I MEAN IT AND THEY GO THROUGH THEM SO FAST .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW SO I JUST I REALLY HAVE BEEN GOING TO THE LIBRARY AND GETTING MY TEN BOOKS OUT AND THEY JUST LOVE TO SIT AND READ AND NOW FINALLY THE LITTLEST ONE IS OLDEST TO TO SIT YOU KNOW AND WATCH THE PICTURES INSTEAD OF GRABBING IT AND TRYING .
MUMBLEX E RIGHT .
TO RIP THE PAGES OUT .
UH WELL .
SO THAT THAT HAS BEEN FUN TO DO DO THAT YOU .
YEAH .
KNOW GO THROUGH THE CHILDREN S LITERATURE .
I READ .
AND UH .
THE PUBLISHER S WEEKLY .
UH .
UH WHICH LISTS ALL THE UPCOMING BOOKS FORTHCOMING BOOKS AND .
UHHUH .
UH THERE ARE SO MANY THAT LOOK LIKE THEY WOULD JUST BE ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL BUT I WAS TICKLED TO SEE THAT SOME PUBLISHER IS UH REPRINTING THE THE JAMES THURBER BOOKS FOR CHILDREN THE .
OH WONDERFUL .
WONDERFUL O AND THE THIRTEEN CLOCKS THAT HAVE BEEN OUT OF PRINT FOR ABOUT OH I THINK ABOUT TWENTY YEARS .
GOSH REALLY WELL I M GOING TO HAVE TO .
WELL .
LOOK FOR THOSE YEAH .
I HAD THOSE FOR MY KIDS AND THEY REALLY DID .
OH .
ENJOY THEM OH .
YEAH .
BUT THEY WERE .
YEAH .
OLD COPIES THEN I DID NT BUY THEM WHEN MY KIDS WERE LITTLE AND SO THEY PROBABLY WERE OUT OF PRINT ALL OF ALREADY WHEN MY KIDS WERE SMALL BUT UM .
YEAH .
I .
YEAH .
WAS REALLY HAPPY TO SEE THAT YEAH I GUESS IT S IN HONOR OF HIS HUNDREDTH .
I LL LET YOU GO FIRST .
WELL I THINK I DO NT KNOW HOW YOUR SCHOOLS WORK BACK THERE BUT WE SUPPORT OUR SCHOOLS HERE WITH PROPERTY TAXES .
UHHUH .
AND THE LAND OWNERS OR HOME OWNERS ARE THE ONES THAT PAY THE SCHOOL TAX SO IF YOU RE RENTING A HOUSE OR DOING ANYTHING ELSE YOU RE NOT ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTING TO THE EDUCATION OF YOUR CHILDREN AND I THINK THAT S WRONG I THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE EDUCATION OF THEIR CHILDREN EVEN IF THEY HAD TO RAISE THE SALES TAX BY ONE PERCENT THEN EVERYBODY GOING THROUGH THE STATE WOULD BE SUPPORTING OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM SO AS IT TURNS OUT WE DO NT REALLY HAVE A TREMENDOUS EDUCATION SYSTEM BECAUSE THEY DO NT HAVE THE MONEY THEY NEED TO RUN IT .
YEAH I UH I SPENT A COUPLE UH YEARS DOWN IN UH PLANO TEXAS .
UHHUH .
AND UH I WAS ONE OF THE HOME OWNERS DOWN THERE THAT GOT TAXED TO DEATH .
YEAH .
FOR THE UH PLANO UH SCHOOL SYSTEM .
YEAH .
AND UH I F YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT TEXAS DOES NT HAVE A STATE TAX .
NO HUHUH .
AND SO ALL THE THINGS COME OUT OF THE THE PROPERTY TAXES .
YEAH .
AND I WAS UH REALLY SHOCKED AT THE AMOUNT OF TAXES I ENDED UP PAYING I WAS I WAS BETTER OFF PAYING A STATE TAX MO BACK IN MARYLAND WHERE .
YEAH YEAH YOU WOULD BE .
THAN I WAS UH PAYING THE UH PROPERTY TAX DOWN THERE UH WHAT THEY DID IN MARYLAND TO GET AROUND THAT IS THEY UH THEY DEVELOPED A RENTERS TAX SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF PAYING FOR THE SERVICES .
OH .
THAT THE RENTERS WERE GETTING INCLUDING THE UH EDUCATIONAL SERVICES .
YEAH .
AND UH THE TAX WAS ADMINISTERED BY UH THE UH RENTAL COMPANY THAT ACTUALLY WAS MANAGING THE APARTMENTS SO WHEN .
OH .
UH LONG LONG TIME AGO WHEN I USED TO LIVE IN APARTMENTS I WOULD PAY A RENT PAYMENT EVERY MONTH AND A TAX PAYMENT EVERY MONTH .
GEE .
AND THE TAX PAYMENT WENT TO PAY FOR THE SERVICES THAT I WAS GETTING AS A A RESIDENT OF THAT PARTICULAR COUNTY .
YEAH .
AND UH THAT S THE WAY IT WORKED HERE IN MARYLAND WE HAVE UH A CERTAIN PORTION OF YOUR YOUR PROPERTY TAXES UH GOES TO EDUCATION .
YEAH .
BUT ALSO A PORTION OF THE STATE TAX THAT YOU PAY GOES BACK INTO THE COUNTY THAT YOU LIVE IN TO PAY FOR THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM .
OH WELL THAT S PRETTY GOOD .
AND SO IT IT WORKS OUT NICE IT IT IT MAKES IT SO THAT THE UH WHOLE COUNTY NOW I I KNOW THE CONCEPT OF COUNTIES IN TEXAS IS QUITE A BIT DIFFERENT THAN IT IS HERE IN MARYLAND UH LIKE COLLIN COUNTY UH WOULD ONLY EQUAL ABOUT MAYBE AN EIGHTH THE SIZE OF BALTIMORE COUNTY HERE IN MARYLAND .
OH YEAH .
I MEAN THE THE COUNTIES ARE MUCH LARGER .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW IN THE THE WHOLE STATE OF MARYLAND I BELIEVE THERE S ONLY LIKE UH FIFTEEN COUNTIES .
GEE WHIZ .
AND SO UH YOU KNOW EACH COUNTY HAS THEIR OWN SCHOOL SYSTEM AN AND IT WORKS OUT REAL NICE UM THE THE FLIP SIDE TO THIS IS ARE WE GETTING WHAT WE RE PAYING FOR .
YEAH .
AND I DO NT BELIEVE SO UM A LOT OF THINGS HAVE COME TO HEAD RECENTLY AND I HEARD A REPORT BECAUSE OF UH UH THE EMPHASIS THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS PUTTING ON EDUCATION YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
UH HIM RUNNING AS OUR EDUCATION PRESIDENT AND THEN FINALLY A COUPLE OF YEARS LATER GETTING AROUND TO DOING SOMETHING .
YEAH .
UM THEY SAID SINCE THEY IMPOSED THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS ON EDUCATION IN OTHER WORDS THEY CAME UP WITH THIS FEDERALIZED SYSTEM WHERE EVERYONE IN THE THIRD GRADE WOULD BE TAUGHT BASICALLY THE SAME THING .
YEAH .
AND THEN AT THE END OF UH SCHOOL YEAR THEY WOULD BE TESTED AND THEN THEY GO INTO THE FOURTH GRADE AND EVERYBODY IN THE FOURTH GRADE S BASICALLY TAUGHT THE SAME THING .
YEAH .
SO WHEN THEY CAME UP WITH THESE THIS NATIONWIDE SYSTEM OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS UH THEY GAVE SOME FIGURES OUT AND SINCE IT S INCEPTION UH THEY VE THE PRICE HAS GONE UP PER STU THE PRICES PAID BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PER STUDENT HAS BEEN THIRTYTHREE PERCENT .
YOW .
AND SO THEY RE ACTUALLY SPENDING THIRTYTHREE PERCENT AND THAT S REAL DOLLARS YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
ADJUSTING IT BACK TO TO THE DAYS YOU KNOW WHEN IT STARTED UH PROBABLY YOU KNOW SEVENTY YEARS AGO AND WHAT THEY VE SAID IS THAT WE HAVE NT HAD A THIRTYTHREE PERCENT IMPROVEMENT IN EDUCATION .
NO HUHUH .
WE VE ACTUALLY GONE BACKWARDS .
WELL THEY SAY THAT TEXAS SCHOOLS ARE SOME OF THE LOWEST IN THE NATION THAT OUR HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES CA NT EVEN MATCH THE NATIONAL AVERAGE .
YEAH .
SO YOU KNOW OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM DOWN HERE IS NO WHERE NEAR PERFECT BUT THEY KEEP COMPLAINING THEY DO NT HAVE THE MONEY TO DO IT .
YEAH WELL THEY THEY VE BEEN HAVING SOME PROBLEMS UH EVEN HERE IN UH LIKE BALTIMORE CITY WHICH IS A A PRETTY GOOD CI GOO GOOD SIZED CITY .
YEAH .
UH THEY VE BEEN PUTTING A LOT OF UH STRESS ON IT AND OF COURSE SPEAKING OF STRESS THE TEACHERS ARE ALL GETTING STRESSED OUT FROM TRYING TO YOU KNOW DO EVERYTHING THEY RE SUPPOSED TO DO AND OF COURSE THEY VE UH BEEN CUTTING THE TEACHERS SALARIES .
OH YEAH .
BECAUSE THEY SAY WE DO NT HAVE THE MONEY TO DO IT AND .
YEAH .
ALL THE SERVICES ARE COSTING MORE MONEY AND AND EVERYTHING UH BUT THE UH A LOT OF EMPHAS NOW IS BEING PUT ON YOU KNOW WHEN CHILDREN USED TO BE TAUGHT YOU KNOW LIKE UH UH EACH CHILD IS INDIVIDUAL .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW THEY RE NOT ALL THE SAME AND .
YEAH THEY NEED TO TAKE THINGS AT THEIR OWN SPEED .
SOME STUDENTS DO HORRIBLE UNTIL LIKE EIGHTH GRADE SOME DO HORRIBLE YOU KNOW UNTIL THEY GET TO LIKE TENTH GRADE .
YEAH .
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN EVERYTHING CLICKS IN YOU KNOW AND THEN THERE ARE SOME STUDENTS THAT YOU KNOW READ WELL AT FIVE YEARS OLD .
UHHUH .
AND YOU KNOW SEEM TO EXCEL AND SO THAT THE YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS I HEARD PROPOSED ON UH ONE OF THE PUBLIC RADIO STATIONS UP HERE WAS THAT WE SHOULD GO BACK TO TEACHING CHILDREN AT THEIR OWN SPEED SOME KI .
YEAH I THINK IT D BE A LOT BETTER .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW EACH CHILD HAS TO LEARN AT HIS OWN RATE THEY CA NT KEEP FORCE FEEDING THINGS TO EACH OTHER AND .
AND AND UH .
OR YOU KNOW AT THE KIDS .
AND ON TOP OF THAT THEY THEY MAKE THE CHILD FEEL INFERIOR .
UHHUH BECAUSE HE CA NT DO IT .
BECAUSE HE S NOT AS GOOD AS ANOTHER KID HIS SAME AGE I MEAN IT S LIKE YOU KNOW THAT S RIDICULOUS .
AND IT S NOT THAT HE CA NT DO IT HE JUST CA NT DO IT QUITE AS FAST OR .
YEAH AND UH YOU KNOW I HAVE UH I I HAVE FIVE CHILDREN TOTAL .
YEAH .
AND I VE GOT TWO OUT OF THE HOUSE ALREADY AND I HA I HAVE TWO THAT ARE IN UH EIGHTH GRADE THIS YEAR .
ALL RIGHT .
AND PRIOR TO THEIR UM WHEN I WHEN THEY WERE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL THEY WERE IDENTI IDENTIFIED AS BEING SLOW .
YEAH .
AND SO THEY PUT THEM INTO SPECIAL PROGRAMS AND THEN WE ACTUALLY HELD THEM BACK IN FOURTH GRADE .
UM .
AND IT WAS NT UNTIL THE LAST TWO YEARS UM LAST YEAR MY UH THEY RE THEY RE A SET OF TWINS .
UHHUH .
UM A BOY AND A GIRL LAST YEAR THE THE UH BOY TWIN STARTED DOING REAL WELL .
ALL RIGHT .
AND IT IT EVERYTHING STARTED TO CLICK IN FOR HIM AND HE KNEW WHAT HE NEEDED TO DO UM AND THIS YEAR IT IT HAPPENED FOR UH FOR THE DAUGHTER .
UM ALL RIGHT .
SHE JUST HAS BEEN .
JUMPED ON OUT THERE .
REALLY DOING GREAT THIS YEAR AND SHE HAS THE RIGHT ATTITUDE TOWARDS SCHOOL AND EVERYTHING .
THAT S GOOD .
AND I THINK IT S JUST A MATTER OF EVERYBODY HAS TO FIND THEIR OWN PATH I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL I DID HORRIBLE UP UNTIL ABOUT .
YEAH I DID TOO UP UNTIL NINTH OR TENTH GRADE .
YEAH ABOUT THE SEVENTH EIGHTH GRADE I I I STARTED TO TO COME AROUND AND REALIZE AN AND BASICALLY I GOT INTERESTED IN MATH .
YEAH .
AND UH NEVER REALLY DID WELL IN ENGLISH BUT YOU KNOW ONCE YOU GOT INTERESTED IN SOMETHING AND THINGS STARTED TO CLICK IN PLACE THEN AFTER THAT YOU TAKE OFF .
YEAH AND SEE WHEN I WAS A KID GROWING UP AND GOING TO HIGH SCHOOL IF I WANTED TO TAKE A LITTLE ELECTRONICS COURSE I HAD A ELECTRONICS COURSE I COULD TAKE BUT WE LIVED OUT IN THE COUNTRY .
UHHUH .
AND WE DID NT HAVE ALL THAT FANCY STUFF TO WORRY ABOUT YOU KNOW WE HAD OUR AUTO SHOP OUT THERE AND OUR AG SHOP AND .
YEAH .
AND YOU KNOW WE HAD JUST ABOUT EVERY THING THAT WE NEEDED BUT THEY DO NT HAVE IT ANYMORE THERE S A LOT OF THINGS THAT THEY DO NT DO IN SCHOOL ANYMORE M OUR OLDEST BOY GOES TO LUBBOCK HIGH DOWN HERE AND THEY GO TO SCHOOL FOUR AND HALF DAYS A WEEK SO .
GEE .
THAT S PRETTY WEIRD .
YEAH IT IS UM MY CHILDREN HAD A UH REAL CULTURE SHOCK UH WHEN WE LIVED IN PLANO I GUESS I DO NT KNOW IF YOU VE HEARD ABOUT THE PLANO SCHOOL DISTRICT BUT .
NO .
THEY RE RE UH THEY REALLY STRESS ACADEMICS THERE .
UHHUH .
AND UH GOD IF YOUR CHILD IS NOT AN HONOR STUDENT WELL THEN YOU RE SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU AS A PARENT .
GEE .
AND THA THAT S KIND OF THE WAY THEY ARE THERE .
YEAH .
AND UH WHEN WE MOVED BACK TO MARYLAND UM I MOVED TO A UH A BALTIMORE COUNTY WHICH IS A NORTHERN COUNTY IN MARYLAND .
UHHUH .
AND IT S BASICALLY A RURAL COUNTY ONCE YOU GET ABOVE ABOUT THE HALF WAY POINT .
YEAH .
AND WE LIVED YOU KNOW IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTY UH WE WENT FROM A UH MIDDLE SCHOOL IN TEXAS THAT SERVED FIFTYFIVE SQUARE BLOCKS TO A UH MIDDLE SCHOOL IN MARYLAND THAT SERVED FIFTYFIVE SQUARE MILES .
YEAH .
AND IT WAS JUST A COMPLETE CULTURE SHOCK .
I CAN IMAGINE .
BECAUSE I MEAN THEY THEY RE RIDING ON THE BUS IN THE MORNING WITH UH OTHER KIDS THAT YOU KNOW ARE A SLEEP BECAUSE THEY GOT UP AT THREE OCLOCK AND WERE DOING CHORES AND .
YEAH THAT WOULD BE QUITE A SHOCK .
THEY YOU KNOW IT S AND THEY HAD UH AG THEY HAD AN AG COURSE UH I FORGET WHAT IT WAS CALLED UH BUT IT GOES ALONG THE THE LINES OF INDUSTRIAL ARTS BUT IT S AGRICULTURAL .
UHHUH .
AND WHERE THEY HAD TO RAISE A SMALL ANIMAL .
OH LIKE FOUR H THEN .
HAD TO LEARN HOW TO DRIVE A TRACTOR .
ALL RIGHT .
THEY ACTUALLY HAD TO G TAKE A DRIVING TEST ON THE TRACTOR I MEAN THEY JUST COULD NT BELIEVE THIS AND IT WAS GREAT THEY LOVED IT .
ALL RIGHT .
I MEAN THEY REALLY ENJOYED THE COURSES UM AND IT YOU KNOW IT MADE SCHOOL FUN FOR THEM AGAIN BECAUSE PRIOR TO THAT SCHOOL WAS JUST A BIG PAIN A DRAIN .
YEAH JUST SOMETHING YOU DO EVERYDAY .
YEAH AND IT WAS YOU KNOW IT WAS LIKE KI KIND OF LIKE THE WAY WE FEEL ABOUT GOING TO WORK .
YEAH YEAH JUST SOMETHING I HAVE TO DO EVERYDAY .
BUT UH UP HERE THEY SEEM TO HAVE MADE IT UH A LOT OF FUN FOR THEM AND THEY THEY SEEM TO REALLY ENJOY IT .

WELL YOU KNOW UH NOW HE HERE S SOMETHING THAT UH FIRST OCCURRED TO ME WHEN THEY STARTED HAVING ALL THESE PROBLEMS WITH THESE AUTOMATIC UH WEAPONS .
YES .

WE VE HAD IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS THAT WE HAVE A REALLY GOOD ROOF .
UHHUH HOW LONG HAVE YOU LIVED THERE .
UH SEE IT S THREE IT S JUST BEEN A AT THREE YEARS .
WE VE BEEN IN THE HOUSE JUST THE THREE YEARS .
WE VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF REMODELING .
I MEAN IT S IT HAD DETACHED IT HAD A DIR DETACHED GARAGE AND MY HUSBAND S BUILT A WALKWAY ACROSS AND WE RE GOING TO BRICK UP THE GARAGE TO MATCH THE HOUSE AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO WE .
YOU .
ALL DID IT .
YOURSELVES .

OH YEAH YEAH HE SEE HE DOES THIS FOR A LIVING .
UHHUH .
I MEAN THIS IS WHAT .
HI MAUREEN HOW ARE YOU .
ALL RIGHT .
WELL DO YOU HAVE A FAMILY BUDGET .
NO WE PROBABLY SHOULD BUT WE HAVE NT SO WHY DO NT YOU EXPLAIN TO ME SOME GOOD TIPS ABOUT WHAT YOU VE DONE WHICH YOU VE FOUND USEFUL AND WORKABLE .
OKAY WE DO A FEW THINGS AND I HAVE TO SAY WE RE MY HUSBAND AND I ARE BOTH FROM FINANCIAL BACKGROUNDS I I M AN ACCOUNTANT .
UHHUH .
AND UH HE HAS AN M B A SO UH WE WERE SORT OF YOU KNOW KEYED IN ON EXPENSES AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO .
UM OKAY .
UM COMING FROM THAT BACKGROUND WHAT WE PRETTY MUCH DO IS WE IN OUR HOUSEHOLD AS FAR AS LIVING EXPENSES WE LIVE ON A CASH BUDGET EVERY MONTH MY HUSBAND UH GOES TO THE CREDIT UNION AND WITHDRAWS YOU KNOW X AMOUNT OF DOLLARS FOR THE MONTH AND THEN THAT MONEY IS USED DURING THAT MONTH WE HAVE A CERTAIN BUDGET .
UHHUH .
EXCUSE ME FOR INSTANCE I CONTROL ALL THE HOUSEHOLD EXPENSES THE GROCERIES UH THE HAIRCUTS THE GASOLINE FOR MY CAR ANY MISCELLANEOUS EXPENSES BABYSITTING THINGS LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
AND UH EXCUSE ME IF UH IT COMES THE END OF THE MONTH AND I DO NT HAVE ANY MONEY UH WE DO NT BUY ANY MORE MILK .
UHHUH .
BUT UH WE VE GOTTEN PRETTY GOOD AT IT WE VE BEEN DOING IT A COUPLE OF YEARS NOW .
UHHUH .
SO WE OUR BUDGETS ARE REALISTIC AND THEY ARE NOT SO STRINGENT AND YOU KNOW TO MAKE US FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE .
HM .
AND I I REALLY TRY TO STRETCH MY MY DOLLARS HERE AND THERE SHOPPING UH AT WAREHOUSES SOMETIMES LIKE AT SAM S AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
BUT UH WE LIVE WE LIVE ON ON A CASH BUDGET AND IT SOMETIMES IT S TIGHT COME THE END OF THE MONTH BUT GENERALLY WE ALWAYS MAKE IT .
WHAT DO YOU DO FOR THE SURPRISE THINGS THAT YOU DO NT NECESSARILY PLAN FOR THE YOU KNOW ARE SOMETIMES SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS LIKE UH TIRES FOR THE CAR OR CAR REPAIR OF SOME SORT .
RIGHT .
OR LIKE A A DENTAL BILL OR SOMETHING THAT YOU RE NOT PREPARED FOR .
WELL UH MOST OF OUR MEDICAL THINGS WE DO NT UH HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BECAUSE OF INSURANCE AND THEY RE THEY RE RELATIVELY SMALL UH WE VE BEEN LUCKY IN THE PAST WE DID NT HAVE THAT PROBLEM BUT RIGHT NOW WE DO NT FOR THE OTHER THINGS THE THINGS THAT CROP UP THAT WE ARE NT REALLY EXPECTING WE HAVE DIFFERENT FUNDS SET ASIDE FOR DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE WE HAVE A CAR FUND AND WE PUT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY INTO THAT EVERY SINGLE MONTH WHETHER WE NEED TO OR NOT .
OH .
SO I MEAN AND I I CA NT REALLY REMEMBER WHAT IT IS .
DO YOU KIND OF CONTINUE CALL THIS LIKE A PART OF SAVINGS ACCOUNT OR A DIFFERENT SAVINGS ACCOUNT OR .
IT S ALL PART OF THE SAVINGS ACCOUNT WE JUST KEEP TRACK OF IT ON PAPER UH YOU KNOW A CERTAIN AMOUNT GOES STRAIGHT TO THE SAVINGS ACCOUNT WE DECIDE OKAY YOU KNOW LET S SAY IT S A HUNDRED DOLLARS YOU KNOW EVERY MONTH FIFTEEN DOLLARS IS FOR CAR FUND YOU KNOW .
OH .
TEN DOLLARS IS FOR VACATION FUND WHATEVER UH AND WE JUST WE CONSTANTLY DO THAT SO THAT THERE S A BUILDUP OF MONEY FOR THOSE THINGS IF SOMETHING DOES COME UP LIKE I KNOW THAT MY WASHING MACHINE IS GOING TO GO ANY DAY .
OH OKAY .
SO BUT WE HAVE THE MONEY SET ASIDE SO IF IT DOES IT S NOT GOING TO KILL US .
HM .
UH SO WE RE WE RE ACTUALLY WE RE PRETTY DISCIPLINED SO IT MAKES THOSE SURPRISES NOT SO DIFFICULT TO GET THROUGH .
OKAY THEN SO LIKE YOUR PAY WHAT KIND OF A PERCENTAGE DO YOU BASICALLY KEEP OUT THAT YOU THINK THAT YOU KNOW WILL COVER ALL OF THE EXPENSES KIND OF THING .
WELL IN .
OR LIKE WHAT WHAT PERCENT DO YOU THEN SAVE OR SOMETHING .
UH WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS RIGHT NOW WE SAVE ABOUT TWENTYFIVE PERCENT OF OUR OF OUR PAY .
HM OKAY .
IT AND IT GOES TOWARD DIFFERENT THINGS IT S FOR YOU KNOW FOR VACATIONS LIKE I SAID FOR YOU KNOW EMERGENCIES LIKE FOR CAR UH BREAKS DOWN SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
UH AND WE ALSO PUT MONEY ASIDE FOR OUR KIDS COLLEGE .
UHHUH .
NEITHER OF US HAD ANY HELP WITH OUR COLLEGE DEGREES AND JUST THIS LAST MONTH WE PAID OFF MY FINAL SCHOOL LOAN SO .
OH .
WE RE STARTING OUR KIDS A LITTLE BIT EARLY .
OKAY .
DO YOU UH USE A LOT OF CREDIT CARDS OR YOUR CHECKING ACCOUNT WHEN YOU GO OUT AND BUY THINGS .
CHECKING ACCOUNT A LOT UH NOT SO MUCH CREDIT CARDS NOW SEVERAL YEARS BACK I USED TO USE CH UH CHARGE CARDS AND YOU KNOW ALL THE TIME KIND OF THINKING OH WELL IT S ON SALE YOU KNOW IT MUST BE A GOOD DEAL .
SURE .
THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES THAT I HAVE BEEN BAD ABOUT THE CREDIT CARDS AND SO PRETTY MUCH NOW UH WE DO NT USE THEM TOO MUCH IF WE TRAVEL OR SOMETHING YEAH BUT YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
STANDARD WE USUALLY DO NT OR IF IT IT IS A PURCHASE UH THEN IT S PAID OFF WHEN THE BILL COMES YOU KNOW SO IT IS NT ANY EXTENDED UH IT MAY BE THAT I PICKED UP SOMETHING AT THE STORE BUT THEN WHEN THE BILL COMES WE ALWAYS PAY IT OFF THEN SO IT S NOT ANY YOU KNOW UH BUILD UP ON THE CHARGE CARDS AT ALL .
THAT S GOOD .
AND BUT THAT HAS NT ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE SO I M KIND OF I FEEL AT LEAST BETTER NOW THAT I HAVE FINALLY GOTTEN SOME OF THOSE THINGS UH YOU KNOW IN THE PAST AND I DO NT HAVE YOU KNOW BIG CUMULATIVE AMOUNTS DUE TO THOSE CHARGE CARDS BECAUSE THAT INTEREST RATE JUST IS A KILLER .
OH AND IT S NOT DEDUCTIBLE ANYMORE .
YEAH WELL I VE NEVER BEEN IN THE SITUATION OF ITEMIZING ANYHOW BUT UH PRETTY MUCH WHEN I ALWAYS I GO TO THE GROCERY STORE OR SOMETHING I JUST ALWAYS WRITE CHECKS .
YEAH WE DID WE DID THAT FOR A LONG TIME AND IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE WE HAD NO IDEA HOW MUCH WE WERE SPENDING ON THINGS .
HM .
AND IT SEEMED LIKE WE DID NT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY WHEN THINGS CROPPED UP YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
SO WE DECIDED TO PUT OURSELVES ON A CASH BUDGET WELL THE FIRST TIME WE DID IT WE JUST TOOK SOME ARBITRARY AMOUNT THAT WE ESTIMATED IT WOULD BE .
UHHUH .
AND THEN WE KEPT TRACK OF EVERYTHING FOR A MONTH .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH WE SPENT ON FOOD HOW MUCH WE SPENT ON GASOLINE HOW MUCH WE SPENT ON EVERYTHING .
UHHUH .
AND FROM THAT BUILT YOU KNOW A CASH BUDGET SO NOW I MEAN I HAVE I DO NT REMEMBER WHAT IT IS NOW FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THE MONTH LET S SAY .
UHHUH .
AND UH I MEAN SOME MONTHS I MAY SPEND THREE HUNDRED ON GROCERIES AND A HUNDRED ON EVERYTHING ELSE AND SOME MONTHS IT MAY BE DIFFERENT .
UHHUH .
IT S NOT AS THOUGH WE FEEL LIKE WE HAVE TO KEEP OURSELVES YOU KNOW DOWN TO THE DOLLAR OR THE PENNY IN CERTAIN CATEGORIES KIND OF THING BUT THE WAY WE SET UP YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT THAT WE WANT TO SAVE AND THE AMOUNTS THAT WE HAVE TO SPEND FOR YOU KNOW UH UTILITIES AND UH THE HOUSE PAYMENT AND ALL THAT .
YEAH .
THOSE ARE THINGS YOU DO NT REALLY HAVE MUCH CONTROL OVER .
UHHUH .
UH THE CASH BUDGET JUST FITS RIGHT IN THERE LIKE I SAID IF WE DO NT HAVE WE ALSO SET ASIDE MONEY FOR ENTERTAINMENT I MEAN BUT AGAIN IT S A SET AMOUNT EVERY MONTH .
UHHUH .
AND UH ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS I MEAN BIRTHDAYS AND THINGS LIKE THAT WE WE DO NT WE STILL HAVE FUN ON THINGS .
YEAH UH WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO BUY A HOUSE DO YOU KNOW HOW DID YOUR BUDGET WORK OR DID YOU HAVE A BUDGET TO UH GET YOUR DOWN PAYMENT GOING TO GET A HOUSE .
WELL NO NOT ORIGINALLY BECAUSE WHEN WE WE DID BUY WHEN WE BOUGHT OUR FIRST HOUSE IT WAS AT A TIME WHERE YOU AND THE KIND OF LOAN WE GOT YOU REALLY DID NT HAVE TO PUT DOWN ANYTHING .
HUH .
SO WE GOT INTO IT FAIRLY CHEAPLY AND THEN UH AFTER WE SOLD THE FIRST HOUSE WE WERE LEFT WITH ENOUGH CASH THAT THERE WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE THE DOWN PAYMENT ON THIS HOUSE .
OH OKAY .
SO WE WE GOT OUT OF THAT ONE PRETTY EASILY .
OKAY UH YEAH I JUST KEEP THINKING ALL THE TIME I MEAN IT IT S REALLY ROUGH TO KEEP YOURSELF ON A STRICT BUDGET FOR A LONG LONG TIME WHEN YOUR YOU KNOW YOUR PRIORITY AT LEAST MINE IS TO SAVE FOR THE HOUSE BUT THEN IT S AWFUL HARD TO REALLY SCRIMP FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND KEEP PUTTING ALL THE MONEY INTO THAT DOWN PAYMENT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WANT TO LIVE A LITTLE BIT IN THE MEANTIME .
SURE I KNOW .
THAT S HOW I FEEL SOMETIMES ABOUT MY KIDS EDUCATION I MEAN JEEZ THEY ARE ONE AND FOUR .
WE HAVE GOT A LONG TIME TO SAVE MY HUSBAND HE S THE REAL HE S THE REAL DISCIPLINARIAN WHEN IT COMES TO THAT MONEY USUALLY .
UHHUH .
OH NO NO .
WELL I KNOW BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I SIT THERE AND I THINK WOW YOU KNOW WE MAKE X AMOUNT OF MONEY AND WHERE IS IT I MEAN YOU LOOK AROUND AND YOU GO .
WHAT DO YOU DO WITH IT I KNOW .
WHERE IS IT YOU YOU HAVE NT MADE UH BIG PURCHASES AND THAT S THE EASIER THING TO SEE IF YOU CAN SEE A BIG PURCHASE AND YOU GO OKAY WELL THIS IS THE YEAR THAT WE BOUGHT THE COUCH OR THE T V .
UHHUH RIGHT .
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT ALL THOSE JUST MONTHLY PAYMENTS AND STUFF THAT JUST GO OUT THE DOOR AND THERE S BIG CHUNKS OF YOUR MONEY TO PAY LIKE THE UTILITIES AND THE GAS AND THE GROCERIES .
OH YEAH .
AND STUFF THAT YOU DO NT HAVE TANGIBLE I MEAN THE PERISHABLE KIND OF THINGS THAT S GONE USED AND GONE .
YEAH IT S IT S AMAZING HOW MUCH WE SPEND ON SOME THINGS MY HUSBAND CUT HIMSELF DOWN TO TEN DOLLARS A WEEK FOR HIS LUNCH AT WORK .
OH .
AND THAT S ALL HE HAS HE HAS A TEN DOLLAR BILL .
HUH .
AND I MEAN SO I D SAY AT LEAST TWO USUALLY THREE TIMES A WEEK HE TAKES HIS LUNCH .
UHHUH .
THE OTHER TIMES HE LL UH I DO NT KNOW GO OUT SOMEWHERE .
UHHUH .
EAT IN A CAFETERIA OR WHATEVER BUT BUT HE KEEPS HIMSELF ON THAT I MEAN HE FOUND IT S IT S SO EASY TO SPEND FIVE DOLLARS A DAY ON LUNCH .
UHHUH .
THAT S A HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH ON LUNCH .
UHHUH .
THAT S THAT S TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR JUST ON LUNCH .
YEAH .
WHEN HE CAN TAKE A SANDWICH YOU KNOW .

THE THE LAST THING .
I VE DONE AS FAR AS CAR REPAIRS GO IS IS CHANGE OIL AND FILTER AN AND THAT KIND OF STUFF .
I HAVE NT GOTTEN REALLY INVOLVED IN ANYTHING UH EXTENSIVE IN CAR REPAIRS IN OH OH PROBABLY A YEAR OR SO .
I THINK THE LAST THING .
I DID OF ANY SIGNIFICANCE WAS CHANGE .
THE WATER PUMP ON AN OLDSMOBILE .
YEAH I HAD A SIMILAR THING THAT I VE WORKED ON CARS EVER SINCE I WAS UH A KID .
AND THAT WAS SOME TIME AGO BUT I VE GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE UH THE NEWER CARS ARE GETTING SO COMPLICATED TO WORK ON THAT UH OH MOST OF THE CARS I BUY I TRY TO BUY AS SIMPLE .
A CAR AS POSSIBLE .
YEAH I KNOW WHAT .
YOU MEAN .
SO YOU KNOW CHANGING THE OIL CHANGING THE SPARK PLUGS AND MOST OF THEM NOW YOU KNOW YOU DO NT GO THROUGH THE IGNITION STUFF ANYMORE BECAUSE THAT S ALL SOLID STATE OR .
YEAH OR FUEL INJECTED AND SO THERE S .
OR FUEL INJECTED SO THERE GOES THE CARBURETOR AND IF THE FUEL INJECTION SYSTEM BREAKS DOWN .

SOMEBODY ONCE SAID UH I HAD A CAR .
THAT SAID FUEL INJECTION ON THE SIDE OF IT AND A WOMAN ASKED ME .

YEAH I HAD TO CHANGE THE WATER PUMP IN THAT HERE ABOUT A YEAR AGO .
AND IT WAS REALLY FAIRLY EASY .
TAKE THE GRILL OUT AND THE RADIATOR OUT AND YOU CAN JUST STAND THERE AND WORK ON IT .
YEAH THE HARDEST PART ABOUT UH WATER PUMP CHANGES IS GETTING ALL THE JUNK OFF BEFORE YOU CAN GET TOO IT .
WELL THAT S TRUE .
YOU RE RIGHT YOU KNOW BY THE TIME .
YOU VE FINALLY GOT DOWN TO IT I WAS HOPING I COULD REMEMBER WHERE ALL THOSE OTHER THINGS WENT .
WELL THAT S KIND OF THE WAY .
I WAS I TRIED TO REMEMBER AS I TOOK STUFF OFF WHERE IT WENT AND I DO NT THINK I HAD TOO MANY NUTS AND BOLTS LEFT OVER WHEN I GOT IT .
ALL PUT BACK TOGETHER .
A FEW YEARS AGO I HAD AN OLDSMOBILE DIESEL AND UH THE UH IT AFTER ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND MILES .
THE INJECTOR PUMP WENT OUT ON IT .
AND UH I BOUGHT IT WHEN WE WERE LIVING IN LUBBOCK WHEN I CAME BACK HERE I BROUGHT THE CAR BACK HERE AND UH I DO NT KNOW DIESELS GOT PRETTY UNPOPULAR AND YOU COULD NT SELL THE THI I MEAN THOUGH FOR WHAT .
YOU COULD GET FOR ONE .
OH YEAH .
YOU MIGHT AS WELL DRIVE IT OVER A CLIFF .
AND UH THE INJECTOR PUMP WENT BAD SO I FOUND A OUTFIT DOWN HERE TO REBUILD IT .
YEAH .
AND UH I REINSTALLED THAT AND THAT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST MISERABLE THINGS I HAD GOTTEN INTO IN A LONG TIME .
I DO NT THINK I D KNOW WHERE TO START WITH A DIESEL .
OH WELL IT YOU KNOW I DIESELS DO NT REQUIRE MECHANICS THEY REQUIRE PLUMBERS .
WELL THAT S TRUE .
AND UH .
I THINK THE ONL CLOSEST THING .
I VE COME TO TO A DIESEL IS I VE WORKED FOR A TRACTOR REPAIR SHOP UH WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND UH WE USED TO OVERHAUL FARM TRACTORS BASICALLY .
YEAH .
AND THEY WERE NEARLY ALL ALL DIESEL BUT AS FAR AS CARS I VE NEVER NEVER BEEN INVOLVED WITH THEM .
WELL THE INJECTOR NOZZLE AND STUFF IN YOU KNOW THE BIG DIESEL FARM TRACTORS YOU KNOW WHAT ARE ABOUT THE SIZE OF YOUR THUMB AND THE .
WELL YE YEAH AND YOU .
CA YOU CAN GET TO THEM .
YEAH YOU CAN GET TO THEM AND THE ONES IN IN THE DIESEL CARS WERE LITTLE TINY THINGS AND JUST ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DO ANYTHING WITH .
WELL I .
I VE HAD A LOT OF GOOD SERVICE OUT OF THAT CAR BUT UH UH I FINALLY GAVE IT TO MY SON AND HE DROVE IT LITERALLY INTO THE GROUND YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
HE WAS OUT AT TECH AND HE HE FINISHED IT OFF .
I M I GUESS YOU RE RIGHT THE THE DIESEL HAS ALMOST FALLEN INTO UNPOPULAR STATUS .
I DO NT KNOW EXACTLY WHY .
ONE OF THE REASONS IS I I M BEGINNING TO WONDER IS WHERE DO YOU GET GAS AT .
I SU I DO NT KNOW IF IT S STILL UH LIMITED LIKE IT WAS I DO NT NOTICE IT PROBABLY BECAUSE I DON .
WHAT THE AVAILABILITY .
HUH .
YOU MEAN THE DIESEL AVAILABILITY .
YEAH I DO NT I DO NT NOTICE BUT MAYBE BECAUSE I M NOT LOOKING FOR IT .
YEAH WELL I D BOUGHT UH A G M C DIESEL PICKUP AND UH LOVED THAT THING YOU KNOW I REALLY LIKED IT .
BUT IT TURNS OUT A PICKUP WAS NT .
WHAT .
I REALLY NEEDED .
YEAH .
AND IT WAS THE VAN THAT I NEEDED THEN TO BUY THE YOU KNOW TRADED IT IN ON THE CHEVY VAN .
BUT UH SURE ENJOYED IT .
BUT YO YOU GOT THE THE THREE FIFTY IN THE VAN .
YEAH YEAH THE THREE FIFTY REGULAR GAS ENGINE .
YEAH THAT S WHAT .
I LIKE BECAUSE THEY VE GOT PLENTY OF POWER AND UH .
UHHUH .
IF YOU TREAT THEM RIGHT THEY RE NOT THE GAS GUZZLERS I THINK THAT THEY VE GOT THE REPUTATION TO BE .
I M CONVINCED THAT UH DETROIT OR WHOEVER .
IT IS MADE A MAJOR MISTAKE .
YEAH CO .
YEARS AGO WHEN THEY STOPPED PUTTING THE SMALL V EIGHTS IN AND WENT TO THE FOURS AND SOME OF THE SIXES .
UHHUH .
I M CONVINCED THAT THE SMALL V EIGHT LIKE THE THE MUSTANG S ORIGINAL TWO EIGHTYNINE OR SOME OF THE CHEVY TWO EIGHTYTHREES .
UHHUH .
WERE GOOD LITTLE V EIGHT ENGINES .
THAT WERE NOT GAS GUZZLERS BUT THEY HAD ENOUGH POWER T PULL ALL THIS WEIGHT .
YEAH .
AND THE FOUR CYLINDERS JUST DO NT HAVE IT .
I THINK THAT LITTLE THE LITTLE CHEVY V EIGHT WHEN IT STARTED OUT IN SIXTY IN FIFTYFIVE I THINK WAS TWO SIXTYFIVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
YEAH .
LITTLE YOU KNOW NOT WHOLE LOT MORE THAN THE THAN THE THAN THE SIX CYLINDER THAT I THINK WAS LIKE ABOUT TWO THIRTYFIVE OR SO .
BUT UH THEY KEPT BORING THAT BLOCK OUT TO WHERE YOU COULD A GET A FOUR HUNDRED SMALL BLOCK FOUR HUNDRED THAT WAS UH THE SAME BLOCK YOU KNOW JUST JUST KEPT BORING IT OUT AND BORING IT OUT AND STROKING IT .
A LITTLE BIT MORE AN .
I THINK THOSE GU THOSE LITTLE V EIGHTS COULD HAVE BEEN MADE TO BE PRETTY POWERFUL LITTLE ENGINES IF THEY WOULD HAVE GONE WITH IT BUT .
WELL THAT WAS UH THAT WAS A SHORT STROKE ENGINE .
IT COULD REALLY WIND UP .
OH YEAH .
THE TWO LITTLE CARS I VE GOT NOW BOUGHT A MITSUBISHI MIRAGE HERE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND AND IT WAS NORMALLY CARBURETED AND IT S FAIRLY EASY TO WORK WITH BECAUSE THERE S NOT JUST A WHOLE LOT IN IT TO GO WRONG .
YEAH THAT S KIND OF LIKE .
AND YOU KNOW CHANGING THE PLUGS AND STUFF .
THE THE FIRST WELL MY FIRST CAR WAS A FIFTYSIX MUSTANG AND UH OVER THE YEARS UH ALL .
I HAD A UH DODGE PICKUP SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND UH I CA NT REMEMBER THE SIZE OF THE ENGINE .
IT WAS A THREE OH SEVEN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
YEAH .
BUT UH I REMEMBER WORKING ON THOSE CARS YOU D OPEN THE HOOD AND THERE WAS BASICALLY NOTHING IN THERE BUT AN ENGINE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND A FEW THINGS .
NOW YOU OPEN THE HOOD AND IT S SCARY .
YEAH .
LIKE YOU SAY IT TAKES A PLUMBER TO FIGURE OUT WHERE ALL THIS STUFF GOES .
THE FRIEND OF OURS OVER HERE HE S GOT UH SIXTYFIVE OR SIXTYSIX MUSTANG .
THE SIX CYLINDER .
YEAH .
AND UH I WAS LOOK UNDER THE HOOD OF THAT THE OTHER DAY AND LIKE YOU SAY YOU CAN SEE THE ROAD .
YEAH .
IT S AMAZING .
WELL IF YOU HAD TO YOU COULD CLIMB UP IN THERE AND DO WHAT .
YOU NEEDED TO .
YOU .
COUL YEAH YOU COULD STAND IN THERE IF YOU REALLY WANTED TO I GUESS .
MY DAD S GOT A NEW UM I GUESS IT S AN EIGHTYNINE OR NINETY UH CHRYSLER SOMETHING OR OTHER .
IT .
S .
ONE OF THOSE TRANSVERSE MOUNTED V SIXES FRONT WHEEL DRIVE .
OH YEAH .
AND UH HE WAS SHOWING IT TO ME AND WE RE LOOKING UNDER THE HOOD AND EVERYTHING S NICE AND CLEAN AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN SEE THE THREE SPARK PLUGS THERE IN THE FRONT .
AND I SAID WELL WHERE ARE THE OTHER THREE .
AND HE D NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT .
YEAH .
AND HE SAYS WELL HOPEFULLY I WO NT HAVE TO CHANGE THEM BEFORE I TRADE IT OFF .
YEAH IT S GOING TO BE A PROBLEM GETTING BACK THERE BECAUSE IT WAS SHOVED RIGHT UP AGAINST THE FIRE WALL .
YEAH .
SO THEY JUST ABOUT COMPLICATED THE THINGS SO MUCH THAT SHADE TREE MECHANICS CA NT DO MUCH WITH THEM .
YEAH .
WELL WHEN THEY WENT TO THE STARTED WITH THE NEWER ENGINES YOU KNOW WHEN THEY STARTED PUTTING ALL THAT POLLUTION CONTROL STUFF ON THE OLDER ENGINES IS WHERE THEY STARTED GETTING INTO SO MUCH YOU KNOW TROUBLE .
BECAUSE THE THREE FIFTY WITH ALL THE YOU KNOW LIKE WELL ACTUALLY I GUESS HER WITHIN A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO ANYWAY WAS THE LAST I VE PAID ANY ATTENTION TO IT .
THE THREE .
OH .
FIVE WAS THAT THAT .
UHHUH .
V EIGHT THAT THEY PUT IN THE THE THREE QUARTER AND AND HALF TON VAN .

YEAH .
AND I HAD TO GET ALL THOSE OFF YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS REPLACE THAT UH WATER PUMP .
YEAH .
AND UH I HAD TO STRUGGLE WITH THAT FOR A WHILE TO FIGURE WHICH BELT GOES WHERE .

WE VE BEEN WANTING TO START CAMPING AGAIN THIS YEAR TOO UH MY OLDEST CHILD IS A GIRL WAS BORN THREE YEARS AGO THREE AND A HALF .
UHHUH .
AND THEN I HAVE A LITTLE ONE THAT JUST TURNED TWO AND WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF POTTY TRAINING I DID NT WANT TO GO CAMPING WITH DIAPERS YOU KNOW .
OH GOSH YEAH YEAH .
I AND AND YOU KNOW AT A TIME WHEN THEY RE AFRAID OF THEIR SHADOW ALL THEY NEED IS YOU KNOW SOME SKUNK OR SOMETHING TO RUB UP THE OUTSIDE OF THE TENT THEY D BE AWAKE ALL NIGHT .

OR SOMETHING TO GET THEM USED TO IT AND GET THEM STARTED UH WITH LITTLE BACK PACKS OF THEIR OWN .
RIGHT .
AND YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE THAT .
YOU BET YEAH WE LL THAT YOU KNOW AND THERE S A LOT OF PLACES WITH UH LIKE NATURE TRAILS .
UHHUH .
THINGS LIKE THAT WHERE THEY COULD LEARN A LOT TOO .
WELL THAT S TRUE .
YOU KNOW IT S LIKE OKAY THIS THIS IS THIS IS WHAT UH A PHEASANT LOOKS LIKE YOU KNOW AND OKAY NOW WE LL GO LOOK FOR ONE .
UGH I WOULD NEED THAT BEFORE I COULD TEACH THEM .
WELL YEAH THAT S EVER EVERYBODY MIGHT LEARN SOMETHING THAT WAY BUT UH BUT YEAH THAT S THERE IS THERE S AN AWFUL LOT OF THINGS SET UP YOU KNOW JUST ANY ANYTHING YOU WANT TO DO LIKE LIKE YOU SAY IT CAN BE UH A WATER SKI TRIP OR FISHING TRIP OR JUST A SIGHTSEEING BIRD WATCHING YOU KNOW HUNT HUNT WITH A CAMERA TYPE OF THING OR THERE S A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THINGS LIKE THAT IT S A LOT OF FUN IT REALLY IS HELLO .
OKAY WELL GO AHEAD I LL LET YOU START .
UH I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD HAVE PEOPLE UH BE REQUIRED TO DO PUBLIC SERVICE FOR A YEAR OR TWO .
UHHUH .
AND I WAS THINKING THAT YOU NEEDED TO PUT SOME WAIVERS IN THERE FOR THE HANDICAPPED AND ALSO FOR PEOPLE THAT HAD TO STAY HOME AND MAYBE BE WAGE EARNERS FOR THEIR FAMILY OR THEY HAD SOMEBODY AT HOME THAT WAS ILL THAT THEY HAD TO TEND TO I MEAN YOU CA NT MAKE IT EVERYBODY .
RIGHT YEAH .
BUT THEN YOU NEED TO MAKE IT SURE THAT THE RICH PEOPLE CA NT BUY SOMEBODY OFF AND AND MAYBE SEND THEM IN THEIR PLACES OR GET OUT OF IT SOME OTHER WAY TOO .
UHHUH OR IT COULD BE LIKE THE DRAFT WHERE YOU KNOW BEFORE THEY DRAFT YOU THEY TA UH YOU GET A PHYSICAL ANYWAY SO WHEN THEY SEND YOU A DRAFT NOTICE AND THEN THEY GIVE YOU A PHYSICAL AND IF THERE S NOTHING PHYSICALLY WRONG WITH YOU THEN YOU RE DRAFTED IT DOES NT MATTER HOW RICH YOU ARE .
THAT WOULD BE GOOD .
AND THEN WE COULD MAYBE GIVE PHYSICALS TO THE REST OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS RIGHT .
WHAT DID YOU SAY .
GIVE PHYSICALS TO THE REST OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS AND THEY ALL HAD TO PASS .
OH YEAH .
UH .
UH I THOUGHT IT A GOOD IDEA TOO THOUGH WOULD BE TO EXTEND THIS AND MAKE PEOPLE THAT ARE ACCEPTING PUBLIC WELFARE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ALONG THIS LINE BEFORE THEY GOT ANY MONEY .
UHHUH THAT S TRUE .
AND UH IF THEY DID THIS MAYBE HELP THEM OUT IN THEIR COLLEGE COST AND MAYBE THEY COULD PAY PEOPLE FOR DOING THIS AT LEAST SOMETHING SO THEY CO COULD SUBSIST .
WELL THAT S TRUE AMERICA S PAYING ALL THIS MONEY TO HAVE OTHER PEOPLE GIVE UH AID TO OTHER COUNTRIES SO THEY COULD BE PAYING THEIR OWN PEOPLE AND TRAINING THEIR OWN PEOPLE AT THE SAME TIME .
YEAH .
BECAUSE ACTUALLY WHEN YOU WHEN YOU DO UH SERVICE OVERSEAS YOU END UP LEARNING SOMETHING USUALLY THAT S THAT S REALLY USEFUL PLUMBING OR FARMING OR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO YOU RE REALLY LEARNING A SKILL .
YEAH AND YOU KNOW ALL THESE OLD PEOPLE THEY WOULD GET OUT OF THIS RIGHT ALL THE ONES THAT ARE ALREADY RETIRED SO WHAT WE COULD DO IS TAKE ALL THE RETIRED PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING AROUND IN THEIR BIG MOBILE HOMES AND THEY COULD DO PUBLIC SERVICE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY .
WHAT DID YOU SAY UHHUH .
I M JUST TEASING .
YEAH I I THINK WELL THAT S PROBABLY THE IDEA I DO NT KNOW WHETHER THE IDEA IS TO BE WITHIN THE COUNTRY OR OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY .
WELL I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA IF MAYBE YOU TOOK SOME OF THE KIDS AND HAD THEM GO OVER TO OTHER COUNTRIES AND CHILDREN FROM THEIR COUNTRIES CAME OVER TO OURS TOO A TRADE OFF .
YEAH THAT WOULD BE NEAT YEAH SORT OF LIKE AN EXCHANGE PROGRAM .
YEAH .
UHHUH .
AND OTHER THAN THAT I CA NT THINK OF ANY OTHER IDEAS .
YEAH THAT D BE SORT OF NEAT I LIKE THE IDEA OF UH BEING UH A MANDATORY THING FOR WELFARE COURSE THAT S WHAT UM THAT S SORT OF LIKE WHAT TRUMAN HAD OR WAS IT ROOSEVELT I CA NT REMEMBER UM WITH THE BIG .
OH WITH W P A .
YEAH .
YEAH .
GETTING PEOPLE UH THE THE WORK PROGRAM AND ALL THE ALL THE MAKE WORK JOBS THAT WAS SORT OF PUBLIC SERVICE IN A WAY ALL THE HIGHWAYS THEY STARTED BUILDING .
AND WE RE STILL USING THOSE THINGS TOO .
WHAT DID YOU SAY .
WE RE STILL USING THOSE THINGS .
YEAH THAT S TRUE A LOT OF THEM ARE STILL OUT THERE .
LIKE ALL THESE WONDERFUL HIGHWAYS IN WEST VIRGINIA AND NO ONE KNOWS WHY .
THEY BUILT LODGES BEFORE TOO LIKE AT CADDO LAKE .
LAKE WHAT .
CADDO LAKE .
CADDO LAKE .
IT S BETWEEN TEXAS AND LOUISIANA IT CROSSES INTO BOTH OF THEM .
NO I VE NEVER HEARD OF IT .
WELL IT S REAL PRETTY IT S LIKE A SWAMP .

OH OKAY YEAH I BEEN UH I GOT UH TALKED TO SOMEONE ELSE BEFORE THAT WAS A UH A TEXAN BUT I GUESS THAT S UH THAT S WHAT WE RE GOING TO HAVE THIS IS UH A T I EXPERIMENT TO SEE HOW TALK TEXANS TALK TO OTHER PEOPLE .
I DO NT KNOW WHERE ARE YOU FROM .
UH VIRGINIA .
VIRGINIA OH THAT S NEAT I TALKED TO SOMEBODY FROM OHIO THE OTHER NIGHT .
OH YEAH IT IS NEAT TO GET OTHER PEOPLE ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU GOT OTHER UH IDEAS ABOUT HOW PEOPLE UH HOW PEOPLE REACT TO THINGS AND STUFF ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO UM SOCIAL SERVICES UH UH I M GLAD THEY HAVE A LOT OF UH UM YOU KNOW TOPICS ON SOCIAL SERVICES BECAUSE LIKE THIS THING THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD IDEA I DID NT EVEN KNOW IF THEY WERE THINKING ABOUT IT I WONDER IF THEY THOUGHT ABOUT IT THEMSELVES OR WHETHER SOMEONE SOMEWHERE IS REALLY THINKING THAT UH IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE EVERYBODY SPEND SOME TIME IN PUBLIC SERVICE .
THERE IS SOMEBODY AND I MUMBLEX UH I CA NT REMEMBER WHO IT IS BUT THERE S A REALLY FAMOUS OF DANG I CA NT REMEMBER .
POLITICIANS PUSHING IT OR UH .
THAT PROPOSED IT I READ SOMETHING IN PEOPLE ABOUT IT .
OR MITCH SNIDER .
HUH .

MITCH SNIDER I DO NT KNOW WHO MITCH SNIDER IS .
OH OKAY WELL SEE THAT S A D C THING MITCH SNIDER IS THE THE ADVOCATE FOR THE HOMELESS THAT UH HE HE S SAID IT OUT HERE IN WASHINGTON BUT HE STARTED THE UM UH THE MOVEMENT FOR CREATIVE NONVIOLENCE .

UHHUH THAT WOULD BE NEAT I D HAVE TO BASICALLY SAY MY BIRTH .
THAT S PROBABLY THE BEST ONE AND WE HAD TO TALK ABOUT AIR POLLUTION TOO WHAT DO YOU THINK IS CAUSING IT AND WHAT SHOULD WE DO ABOUT IT .
UHHUH WELL THAT WOULD BE SORT OF INTERESTING BECAUSE THEN YOU GET PEOPLE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES I MEAN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE YOU KNOW OF COURSE PITTSBURGH WOULD SAY YOU KNOW OH FIND THE BETTER CHEAPER WAYS OF BURNING COAL YOU KNOW .
UHHUH RIGHT .
CLEANER WAYS OF BURNING COAL AND PEOPLE IN THE SOUTH WOULD SAY DO NT BURN COAL YOU KNOW .

UHHUH .
BUT I M GOING TO TRY IT WELL YOU HAVE A GOOD NIGHT .
THANKS A LOT .
WE LL SEE YOU BYEBYE .
BYEBYE .
WELL MY FAMILY MOVED TO TEXAS ABOUT EIGHT YEARS AGO MY HUSBAND WAS RAISED HERE BY I I HAVE NEVER LIVED HERE SO UM WHEN WE CAME BACK TO TEXAS I WAS REALLY KIND OF EXCITED THERE WAS NT A STATE INCOME TAX AND THERE WAS NT A TAX ON FOOD THAT WE PURCHASED AT THE THE GROCERY STORE AND THINGS .
HUHUH .
AND ALL OF THAT WAS NEW TO ME BECAUSE I M SORT OF FEELING LIKE WE RE GETTING A BETTER DEAL HERE THAN WHAT I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO .
YEAH DID YOU MOVE FROM THE NORTHEAST .
WELL I LIVED IN MISSOURI AND THEN IN UTAH AND THEM UM BOTH PLACES HAD PRETTY GOOD STATE INCOME TAX AND UM WE VE ALWAYS PAID TAX YOU KNOW ON EVERYTHING WE PURCHASED EVEN FOOD AT THE GROCERY STORE SO I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY YOU KNOW KIND OF A PRETTY GOOD DEAL NOT TO HAVE TO PAY TAX ON YOUR GROCERIES AND BUT I THINK I MEAN I DO NT ENJOY PAYING TAXES AND IT S HARD BUT UM I THINK THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE TO HAVE YOU KNOW HAVE OUR STREETS AND HAVE HAVE OUR GOVERNMENT AND EXCUSE ME AND HAVE AND HAVE THE SERVICES THAT WE NEED AND WE HAVE TO PAY FOR THEM AND PAY FOR THE EMPLOYMENT OF THE PEOPLE THAT RUN THEM AND AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND I THINK I GUESS WHAT I FEEL IS THAT MOST PEOPLE UM THEY DO NT LIKE TO PAY TAXES BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE THERE S SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE NT PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE .
YEAH I THINK YEAH .
AND UM THAT MAKES YOU FEEL BAD .
PEOPLE THAT CAN REALLY INFLUENCE THE GOVERNMENT HAVE ALL THE MONEY TO THROW .
RIGHT AND YOU KNOW WHEN UM WHEN LAST YEAR THE ELECTIONS WERE GOING ON THE GOVERNORS ELECTION AND STATE AND YOU KNOW I I DID NT HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST CLAYTON WILLIAMS PERSONALLY OR ANYTHING BUT UM IT WAS KIND OF HARD FOR ME TO THINK HERE S SOMEONE AS WEALTHY AS HE IS DID NT HAVE TO PAY ANY INCOME TAX THAT HE SAID THAT YEAR HE CLAIMED HE HAD HE DID NT HAVE TO PAY INCOME TAX AND HE THOUGHT YOU KNOW THERE S SOME PEOPLE ARE LIVING PRETTY PRETTY GOOD LIFE STYLES BUT THEY RE NOT PAYING INCOME TAX AND THAT S NOT FAIR .
NO .
TO ME AND THERE S YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE YOU KNOW WHO ARE ABUSING THE SYSTEMS THAT WE PAY TAXES TO SUPPORT AND ALL THAT MAKES US FEEL BAD BUT I THINK ALL IN ALL HOW I FEEL IS THAT UM I M WILLING TO PAY THE TAXES BECAUSE I THINK I LIKE OUR COUNTRY COMPARED TO THE OTHER COUNTRIES I VE STUDIED AND VISITED AND I M WILLING TO PAY EXTRA TO LIVE HERE AND TO ENJOY THE SERVICES THAT I ENJOY HOW DO YOU FEEL .
WELL YEAH I AGREE THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY TAXES FOR THE SERVICES YOU GET AND .
HUHUH .
AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW I DO NT THINK THAT THERE S ANY REALLY ANY SYSTEM THAT EVERYBODY WOULD THINK IS FAIR AS FAR AS BEING TAXED .
HUHUH .
SO I GUESS IN TEXAS WITH WE LIVE HERE ALSO .
HUHUH .
AND THAT IT S MOSTLY SALES TAX SO IT S REALLY THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE MONEY TO BUY THINGS ARE PAYING THE MORE BECAUSE THEY RE PAYING THE SALES TAX ON THE LARGER ITEMS THAT THEY BUY AND STUFF .
HUHUH .
I VE LIVED IN TEXAS MOST OF MY LIFE WE UM LIVED IN KANSAS CITY FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS AND WE WERE KIND OF IN FOR A RUDE AWAKENING THEY HAD PERSONAL PROPERTY TAXES ON LIKE CARS AND THE FIRST YEAR WE WERE THERE IT WAS KIND OF LIKE EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS .
OH NO .
AND WE RE LIKE MUMBLEX MY HUSBAND SAYS I USED TO COMPLAIN TO PAY SIXTY DOLLARS TO GET LICENSED IN TEXAS AND NOW .
YOU KNOW .
HUHUH .
SO I MEAN THAT WAS KIND OF DIFFERENT AND THEN TO FILE A A STATE INCOME TAX WAS ALSO KIND OF TOUGH TOO I GUESS SINCE WE VE BEEN MARRIED WE VE MOVED A LOT SO IT ALWAYS SEEMS LIKE YOU KNOW WE RE ALWAYS PAYING TAXES FOR SOMETHING .
AND IT WAS KIND OF NICE THIS YEAR TO FINALLY BE ABLE TO GET A LITTLE MONEY BACK BUT .
HUHUH .
I UM HAVE A ACCOUNTING BACKGROUND SO I THEN HAVE ALSO DONE TAX RETURNS IN THE PAST FOR OTHER PEOPLE WHEN I WORKED FOR AN ACCOUNTING FIRM .
HUHUH .
AND UH YOU KNOW IT IS KIND OF SAD TO SEE HOW THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO HIRE SOMEBODY AND HAVE THE MONEY TO SPEND TO PUT THERE MONEY IN PLACES THEY DO NT HAVE TO PAY TAXES .
RIGHT .
OR TO BUY SOMETHING THAT LOSES MONEY SO THAT THEY CAN OFFSET THE INCOME THAT THEY GET OR WHATEVER .
YEAH .
SO YOU KNOW I THINK IF I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THE RICH PEOPLE DO NT WANT TO PAY .
HUHUH .
YOU KNOW A LARGE LARGE PERCENT BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT S NOT REALLY FAIR EITHER IF THEY VE EARNED MONEY BY THEMSELVES WELL YOU KNOW PEOPLE JUST KIND OF GIVEN THE MONEY .
YES .
IT S KIND OF DEPRESSING SOMETIMES I THINK .
WELL IT IS AND SOMETIMES I THINK UM WELL FOR MYSELF THAT INCOME THAT WE HAVE WE PAY A CERTAIN SALARY BUT I THINK THE EMPLOYER KEEPS IN MIND THIS WILL BE DEDUCTED YOU KNOW SO SO MANY TAXES WILL BE DEDUCTED FROM IT AND SO I THINK YOU KNOW OUR SALARIES ARE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER BECAUSE WE HAVE TO PAY TAXES ON IT .
YEAH .
AND SO I THINK YOU KNOW IN THAT WAY WE RE COMPENSATED UM JUST BY OUR SOCIETY UM YET YOU KNOW THEY DO NT PAY YOU UM WHAT JUST WHAT IT WOULD TAKE AND IF YOU PAY TAXES ON IT YOU WOULD NT HAVE ANY MONEY LEFT OVER AND AND UM BUT SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT MAKE A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY AND EVERYTHING I WISH THAT THEY WOULD I GUESS BECAUSE I M NOT ONE OF THEM .
WELL YEAH THAT S TRUE .
I WISH THAT THEY WOULD YOU KNOW REALIZE THAT THEY THEY COULD NT MAKE THIS KIND OF MONEY THEY COULD NT LIVE THAT KIND OF LIFE STYLE ANYWHERE ELSE .
YEAH .
IN THAT EVEN IF THEY MADE THAT KIND OF MONEY THERE S SOME COUNTRIES THAT HAVE LIKE FIFTY PERCENT INCOME TAX YOU KNOW THAT HAVE .
YEAH .
SOCIALIZED MEDICINES AND THINGS THAT THEY UM THEY WOULD NT BE ABLE TO ENJOY THE MUMBLEX IN THAT SO THAT YOU KNOW THEY NEED TO BE WILLING TO PAY A LITTLE BIT MORE FOR IT YES THEY VE EARNED IT AND YES THEY HAVE SUCH GREAT FORTUNE HERE BUT THEY NEED TO PAY FOR IT TOO BECAUSE THEY COULD NT DO IT SOMEWHERE ELSE .
YEAH .
UM I LIKE TEXAS UM NOT HAVING THE STATE INCOME TAX AND I HOPE THAT BECAUSE UM WE VE HAD ENOUGH INDUSTRY HERE THAT I GUESS IT IS THAT WHY WE DO NT HAVE INDUSTRY HERE IS ABLE TO TO FUND THE STATE BECAUSE WE HAVE OIL HERE AND THINGS I MEAN THAT S WHAT I VE ALWAYS HEARD IS THAT UM .
THEY MUST HAVE ENOUGH OTHER STUFF BECAUSE THE WAY THE OIL HAS BEEN THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT THAT REALLY HAS NOT BEEN .
BIG BOOM .
THE INDUSTRY THAT IS BRINGING IN THE MONEY FOR THE TAXES I WOULD NT THINK .
YEAH THERE S SOMETHING ABOUT UM THE INDUSTRY IN THE STATE .
YEAH .
THAT UM THERE S ENOUGH I KNOW WE MOVED HERE FROM HOUSTON AND THE CITY HAD ENOUGH MONEY IT WAS REALLY NICE THAT THEY HAD UM THAT THEY BEGAN TO CUT BACK BECAUSE OF THE OIL PROBLEMS BUT UM THEY WOULD HAVE UM SO MANY COMMUNITY OUTDOOR THEATERS AND .
HUHUH .
AND LIKE UH COMMUNITY COUNTRY CLUB TYPE THINGS THAT THE IT WAS SUCH NICE SERVICES TO OFFER THE RESIDENTS IN THE CITY AND I REALLY LIKED THAT .
DO NT YOU HAVE TO WHY PEOPLE DECIDED TO EXPECT CERTAIN SERVICES .
HUHUH .
THEN THEY DO NT REALLY THINK THEY SHOULD PAY FOR THEM MAYBE I DO NT KNOW .
YEAH THAT S TRUE AND I YOU KNOW LIKE THE PROPERTY TAX THAT WE PAY IS SO MUCH HIGHER THAN MY PARENTS PAY IN MISSOURI BUT UM I M I M COMFORTABLE AT LEAST IN THIS YEAR WITH WITH WE HAVE SOME GOOD SCHOOLS THE SCHOOL THING MIGHT BE CHANGING BUT .
YEAH .
I M WILLING TO PAY FOR THAT FOR MY CHILDREN AND I M WILLING TO SACRIFICE I GUESS I M NOT GOING TO BE THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT S GOING TO GRUMBLE ABOUT THE TAXES EVEN THOUGH WE RE PAYING A PRETTY HIGH PERCENTAGE I FEEL LIKE YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR AND I WANT TO BE HERE AND I ENJOY I ENJOY LIVING HERE IN THIS COUNTRY AND HAVING SEEN OTHER COUNTRIES I D MUCH RATHER LIVE HERE AND PAY TAXES .
HUHUH .
THAN LIVE SOMEWHERE ELSE AND NOT ANYWAY WELL I GUESS I BETTER LET YOU GO .

WELL I KEEP TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM THEM I USED TO USE A LOT OF CREDIT CARDS I GUESS FOR A WHILE I WOULD USE YOU KNOW A VARIETY OF THE VISA AND THE MASTERCARD AND THE STORES BUT I THINK I I IMPULSE BUY TOO MUCH WITH THEM OR I BUY THINGS YOU KNOW I SEE IT ON SALE AND I THINK OH IT S ON SALE I HAVE TO GET IT AND I REALLY DO NT NEED IT OR I REALLY HAVE NT BUDGETED FOR IT SO UM THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS I REALLY HAVE TRIED NOT TO USE THEM AT ALL .
YEAH .
WHAT ABOUT YOU .
WELL WE HAVE THIS PHILOSOPHY WE USE IT WHEN WE GO OFF SOMEWHERE BUT WE PAY FOR IT AS SOON AS WE COME BACK YOU KNOW AS SOON AS WE GET OUR BILLS .
UHHUH .
WE PAY IT OFF .
UHHUH .
AND WE ONLY HAVE ONE WE TORE ALL THE REST OF THEM UP .
OKAY .
BECAUSE I DO NT LIKE CREDIT CARDS FOR ONE THING YOU KNOW I MEAN THEY RE OKAY I GUESS IF YOU RE ON A TRIP OR SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
YOU DO NT HAVE TO TAKE A WHOLE BUNCH OF YOU KNOW CASH WITH YOU .
RIGHT .
BUT I DO NT LIKE USING THEM BECAUSE I VE SEEN TOO MANY PEOPLE THAT USED THEM AND ENDED UP BANKRUPT OR ON .
HUH .
CHAPTER THIRTEEN AND STUFF LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE THEY HAVE THIS WEIRD OPINION THAT IF YOU USE THAT CARD YOU DO NT HAVE TO PAY FOR IT .
THAT S TRUE IF IF IT S ON THE CREDIT CARD IT DOES NT SEEM LIKE IT S MONEY OUT OF YOUR POCKET SOMETIMES YOU MAY THINK WELL I DO NT HAVE THE MONEY SO YOU USE THE CREDIT CARD IT S LIKE FAKE MONEY OR SOMETHING .
YEAH YEAH AND IT GIVES YOU A SENS UM A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY OR SOMETHING IT SEEMS LIKE BECAUSE YOU SAY OH WELL I DO NT HAVE TO PAY FOR IT NOW BUT YOU RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY FOR IT AND IT SEEMS LIKE .
YEAH YOU THINK WELL I DO NT HAVE IT NOW BUT PAYDAY WILL COME AND THEN I LL HAVE THE MONEY .
UHHUH .
BUT THAT S PROBABLY PAYING FOR THINGS THAT WERE STILL OWED FROM LAST TIME .
RIGHT ARE YOU MARRIED .
YES .
OH OKAY WELL I KNOW THAT A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE YOU KNOW I IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME TO GET IT THROUGH MY CHILD S HEAD I MEAN THAT WAS HER GOAL YOU KNOW UH GOT TO HAVE A CREDIT CARD .
UHHUH .
BUT NOW THAT SHE HAS ONE SHE S ONLY USED IT ONE TIME BUT SHE WANTED TO ESTABLISH SOME CREDIT .
UHHUH .
BUT I THINK IT FINALLY SUNK IN YOU KNOW BECAUSE SHE SAW SOME OF THE OTHER PEOPLE AND JUST LIKE SHE HEARD THEM SAY YOU KNOW WELL I USED A CREDIT CARD AND MY HUSBAND S SISTER IS THE WORLD S WORST AT OH WELL I LL JUST USE THE CREDIT CARDS AND SHE HAS ALL OF HER CREDIT CARDS UP TO THE LIMIT .
HUH .
YOU KNOW AND I M I M THINKING WOMAN WAKE UP AND SMELL THE ROSES BEFORE THEY COME AND GET YOU BUT .
RIGHT BESIDES THE FACT THAT HOW MUCH INTEREST YOU PAY AND THEN THIS .
RIGHT AND PEOPLE DO NT SEE THAT EITHER .
YEAH THIS THING THAT YOU THOUGHT YOU GOT ON SALE BY THE TIME YOU GET DONE PAYING WITH THAT WITH ALL THE FINANCE CHARGES BECAUSE YOU PAY IT OFF OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME YOU VE SPENT A HECK OF A LOT OF MONEY ON THAT THING .
RIGHT THE ONLY ONE THAT WE WE HAVE THAT WE KEPT WAS THE DISCOVER CARD .
UHHUH .
AND IT PAYS YOU TO USE IT .
UHHUH .
I MEAN IF YOU PAY YOUR BILL OFF RIGHT AWAY .
UHHUH .
IF YOU DO NT EVER HAVE TO PAY ANY INTEREST ON IT BECAUSE THEY GIVE YOU A CERTAIN AMOUNT EVERY TIME THAT YOU USE IT AND YOU MAKE THAT MONEY AS LONG AS YOU DO NT EVER HAVE TO PAY THEM ANY UH INTEREST NOW IT S AND PEOPLE SAY WELL YOU KNOW I M MAKING MONEY BY USING THIS CREDIT CARD BUT THEY DO NT REALIZE THAT IF THEY I MEAN IT ONLY TAKES ONE TIME FOR YOU TO USE IT AND NOT PAY THE INTEREST I MEAN YOU HAVE TO PAY THE INTEREST NOT PAY IT RIGHT OFF .
UHHUH .
THAT S GOING TO TAKE UP WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE MADE .
HUH .
SO THAT S THE ONLY REASON THAT WE KEPT THAT WE DEBATED FOR A LONG TIME PLUS THEY DO NT HAVE THAT UM CHARGE ON IT YOU KNOW LIKE .
SERVICE CHARGE YOU MEAN .
YEAH .
YEARLY FEE YEAH .
RIGHT THEY DO NT HAVE ONE OF THOSE SO IT WE DECIDED THAT WAS IT YOU KNOW AND I MEAN EVERYBODY CALLS US AND WANTS TO GIVE US A CREDIT CARD WE HAVE WE COULD HAVE CREDIT CARDS RUNNING DOWN OUR EARS .
OH YOU GET THAT STUFF IN THE MAIL ALL THE TIME .
YES YES AND THEN I I LL HAVE JUST LIKE UH DEPARTMENT STORES THEY LL CALL ME UP YOU KNOW AND I LL SAY LOOK I DO NT WANT THE CREDIT CARD WELL WE RE JUST GOING TO SEND IT TO YOU YOU KNOW YOU DO NT HAVE TO EVER USE IT IF YOU DO NT WANT TO THEY LL SEND ME ANY CREDIT CARD I TEAR IT UP I JUST CA NT SEE IT .
WHAT I REALLY HATE IN THE MAIL IS LIKE FOR THE CREDIT CARDS THAT I DO HAVE STILL .
UHHUH .
THAT THEY SEND YOU THESE THINGS THAT LOOK LIKE CHECKS .
YEAH .
AND THEY SAY HEY YOU KNOW TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU KNOW FREE TO YOU KIND OF THING YOU KNOW ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS GO CASH THOSE THINGS AND YOU VE GOT A SHORT TERM LOAN I HATE IT .
I KNOW IT AND YOU KNOW WHAT .
I CA NT BELIEVE THEY HAVE THE NERVE TO DO THAT .
WHAT S REALLY BAD ABOUT THOSE THOUGH IS JUST LIKE YOUNG PEOPLE IF THEY DO NT YOU KNOW WE TAKE THE TIME TO YOU KNOW HELP MY DAUGHTER SHE S IN COLLEGE .
UHHUH .
BUT IT THIS IS HER FIRST CREDIT CARD THING WELL WHEN SHE GOT HER FIRST ONE SHE WAS SO EXCITED IT WAS UNREAL LOOK AT THIS THEY SENT ME THIS MONEY YOU KNOW SO THEN WHEN I EXPLAINED TO HER LOOK YOU HAVE TO PAY THIS BACK AND THEY ARE GOING TO CHARGE YOU INTEREST AND STUFF OF COURSE SHE TER TORE IT UP .
BUT A LOT OF PARENTS WOULD NOT TAKE THE TIME YOU KNOW AND THEY WOULD NT EVEN THINK OF IT OR THEIR KIDS MAY NOT BE AS CLOSE AS MY DAUGHTER AND I ARE AND UH YOU KNOW THEY MAY NOT EVEN DISCUSS IT THEY GO OUT AND CASH THEIR CHECK THINKING THAT YOU KNOW THEY VE GOT SOMETHING MAYBE THEY VE WON SOMETHING .
YOU KNOW SOMEBODY SENT THEM SOMETHING FREE .
UHHUH .
AND GO OUT AND SPEND IT AND UM IT S JUST UNREAL I MEAN I DO NT LIKE CREDIT CARDS I WISH THAT THEY WOULD COME UP WITH SOME OTHER WAY TO YOU KNOW THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD USE THEM IS IF YOU WERE LIKE ON VACATION THEY WOULD LET YOU USE IT MAYBE ONCE A YEAR .
YOU KNOW I MEAN OF COURSE I GUESS SOME PEOPLE GO OUT AND SPEND THEIR WHOLE ENTIRE LIMIT ON IT LIKE THAT AT THAT TIME BUT UM I HAVE SEEN SO MANY PEOPLE AND I HAVE A FRIEND RIGHT NOW SHE JUST GOT OFF OF THIRTEEN SHE GOT UH I CA NT REMEMBER WHAT SHE CALLED IT IT S SOME KIND OF MAYBE IT S SURE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT S SOMETHING IT S SOME WEIRD NAME OF A CREDIT CARD .
UHHUH .
AND SHE IS CHARGING OUT OF HER MIND ALREADY AND I M GOING YOU JUST GOT OFF THAT S HOW YOU GOT ON TO IT TO START WITH YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH THIS PERSON .
YEAH .
BUT UM IT SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE JUST YOU KNOW THEY JUST THINK WELL I CAN JUST HAVE ANYTHING I WANT AND I JUST DO NT SEE IT LIKE THAT OF COURSE I ALWAYS SEE PAY THE BILLS FIRST AND WHATEVER S LEFTOVER THAT S WHAT YOU HAVE BUT UM MAYBE A LOT OF PEOPLE DO NT SEE IT LIKE THAT BUT I CA NT STAND OWING I MEAN I CAN NOT FULLY TOLERATE TO OWE SOMETHING LIKE YOU KNOW I GUESS IT S JUST BECAUSE I VE BEEN BROUGHT UP LIKE THAT BUT UM I COULD NOT CHARGE TO THE LIMIT AND KNOWING THAT I WAS GOING TO HAVE TO PAY THIS THING OUT FOR EVER AND MAYBE SUFFER FROM HAVING TO PAYOUT BUT THAT S JUST THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT IT .
YEAH I THINK IT S IT S SOMEWHAT A UH SYMPTOM OF OUR ME GENERATION AND THAT WE THINK WE NEED ALL THESE THINGS AND I THINK MY PARENTS ALWAYS YOU KNOW DID WITHOUT OR SAVED UP TO YOU KNOW BUY THINGS AND WE CONSIDER THAT SO MANY OF THESE THINGS WE JUST HAVE TO HAVE YOU KNOW LIKE WHEN I FIRST GOT MY APARTMENT AND I WAS SETTING IT UP I DID TRY TO ECONOMIZE SOME BUT YOU KNOW I WAS JUST LIKE WELL I HAVE TO HAVE IT ALL FURNISHED AND I HAVE TO HAVE ALL OF MY KITCHEN SETUP AND YOU DO NT YOU KNOW DO WITHOUT TOO MUCH AND YOU KNOW THAT S HOW I GOT STARTED KIND OF WITH SETTING UP A HOUSEHOLD ALL UP YOU KNOW IT KIND OF LIKE IN THE SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME YOU KNOW YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE THESE THINGS JUST YOU KNOW HAVE THEM AT HOME HAVE TO HAVE THEM AT MY OWN PLACE AND THAT S YOU KNOW A BIG EXPENDITURE TO START UM BUYING ALL THESE THINGS THAT YOU THINK OR OR HAVE TO HAVE AND ACTUALLY THEY RE KIND OF LUXURIES OR YOU SHOULD SAVE UP SLOWLY AND KEEP BUYING THEM AND NOT JUST RUSH OUT AND FURNISH THE WHOLE PLACE .

YEAH WELL YOU LEARNED THEN RIGHT .
YEAH YOU LEARN THE YOU KNOW THE HARD WAY YOU HATE PAYING ALL THAT INTEREST AND I VE NEVER BEEN ONE TO ITEMIZE ON MY INCOME TAX AND NEVER HAD ENOUGH TO ITEMIZE AND SO IT S JUST A BIG CHUNK OF MONEY AND YOU REALIZE THAT YOU RE NOT BUYING ANYTHING ON SALE YOUR PAYING SO MUCH MORE FOR THAT ITEM BECAUSE YOU VE GOT FINANCE CHARGE AND THE COST OF HAVING THAT CARD EVERY YEAR WHICH IS WHAT FORTY DOLLARS SOMETIMES JUST TO HAVE THE CARD .

AND .
YEAH .
OBVIOUSLY THAT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT .
OH SURE .
AND AND IF YOU KNOW I CAN SEE THAT HE WAS IN KUWAIT .

THE AMERICAN PEOPLE .
OUR GOVERNMENT IS FULL OF LIARS THIEVES AND CROOKS .
OH SURE WELL AND THERE S A LOT .
AND THAT S .
THAT WE .
OUR OWN FAULT BECAUSE WE ELECTED THEM .
YEAH I THINK THAT S TRUE BUT I THINK THERE S A LOT THAT WE THE PUBLIC DOES NT NEED TO KNOW I THINK THERE S SOME THINGS WE SHOULD NT KNOW JUST FOR NATION NATIONAL SECURITY SAKE AND I YOU KNOW I THINK IF WE DID KNOW I THINK THERE WOULD BE A LOT MORE CHAOS THAN THERE IS BECAUSE I DO NT I DO NT THINK PEOPLE COULD HANDLE IT SO I THINK THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD NOT KNOW THE MASSES SHOULD NT KNOW BUT I ALSO AGREE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF CROOKS AND LIARS TOO .
YOU KNOW IT S UH I WENT ON JURY DUTY HERE NOT LONG BACK .

YES I DO .
UH THERE SEEMS TO BE MORE A MATURE CROWD IN UH APARTMENTS AT LEAST WHERE I AM UH EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW THERE S KIDS ALL AROUND AND THERE S THERE S TRAFFIC AND THERE S PEOPLE RUNNING UP AND DOWN THE SIDEWALKS AND STUFF LIKE THAT BUT STILL UH .
EVERYBODY PRETTY MUCH KEE KEEPS KEEPS TO THEIR OWN TURF SO TO SPEAK .

RELAX AND TRY TO GO TO SLEEP REALLY YEAH .
YOU SEE A LOT OF ACTIVITY OUTSIDE PEOPLE RIDING BIKES PLAYING BALL OR JOGGING OR THEY RE DOING THIS AND THAT AND THEY THEY RE TRYING TO TO UNWIND .
I THINK PLANO IN GENERAL IS GETTING A LITTLE MORE WELL IT S GOTTEN SO BIG IT S ALMOST A TOWN IN IT S OWN RIGHT .
OH YEAH IT S A HUNDRED AND WHAT EIGHTY THOUSAND SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
OR SOMETHING YEAH THE PRICE OF HOME NOW WE PAID OH WE PAID UM ABOUT SEVENTYEIGHT NINE FOR OUR HOUSE LIKE I SAID ABOUT A DECADE AGO NOT EVEN ABOUT NINE YEARS AGO AND I D SAY THEY APPRAISED IT IT S GONE UP YOU NOW MAYBE LIKE FIVE PERCENT .
OH YEAH .
SO IT S AN INVESTMENT BUT IT S SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU RE FIRST MARRIED OR STARTING OUT YOU THINK IF YOU REALLY HAVE SOMETHING BUT YOU REALLY IT S JUST REAL NOWADAYS WITH THE WAY THE INCOME TAX I THINK HOUSING IS STRICTLY TO ITEMIZE .
OH YOU BET AND THE THING THAT THAT GETS ME IS UH YOU NEVER REALLY CATCH UP YOU NEVER REALLY FINISH DOING THINGS AND UH .
YEAH EXACTLY WE .
YOU RE ALWAYS PAYING FOR SOMETHING .
YEAH AND EVEN YOU KNOW I MEAN LIKE WE HAD I CALLED THEM PREFABS JUST A TRACT HOME YOU KNOW I MEAN WE WE HAD ONE OF THEIR HOMES THAT WAS NICER IN PENNSYLVANIA BUT UM IT WAS AN OLDER HOME BUT THEN YOU BUY AN OLDER HOME AND YOU RE ALWAYS FIXING THINGS UP .

I HAVE ONE SON .
AND DID YOU PUT HIM IN DAYCARE OR IS HE OLDER NOW OR YOUNGER OR .

SURE SO HE S OUT OF DAYCARE .
I RIGHT AND AND SO THAT BUT I WAS WORKING FULLTIME UH .
YOU UHHUH .
WHEN HE WAS BORN BUT I WAS VERY LUCKY BECAUSE I WAS A A COLLEGE PROFESSOR .
OH .
AND SO I WAS ABLE TO YOU KNOW AND I IT WAS .
FLEX .
WALKING DISTANCE FROM FROM .
YEAH .
MY APARTMENT SO I WENT UP THERE AND I SORT OF LEFT HIM WITH WITH A NEIGHBOR .
UHHUH .
AND I LEFT HIM IN A CARRY COT WHEN HE WAS VERY LITTLE AND I SAID YOU KNOW HE DOES NT NEED ANYTHING EXCEPT YOU KNOW LOOK AT HIM IF HE CRIES BUT YOU KNOW DO NT PICK HIM UP AND AND .
YEAH .
THIS SORT OF STUFF BECAUSE I WAS GONE ONLY AN HOUR AT A STRETCH OR AN HOUR AND A HALF .
OH THAT S WONDERFUL .
AND I WAS ABLE TO YOU KNOW GET HIS SCHEDULE JUST UH COOPERATED .
RIGHT .
AND .
THAT S WONDERFUL YEAH .
YEAH .
AND AND I GUESS UH TH BECAUSE OF YOUR UM YOUR UH PROFESSION I MEAN I UH I M IN CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONS BUT I VE DONE FREELANCE WRITING IN THE PAST .
UHHUH .
SO WHAT WE RE HOPING IS THAT UH I MEAN MY HUSBAND THINKS I CAN DO IT I VE JUST NEVER WORKED OUT OF A DOMESTIC BASE YOU KNOW I VE ALWAYS .
UHHUH .
BEEN IN A CORPORATE UH ENVIRONMENT UH BUT I M HOPING THAT POSSIBLY I CAN DO SOMETHING WHERE I CAN GO FLEXTIME OR PARTTIME OR IF THEY DO NT HAVE THAT UH MY BOSS I M VERY LUCKY THOUGH AGAIN TOO MY BOSS IS VERY AKIN TO FAMILY BUILDING SO I THINK THAT S SOM TH SOMETHING THAT COUPLES NEED IN GOING .
UHHUH .
INTO THIS .
RIGHT .
UH I DO NT KNOW I DO THINK THERE S GOOD DAYCARE OUT THERE WHAT PART OF THE COUNTRY ARE YOU IN .
I M IN MARYLAND .
YOU RE IN MARYLAND .
BUT BUT I WAS OUT OF THE COUNTRY WHEN UH MY MY SON WAS LITTLE BUT BUT THE THING IS IF YOU HAVE THIS FLEXTIME AND THAT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING SIMILAR TO WHAT I DID .
RIGHT .
WHICH IS .
THAT S WHAT I M HOPING .
YOU KNOW BE THERE SHORT TIMES AND THEN LATER ON WHEN HE WAS YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
I MEAN THIS WE RE TALKING ABOUT UH I WENT BACK TO WORK AND OR TAUGHT SOME SOME CLASSES LIKE A WEEK AFTER HE WAS BORN .
OH MY GOODNESS YOU WERE .
AND SO .
FORTUNATE YEAH .
YEAH AND SO THAT S WHEN I WAS .
YEAH .
SAYING YOU KNOW DO NT DO NT PICK HIM UP AND STUFF BUT THEN LATER WHAT I DID WAS I BROUGHT A WOMAN INTO THE HOUSE .
UHHUH SURE .
AND SHE SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO HELP ME A LITTLE BIT WITH COOKING AND DOING THE BABY S LAUNDRY AND THIS SORT OF STUFF .
UHHUH .
AND THEN I ALSO CAME HOME AND SORT OF WAS ABLE TO SEE FROM A DISTANCE WHAT SHE WAS DOING .
UHHUH .
AND YOU KNOW IN A SENSE SHE SHE CARRIED HIM AROUND A LOT TOO MUCH UH YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
FOR FOR MY TASTE .
RIGHT .
IT WAS CONSTANTLY NO I DO NT WANT HIM .
TO EXPLORE ANYTHING HE MIGHT UH HE MIGHT HURT HIMSELF .
SO DO YOU THINK THAT I MEAN DO YOU THINK THAT THAT WAS IN A WAY THOUGH GOOD OB GOOD OBJECTIVITY THAT THAT DOES NT REALLY THAT S NOT A CORRECT ENGLISH BUT MUMBLEX YOU KNOW .
IN A SENSE YOU SEE WHAT I M SAYING THOUGH FROM A MOTHER S STANDPOINT I MEAN IN A WAY I IT WAS QUOTE AND UNQUOTE GOOD OB OBJECTIVITY .
I THINK IT WORKED OUT VERY VERY WELL BECAUSE WHAT HE LEARNED TO DO BY THE TIME HE WAS .
UHHUH .
TWO OR SO HE WOULD SIT NEXT TO THE DESK WHERE I WAS GRADING PAPERS OR .
SEE .
WRITING LESSON PLANS .
UHHUH .
AND HE HAD ASKED FOR A PAPER AND YOU KNOW SORT OF SCRIBBLE AND THEN HE REALIZED THAT THERE .
YEAH .
WERE QUIET TIMES AND THERE WERE ACTIVE TIMES .
RIGHT AND THEN HE LEARNED HE HE ALSO LEARNED THAT UH THERE WERE TIMES THAT YOU HAD TO BE GONE SO YOU PROBABLY MINIMIZED WELL WE RE ACTUALLY UH WE RE GETTING READY I MEAN YOU RE FAR ENOUGH AWAY NOW I CAN TELL YOU SINCE THIS IS LOCALLY I MAKE SURE WE RE GOING TO ROMANIA IN A FEW WEEKS .
OH .
AND THAT S UH JUST .
DID YOU SAY ROMANIA .
R .
OR ARMENIA .
ROMANIA .
OH OKAY YEAH YEAH .
AS IN LIKE WHAT TWENTY TWENTY AND UH BUT WE WE RE REAL EXCITED BECAUSE WE VE JUST DEVELOPED A CONTACT .
OH GOOD .
THROUGH PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE AND IT S PRIVATE AND IT S HOSPITAL IT S WE RE JUST VERY EXCITED UH .
OH GREAT .
AND W I I WHAT S THE WORD I M LOOKING FOR WHEN YOU DEAL WITH ISSUES LIKE THAT UH IN TERMS OF FAMILY BUILDING THROUGH ADOPTION UH AND THEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE RESPONDING TO YOU WELL IF YOU GO THROUGH THAT WHY WOULD YOU PUT THEM IN DAYCARE .
OH THAT S SILLY .
UH ISSUES ARE BEING RAISED PREMATURELY IN MY MIND BUT I GUESS THEY RE NOT BECAUSE IT S SOMETHING I LL HAVE TO DEAL WITH SOONER THAN LATER UH AND I WHAT I VE LEARNED TO DO IS JUST TUNE OUT EVERYBODY S OPINION I FEEL THAT IF THE CHILD IS HEALTHY UH AND AS LONG AS WE MAKE IT FEEL SECURE I D LOVE TO DO SOMETHING LIKE WITH WHAT YOU DID .
UHHUH .
UH I DO NT THINK I COULD BE DUMPER WHERE I COULD TAKE IT FROM YOU KNOW EIGHT IN THE MORNING TILL NINE AT NIGHT OR SIX AT NIGHT AND LEAVE IT THERE .
RIGHT .
UH MAYBE AFTER TWO OR THREE OR Y YEARS OLD I DO NT KNOW UM .
OH I IN MY OPINION IT S EVEN THAN I MEAN .
YEAH .
YOUR KIDS NEED YOU .
WELL THEY NEED A SCHEDULE I THINK I DO NT THINK THE UNITED STATES WHAT COUNTRY WERE YOU UH IN EUROPE WHEN YOU WERE UH UH .
NO I WAS IN THE MIDDLE EAST .
UH THAT S WELL THAT S THE SAME THING I MEAN I DO NT KNOW HOW THEY ARE THERE BUT UH IN EASTERN EUROPE MY STEPFATHER S FROM ENGLAND IT JUST SEEMS THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR EITHER CHILD CARE OR GERIAT OR ELDER CARE AS I CALL IT .
RIGHT RIGHT .
UH AND WE RE JUST NOT SET UP FOR THAT UH WITH THE .
I YEAH .
GO AHEAD .
NO I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY I GUESS UH MY SENSITIVITIES ARE ARE MUCH MORE WITH THE YOU KNOW TO BE AT HOME BECAUSE ACTUALLY I HAD .
UHHUH .
MY GRANDMOTHER WITH ME FROM THE TIME SHE WAS FROM THE TIME SHE WAS NINETYTWO UNTIL SHE DIED AT NINETYSEVEN .
SEE I THINK THAT S WONDERFUL .
AND I MEAN THAT WAS RECENTLY AFTER MY SON WAS GOING OFF AND I MEAN YES IN A SENSE I WENT TO WORK AND SHE WAS AT HOME ALONE SOME OF THE TIME BUT BUT STILL YOU KNOW IT WAS MUCH BETTER THAN BEING SHIPPED TO .
TO .
A DAYCARE CENTER .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW WHICH IS MUCH MY FEELINGS ON KIDS AND THE ELDERLY I THINK WE RE T WE RE TOO TOO MUCH TOWARDS IT S SOMEBODY .
WE CAST OFF .
PROBLEM YOU KNOW .
RIGHT RIGHT TH I M THAT WAY YEAH .
I WANT TO WORK SHOVE THEM IN IN SOME SCHOOL FOR TWELVE HOURS A DAY .
RIGHT IT S EASIER AND I AGREE WITH THAT THAT S WHY I .
YEAH .
Y YOU KNOW WHAT IS AMAZING TO ME IS NOW YOUR SON IS ALREADY GROWN BUT YOU CAN PROBABLY EMPATHIZE WITH THIS IT S AMAZING TO ME HOW FORTHCOMING PEOPLE ARE WITH THEIR OPINIONS AND THOUGHTS .
RIGHT RIGHT .
IN TERMS OF WHAT TO DO UH AND I JUST DO NT THINK THERE IS A DAY A GOOD DAYCARE SYSTEM UH MY COMPANY I M PARTICULARLY FORTUNATE THAT THEY HAVE THEY RE IN TUNE WITH THAT BUT I VE BEEN AT COMPANIES WHERE UH YOU KNOW THE DECI THE THE TREND IS OR THE DEFINITE MOOD IS WELL WE MADE CONSCIOUS DECISIONS NOT TO HAVE CHILDREN .
AND THAT S SAD .
YOU KNOW AND IN AND A COUPLE LIKE US BUILDING THROUGH ADOPTION THERE IT S ALMOST RADICAL TO SOME PEOPLE .
RIGHT .
AND WHAT YOU JUST LEARN TO DO IS TUNE EVERYBODY ELSE OUT AND UH I RESPECT THERE ARE SOME WOMEN THAT I KNOW THAT ARE DIVORCED OR ON THEIR OWN OR IN SINGLE PARENTING AND MEN THAT THEY YOU KNOW THEY MAY HAVE THE NEED FOR CHILD CARE LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
BUT I AGREE WITH YOU THAT IT S JUST I CALL IT DUMPING .
YEAH .
I I .
NO I I THINK THAT CERTAINLY THERE IS A ROLE UH FOR THIS TYPE OF HELP .
UHHUH .
AND AND AS LONG AS ONE CAN CAN SUPERVISE IT AND AND YOU KNOW MAKE IT WORK IN INTO ONE S OWN SCHEDULE WITHOUT IT SEEMING LIKE DUMPING OR .
UHHUH .
OR OR UH GIVING IT YOU KNOW THE WHOLE JOB TO SOMEBODY ELSE TO TAKE CARE OF .
THEN YEAH IT S AR .
MUMBLEX .
IN TANDEM THEN .
YEAH YEAH .
I JUST UH AND THERE ARE TRADEOFFS TOO I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS A PROBLEM IS THAT UH IN TERMS OF COMPENSATION TO SOME OF THE CHILD CARE PROVIDERS .
UHHUH .
UH IT S JUST YOU KNOW IT S SO LOW BUT YET THE OVERALL COST FOR SOMEBODY DOING IT ON A DAILY OR EVEN A WEEKLY BASIS IT S PROHIBITIVE AND SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT MAKING MORE THAN TWENTY THOUSAND A YEAR .
YEAH .
UH .
ACTUALLY THERE SEEMS TO BE AN ALTERNATIVE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD IS .
REALLY .
THERE SEEM THERE ARE SEVERAL U U M MOTHERS WHO STAY HOME .
UHHUH .
AND THEY TAKE YOU KNOW IT S PROBABLY NOT COMPLETELY LEGAL UH I MAYBE IT S LEGAL UP TO ONE OR TWO ADDITIONAL KIDS .
SURE .
BUT AND THEY THEY TAKE CARE OF ANOTHER CHILD AND I I CAN ACTUALLY N COULD NAME FIVE OR SIX PEOPLE AROUND MY NEIGHBORHOOD THAT REALLY DO A GOOD JOB ON THIS .
UHHUH AND THEY YEAH .
AND I MEAN THAT S ANOTHER POSSIBILITY AND YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT WANT TO STAY HOME ONE YEAR AND SOME OTHER LADY MIGHT WANT TO STAY HOME FOR A A FEW YEARS AND .
I HAVE NT THOUGHT ABOUT THAT YEAH AND ACTUALLY MY NEIGHBOR HAS AN EIGHTEEN MONTH OLD AND SHE S AT HOME PARTTIME PARALEGAL SO I M THINKING UM .
YEAH YEAH .
AND WE GET ALONG FANTASTICALLY SO I M THINKING YOU KNOW AND THAT S THE WAY YOU HAVE TO UH HOW WA I M JUST REAL CURIOUS HOW WAS THE MIDDLE EAST IN TERMS OF THAT WITH CHILDREN IS THAT IS CHILD CARE OR THAT TYPE OF IDEA COMPLETELY FOREIGN TO THEM .
NO WELL ACTUALLY THERE WAS A DAYCARE CENTER UH WHERE MY SON DID GO FOR A YEAR I THINK FROM WHEN HE WAS TWO TO THREE .
UHHUH .
BUT THEN HE ACTUALLY STARTED KINDERGARTEN AT AGE THREE .
UHHUH .
AND SO AND I YOU KNOW IT WAS NT LIKE PREKINDERGARTEN IT WAS REAL KINDERGARTEN .
OH REALLY HE MUST BE SMART YEAH .
YEAH SO HE HE WAS READY TO TO GO TO SCHOOL AT THAT POINT .
UHHUH .
BUT YEAH THEY RE THEY DO HAVE SUCH FACILITIES BUT FOR THE MOST PART UH TH WITH THE EXTENDED FAMILY YOU KNOW YOU CAN USUALLY FIND SOMEBODY WHICH IS MUCH LIKE OUR NEIGHBOR .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW TO SHARING RESPONSIBILITY AND I M AND ALSO THERE ARE NT THAT MANY WOMEN WHO WHO D WHO WORK .
THE PROFESSIONAL YEAH I WAS WONDERING ABOUT THAT .
YEAH .
UH THERE I M IN DALLAS AND THERE WAS JUST A VERY BIG UH SERIES ABOUT MOSLEM WOMEN AND .
UHHUH .
THERE WERE ENLIGHTENING THINGS THAT BROKE SOME OF MY STEREOTYPICAL THOUGHTS I M DIGRESSING HERE BUT UH I WAS JUST REAL CURIOUS WHEN YOU SAID MIDDLE EAST IF YOU .
YEAH .
DID NT MIND ME ASKING .
NO NO AND I DID NT MEAN ISRAEL SO YOU YOU ASSUMED RIGHT .
OH NO THAT S OKAY WELL EVEN IF YOU DID THAT S OKAY ACTUALLY I THINK .
WELL NO BECAUSE AT FIRST THOUGHT WHEN I S YOU KNOW I SAID THAT NOT MANY PEOPLE WORK I M I M THINKING OH WELL SHE S GOING TO YOU KNOW BECAUSE CERTAINLY IN ISRAEL THE WOMEN DO WORK .
RIGHT RIGHT THEY FIGHT THEY WORK .
UH WELL HOW IS IT APPROPRIATE TO BE TALKING ABOUT EXERCISE ATTITUDES .
WE UH WELL UH MY MY HUSBAND IS RIGHT NOW TEACHING AN AEROBICS CLASS .
UHHUH .
HE S AN AEROBICS INSTRUCTOR .
AND UM IS GOING TO BE UH ENTERING NORTH TEXAS FOR UH A KINESIOLOGY PROGRAM THERE .
UHHUH .
AND UM THE THE HOW I MET HIM WAS THROUGH UH THE AEROBICS CLASS THAT HE USED TO TEACH .
UHHUH .
YOU RE A STUDENT .
YEAH SO .
UHHUH .
I M I M AN AVID AEROBICS UH PERSON AND JUST VERY VERY ATHLETIC .
ENJOYING A TH YOU KNOW UH ANYTHING DEALING WITH SPORTS .
UHHUH UHHUH .
SO AND HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IT .
UH I M I AM A PERSON .
WHO WISHES I HAD MORE TIME TO EXERCISE .
I .
I DO NT FEEL LIKE I I DO NT VERY OFTEN DO THINGS FOR THE SAKE OF EXERCISE .
I DO NT FEEL WELL UNLESS I AM EXERCISING AND I TRY TO DO THINGS .
THAT INVOLVE EXERCISE BUT I VERY RARELY DO THINGS LIKE UM I VE NEVER DONE AEROBICS OR ANY SORT OF STRUCTURED THIS IS MY EXERCISE TIME .
UHHUH .
BUT I DO LOTS OF OUTDOOR SPORTS AND THINGS BICYCLING UH YOU KNOW MOUNTAINEERING A LITTLE MOUNTAINEERING THIS AND THAT AND I SPEND A LOT OF TIME AND I PROBABLY GET MORE EXERCISE THAN YOUR AVERAGE PERSON .
BUT IT S NOT A A STRUCTURED SORT OF THING AND I HAVE TO ADMIT I HAVE A CERTAIN RESISTANCE TO THE IDEA OF EXERCISING FOR EXERCISING S SAKE .
UHHUH .
AND PERHAPS IT S BECAUSE SOMEHOW THAT IMPLIES TO ME .
IT S NOT FUN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
YEAH WELL I I VE MY THAT S THE WAY MY MOTHER STANDS ON IT .
SHE FEELS LIKE IF IT S SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO DO YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
IF YOU LOOK AT IT AS IF YOU HAVE TO DO IT .
UHHUH .
THEN IT BECOMES IT BECOMES A CHORE .
YES YES .
AND AND SHE DOES NT ENJOY IT WHEN IT S A CHORE .
SO UM AND I FEEL THAT WAY TOO AS FAR AS YOU KNOW JUST SITTING AND DOING YOU KNOW TO THE IDEA OF DOING FIFTY SITUPS OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW TO .
UHHUH UHHUH .
YOU RE A CALCU YOU KNOW CALCULATED DOWN AND DO YOUR CALISTHENICS .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THREE TIMES .
A WEEK OR .
UHHUH UHHUH .
BUT BUT I DO TRY AND UM I DO TRY AND REGULATE HOW MUCH EXERCISE .
I GET A WEEK .
YEAH YEAH .
IS THAT WHY YOU LIKE AEROBICS CLASSES BECAUSE YOU RE NOT SORT OF SOMEONE ELSE IS DOING THE COUNTING FOR YOU SO .
YEAH .
IT MAKES IT LESS OF A CHORE .
AND IT .
S GOT AND I VE ALWAYS ENJOYED DANCE .
YEAH .
SO IT INVOLVES YOU KNOW I I CA NT GET OUT TO DANCE ALL THE TIME AND .
YEAH WOULD THAT WE COULD .
YEAH AND IT S AND IT S MORE REGULATED I MEAN YOU RE YOU RE USING DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BODY .
UHHUH UHHUH .
SO IT IT IS LIKE DANCE AN AND IT S STRUCTURED LIKE THAT BUT YOU HAVE THE MUSIC AND SOMEONE LIKE YOU SAID SOMEONE ELSE IS COUNTING .
YEAH .
SO IT MAKES IT EASIER FOR ME .
UHHUH .
AND SOMEONE ELSE IS TELLING ME OKAY YOU KNOW LET S MOVE THIS WAY LET S MOVE THAT WAY .
UHHUH UHHUH .
INSTEAD OF ME HAVING TO THINK ABOUT IT SO MUCH .
RIGHT .
YOU CAN JUST TRUST SOMEONE ELSE TO GIVE YOU FULL EXERCISE AND ALL .
YOU DO IS FOLLOW ALONG AND ENJOY YOURSELF .
YEAH YEAH .
BUT I M LIKE YOU I ALSO UM LIKE TO PARTICIPATE IN UH THINGS LIKE WELL WE JUST WENT TO THE UH MYERERSON SYMPHONY RUN .
THIS PAST WEEKEND AND AND THAT WAS A LOT OF FUN AND YOU GET TO MEET DIFFERENT PEOPLE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND UM JUST GET OUT YOU KNOW .
UHHUH UHHUH .
OUT AND ABOUT AND IT S IT IT S SOMETHING .
YOU CAN ALL LIKE OUR WE DID IT AS A FAMILY SO .
UHHUH .
IT WAS IT WAS QUITE A LOT OF FUN .
UHHUH .
AND BIKING AND I I I LOVE TO SWIM SO I LOVE IT WHEN YOU KNOW IT S SWIMMING WEATHER .
UM .
AND UH .
WELL YOU RE TALKING TO SOMEONE FROM CALIFORNIA WHERE IT S OFTEN SWIMMING WEATHER .
OH I DID NT REALIZE THAT .
UH .
I M SORRY .
WELL I M IN TEXAS .
I I JUST ASSUMED THAT I HAD THIS IS THE FIRST CALL .
I VE DONE .
UHHUH .
AND I DID NT REALIZE THAT THEY HA WERE GOING TO REACH OUT TO PEOPLE FROM .
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY .
YOU WOULD NT KNOW THAT .
OH I .
SO IT S THE IT S IT S THE THE ACT WELL IT S ACTUALLY IT S INTERESTING BECAUSE THERE ARE RE REAL REGIONAL DIFFERENCES .
UM IN CALIFORNIA THERE .
S UH ALMOST AN ASSUMPTION .
UM UNLESS YOU RE SORT OF CLEARLY OF AN OLDER GENERATION OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW IN YOUR SIXTIES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I M I M I M NOT .
UH THERE S AN ASSUMPTION THAT YOU DO SOMETHING FOR YOUR PHYSICAL FITNESS AND AND AT LEAST IN URBAN CALIFORNIA .
AND MAYBE NOT I DO NT KNOW ABOUT RURAL CALIFORNIA TOO WELL .
BUT IN URBAN CALIFORNIA .
IT S JUST YOU KNOW FOR ALL .
I KNOW AEROBICS STARTED OUT HERE .
I DO NT KNOW WHERE THEY ACTUALLY STARTED BUT THEY YOU KNOW THE CRAZE REALLY PICKED UP BIG HERE AND BEFORE THAT THERE WAS THE RUNNING CRAZE .
AND THEY CALIFORNIA GETS YOU KNOW TENDS TO BE A BIT FADDISH BUT .
UHHUH .
THE REMARKABLE THING IS HOW WELL THE FADS CATCH ON ELSEWHERE .
SO THERE MUST BE SOMETHING TO SOME OF THEM .
AND UH .
WELL I THINK PEOPLE ARE ARE MORE INC UM UM PEOPLE FROM CALIFORNIA SEEM TO BE MORE HEALTH MOTIVATED ALL AROUND .
I MEAN AS FAR AS THE DIET AND EVERYTHING .
UH THE DIET AND UH JUST YOUR HEALTH CONSCIOUSNESS AND I MEAN IT JUST .
UHHUH .
SEEMS LIKE UH A LOT OF THOSE IDEAS GENERATE OUT OF CALIFORNIA .
NOT JUST EXERCISE BUT .
YEAH .
HEALTH HEALTH RELATED IDEAS .
AND I IT S CURIOUS I DO NT KNOW WHY DO NT KNOW IF IT S DO YOU DOES CALIFORNIA HAVE A .
WELL THERE S A SENSE OF IT BEING A PACKAGE .
I THINK .
THERE THERE IS A SENSE OF YOU KNOW WHOLE THERE S A LOT OF YOU KNOW YOU LL GET ORGANIZATIONS LIKE INSTITUTES FOR THE WHOLE HEALTH OR WHATEVER .
AND UH OH THE THE THE UNI UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT BERKELEY PUTS OUT THE WELLNESS LETTER .
WHICH IS UH TURNED INTO A FAIRLY WELL SUBSCRIBED TO UH NEWSLETTER .
UHHUH .
MONTHLY OR BIWEEKLY NEWSLETTER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND AND IT DOES NT DEAL WITH JUST EXERCISE OR JUST STRESS MANAGEMENT OR JUST DIET OR ANYTHING .
IT IT S ON FAIRLY SO SOLID SCIENTIFIC GROUND .
UH IT S JUST DISPENSED WITH THESE DISTINCTIONS .
IT SAYS EVER ALL SORTS OF FACTORS GO INTO HEALTH AND THERE S NO REASON TO TALK ABOUT ONE RATHER THAN ANOTHER SO THAT THEY THEY COMBINED THEM ALL TOGETHER .
AND UH SO IT S HAD THAT ORIENTATION FOR QUITE SOME TIME .
UM THERE S BEEN SOME PROGRESSIVE MEDICAL SCHOOLS OUT HERE .
UHHUH .
THAT HAVE TAKEN THAT APPROACH .
AND UM .
NOW DO YOU THINK THAT S BECAUSE THEY VE REALIZED THAT FOR WHOLE HEALTH THAT THE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT COMBINATION OR THAT PEOPLE ARE MOTIVATED THAT WAY SO THAT THEY VE INCORPORATED THAT INTO THEIR PROGRAM .
BOY .
DO YOU THINK THE PROGRAM CAME FIRST OR THE .
YEAH THAT THERE S A I I CAN SAY THERE S A CORRELATION BUT I COULD NT SAY WHICH WHICH CAUSED THE OTHER .
THEY SORT OF DEV YOU KNOW EACH DEVELOPED A LITTLE BIT AND THEN WOULD FEED OFF ONE ANOTHER AND DEVELOP A LITTLE BIT MORE AND A LITTLE BIT MORE .
YEAH THE MORE MONEY .
THEY PUT INTO IT .
YEAH .
AND .
I CAN SEE THAT .
AND CAUSE I KNOWING FROM INSTITUTES OF LEARNING LIKE THAT I KNOW THAT THEY VE GOT TO GET THEIR MONEY SOMEWHERE AND SOMEBODY .
S GOT TO BE WILLING TO PAY FOR IT AND BELIEVE IN IT SO .
YEAH YEAH .
EXACTLY .
AND PART OF IT IS CALIFORNIA .
YOU KNOW IN BACK IN THE SIXTIES HAD A LOT OF ALTERNATIVE MOVEMENTS AND SOME OF THEM FIZZLED OUT AND SOME OF THEM WERE DISASTROUS AND OTHERS OF THEM UM HAD AN IMPACT ON THE SOCIETY AROUND HERE .
AND ONE OF THE ONES .
THAT HAD AN IMPACT WAS UH PEOPLE BECOMING INTERESTED IN ALTERNATE PRACTICES I M NOT SURE IF IT WAS A MEDITATION PRACTICE OR IF IT WAS YOU KNOW WHICH IS SIMILAR TO A STRESS MANAGEMENT PRACTICE OR ALTERNATES TO UH A M .
A APPROVED MEDICINE .
UH YOU HAVE YOU KNOW MAJOR UM ACUPUNCTURE SCHOOLS AND THINGS OUT HERE .
AND AND YOU COULD HAVE THEM AROUND LONG ENOUGH AND MORE AND MORE PEOPLE START BELIEVING THEM OR WONDERING HOW TO COMBINE THEM WITH OTHER THINGS .
UHHUH .
AND BEFORE LONG YOU YOU GET THIS THIS WHOLE KIND OF GESTALT THIS WHOLE PACKAGE OF OF HEALTH OF HEALTH CARE AND OPTIONS .
UHHUH .
AND UH AND EXERCISE IS IS STRONGLY CONSIDERED ONE OF THEM .
THE IRONY IS IS ITS PEOPLE IN THE CITIES IN MY EXPERIENCE THAT ARE MOST ORIENTED TOWARDS DOING THE EXERCISE .
AND I GUESS BECAUSE THEY SPEND ALL DAY IN BACK OF THEIR DESKS .
THE AVERAGE PERSON OUT ON THE FARM AT LEAST TRADITIONALLY NOW THEY DRIVE FANCY TRACTORS AS MUCH AS ANYTHING .
YEAH .
BUT AT LEAST TRADITIONALLY THE LABORERS LAST THING .
OR THEY RE OLDER .
PARDON ME .
WELL DO NT YOU THINK THEY TEND TO BE OLDER IN THE RURAL AR .
I I SOMETIMES THINK THAT IT S ALMOST FRANTIC EFFORT ON THE PART OF THE PEOPLE IN THE CITY .
OH LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE .
I LIVE IN A RURAL AREA SO .
YEAH YEAH .

GO AHEAD .
UM WE JUST GOT THE THE DOG LESS THAN A YEAR AGO SO HE S STILL A PUPPY .
OH WHAT KIND IS IT .
HE S A MIXED BREED HE S PART COLLIE PART SHEPHERD AND PART CHOW .
OH SO YOU MUMBLEX .
MORE COLLIE AND SHEPHERD THAN CHOW THE ONLY CHOW .
HE .
S GOT IS IS HIS TONGUE .
OH HE S GOT A BLUE TONGUE .
YEAH .
OH .
HE .
S GOT LITTLE SPOTS ON THEM .
WE HAVE TWO CHOWS AND A MINIATURE SCHNAUZER AND RECENTLY ADDED A GUINEA PIG WHICH WAS NT BY MY CHOICE BUT I WAS OUT RULED SO BUT THE DOGS ARE MAINLY MINE AND MY HUSB BUT I JUST LOVE THEM TO DEATH .
WAS THE GUINEA PIG FOR YOUR .
DAUGHTER YES .
FOR YOUR CHILD .
YES AS IF THE DOGS WERE NT ENOUGH HAD TO HAVE A GUINEA PIG SO ANYWAY SHE S SHE ENJOYS HER THOUGH SO THAT S THAT S WHAT MATTERS .
BUT UM OUR CHOWS WE VE HAD THEM I D SAY RIGHT AROUND SIX MAYBE SEVEN YEARS AND .
REALLY .
THEY RE UM REGISTERED AND WE VE BEEN BREEDING THEM .
SHE .
S HAD ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE LITTERS .
OH MY MY HUSBAND S ALWAYS WANTED A CHOW BUT I M KIND OF CONCERNED ABOUT UM WITH HAVING CATS .
OH .
AND HOW HOW THEY SOCIALIZE WITH CATS .
UM WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE GOT A MIXED BREED .
RIGHT .
UM BECAUSE WE THOUGHT THEY WOULD SOCIALIZE EASIER .
UHHUH .
UM MY HUSBAND HAD ORIGINALLY WANTED AN MUMBLEX AND HIS BROTHER HAS AN MUMBLEX AND HE SO FAR HE S BITTEN TEN PEOPLE .
OH MAN .
SO .
GOODNESS .
AND THE PEOPLE THAT HE GOT THE MUMBLEX FROM USED TO HAVE CATS AND THEY NO LONGER HAVE ANY OTHER CATS .
SO .
IT S TELLING UM YOU KNOW WHEN WE HAD UM WE HAD A CAT WHEN WE FIRST MARRIED NO TOOK YEAH WE HAD THE CAT FIRST AND THEN WE GOT UH THE CHOW .
AND BRING UM BRINGING THEM IN AS PUPPIES THEY GOT ALONG JUST FABULOUS WITH HER .
UHHUH .
AND UH YOU WOULD THINK YOU KNOW THAT THEY WERE ALL DOGS .
THE WAY .
SHE WOULD PRANCE AROUND THEM AND AND PAW AT THEIR FACE AND THEY D JUST PLAY AND THEY WERE NEVER THEY NEVER HARMED HER .
SO UH THEY GOT ALONG GREAT NOW I DO NT KNOW HOW HOW IT WOULD BE BRINGING IN UH LIKE CAT TO A FULL FULL GROWN DOG .
YEAH I WOULD NT WANT TO BRING A CAT INTO A FULL GROWN DOG .
YEAH .
BUT I I WOULD NT FEEL UM HESITANT ABOUT BRINGING A PUPPY IN .
RIGHT .
TO ADULT CATS I THINK THEY WOULD SOCIALIZE EASIER .
I THINK SO TOO .
UM HOW HOW OLD IS YOUR CHILD .
FIVE .
FIVE .
SHE S A REAL MUMBLEX .
SO YOU HAD THE DOGS BEFORE YOU HAD THE BABY .
RIGHT .
AND I WAS NOT REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT UM THEM HARMING HER UH I THINK I THINK A LOT OF THAT THAT THAT WE HEAR ALL THE TIME IS HOW YOU BRING THEM UP .
UHHUH .
AND OURS ARE REAL FRIENDLY THEY RE PROTECTIVE BUT THEY RE VERY FRIENDLY AND LOVABLE .
UHHUH .
I MEAN YOU THINK THEY RE LAPDOGS .
YOU KNOW THEY LL JUST COME JUMP ON YOUR LAP AND WANT TO BE HAVE THEIR BELLIES RUBBED AND EVERYTHING AND .
WHAT COLOR ARE THEY .
UH THE FEMALE S RED AND THE MALE IS BLACK .
OH I BET THE BLACK ONE S PRETTY .
YEAH HE IS HE S A BIG OLD THING .
AND UM I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE FEMALE MAINLY AND AS LUCK HAD IT UH SHE HAD PUPPIES .
THE SAME WEEK MY DAUGHTER WAS BORN SO IT WAS KIND OF LIKE SHE HAD HER BABIES AND UNDERSTOOD ABOUT YOU KNOW .
ABOUT YOUR BABY .
YEAH AND THAT YEAH I THINK THAT REALLY HELPED AND UM MY DAUGHTER YOU KNOW SINCE SINCE SHE S LITTLE HAS BEEN PLAYING WITH THEM AND THEY LET HER TUG THEIR HAIR AND AND GET ON THEIR BACK OR WHATEVER AND SHE S SHE S GROWN UP WITH THEM AND LOVES THEM TO DEATH AND THEY LOVE HER SO .
YEAH I THINK IT S GOOD FOR KIDS TO GROW UP AROUND PETS .
I DO TOO .
AS AS LONG AS THEY DO NT HAVE ANY ALLERGIES TO THEM OR ANYTHING .
YEAH .
BUT I THINK IT REALLY HELPS THEM TO UNDERSTAND WHEN WHEN THEY GO TO OTHER PEOPLE S HOUSES AND THEY HAVE PETS I SEE SO MANY TIMES KIDS JUST YOU KNOW THEY MEAN TO ANIMALS NOT REALLY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE ANIMALS HAVE FEELINGS .
YEAH EXACTLY THAT OR OR UH THE OTHER EXTREME THEY RE THEY RE TERRIFIED OF THEM AND I HATE THAT .
YEAH YEAH .
AND THEY SHOULD NT BE I MEAN SOME MAYBE BUT BUT UM LIKE OUR MINIATURE SCHNAUZER SHE S JUST SHE S JUST LIKE UM A LITTLE HYPER THING AND JUST PRANCES AROUND AND JUMPS ALL OVER EVERYBODY ACTING SILLY AND A LOT OF KIDS ARE SCARED OF THAT .
AND WHICH .
I UNDERSTAND BECAUSE SHE IS YOU KNOW A LOT OF MOVEMENT AND EVERYTHING BUT WHEN SHE CALMS DOWN THEY RE SO SCARED OF HER .
IT S .
HUH .
IT THAT BOTHERS ME BECAUSE SHE S THE FRIENDLIEST THING SHE WOULD NT HI YOU KNOW HARM THEM AT ALL AND AND AND THAT S MAINLY PEOPLE .
THAT HAVE NEVER HAD PETS AROUND THEIR CHILDREN SO I THINK I THINK IT S A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE THEM .
WE VE HAD UM IN THE PAST WE VE HAD BIRDS TOO UH LIKE COCKATOOS .

OKAY UM I THINK THAT IN THIS DAY AND AGE EVERYONE NEEDS TO HAVE SOME SORT OF EXPOSURE TO COMMUNITY SERVICE BECAUSE IT IT SEEMS LIKE AND I M I M THINKING OF THE COM OF COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE THAT ARE IN JAIL NOW I THINK THAT MAYBE IF IF IF SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE HAD GOTTEN EXPOSED TO THE COMMUNITY GOTTEN EXPOSED TO WORKING WITH OTHER PEOPLE THAT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY DID THEY WOULD NOT HAVE DONE BECAUSE THEY THEY UNDERSTAND PEOPLE MORE THEY UNDERSTAND HELPING PEOPLE MORE THEY UNDERSTAND THE PLIGHT OF PEOPLE .
THAT S TRUE UHHUH .
UHHUH .
I AGREE WITH YOU IN THE SENSE THAT UH I THINK THAT IT S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO UH ALSO SHARE GIVE SOMETHING OF THEMSELVES .
RIGHT .
AND UH I THINK THAT THERE S TOO MUCH IN THE IN IN A WAY OF SELFGRATIFICATION TODAY .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND THERE S NOT ENOUGH SHARING .
UHHUH I WOULD THINK THAT FOR LIKE PEOPLE THAT ARE JUST FILTHY FILTHY RICH .
UHHUH .
I THINK THAT THEY WOULD BENEFIT ALSO IN DOING COMMUNITY SERVICE SO THAT THEY CAN SEE AND I M I M SPEAKING ABOUT PEOPLE THAT ARE LIKE BORN RICH .
YEAH .
AND THAT S ALL THEY KNOW .
YEAH .
AND I M THINKING THAT COMMUNITY SERVICE WOULD HELP THEM UH JUST GET A FEEL OF WHAT ELSE IS OUT THERE HOW OTHER PEOPLE ARE LIVING YOU KNOW IF THEY WERE TO WORK IN IN A A I DO NT KNOW A SOUP KITCHEN OR SOMETHING .
YEAH .
THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND HOW OTHER PEOPLE LIVE AND .
UHHUH .
UH YOU KNOW ON THE SAME NOTE IF POOR IF POORER PEOPLE UH ARE WORKING TO TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY I DO NT KNOW THEY PROBABLY HAVE A BETTER PERSPECTIVE OF OF INJUST LIFE ITSELF .
YEAH AND I THINK THE PEACE CORPS IS GREAT TOO .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE UH IT YOU GO TO DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND YOU SEE UH IN FACT I SAW AN INTERVIEW ON T V THE OTHER NIGHT WITH UH PATRICK SWAYZE .
UHHUH .
AND HE S MAKING A MOVIE IN I THINK IT S UH CALCUTTA OR EITHER INDIA .
UHHUH .
SOMEWHERE WHERE IT S IT S A VERY POOR POOR COUNTRY .

UHHUH .
UH .
DEMEANOR YEAH UHHUH .

RIGHT .
THEY DWELL ON WHAT THEY DO HAVE AND THEY RE HAPPY WITH EACH OTHER TYPE OF THING .
THAT S GREAT .
HE SAID THAT OUT HERE HE SAID THAT WHEN HE COMES BACK HE KNOWS THAT IT IT S JU COMPLETELY CHANGED HIS LIFE .
UHHUH AND I I THINK THAT THAT YOU KNOW THIS ON THE SAME NOTE BEING HE WAS EXPOSED TO THAT AND MAYBE HE WAS NT BEFORE .
RIGHT .
AND NOW HE SEES .
EXACTLY .
AND I THINK THAT ANYBODY THAT WORKS IN THE IN SOME KIND OF SERVICE OR FOR THE COMMUNITY OR SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
THEY CAN SEE YOU KNOW YOU DO NT SEE WHAT YOU DO NT YOU CA NT KNOW WHAT YOU DO NT SEE .
EXACTLY RIGHT .
YOU KNOW SO AND YOU HAVE TO EXPERIENCE SOME THINGS YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW THAT PEOPLE THAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE POOR BUT YOU .
YEAH .
THEY DO NT KNOW WHAT POOR IS .
RIGHT .
UNLESS THEY ACTUALLY SEE IT AND YOU KNOW HELP OR SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
UHHUH .
WELL I I KNOW THAT IT THAT MUST BE TRUE ESPECIALLY IF YOU DO SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF UH YOU KNOW HELPING THEM LEARN HOW TO SURVIVE HOW TO PLANT .
UHHUH .
HOW TO FIND WATER AND I VE SEEN SO MANY .
UHHUH .
UH EXTRAORDINARY THINGS ON T V .
UHHUH .
THAT PEOPLE HAVE DONE WORKING IN THE PEACE CORPS AND HOW YOU KNOW UH THE PEOPLE OF THE COMMUNITY THEY WORKED IN IS SO MUCH BETTER .
UHHUH .
IT S LIKE ONE PERSON CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE .
RIGHT .
AND I I REALLY BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN IN SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
THERE S SOMETHING I I VE REALLY BE SKEPTICAL OF YOU KNOW YOU WATCH TELEVISION YOU LL SEE THE SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT FOR CHILDREN IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND .
UHHUH .
IF YOU WANT TO SEND LIKE YOU KNOW FIFTY CENTS A DAY .

OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND YOU CAN HELP A CHILD .

I KNOW AND HOW DO YO .
AND THINGS GOING ON YOU KNOW I WOULD LOVE TO HELP SOMEBODY YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
BUT I JUST I CA NT BRING MYSELF TO TRUST THIS .
RIGHT .
THIS COMPANY WHO IS TRYING TO DO THIS OR WHATEVER IT IS YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE OR SO I DO NT KNOW JUST TODAY PEOPLE ARE JUST SO MONEY HUNGRY .
I KNOW .
THAT I THINK THEY WOULD DO ANYTHING .
IT S TRUE IT REALLY IS .
AND SO YOU DO NT KNOW WHAT THEY .
IT S THE SAD LIFE I THINK TODAY .
UHHUH .
IT S UH IT S IT S NOT LIKE IT USED TO BE EVEN IN IN THE YEARS OF MY GROWING UP .
UHHUH .
I MEAN I M FIFTYTHREE YEARS OLD .
UHHUH .
AND I HAVE SEEN A TOWN CHANGE FROM A TOWN TO A CITY AND ITS .
UHHUH .
UH PEOPLE YOU KNOW GROW FROM A SMALL TOWN TO A LARGE TOWN .
UHHUH .
AND YOU WOULD THINK THAT MORE PEOPLE WOULD BE BETTER YOU KNOW SHARE MORE .
UHHUH .
DO MORE YOU KNOW BE MORE COMMUNITY ORIENTED AND ALL .
UHHUH .
BUT IF THEY JUST GET MORE UH UNTO THEMSELVES KIND OF .
MORE SELFCENTERED UHHUH .
RIGHT AND AND IT S NOT THE SHARING OF .
UHHUH .
UH A NEIGHBOR TO A NEIGHBOR .
UHHUH .
AND WE WOULD GO OUT AND NOT EVEN LOCK OUR DOORS .
UHHUH .
AND NOT EVEN WORRY ABOUT IT .
BUT YOU CA NT DO THAT TODAY .
BUT TODAY I MEAN YOU KNOW IT S LIKE YOU WOULD NT EVEN THINK OF DOING THAT .
UHHUH .
IF YOU DO NT HAVE BARS ON THE WINDOW YOU RE NOT EVEN SAFE YOU KNOW .
YEAH EVEN WHEN WHEN I FIRST MOVED TO DALLAS FROM NEW YORK IT SEEMED LIKE DALLAS WAS SO OPEN YOU KNOW EVERYBODY LEFT THEIR .
UHHUH .
DOORS OPEN YOU JUST RUN .
YEAH .
IN THE STORE YOU LEAVE YOUR CAR RUNNING .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW AND THIS WAS ONLY UH WELL I GUESS IT HAS BEEN AWHILE IT S BEEN ALMOST TEN YEARS SINCE I MOVED HERE .
YEAH .
AND IT S AMAZING NOW HOW MUCH IT S CHANGED I MEAN I DO NT GO OUT I DO NT GO .
IN DALLAS I .
OUTSIDE AT NIGHT YOU KNOW .
I WAS GOING TO SAY CAUSE I I HEARD I IN FACT I WAS TALKING TO SOMEONE FROM DALLAS UH JUST LAST WEEK AND THEY WAS SAYING THAT UH IN FACT IT WAS THIS ONE GIRL PARTICULARLY THAT WORKED FOR T I .
UHHUH .
AND SHE HAD GONE OVERSEAS TO TOKYO .
UHHUH .
AND SHE ASKED THEM THERE IF THERE WAS SOME ANYWHERE THAT SHE SHOULD NT GO BECAUSE SHE WAS ALONE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW BEING A GIRL FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY .
UHHUH .
AND EVERYTHING AND SHE SAID THEY THOUGHT FOR A FEW SECONDS AND THEY SAID UH NO THERE S NOWHERE THAT YOU CAN GO THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE AFRAID .
UHHUH .
THEY SAID TO HER THAT EVEN IF SHE LEFT HER PURSE ON THE SUBWAY OKAY .
UHHUH .
THAT SHE WOULD HAVE THAT PURSE RETURNED TO HER THIS IS HOW CONFIDENT THEY WERE .
WOW .
OKAY WITH NOTHING MISSING .
WOW .
OKAY THIS IS A FOREIGN COUNTRY .
UHHUH .
AND YOU WOULD THINK YOU KNOW UH BEING UH AN AMERICAN OR WHATEVER .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW A FOREIGNER THERE THAT .
UHHUH .
THAT WOULD BE ALL THE MORE REASON THAT THEY D TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU .
OH GOD THAT WOULD BE THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF HERE .
OKAY .
I MEAN IF YOU LEAVE SOMETHING ANYWHERE YOU MIGHT AS WELL FORGET IT .
AND SHE TOLD ME SHE SAID SHE COULD TELL THEM FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES PLACES NOT TO GO IN .
UHHUH .
IN AND AROUND DALLAS .
UHHUH .
AND THAT S WHERE SHE WAS FROM .
UHHUH THAT IS SAD .
SHE SAID EVEN CHOOSING HER APARTMENT SHE HAD TO BE SO CAREFUL BECAUSE OF BEING A WOMAN ALONE .
YEAH YEAH THAT S .
YOU KNOW SHE HAD THERE ARE CERTAIN .
A BIG THAT S A BIG THING WITH ME I LIVE IN A ONE BEDROOM I M SINGLE .
UHHUH .
AND I VE I COULD LIVE IN AN APARTMENT I LIVE IN WACO OKAY .
OH YEAH .
AND YOU EITHER LIVE IN REALLY LOW PRICED HOUSING OR YOU LIVE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN IN THE HIGH PRICE APARTMENTS .
YEAH .
AND I LIVE I DO NT MAKE A LOT OF MONEY BUT I LIVE IN THE HIGH PRICE APARTMENTS SIMPLY BECAUSE I FEEL SAFE HERE .
YEAH .
AND I PAY I M PAYING PROBABLY THE HUNDRED OR HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS MORE THAN I WOULD BE PAYING SOMEWHERE ELSE BUT I WOULD NT BE ABLE TO SLEEP AT NIGHT .
YEAH .
AND THAT TO ME IS WORTH THE EXTRA MONEY .
YEAH .
FOR ME TO BE YOU KNOW I FEEL VERY SAFE WHERE I AM YOU KNOW INSTEAD OF .
AND THAT THAT S WHY I THINK IF PEOPLE WERE MORE EXPOSED TO UH .
UHHUH .
ESPECIALLY UH YOUNG KIDS GETTING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
I MEAN AT ONE TIME THEY WOULD GO INTO THE SERVICE .
UHHUH .
TO HAVE THE SAME EXPOSURE AND YOU KNOW UH TO FURTHER THEIR WORLDLINESS SO TO SPEAK .
RIGHT .
AND GO TO SEE UH FOREIGN COUNTRIES THAT THEY WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO SEE .
UHHUH .
IT WAS LIKE THEY SAID JOIN THE NAVY TO SEE THE WORLD TYPE OF THING YOU KNOW .
RIGHT RIGHT .
BUT NOWADAYS THEY DO NT DO THAT ANYMORE .
HUHUH .
IT S NOT A A THING A A LOT OF YOUNG MEN DO NT EVEN UH HAVE THE DESIRE TO GO INTO THE SERVICE .
YEAH THEY DO NT EVEN CONSIDER IT .
OR TO UH YOU KNOW DO SOMETHING FOR SOMEONE ELSE .
UHHUH .
AND I DO NT KNOW I ATTRIBUTED I THINK A LOT OF THAT TO WOMEN WORKING .
TO .
YOU KNOW TO MOTHERS NOT BEING AT HOME .
YES YES I WAS TALKING TO SOMEONE YESTERDAY ABOUT THAT .
THE BONDING PROCESS YEAH .
AND WE WERE SAYING THAT THE BASIC UH THE THE BASIC FAMILY IS IS DISRUPTED THESE DAYS .
IT VERY DEFINITELY IS .
AND SO I THINK YOU KNOW BEFORE THE FATHER WOULD WORK AND THE MOTHER YOU KNOW WOULD STAY HOME AND HAVING THAT MOTHER THERE THAT BASE I THINK .
THAT S RIGHT .
WAS A BIG PART OF OF FAMILY A BIG PART OF OF WHAT YOU KNOW YOUR YOUR UH YOUNGSTERS THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT THEY DID .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
AND THE THING IS LIKE I THINK A MAN CAN AFFORD TO SUPPORT A WOMAN BUT THE WOMAN AFFORDS THE LUXURIES .
UHHUH .
IN IN OTHER WORDS LIKE ANYONE CAN LIVE .
UHHUH .
ON A CERTAIN INCOME NO MATTER WHAT IT IS .
RIGHT .
YOU HAVE TO .
RIGHT .
SO TO SPEAK OKAY IT IT S WHAT S IMPORTANT TO YOU .
UHHUH .
NOW A FAMILY I I THINK THAT LIKE GIRLS TODAY HAVE CHILDREN .
UHHUH .
AND SIX WEEKS LATER THEY RE BACK TO WORK .
RIGHT .
THEY DO NT EVEN HAVE A BONDING WITH THAT CHILD THEY .
UHHUH .
DO NT EVE EVER SEE THE IT S IT S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING THAT HAPPENS BETWEEN A MOTHER AND A CHILD .
UHHUH .
THE FIRST LIKE SAY SIX .
UHHUH .
YEARS OF LIFE SO MUCH .
WHEN I CALL .
HAPPENS IN THAT PERIOD OF TIME .
UHHUH .
AND I MEAN ONCE THE CHILD S IN SCHOOL IF YOU HAD A JOB FROM SAY NINE TO THREE .
UHHUH .
BIG DEAL I MEAN THEY THEY RE IN SCHOOL YOU RE AT WORK .
RIGHT .
THAT S GREAT BUT IT S KIDS THAT COME HOME AND DO NT HAVE A MOTHER THERE .
RIGHT .
OR THE KIDS ARE AT HOME IN THE MORNING AND .
WELL I WONDERED IF I WAS GOING TO GET TO TALK TO A MALE OR A FEMALE ON THIS TYPE .
HAVE YOU BEEN TALKING TO MALES .
YEAH YEAH THIS IS THIS IS PROBABLY MORE INTERESTING IF IT HAD BEEN A MALE AND A FEMALE .
I WAS AFRAID WE MIGHT GET INTO AN ARGUMENT .
RIGHT .
WELL UH I GUESS UH THERE HAVE BEEN CERTAINLY A LOT OF CHANGES IN THE LAST COUPLE OF GENERATIONS .
UHHUH .
FOR UH THE ROLES OF WOMEN AND UH I GUESS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROBABLY IS THAT SO MANY ARE WORKING NOW .
RIGHT .
AND TRYING TO JUGGLE JOB AND HOME AND FAMILY AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER POSSIBILITIES YOU KNOW THEY MAY BE GOING TO SCHOOL OR MAY HAVE ELDERLY PARENTS OR YOU KNOW ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS .
YEAH IT IT SEEMS TOO ME LIKE THOUGH THAT WOMEN S ROLES ARE CHANGING FASTER THAN THE MEN AND THEREFORE THE WOMEN ARE SPREADING THEMSELVES .
THINNER .
OH I THINK SO .
THAN BEFORE .
ABSOLUTELY .
I I I THINK IT S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO KEEP UP WITH ALL THAT WE HAVE TO THESE DAYS .
UHHUH .
SOMETIMES I THINK I AM GOING CRAZY TRYING TO DO IT BUT .
DO YOU WORK OUTSIDE THE HOME .
YES .
DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN .
UH YES .
THEY ARE GETTING OLDER NOW .
UHHUH .
SO THEY ARE NOT QUITE AS MUCH OF A RESPONSIBILITY BUT THEY ARE STILL THERE YOU KNOW .
OH SURE .
THEY STILL TAKE TIME AND AND I YOU KNOW I STILL PROVIDE MOST OF THE THINGS .
THAT GO ON AROUND THE HOUSE .
RIGHT .
SO UH YEAH AND FOR A WHILE .
I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL TOO AND THA IT WAS TOUGH .
YEAH I UH I THINK THAT WHILE IT S A GOOD CHANGE FOR I THINK WOMEN TO BE ABLE TO FULFILL THEIR POTENTIAL IN WHATEVER .
THEY FEEL YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
THEIR EXPERTISE MAY BE .
UHHUH .
UH I THINK SOMETIMES OTHER THINGS SUFFER AND THA I THINK IT S HARD TO FIND A BALANCE THERE .
BUT IN SOME WAYS I THINK WE ARE EXPECTED TO DO IT .
ALL .
YOU RE ALMOST LOOKED DOWN UPON IF YOU DO NT TRY TO DO ALL OF THESE THINGS AND .
RIGHT .
THAT S WHERE THE PROBLEM IS REALLY .
YEAH YEAH I HAVE LITTLE CHILDREN FOUR AND ONE AND I DECIDED THAT IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME TO STAY HOME .
UHHUH .
UH AND WHEN I I I HAPPEN TO YOU KNOW BE I M VERY ACTIVE WITH UH PEOPLE OTHER PEOPLE WITH CHILDREN MY AGE AND MOST OF US DO TEND TO STAY HOME BUT WHEN I RUN INTO PEOPLE .
THAT YOU KNOW JUST HAVE RECENTLY HAD BABIES OR HAVE VERY YOUNG CHILDREN AND ARE WORKING FULL TIME I THERE S ALMOST A UH FRICTION BETWEEN US .
UHHUH .
UHHUH NOT PEOPLE .
THAT ARE YOU KNOW NECESSARILY GOOD FRIENDS .
YEAH .
EVEN THOUGH THAT HAS HAPPENED TOO UH IT S ALMOST AS THOUGH IT PUTS YOU ON DIFFERENT SIDES OF A FENCE .
YOU KNOW W IF YOU DECIDE TO GO BACK TO WORK THEN YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE ALWAYS HAVING TO DEFEND YOURSELF .
RIGHT .
AND IF YOU DO NT THEN SOMETIMES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU RE LOOKED DOWN UPON BY PEOPLE .
THAT GO BACK TO WORK AND SO YOU RE JUST WASTING YOUR TIME .
YEAH .
AT HOME .
YEAH IT S A TOUGH ONE .
I MEAN I VE DONE SOME OF BOTH .
UHHUH .
I WHEN MY KIDS WERE REAL LITTLE I WAS AT HOME FOR A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT PERIODS OF TIME .
UHHUH .
OH I THINK THE LONGEST WAS LESS THAN A YEAR BUT STILL AT LEAST I WAS ABLE TO TO SPEND YOU KNOW THOSE FIRST MONTHS WITH THEM .
RIGHT .
BUT UH I MOSTLY WENT BACK TO WORK BECAUSE I WAS TIRED OF DOING WITHOUT THINGS .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW THE MONEY WAS THE ISSUE .
BUT UH EVEN NOW I WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO NOT HAVE TO WORK IN SOME WAYS .
RIGHT .
IT IT S KIND OF PULL AND TUG .
YEAH .
ON THE OTHER HAND I CA NT IMAGINE JUST BEING AT HOME UH ALTHOUGH I HAVE A LOT OF INTERESTS AND A LOT OF THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO PURSUE .
UHHUH .
UH STILL UH THERE S THERE S SORT OF A FEELING OF ACCOMPLISHMENT WITH HAVING YOU KNOW A JOB AND ALL THAT GOES WITH THAT .
NO THAT THAT S DEFINITELY TRUE .
IN FACT I I WORK OUT OF MY HOME .
UM I M AN ACCOUNTANT .
OH .
AND I DO TAXES AND BOOKKEEPING AND I UH IT WAS IT S A WAY FOR ME TO STAY HOME .
UHHUH .
AND I MEAN I STILL UNFORTUNATELY HAVE TO BE VERY DISCIPLINED IN DOING MY WORK AT FIVE IN THE MORNING AND TEN OCLOCK AT NIGHT .
YEAH .
BUT UH BUT IT IT S WORKED OUT FOR FOR MY FAMILY .
YEAH .
TO HAVE MY CAKE AND EAT IT TOO KIND OF THING .
YEAH THAT S A GOOD DEAL .
WHERE DO YOU THINK THIS IS GOING IN THE FUTURE I MEAN DO YOU THINK THINGS ARE GOING TO CHANGE OR ARE WE GOING TO KEEP HAVING TO TRY TO JUGGLE ALL OF THIS .
WELL I I HOPE THAT THEY WILL CHANGE UH BUT BUT I M I JUST I KNOW IT S GOING TO BE A SLOW CHANGE .
UH I I FEEL AS THOUGH A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING BACK TO JUST HAVING A ONE WAGE EARNER .
I MEAN I M JUST THINKING OF MY CIRCLE OF PEOPLE THAT I KNOW .
I KNOW QUITE A FEW PEOPLE .
WHO HAVE DECIDED TO NOT HAVE BOTH BOTH BOTH UH COUPLES YOU KNOW BOTH UH OF THE PARENTS WORK .

WHO MAY NOT DO IT SEEM TO BE SPENDING MORE TIME WITH THEIR KIDS AND REALLY TRYING HARDER AT MAKING ALL OF THE THE FAMILY THINGS WORK .
RIGHT .
UH BUT I DO NT KNOW IF THEY RE GOING TO EVER GIVE UP THEIR CAREERS YOU KNOW .
IT .
S SORT OF LIKE THEY WENT TO SCHOOL AND THEY WORKED SO HARD TO GET WHERE THEY ARE I DO NT KNOW IF THEY WANT TO COMPLETELY GIVE THAT UP .
RIGHT IT S A VERY PERSONAL THING .
BUT IT WOULD BE NICE IF THERE COULD BE AN INBETWEEN A MIDDLE GROUND SOMEWHERE .
YEAH .
I THINK IT S HARD THOUGH WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT ABOUT FAMILIES AND AND RAISING CHILDREN BECAUSE CH I THINK CHILDREN HAVE A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING A MIDDLE GROUND .
I THINK THEY UH THEY NEED SECURITY AND YET THEY I DO NT KNOW I FROM SPEAKING FROM MY CHILDREN THE THEY ARE NT REAL FLEXIBLE WHEN IT COMES TO THINGS LIKE THAT .
YEAH .
THEY UH THEY WANT TO KNOW THINGS ARE GOING TO BE A CERTAIN WAY .
WELL YEAH I THINK THEY THEY LIKE A ROUTINE OF SORTS .
UHHUH RIGHT .
WELL WE WILL SEE .
I I M HOPING TO SEE MORE FEMALE LEADERSHIP IN OUR SOCIETY .
WELL YES I I LIKE THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW GRADUALLY YOU RE BEGINNING TO SEE WOMEN IN PUBLIC OFFICE AND EXECUTIVE POSITIONS BUT IT S STILL A LONG WAY FROM BEING WHAT .

I TELL YOU WHAT I WOULD NOT I WOULD NOT BUY A CAR THAT HAD THE SEAT BELT WHERE IT WAS HOOKED UNDER THE DOOR .
THAT REALLY SC I I GUESS I THAT THAT A LITTLE MORE THAN SCARED ME THAT IRRITATED ME UH THAT BECAUSE IT IT IT SURELY DID NT COME AS A SURPRISE THAT THAT IF THE DOOR CAME OPEN THE LADY WOULD FALL OUT I MEAN AND .
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT THE AVERAGE PERSON WOULD YOU EVER HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT .
UH .
I MEAN NOW I .
NO PROBABLY WELL .
YOU PROBABLY WOULD NT HAVE .
I MIGHT THE PROBLEM IS I M REALLY INTO CARS AND SO IT S NOT A UH FOR ME IT S IT S A REAL IT S A REAL CONSIDERATION UH UH AND AND UH THE BUT NO I PROBABLY WOULD NT HAVE EVEN THOUGH I M REALLY QUITE INTO CARS IT S .
RIGHT .
IT S PROBABLY MY MAIN HOBBY .
BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS THINK I MEAN I DO NT KNOW MAYBE YOU DO NT BUT JUST LIKE ME I ALWAYS THINK WELL YOU KNOW THESE THINGS MUST BE SAFE BUT THAT S JUST LIKE I DO NT KNOW IF YOU VE HEARD ABOUT IT A FEW YEARS AGO THEY SAID YOU KNOW BEFORE THEY HAD THE LIKE THE SHOULDER STRAP THING WHERE IT WAS JUST LIKE A SEAT BELT THAT GOES ACROSS YOUR WAIST .
YEAH .
ALL THESE PEOPLE WERE AND AND IT IT WAS ON ONE OF THOSE KIND OF SHOWS LIKE TWENTYTWENTY .
UHHUH .
THESE PEOPLE WERE LIKE PARALYZED AND BECAUSE IT THREW THEM FORWARD BUT THEY WERE HOOKED AT THE WAIST AND SO IT LIKE YOU KNOW DID SOMETHING TO THEIR SPINAL CORD .
YEAH .
THEN THEY WERE LIKE PARAPLEGICS .
YEAH YOU KNOW ROAD AND TRACK HAD A HAD SOME ARTICLES ON AND PARTICULARLY WITH WITH BACK SEAT UH WITH SOME WHERE KIDS WERE WERE SITTING IN THE BACK SEAT WITH SEAT BELTS ON AND THEY WERE THROWN FORWARD INTO THE FRONT SEAT AND THERE WAS ENOUGH STRETCHING THE COMBINATION OF STRETCHING THE SPINE TO UH PAR I MEAN THE SERIOUS INJURY EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE THEY WERE STILL LOCKED IN THE .
RIGHT .
THEY WERE FORCED TO GO SO REALLY IF YOUR SITTING IN THE BACK SEAT YOUR BETTER OFF NOT NOT TO HAVE YOUR SEAT BELT ON IF IT S JUST A SEAT BELT .
YEAH .
WE HAVE A VAN THAT UH JUST HAS SEAT BELTS IN THE BACK DOES NT HAVE A SHOULDER HARNESS .
WELL TELL ME ABOUT YOUR VAN DO YOU LIKE IT .
I HAVE AN ARROW STAR VAN WE REALLY DO UH IT S IT S A MINI VAN WE VE HAD IT GOODNESS IN MAY WILL BE FIVE YEARS AND UH THEY REPLACE THE ENGINE AT SIXTY THOUSAND UNDER EXTENDED WARRANTY AND THE TRANSMISSION WAS REPLACED BUT THEY REALLY ARE NIFTY UH THE MINI VAN IT S ACTUALLY WE HAD A STATION WAGON BEFORE AND IT S A FOOT OR TWO SHORTER THAN A WE HAD A REGULAR SIZE STATION WAGON .
UHHUH .
AND IT REALLY UH WE LIKE IT IT THE MUMBLEX INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH ONE OF THE FEATURES WE LIKE ARE THE ELECTRIC LOCKS .
HUH THE REASON THAT WE RE THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT WE TOOK A TRIP IN MY BROTHER IN LAW AND SISTER IN LAWS TO FLORIDA .
UHHUH .
AND LIKE I SAID I MEAN WE RE NOT THAT OLD BUT MY HUSBAND WORKS FOR THE STATE AND AFTER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF YEARS YOU CAN RETIRE AND WHEN HE RETIRES I M RETIRING WELL AS SOON AS I GET MY QUARTERS IN I M .
UHHUH .
RETIRING PERIOD THAT S IT .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW NO MORE .
WELL BUT THE DID YOU .
AS THOUGH .
DID YOU GO TO FLORIDA IN A VAN .
UHHUH AND WE WANTED TO TRAVEL WELL THAT WAS REALLY NICE TRAVELING BUT YOU KNOW I LIKE TO KNOW MORE I MEAN HEAR ABOUT MORE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THINGS LIKE THAT YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
AND SEE WHAT THEY THINK OF THEM THE DIFFERENT KINDS .
YEAH .
BECAUSE I VE ONLY RIDDEN IN THE ONE .
WHAT WHAT KIND WAS IT .
THAT S IT UH SHOOT I CA NT EVEN THINK OF THE NAME OF IT NOW .
WHAT WHAT WAS REMARKABLE THIS VAN EVEN WITH THE WE HAVE TWO KIDS AND WE WENT TO DISNEY WORLD .
UHHUH .
UH ACTUALLY I GREW UP IN ALABAMA AND I WENT TO SEE MY MOTHER AND THEN WENT ON DOWN TO DISNEY WORLD AND IT GOT BETTER THAN I THINK TWENTYTWO TWENTYTHREE MILES A GALLON AND THIS WAS WITH THE AIR CONDITIONER ON AND AND YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
FOUR PEOPLE WITH WITH LUGGAGE AND UH COURSE THIS GRANT IT THAT S YOU KNOW IT S BEEN FOUR YEARS AGO BUT IT S REMARKABLE THAT THE THAT THE BIGGER VANS UH THEY RE UH MY BOSS JUST BOUGHT A A PICK UP TRUCK AND UH HE ONLY GETS SEVENTEEN MILES A GALLON .
YEAH .
BUT IT IT HAS A BIG ENGINE AND IT IT PULLS A BOAT AND STUFF BUT IT S AND IT IT S GOT THE SEATS THAT AND THE OTHER THING THAT IS INTERESTING IS IT HAS UH REAR AIR CONDITIONING .
UHHUH .
AND THAT THAT MAKES A LOT OF DIFFERENCE IN THOSE OF US THAT LIVE IN WARM CLIMATES .
YEAH WELL NOW THIS ONE THAT WE WENT IN IT DID BABY WHAT KIND OF VAN WAS THAT THAT WE WENT TO FLORIDA IN FORD A WHAT FORD A FORD FORD WHAT YOU REMEMBER HE WAS TRYING TO THINK OF WHAT THE NAME OF IT WAS .
WELL THE BIG YOU KNOW THE BIG VANS ARE ALL .
THIS WAS A BIG ONE I MEAN IT WAS A BIG ONE .
REAL NICE YEAH OH THOSE ARE .
IT HAS THE FRONT AND THE BACK AND YOU KNOW IT HAS THE .
YEAH .
UH BACK SEAT LET DOWN INTO A DOUBLE I MEAN A QUEEN SIZE BED .
YEAH .
AND THEN IT HAD THE TWO SWIVELS IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN THE TWO SWIVEL CHAIRS ON THE FRONT .
ALL RIGHT .
AND I MEAN IT WAS FANTASTIC .
UHHUH .
AND IT GOT GOOD GAS MILEAGE BUT I DO NT KNOW I DO NT REALLY I DO NT I WANT SOMETHING I CAN DRIVE TOO YOU KNOW .
WELL .
AND I WAS SCARED TO DRIVE THAT BIG VAN .
WELL THE MINI THAT YOU D BE SURPRISED IF IF YOU DRIVE A ONE OF THE THE MINI VANS UH MUMBLEX MORE OR LESS ALIKE THE THE UH CHEVROLET AND UH WELL OF COURSE OLDSMOBILE HAS GOT ONE AND CHRYSLERS GOT ONE BUT THEY DRIVE REMARKABLY LIKE CARS .
WELL DO YOU DOES YOURS HAVE THAT THIS ONE HAD IT WHERE YOU KNOW YOU WOULD SEE SOMETHING COMING IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR I MEAN NOT THE REAR THOSE LITTLE SIDE MIRROR THINGS .
YEAH .
AND IT WOULD LOOK LIKE IT WAS FURTHER BACK THAN IT WAS .
YEAH BUT THE LITTLE THING ETCHED IN IT SAY OBJECTS ARE ARE CLOSER THAN THEY APPEAR OR SOMETHING .
YEAH DOES YOURS DO THAT TOO .
YEAH .
OH I WAS WONDERING IF ALL VANS DID THAT .
WELL YOU YOU CAN YOU CAN UH INSTALL THOSE MIRRORS WE VE GOT THE BIG SIDE MIRRORS WHICH ARE REALLY NICE I DO NT KNOW IF YOU VE WELL IF YOU VE DRIVEN A PICK UP TRUCK YOU KNOW THESE ARE THESE UH MIRRORS MUST BE SIX INCHES ACROSS NOT NEARLY A FOOT HIGH .
UHHUH .
AND THEY RE REALLY NICE UH GOT THEM ON BOTH SIDES ACTUALLY THEY THEY FOLD SO WHEN YOU GET IN TIGHT SITUATIONS YOU CAN FOLD THEM BACK .
YEAH .
BUT THEY RE .
WELL SEE THAT S THE REASON WE COULD NT MAKE REALLY MAKE THEM AT FIRST WE WERE GOING TO GET A PICK UP TRUCK WITH A CAMPER ON THE BACK OF IT .
UHHUH .
OF IT BUT THEN THAT GAS MILEAGE WAS JUST ATROCIOUS I MEAN IT S .
UHHUH .
UNREAL IT S IT JUST PRACTICALLY DO NT GET ANY .
WELL THEY HAVE GOT SOME OF THE NEWER ONES THEY YOU KNOW WITH THE AERODYNAMIC FEATURES YOU CAN GET PRETTY PRETTY DECENT GAS MILEAGE .
YEAH AND THEN UH HE TALKED ABOUT A VAN AND I SAID WELL YOU KNOW I DO NT KNOW I DO NT KNOW HOW THE GAS IS ON MOST OF THESE AND ANOTHER THING WAS THAT S THE REASON I SAID YOU KNOW THERE WAS SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE YOU KNOW IN A LITTLE ECONOMY CAR BUT I SAID .
UHHUH .
MAYBE WE MIGHT HAVE TO GET US AN ECONOMY CAR TO PULL ALONG .
UHHUH .
WHEN WE WENT SOMEWHERE .
YEAH .
BUT REALLY AND TRULY THE SAFETY FEATURES BUT I WOULD NT GET ONE THAT IF IT HAD THE SEAT BELTS ON THE DOOR NOW .
YEAH .
I WOULD NT GET IT PERIOD .
MUMBLEX FORD NOW ANNOUNCED I THINK IN NINETYTWO THEY RE GOING TO PUT UH AIR BAGS IN THEIR IN THEIR VANS .
OH THAT WOULD BE GOOD .
SO UH AND I THINK I I BELIEVE SAFETY I I I I REALLY DO BELIEVE IN THIS STUFF UH AND I I THINK IT CAN GO MUMBLEX I M NOT THE AIR BAGS ARE A GOOD DEAL BUT UH SURPRISINGLY UH THEY RE UH YOU REALLY NEED TO DO YOU NEED A COMBINATION OF BOTH THE AIR BAGS AND THE UH .
OH I THINK SO TOO .
AND THE SEAT BELTS SO .
I DO NT THINK THEY SHOULD DO AWAY WITH THE SEAT BELTS NOW .
YEAH .
I M BUT I THINK YOU NEED THE SHOULDER THING .
YEAH .
I THINK YOU NEED THE THING AROUND YOUR WAIST BUT I THINK YOU NEED THAT BAG TO POP OUT TOO .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW BECAUSE I KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE HERE THAT HAVE BEEN KILLED IN HEAD ON COLLISIONS WHERE MAYBE IF THEY HAD HAD THAT THAT .
YEAH .
AIR BAG THEY MAY STILL BE WALKING AROUND .
YEAH .
BUT UH I THINK IT S FANTASTIC I WISH THEY REQUIRED IT IN EVERYTHING EVERY NEW CAR THAT CAME OUT I WISH THEY WOULD REQUIRE IT IN IT .
IT WOULD BE MUMBLEX THAT WOULD DO TO OUR INSURANCE RATES YOU KNOW IF IF UH IF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES SAYS IT SAYS WE RE NOT GOING TO PAY YOU KNOW A CLAIM IF IF THE CAR DOES NT HAVE UH AIR BAGS WOULD BE INTERESTING WOULD NT IT .
YEAH .
UH THAT WOULD NT BE FAIR BUT UH .
WELL NO BECAUSE WHAT THEY WOULD DO IS THAT S WHAT THEY RE GOING TO PLAN ON YOU KNOW THEY WOULD HAVE TO DO IT THE INSURANCE COMPANY WOULD HAVE TO DO THE SAME THING THEY RE GIVEN LIKE A TEN YEAR TIME LIMIT .
YEAH .
WHERE OKAY THESE CARS I GUESS THEY FIGURE ALL THE OLD CARS WILL BE OFF THE ROADS OR SOMETHING BY THE IN TEN YEARS .
YEAH .
AND THEN YOU KNOW IF YOU DID NT HAVE A CAR THAT HAD ONE THEN YOUR INSURANCE WOULD GO UP ENORMOUSLY .
UHHUH UHHUH UH I VE GOT TO GO MY SON S IN A PERFORMANCE TONIGHT I HAVE TO LEAVE .
OH THAT S OKAY .
IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES UH I THINK WE VE PROBABLY SPENT A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME .
OKAY .
IT WAS GOOD TALKING TO YOU .
WELL YOU YOU TOO .
OKAY GOOD NIGHT .
ALL RIGHT BYE BYE .
I I I ASSUME YOU HAVE KIDS .
UH WE HAVE ONE .
SHE S ONLY NINE MONTHS OLD .
OH WELL SHE SHE DOES NT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT PUBLIC SCHOOLS YET .
RIGHT .
WELL MY DEGREE IS IN TEACHING SO .
YEAH .
WELL .
MUMBLEX .
WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A BASIS FOR CONVERSATION .
I WAS A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER FOR ABOUT A YEAR .
OH REALLY .
YEAH .
I UH THOUGHT I WANTED TO BE A TEACHER SO BUT BEFORE I WENT THROUGH ALL OF THAT I WANTED TO SEE HOW I WAS GOING TO LIKE IT .
UHHUH .
AND AND THEY UH IN ALABAMA WHERE I CAME FROM THEY THEY ALLOW YOU TO SUBSTITUTE IF YOU GOT A FOUR YEAR DEGREE .
SO I WENT OUT AND PLAYED SUBSTITUTE FOR A WHILE AND DECIDED NOPE NOT FOR ME .
DID YOU TEACH IN ALL SUBJECTS OR IN ALL GRADE LEVELS OR .
YEAH .
IT WAS I JUST TOOK GRADES ONE THROUGH SIX .
UHHUH .
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE SMART AND GET THE GOOD KIDS WRONG .
WELL MY DEGREE WAS IN FOURTH THROUGH SEVENTH GRADE BUT I TAUGHT JUNIOR HIGH .
AND I EXPECTED IT TO BE A LOT OF TROUBLE BUT IT .
WAS NT THAT BAD I TAUGHT REMEDIAL READING KIDS .
UM .
AND WELL THEY DO NT CALL IT REMEDIAL READING THESE DAYS .
YEAH .
THEY CALL IT .
SOMETHING ELSE .
BUT BUT ANYWAY AT THE TIME .
THAT S WHAT .
I TAUGHT .
AND UM YOU .
KIND OF GROUP YOUR BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS TOGETHER THAT WAY .
UHHUH .
WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR SLOW READERS BUT IT IT WAS NT TOO BAD .
WE WE GOT LONG REAL WELL .
WELL I I SOMETIMES WONDER IF I DID NT MESS UP .
I MAYBE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THE HIGHER GRADES BECAUSE AT LEAST YOU CAN IF YOU HAVE TO YOU CAN GET MEAN WITH THEM .
THOSE LITTLE KIDS DO NT UNDERSTAND IT .
YEAH .
I ESPECIALLY WITH THE REAL YOUNG ONES .
I STARTED OUT WANTING TO TEACH ELE LOWER LIKE PRIMARY AND THEN TOP PRIMARY AND THOUGHT WELL NO I DO NT LIKE THIS AS MUCH AND ENDED UP MOVING UP AND GOT UP UNTIL ABOUT THE SIXTH AND SO THAT S WHAT .
I GOT MY CERTIFICATION IN .
UHHUH .
BUT I HAD DECIDED LONG BEFORE I WAS EVEN MARRIED THAT I WANTED TO IF POSSIBLE TEACH MY KIDS AT HOME AND NOT PUT THEM IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS .
YEAH .
UM AND MY REASON FOR THAT WAS I DO NT LIKE THE UH WHAT S THE RIGHT WORD .
THE VARIED INAPPROPRIATE INFLUENCES THAT YOU FIND SO MUCH IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS .
WELL THAT S A NICE WAY OF PUTTING IT .
YOU CAN FIND A LOT OF GOOD PUBLIC SCHOOLS IF YOU IF YOU LOOK REAL HARD BUT I DO NT THINK THEY COULD COVER EVERYTHING THAT YOU COULD TEACH .
EXACT EXACTLY .
YOUR CHILDREN ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS .
AND TOO MOST PEOPLE DO NT HAVE THAT OPTION .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
AND PLUS IT ALSO DEPENDS ON THE DISTRICT YOUR IN AS I MEAN ON THE I VE SEEN SOME DISTRICTS WHERE ALL THE SCHOOLS ARE LOUSY IT DOES NT MATTER WHAT .
YOU DO .
UHHUH .
UH ACCEPT FOR THE PRIVATE ONES OF COURSE WE RE TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC .
RIGHT .
I DO NT KNOW .
BACK WHEN I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL UH YOU JUST DID NT GET AWAY WITH THE THINGS THESE KIDS GET AWAY WITH NOW .
UHHUH .
I MEAN YOU YOU PULLED STUNTS LIKE THAT AND YOU WERE DOWN AT THE PRINCIPAL S OFFICE AND UH USUALLY BENDING OVER TO GET FIVE OF THE BEST .
YEAH .
UM BUT NOW NOWADAYS THEY CA NT EVEN THEY CAN BARELY SCOLD THE CHILDREN FOR SOMETHING YOU KNOW WITHOUT GETTING SUED .
AND THE THE UM THE CRIME IS JUST ESCALATED AND THE DRUGS AND .
OH YEAH .
EVEN IN THE THE THE LOWER THE LOWER SCHOOLS .
WELL THE THING .
THAT REALLY DID IT FOR ME I WAS SUBBING IN A FIFTH GRADE CLASS AND UH THIS KID COMES TO SCHOOL WITH HIS LUNCH BOX AND INSIDE THIS LUNCH BOX .
HE HE S GOT EASILY TWO I D SAY TWO HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS IN ONE DOLLAR BILLS .
UM .
AND I ASKED HIM UH WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT .
AND HE SAYS MY FATHER GAVE IT TO ME .
AND I DID NT BELIEVE IT FOR A MINUTE .
UHHUH .
UM SO UH BUT UH YOU KNOW THE NOT A LOT .
I COULD DO ABOUT IT .
RIGHT .
CA NT STOP THE KID FROM BRINGING MONEY TO SCHOOL IF HE WANTS .
CRAZY FOR HIM TO BUT .
WELL I HAVE I I I VE FULL I THINK I UNDERSTOOD WHAT .
THE WHAT .
THE KID WAS DOING HE WAS A UH WELL LET S JUST SAY HE WAS ONE OF TH THOSE TYPES THAT YOU WOULD NT DOUBT THAT HE WAS SELLING SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
YEAH .
BUT NOT A LOT .
I COULD DO ABOUT IT .
WELL WE HAD THE PROBLEM WHEN I WAS IN WITH TEACHING UM I WAS EIGHTH AND NINTH GRADERS THAT I WORKED WITH AND IF WE DID HAVE A A STUDENT COME IN AND THEY WERE DRUNK OR THEY WERE ON SOMETHING .
YOU HAD THE OPTION OF CALLING THE POLICE AND HAVE THEM TAKEN OUT OF THE SCHOOLS OR TRYING TO TEACH THEM .
SOMETHING WHILE THEY WERE THERE .
UHHUH .
AND YOU DO NT KNOW IF YOU WERE REACHING THEM OR NOT BUT WE FELT LIKE YOU KNOW MAYBE JUST GOING AHEAD AND TRY TO TEACHING THEM WAS BET TRYING TO TEACH THEM WAS BETTER THAN HAVE THEM TAKEN OUT .
YEAH .
BECAUSE UH UH THAT JUST THAT DOES NT DO A LOT FOR THEM .
I MEAN IT .
YEAH .
ALLEVIATES YOUR PROBLEM BUT IT DOES NT DO ANYTHING FOR THEM .
RIGHT .
UH MOST THE TIME IF THEY WERE THEY WERE SOME OF THEM WERE EVEN BETTER BEHAVED .
I VE ONLY HAD TWO INSTANCES WHERE I COU IT WAS REALLY NOTICEABLE BUT THEY WERE BETTER BEHAVED WHEN THEY WERE UM I DO NT KNOW IF WAS ALCOHOL OR SOMETHING ELSE THAT THEY WERE ON BUT IT ENDED UP BETTER BUT .
UH I DO NT KNOW GUNS AND I DO NT KNOW IT S SOMETHING .
I THINK THERE S A PROBLEM TOO WITH TEACHERS TRYING TO UM TO BE SO VERSATILE THAT THEY DO LOOSE SIGHT OF THE BASICS YOU KNOW THEY VE BEEN A BIG DRIVE IN ESPECIALLY IN THE SEVENTIES TO RETURN BACK TO THE BASICS .
UHHUH .
AND UH AND I M NOT COMPLETELY JUST YOU KNOW JUST TEACH THE BASICS IN SCHOOLS BUT I THINK THERE DOES NEED TO BE A REEMPHASIS OF THOSE BECAUSE .
OH YEAH .
OF OUR OUR LOWER GRADES IN THE STANDARDIZED TEST AND SUCH .
OH SURE .
I MEAN I I IT S INDICATIVE ACROSS THE BOARD THAT WE WE VE DONE SOMETHING WRONG .
RIGHT .
AND WHEN YOU SEE UH KOREANS AND CHINESE AND JAPANESE .
WHO ARE TAKING ALL THE UH SCIENCE JOBS ALL THE ENGINEERING JOBS ALL THE MATHEMATICAL JOBS AND YOU KNOW HERE WE ARE WE CA NT WE CA NT BALANCE A CHECKBOOK WITHOUT A CALCULATOR .
UHHUH .
UM I DO NT KNOW .
WELL I SPENT A YEAR AND A HALF IN JAPAN ALSO AND I VE SEEN HOW THEIR SCHOOL SYSTEM WORKS AND I THEY GO BY A COMPLETE ROTE SYSTEM YOU JUST MEMORIZE EVERYTHING .
UHHUH .
AND THEN AT THE END OF THE OF A CERTAIN TIME PERIOD .
YOU SPITTED EVERYTHING BACK OUT AND THE BETTER THE MEMORIZER .
YOU ARE THE BETTER YOUR GRADES ARE GOING TO BE .
YEAH .
SO I DO NT COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THAT EITHER .
NO .
BUT THERE .
THERE DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BE A BALANCE SOMEWHERE .
YEAH .
THAT S THAT S A GREAT DEAL .
WHAT LAW SCHOOLS LIKE .
OH IS IT .
YEAH .
IS THAT WHAT .
YOU ENDED UP GOING INTO .
YEAH .
OH .
AND UH I DID THE SAME SORT OF THING THEY JUST YOU SIT THERE AND READ HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF CASES AND THEN YOU GET ONE EXAMINE FOR THE WHOLE SEMESTER .
UHHUH .
AND IT S HOW WELL YOU CAN REMEMBER IT .
ALL .
HOW HOW MUCH CAN YOU STUFF IN YOUR BRAIN .
YEAH .
AND I FOUND THAT A PARTICULARLY USELESS WAY OF STUDYING .
YEAH .
I NEVER DID .
I ALWAYS TRIED TO UNDERSTAND THINGS NOT TRIED TO MEMORIZE .
UHHUH .
AND CONSEQUENTLY SOME OF THE VERY BEST STUDENTS WERE HAD EXCELLENT MEMORIES BUT THEY COULD NT PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER AS FAR AS THE LAW WAS CONCERNED .
YEAH .
SO .
YEAH .
IT DID NT SHOW ME .
ANYTHING .
A YEAR AND A HALF I GAVE IT UP .
I WAS NT REALLY WA I DID NT WANT TO BE A LAWYER ANYWAY .
UHHUH .
JUST WANTED THE DEGREE .
YEAH .
SO .
YEAH .
WELL .
WELL .
I DO NT KNOW .
WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT .
GOO GOOD QUESTION .
PROBABLY .
MONEY .
TAKING .
MONEY IS NOT THE ANSWER .
NO .
THERE S PLENTY OF MONEY IN THE SYSTEM .
YEAH .
IT S JUST .
YEAH .
I MEAN THE THEY RE THROWING MORE MONEY AT IT NOW THAN EVER BEFORE AND THINGS ARE GETTING WORSE .
I THINK IT S LIKE A LOT OF THINGS IN THE IN THE UNITED STATES .
WE VE GOT SO MUCH BUILT UP IN UM IN THE IN THE UH BUREAUCRACY AND IN THE POLITICS OF IT .
UHHUH .
AND IN THE THE POWER PLAYS THAT IT NEEDS TO BE PULLED DOWN AND STARTED OVER AGAIN AND THERE S NO WAY THAT THAT CAN BE DONE .
UHHUH .
NOT WITHOUT WIPING OUT A WHOLE GENERATION OF OF KIDS IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM .
YEAH .
SO .
YEAH .
MAYBE ON SMALLER SMALLER SCALES .
WELL I DO NT KNOW I UH AS MUCH AS I DID NT LIKE SCHOOL WHEN I WAS GOING THROUGH IT .
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE NOW I CAN SEE THAT IT S A LOT BETTER THAN WHAT .
WE HAVE NOW .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK PART OF IT IS THAT THEY VE GOT TO GIVE AUTHORITY BACK TO THE LOCAL SCHOOL .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW I MEAN IT S IT S SILLY THAT THESE THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE HANDCUFFED WHEN IT COMES TO DISCIPLINE .
UHHUH .
RIGHT INTO THE CLASSROOM .
IT NEEDS TO BE .
YEAH .
BE ABLE .
EXACTLY .
TO BE ENFORCED .
I MEAN I I MEAN TEACHERS ARE SO AFRAID NOW OF EVEN SAYING SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
TO STUDENTS BECAUSE THEY RE GOING GET THEY RE GOING TO GET COMPLAINTS OR THEY RE GOING TO GET SUED OR SOMETHING .
IT .
S LIKE DOCTORS IN LAWSUITS .
OH YEAH .
YOU KNOW THEY RE KIND OF FEARFUL OF .
EVERYTHING .
WELL LAWYERS HELP CREATE THAT .
THAT S THAT S WELL AT LEAST I VE HEARD THAT I I I HAVE NT FORTUNATELY BEEN IN A SITUATION WHERE IT S .
BEEN APPLICABLE TO ME BUT MUMBLEX .
WELL I THINK I THINK I I MEAN WHAT .
WE VE TURNED THE SCHOOL SCHOOLS INTO NOW ARE JUST DAYCARE CENTERS .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW SOMEBODY OKAY WE RE GOING TO SEND OUR KID HERE FOR SEVEN OR EIGHT HOURS .
A DAY AND HE S OUT OF OUR HAIR .
RIGHT .
AND THE OTHER PART OF IT IS PARENTS HAVE QUIT BECOMING PARENTS .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THEY RE JUST .
OH YEAH IT HAS TO BE REINFORCED IN THE HOME .
OH SURE .
I I .
YOU .
YEAH .
YOU CAN YOU CAN HAVE THE BEST SCHOOL SYSTEM IN THE WORLD IF YOU DO NT GET ANY ANYTHING AT HOME THEN IT S IT S NOT GOING TO HELP EITHER .
RIGHT .
SO I DO NT KNOW I DO NT KNOW I DO NT KNOW WHAT .
THE ANSWER IS .
UHHUH .
IT S AN INTERESTING INTERESTING THING .
YOU WANT TO DO .
I HOW IS TEXAS ABOUT KEEPING YOUR CHILDREN OUT OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS DO THEY ALLOW IT .
YEAH .
THEY ALLOW IT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES .
YOU HAVE TO TO PROVE THAT YOU RE TEACHING THEM .
SOMETHING .
YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW .
UHHUH .
A PREFERRED CURRICULUM UM THEY TRY TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO FOLLOW A SPECIFIC CURRICULUM ALTHOUGH YOU DO NT HAVE TO .
UHHUH .
AND THEN IF YOU HAVE PARTICULAR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS THEY HAVE TO BE THEY RE KIND OF MONITORED .
YOU KNOW THEY THEY WILL ALLOW YOU TO I CA NT THINK OF ANY EXAMPLES BUT CERTAIN RELIGIOUS GROUPS DO NT WANT THEIR CHILDREN IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS BECAUSE THE INFLUENCE .
AND MAYBE THEY WERE A GROUP OF MENNONITES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
I DO NT THINK THEY RE WERE IN THIS AREA BUT UM THEY THEY ARE MONITORED BY THE UM BY THE STATE SCHOOL BOARD .
UM .
SO .
THAT S INTERESTING .
I REMEMBERING READING A FEW CASES ABOUT THAT WHEN IT WHEN SOME PEOPLE FIRST TRIED THAT AND THEY GOT SUED .
UHHUH .
GOT TAKEN TO COURT BY THE SCHOOL SYSTEM .
I M GLAD THE PARENTS WON .
I MEAN IT SEEMS SILLY THAT UM WE STARTED THAT S THAT S THE WAY .
YOU GOT YOUR EDUCATION IN THIS COUNTRY .
UHHUH .
AND THEN UM .
OKAY .
THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEMS WELL EVERYBODY .
S KNO HAS KNOWN THEY VE NEEDED RENOVATION FOR YEARS BUT NEVER REALLY HAD A CLEAR DIRECTION ON WHICH WAY TO GO WITH IT .
UHHUH .
THE FIRST DIRECTION THAT I CAN SEE OR I WISH I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THEM GO WITH .
KIDS LEARN AT DIFFERENT RATES AND FOR TOO LONG THEY VE KIND OF LUMPED EVERYBODY TOGETHER .
YOU D LEARN AT THIS RATE AND THAT S THE ONLY WAY .
IT S GOING TO HAPPEN .
YEAH .
THAT S TRUE .
YOU VE GOT SOME KIDS .
THAT LL PICK UP ON IT IN THE FIRST THREE MINUTES YOU RE TALKING ABOUT IT AND THE RE THE OTHER FIFTYSEVEN MINUTES YOU VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT A SUBJECT YOU VE BORED THEM .
YEAH YEAH THAT S THAT S VERY TRUE .
UM I GUESS I CAN RELATE TO THAT BECAUSE I HAVE TWO KIDS .
THAT ARE OPPOSITES LIKE THAT .
UH ONE PICKS UP REAL QUICK AND THE OTHER ONE DOES NT .
AND YOU RE RIGHT THEY DO GET BORED UH REALLY FAST IF THEY ALREADY KNOW WHAT .
YOU RE TALKING ABOUT .
WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE THAT THEY DO .
WHAT WHAT IS YOUR SUGGESTIONS .
THE EDUCATORS NEED TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE OPEN MINDED AS WELL AS INNOVATIVE IN DEALING WITH UH THE VARIOUS STUDENTS TO GET THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL OUT OF THE PERSON .
UHHUH .
OUT OF EACH CHILD .
OUT OF EACH CHILD .
EACH INDIVIDUAL CHILD .
SOME KIDS ARE GOING TO BE GREAT WITH MECHANICAL STUFF .
OTHER KIDS ARE GOING TO BE REALLY INTO MATH SOME ARE REALLY GOING TO BE HEAVY INTO READING .
RIGHT .
INSTEAD OF PUSHING THE SCALES TOO FAR EITHER DIRECTION I MEAN IT S GREAT TO BE WELL ROUNDED AND HAV BE EXPOSED TO ALL THIS STUFF .
YEAH .
THAT S .
BUT WHY NOT HIT THE POINTS .
THE KID S REALLY INTERESTED IN .
BECAUSE IF HE S INTERESTED HE S GOING TO STUDY IT AND HE S GOING TO LEARN IT AND HE S GOING TO REMEMBER IT .
THAT S TRUE .
THE ONLY I THINK THE ONLY THING THAT THEY WOULD ARGUE ABOUT THAT IS THAT YOU KNOW EVERY CHILD NEEDS TO LEARN EVERY SUBJECT .
I MEAN THAT S THAT MIGHT BE THE ONLY THING .
BUT I MEAN I I DEFINITELY AGREE WITH YOU .
UH .
THEY NEED EXPOSURE TO EVERY SUBJECT .
THEY DO NT NEED TO BE MASTERS OF IT .
RIGHT RIGHT .
THAT S TRUE .
UH .
EVERYTHING I LEARNED ABOUT ANCIENT ROME HA HAS NOT HELPED ME ANYWHERE IN .
MY ADULT LIFE .
YES I DEFINITELY AGREE .
THERE S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT .
I UH I I MEAN I CAN RELATE TO THAT BECAUSE I M I M GOING TO COLLEGE RIGHT NOW AND I FEEL LIKE I MEAN I M TAKING THIS HISTORY CLASS .
AND I MEAN IT S SO BORING AND I JUST HATE IT .
AND I THINK WHY DO THEY MAKE US TAKE THIS STUFF .
I MEAN WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH GETTING YOU KNOW A COMPUTER SCIENCE DEGREE OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW .
WHAT WHAT TYPE OF HISTORY CLASS IS IT THAT YOU RE HAVING TO TAKE .
UH AMERICAN HISTORY .
WE HAVE TO TAKE UM LIKE THIS IS LIKE EARLY SEVENTEEN HUNDREDS THROUGH I DO NT KNOW I THINK LIKE MID EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS .
AND THEN WE HAVE TO TAKE ANOTHER .
ONE .
THAT S MID EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS ON UP TO BASICALLY PRESENT .
WELL THE EARLY ONES THEY COULD ACTUALLY COMBINE TWO TWO .
YEAH .
LEVELS OF IT THE ONE FROM SEVENTEEN HUNDRED TIL SAY THE END OF THE CIVIL WAR .
COMBINE THAT INTO ONE .
AND THEN FROM EIGHTEEN SIXTYFIVE TO PRESENT AND MAKE THAT YOUR SECOND STEP BECAUSE .
YEAH .
THAT S WELL THAT S .
TO A POINT .
BASICALLY WHAT .
THEY RE DOING .
TO A POINT .
THE BOTTOM YOU KNOW THE EARLY PARTS OF IT YOU RE GIVING THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE NATION AND BUT EVEN THEN THEY RE SKIMMING OVER THEY RE VERY TRI ALMOST TRIVIAL WITH IT .
YEAH OH YES .
DEFINITELY I AGREE .
YEAH THERE S .
YOU KNOW I MEAN IF THEY REALLY WANTED TO GET TO THE MEAT OF THE MATTER I MEAN THERE S THEY MAKE ALL THESE PEOPLE OUT TO BE OH THEY WERE GREAT MEN AND THEY RE THE FATHER OF THE COUNTRY AND ALL THIS .
HE HAD JUST AS MUCH DIRT ON HIM AS ANYBODY ELSE .
IF NOT MORE .
THE MAN WAS NOT A SAINT .
YEAH .
THAT S TRUE YEAH .
ANY WAY THIS THIS UM SCHOOL SYSTEM THING I I TELL YOU I SAW SOMETHING ON THE NEWS OH I DO NT KNOW MAYBE TWO WEEKS AGO .
AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT I DO NT KNOW WHERE YOU RE FROM BUT I M FROM THE DALLAS AREA .
AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE PLANO SCHOOL SYSTEM THAT THEY HAD ONE SCHOOL .
THAT UH IF THE STUDENTS DID SOMETHING WRONG I MEAN WHETHER IT WAS BEHAVIORAL OR UH YOU KNOW THEY WERE NT LEARNING PROPERLY OR SOMETHING .
THEY TOOK THESE STUDENTS AND PUT THEM BASICALLY IN A CLOSET .
WITH NO WINDOWS .
THEY HAD A A TABLE OR NOT A TABLE BUT A DESK IN THIS CLOSET AND THEY HAD TO SIT IN THERE BY THEMSELVES .
WELL PARENTS WERE GETTING REALLY ANGRY ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THEY SAID WHY IS MY CHILD BEING PUT IN THIS CLOSET .
WELL HOW IS THAT HELPING MY CHILD YOU KNOW .
AND UH THE THE THING YOU KNOW THEY SAID WELL WE RE GIVING THEM .
ISOLATION TIME AND THIS HELPS THEM TO THINK .
BUT A LOT OF KIDS I MEAN IF A CHILD HAS UH CLAUSTROPHOBIA I MEAN THAT S JUST GOING TO TERRIFY HIM YOU KNOW AND .
IF IF THE ISOLATION CONCEPT REALLY WORKS THAT GOOD WHY ARE OUR PRISONS OVERCROWDED .
UH THAT S TRUE .
THAT S TRUE .
BUT NO I MEAN THEY WERE UH I MEAN I DEFINITELY AGREE WITH PARENTS .
I THINK THAT IS A VERY WRONG WAY TO HANDLE UH DISCIPLINING A CHILD .
PUTTING THEM IN I MEAN THEY WERE THEY WERE CALL THEY CALLED THEM THEIR QUIET ROOMS OR THEIR ISOLATION ROOMS .
THEY DID NT CALL THEM CLOSETS .
BUT THEY SHOWED THESE ROOMS ON UH YOU KNOW ON THE NEWS AND I MEAN THEY LOOKED LIKE A CLOSET TO ME .
YOU KNOW WITH A DESK IN IT A REAL SMALL .
BUT THEY SAID THAT ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS THEY CAME UP WITH WAS TO TAKE THE DOORS OFF OF THESE ISOLATION ROOMS .
I SAID NOW WHAT GOOD DOES THI I MEAN HOW IS THIS HELPING .
I MEAN EITHER WAY .
YOU KNOW I I DEFINITELY HAD TO DISAGREE WITH THAT .
I THINK THAT IS THAT S NOT THE WAY TO HANDLE A CHILD YOU KNOW DISCIPLINE A CHILD BY PUTTING HIM IN A CLOSET .
TH THE AS A PART OF THE REVAMPING OF THE ENTIRE EDUCATION SYSTEM ON THAT LEV THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM .
I WANT TO SEE CHANGED TOO .
WHEN I WAS BR BROUGHT UP IF YOU CROSSED THE LINE AND YOU BROKE A RULE BAD ENOUGH YOU WERE GOING TO GET SPANKED .
RIGHT .
WELL THEN THE EXTREME CAME IN AND NOW WE CAN NO LONGER .
RIGHT .
SPANK THEM SO WE NOW ISOLATE THEM .
YEP .
UH .
OKAY WE VE SWUNG THE PENDULUM .
BOTH .
WAYS .
LET S FIND A MIDDLE GROUND .
INSTEAD OF THERE HAS TO BE SOME SORT OF DISCIPLINE AND THERE HAS TO BE SOME SORT OF PUNISHMENT .
RIGHT .
SHORT OF PHYSICALLY ISOLATING THE CHILD AND SHORT OF PHYSICALLY HITTING THE CHILD .
WELL .
LET S PUT HIM INTO A SITUATION WHERE OKAY YOU CROSSED THE LINE YOU BROKE THE RULE YOU RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY FOR IT .
RIGHT .
BUT IT S GOING TO TAX YOU PHYSICALLY .
UHHUH .
I I DO NT .
HAVE TH I MEAN IN INSTEAD HA HAVE THEM PICK UP AROUND THE SCHOOL YARD HAVE THEM WEED A FLOWER BED SOMEWHERE ON THE SCHOOL YAR .
DO SOMETHING TO BEAUTIFY THE SCHOOL PROPERTY .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
BUT YOU CUT YOU KNOW THE THE KID S HAVING TO GIVE UP HIS QUOTE PLAY TIME TO PAY HIS DEBT FOR WHAT .
HE DID WRONG .
WELL .
BUT HE S SEEING SOMETHING .
CONSTRUCTIVE COME OUT OF IT .
UM I HAVE TO I THINK ONE OF THE POSITIVE THINGS I MEAN ONE OF THE THINGS .
THAT CAN COME OUT OF UH IS NOT JUST DI DISCIPLINE OKAY .
BUT OKAY FOR INSTANCE ONE OF THE THINGS THEY DO AT UH MY KIDS SCHOOL UH THEY HAVE WHAT .
THEY CALL UH CAUGHT BEING GOOD SLIPS .
AND WHEN THE KIDS ARE IN HALLS AND STUFF AND IF THEY RE BEING REALLY GOOD I MEAN JUST BEING EXCELLENT THEY RE NOT YOU KNOW CUTTING UP AND SO ON .
THEY RE JUST STANDING IN LINE DOING WHATEVER .
THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO THEY GET ONE OF THESE CAUGHT BEING GOOD SLIPS .
AND THEN WHEN THEY COLLECT THEM AT THE END OF EACH WEEK THEY GET TO GO TO THIS LITTLE WHAT .
THEY CALL THEIR CAUGHT BEING GOOD STORE AND THEN THEY GET TO SPEND THESE LIKE MONEY .
WELL SEE TO ME THAT S POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT IS MUCH BETTER MUCH BETTER THAN TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO DISCIPLINE KIDS BECAUSE THEY RE GOING TO BE GOOD AND TRY AND EARN THOSE THINGS YOU KNOW TO GET THE POSITIVE PART OF IT .
I MEAN THEY D RA MUCH RATHER GO IN THE STORE AND BUY SOMETHING THAN BE SPANKED .
SO THEY RE DEFINITELY GOING TO WORK TOWARDS BEING GOOD YOU KNOW RATHER THAN TRYING TO ACT UP AND BE BAD YOU KNOW .
I THINK THAT NOT ONLY APPLIES INSIDE THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM BUT IN SOCIETY .
ITSELF .
WE VE BEEN TOO LONG THERE S BEEN TOO MUCH NEGATIVE REINFORCEMENT .
HOW MUCH DA LIKE THE CAUGHT BEING GOOD SLIPS .
HOW ABOUT JUST THE JOHN Q CITIZEN OUT THERE ON THE STREET .
YEAH WELL THAT S TRUE .
I THINK I THINK REALLY THOUGH I MEAN THAT S ONE THING THAT I MEAN MY KIDS DEFINITELY GET SPANKED WHEN THEY NEED THEY NEED TO BE SPANKED .
BUT I REALLY DO TRY TO USE POSITIVE UH REINFORCEMENT WITH THEM AT HOME ALSO .
AND IT REALLY HELPS .
AND I MEAN THEY THEY DO NT GET SPANKED VERY OFTEN BUT THEY THEY DO WHEN THEY DESERVE IT YOU KNOW .
BUT UH I DO NT THINK ANY KID SHOULD BE EXEMPT FROM BEING SPANKED .
I MEAN I I THINK I WOULD NT MIND IF A TEACHER SPANKED MY CHILD .
BUT YOU KNOW THAT S JUST MY PERSONAL OPINION AND THAT S NOT GOING TO I MEAN I DO NT THINK THAT LAW WILL EVER CHANGE .
THEY ARE NEVER GOING TO LET A A TEACHER SPANK A CHILD AGAIN .
BUT I DO NT THINK I MEAN SOME KIDS DO NT GET DO NT GET SPANKED AT HOME AND SOME KIDS NEED TO BE SPANKED AT HOME .
I MEAN DO NT YOU THINK .
I M M MOST WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE .
BUT I DO NT KNOW .
I MEAN THERE S A POINT OF OVER KILL BUT SOMEWHERE IN YOU VE GOT TO FIND AN EVEN LINE .
RIGHT RIGHT .
WELL THERE S SO MANY PARENTS .
THAT SAY YOU CAN DEAL WITH A CHILD WITHOUT SPANKING .
THEM .
WHICH IS TRUE YOU CAN .
BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN A CHILD NEEDS TO BE SPANKED .
I MEAN THEY DO THINGS THAT THEY NEED THAT .
NEED THAT SHOCK EFFECT WHERE THEY EQUATE THE SHOCK OF BEING SPANKED WITH THE ACTIONS THEY DID TO GET SPANKED .
RIGHT .
WELL IRONICALLY ENOUGH I M SITTING HERE WITH A CAST ON MY LEG BECAUSE I RESUMED AN AEROBICS CLASS .
THE NIGHT BEFORE LAST .
OH NO .
I RIPPED THE LIGAMENTS IN MY RIGHT ANKLE .
GOSH .
YEAH SO .
EXERCISE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THAT TO YOU .
THAT S WHAT .
THE NURSES KEPT SAYING AS THEY LAUGHED ALL THE WAY YOU KNOW DOWN THE HALLWAY .
DO YOU DO ANYTHING ON A REGULAR BASIS .
WELL OFF AND ON OFF AND ON .
RIGHT NOW I VE BEEN OFF BUT I VE BEEN GOING OVER TO THE FITNESS CENTER .

YEAH .
UH WELL I VE BEEN GOING TO SPRING CREEK .
I HAVE NT BEEN TO THE DALLAS ONE NOW IN OH A COUPLE OF YEARS .

BUT MY HUSBAND S WORKING OVER THERE AND HE JUST GOES TO THE DALLAS ONE .
BUT I JUST DO NT I MEAN IT S JUST SO MUCH WEIGHT LIFTING .
EVEN THE SPRING CREEK ONE HAS A LOT OF WEIGHTS IN IT .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .

UHHUH .
IN ANY CLASS LIKE THAT I GO TO .
INSTEAD OF HAVING THAT LEVEL YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
THEY HAD A CHROME STRIP .
THAT WAS NT LEVEL AND IT WAS ABOUT FOUR INCHES DEEP AND THEN ABOUT OH A SEVENTY DEGREE ANGLE .
OH MY GOODNESS .
AND AS WE WERE JUMPING AROUND OR DOING SOMETHING .
I JUST JUMPED UP AND CAME RIGHT DOWN ON IT .
UM .
THE ORTHOPEDIST CALLED IT .
A UH BASKETBALL INJURY WHERE THE ANKLE JUST ROLLS UNDER YOU AND IT SNAPPED .
WOO .
I KNOW .
WE WENT TO MUMBLEX WELL WHATEVER IN PLANO AND THE EMERGENCY ROOM WAS LIKE A BAD COMEDY SHOW .
AND THE DOCTOR SAID YOU DID NT DO ANYTHING .
THERE S ONLY A ONE IN FIVE HUNDRED CHANCE THAT THE RADIOLOGIST WILL CALL YOU .
THAT WAS TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT .
THE RADIOLOGIST CALLED ME AT WORK AND UH I WAS ON CRUTCHES AND HE SAID I THINK YOU BETTER CALL AN ORTHOPEDIST .
SO WE WENT TO ONE AND HE JUST PUT A BIG OLD CAST ON IT .
PUT A BIG CAST ON IT .
YEAH FOR ABOUT FOUR WEEKS .
FOUR WEEKS YEAH .
WELL I LIKE AEROBICS BUT I M NOT SO SURE THAT .
WELL NOT THAT MUCH THOUGH .
NO I VE NEVER I WAS OFF FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS TOO JUST FOR SOME OTHER SURGERY .
I D HAD BUT I VE NEVER I D YOU KNOW I WAS PRETTY MUCH IN SHAPE WALKING AND AND YOU KNOW THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS LIKE THIS ORTHOPEDIST SAID HE SAID YOU D BE SURPRISED HOW MANY BASKET HOW MANY PEOPLE COME IN HERE WITH THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE ACTIVE .

YOU KNOW I WAS REAL EMBARRASSED BUT I FELT KIND OF STUPID .
WELL THOSE THINGS HAPPEN THOUGH .
YEAH THEY DO .
I MEAN I GUESS I M GLAD YOU KNOW THAT UM NOBODY REALLY NOTICED I GUESS YOU COULD SAY .
YEAH .
BECAUSE I GOT UP AND STARTED JUMPING ON IT AGAIN .
WELL THAT DID A LOT OF GOOD I M SURE .
YEAH REALLY .
I ENJOY AEROBICS AND I DO IT BECAUSE I LIKE IT I MEAN I LIKE THE MUSIC AND .

IN AEROBICS .
NO NO ACTUALLY I WAS UP ON A LADDER AND UH FELL OFF .

AND WHEN I CAME DOWN I HIT WITH MY FULL WEIGHT ON MY FOOT BUT ON CONCRETE .
WHAT D THEY DO FOR THAT .
DID THEY HAVE TO CAST IT .
YEAH THEY HAD WELL THEY HAD TO GO IN AND DO SURGERY .
THEY PUT A PIN IN IT .
OH SO THE AEROBICS THE IMPACT WOULD NOT BE GOOD .
YEAH AS I PERMANENTLY DAMAGED THE THE CUSHION UNDER MY HEEL .
OH GOODNESS .
THE NORMAL CUSHION THAT YOU HAVE THERE .
UHHUH .
I CA NT DO ANY JUMPING UP AND DOWN BECAUSE IT MAKES IT HURT .
OH THAT MAKES SENSE .
SO I MEAN ARE YOU IN TERMS OF OTHER THINGS LIKE LIKE NOT RUNNING BUT PLAYING A LITTLE BIT OF TENNIS OR CAN YOU NOT DO STUFF LIKE THAT AT ALL .
UH WELL I HAVE NT TRIED THAT .
I DO NT KNOW .
IT S BEEN I BET IT .
S BEEN THIRTY YEARS SINCE I PLAYED TENNIS .
YEAH .
IT S BEEN .
MOSTLY INTO JUST WALKING AND STUFF LIKE THAT .
THAT S PROBABLY THE SAFER WAY BECAUSE I NOTICE IN AEROBICS .
A LOT OF THE WOMEN .
THAT DO NT LOOK LIKE THEY SHOULD NT BE DOING CERTAIN THINGS .
UHHUH .
I M ALWAYS AFRAID THEY RE GOING TO FALL OVER AND HAVE A CORO CORONARY .
YEAH .
AND THERE WAS MY EGO WHEN I WENT AHEAD AND I WENT OH I CAN DO THAT AND .
UHHUH .
HALF THE TIME THOUGH I DO NT JUMP HALF AS MUCH AS I MEAN LIKE I M REAL TALL AND YOU KNOW I M NOT HEAVY BUT WHEN YOU GO EASY A HUNDRED SEVENTY AT MY HEIGHT UM I M FIVE ELEVEN .

FREAK .
THAT HAPPENED TO ME BECAUSE I WAS NT FAMILIAR WITH THE .
WELL THE FLOOR WAS UNEVEN .
OH IT WAS COMPLETELY I MEAN IT LITERALLY THE TWO DISSIMILAR FLOOR LEV FLOOR COVERINGS WERE NOT LEVEL .

RIGHT .
IT CURBS THE APPETITE AND HELPS WITH THE CALORIES AND ALL THAT STUFF .
YEAH REALLY .
YEAH BUT .
YEAH AND I NEED ALL THE HELP .
I CAN GET .
THAT GRAVITY FACTOR I KNOW .
UHHUH .
IT DOES GET YOU .
LIKE THAT ORTHOPEDIST SAID TO ME HE SAID DO NT WORRY DIANE HE SAYS HE SAID UH YOU RE AT THIRTY .

MORE DIVERSE CLIENTELE .

WORTH TALKING ABOUT .
YEAH .
I THOUGHT MAYBE ONE OF THESE DAYS I LL DRIVE OVER THERE AND CHECK IT OUT .

THAT S NOT WORTH .
YEAH .
I LIVE IN RICHARDSON BUT IT S ABOUT HALF WAY BETWEEN THE SPRING CREEK AND THE THE DALLAS SITE .
YEAH .
THAT S ACTUALLY WHERE THIS HAPPENED TO ME OUT IN I SAY PLANO BUT IT S ALL THE SAME TO ME .
RICHARDSON OVER ON CAMPBELL AND PARK HILL THERE S A NEW RECREATION CENTER .
UHHUH .
AND AS WE WERE DOING IT TOO EVERYBODY NOTICED THAT THERE WERE ALL THESE BIG GUYS OF ASSORTED NATIONALITIES .
MUMBLEX WALKED OUT I WAS ONE THING OH GREAT I HAVE PURPLE TIGHTS ON YOU KNOW .

HE SAID YEAH BUT THAT S JUST THEY TRIED TO PUT ME IN SOME KIND OF IMMOBILIZED WALKER BECAUSE HE DOES NT LIKE TO PUT CASTS ON WHEN IT S WARM .

I NEED TO GO ACTUALLY GET SOMETHING TO EAT HERE .
IT S GREAT THOUGH I REALLY DO ENJOY IT .
OKAY THANK YOU SANDY .
SURE THANKS .
UHHUH .
BYEBYE .
ALL RIGHT UM I THINK THE TOPIC WAS CRIME IN THE CITY .
RIGHT .
I DO NOT LIVE IN A CITY .
I LIVE IN A REAL SMALL LITTLE PLACE .
WHERE IS THAT .
UH IT S ABOUT THIRTY MILES FROM SHERMAN .
NORTH SOUTH EAST OR WEST .
IT .
S NORTH OF SHERMAN .
WELL YOU LIVE ALMOST IN OKLAHOMA .
NOT TOO FAR .
YEAH .
THAT S KIND OF IRONIC BECAUSE I DO NT LIVE TOO FAR FROM OKLAHOMA EITHER .
HUHUH .
YOU KNOW WHERE SAINT JOE IS .
UH I VE BEEN THROUGH THERE .
I M ABOUT EIGHT MILES SOUTH OF IT .
OKAY .
OH YEAH .
I HAD BEEN THROUGH SAINT JOE BUT UM JUST AS FAR AS WATCHING THE NEWS AND READING THE PAPERS AND ALL THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE THE CRIMES IN THE CITIES ARE REALLY GETTING BAD .
WELL YOU KNOW I VE I VE SEEN THOSE STATISTICS AND EVERYTHING AND YOU KNOW WHAT FRIGHTENS ME IS THAT YOU PUT A HALF .
A MILLION PEOPLE OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT .
HUHUH .
WITH HIGH TECH WEAPONRY YOU KNOW I MEAN THE IRAQIS DID NT HAVE A LOT OF HIGHTECH WEAPONRY BUT THEY HAD MORTARS AND MACHINE GUNS .
OH YEAH .
TANKS AND ALL THAT .
SURE .
AND THEY DID NT KILL AS MANY PEOPLE IN IN FORTYFIVE DAYS AND THEY WERE INTENDING TO KILL PEOPLE .
HUHUH .
I MEAN THAT WAS THEIR JOB AS THEY KILLED IN WASHINGTON D C .
OH I KNOW I KNOW .
I KNOW .
UM I THINK NOWADAYS PEOPLE JUST REALLY JUST MURDER IS NOTHING TO THEM YOU KNOW .
WELL I FORMULATED A PRETTY RADICAL THEORY OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS I GUESS .
AND I VE COME TO THE CONCLUSION AND THIS IS A PRETTY SCARY THOUGHT TO ME EVEN THAT IF A GUY IS CONVICTED OR A GAL IS CONVICTED OF A CRIME RATHER THAN PUT THEM IN PRISON BECAUSE PRISON S PROVEN NOT TO WORK JUST LET THEM GO .
SAY OKAY YOU RE CONVICTED .
HUHUH .
AND JUST LET THEM GO .
YEAH .
AND IF THEY GET CONVICTED AGAIN WELL JUST KILL THEM .
YEAH BECAUSE UH MOST LIKELY THAT WILL HAPPEN WO NT IT THAT YOU KNOW .
WELL I THINK THAT THE BEST HOPE TO ELIMINATE CRIME AS WE KNOW IT .
TODAY .
HUHUH .
IS TO ELIMINATE THE CRIMINALS FROM SOCIETY .
HUHUH .
IF SOMEONE IS KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN IN PRISON THEY CA NT GET A JOB .
NO .
YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
THEY CA NT BE ACCEPTED INTO SOCIETY .
YOU KNOW IF THEY RE NOT GOING TO BE ACCEPTED INTO SOCIETY THEN EVERYBODY S GOING TO BECOME SOCIOPATHIC .
HUHUH .
AND YOU KNOW WHO S TO PUT THE LIMIT ON IT .
I MEAN I WAS WATCHING A THING LAST NIGHT UP IN WASHINGTON STATE .
IF YOU GET CONVICTED OF UH SEXUAL OFFENSES ON A REGULAR BASIS .
YOU KNOW I MEAN SOME OF THESE GUYS ARE FORTY YEARS OLD AND GOT TEN CONVICTIONS .
HUHUH .
AND THEY RE STILL LET OUT ON THE STREET AFTER ONE OR TWO YEARS .
WELL IN WASHINGTON STATE IF YOU RE A HABITUAL SEXUAL OFFENDER THEY JUST DO NT LET YOU OUT .
UM .
SO YOU SERVE YOUR PRISON TERM AND THEN YOU GO INTO THE MENTAL HOSPITAL AND IF YOU RE PRONOUNCED CURED THEY LL LET YOU GO .
HUHUH .
WELL THEY MAY FIND A CURE FOR IT BUT THERE IS NO KNOWN CURE NOW .
UM .
SO YOU RE YOU RE KIND OF THINKING IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU GET IF YOU DO SOMETHING THE FIRST TIME THAT S NOT REAL BAD YOU KNOW .
HEY PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES .
YEAH TO GO AHEAD AND LET THEM GO BUT IF THEY DO IT AGAIN AND THEY REALLY NEED TO FACE THE CONSEQUENCES THEN UH .
WELL YEAH USE THAT OR YOU KNOW THERE .
S OTHER CONSEQUENCES RATHER THAN KILLING THEM YOU KNOW YOU COULD .
OH .
ALWAYS MAKE THEM .
THE SLAVE OF THE PEOPLE THEY COMMITTED THE CRIME AGAINST .
HUHUH .
YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
AT LEAST THEY MIGHT GET SOME BENEFIT IN THAT AND IF THE PEOPLE THEY COMMITTED A CRIME AGAINST FEEL AT SOME LATER DATE THAT THESE PEOPLE HAVE LEARNED THEIR LESSON ARE ARE OKAY YOU KNOW WELL THEY CAN FREE THEM .
HUHUH .
BUT UH YOU KNOW WITH THE TECHNOLOGY .
WE HAVE TODAY YOU CAN PUT A COLLAR ON A GUYS LEG .
THAT WILL KNOCK HIM DOWN IF THEY LEAVE THE PROPERTY .
I MEAN IT WILL JUST IN INCAPACITATE THEM .
HUHUH .
AND YOU CAN PUT A COLLAR AROUND A GUYS LEG .
THAT WILL PROHIBIT THEM FROM COMMITTING ANY KIND OF PROHIBITIVE ACT .
HUHUH .
BUT YOU KNOW PUTTING THEM IN PRISON MY GOD THAT DOES NT WORK .
NO APPARENTLY NOT BECAUSE LOOK HOW MANY YEARS THEY VE BEEN DOING THAT AND LOOK I MEAN YEAH .
WELL YOU LOOK AT PLACES LIKE TURKEY .
TURKEY HAS THE DEATH PENALTY .
HUHUH .
FOR JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING .
HUHUH .
I MEAN IF YOU GET CONVICTED OF UH YOU KNOW DRUG TRAFFICKING THEY JUST KILL YOU .
YOU GET CONVICTED OF UH YOU KNOW HEINOUS CRIMES THEY JUST KILL YOU .
I MEAN THERE S NO TWO WAYS ABOUT IT .
HUHUH .
AND UH YOU LOOK AT THEIR SOCIETY AND THE REPEAT OFFENDERS ARE VERY FEW .
YOU KNOW AND YOU LOOK AT OUR SOCIETY ALMOST EVERYONE OUT ON THE STREET .
THAT HAS BEEN IN PRISON HAS BEEN IN PRISON THREE OR FOUR TIMES .
THREE OR FOUR TIMES YEAH .
I MEAN .
THAT IS TRUE I KNOW .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW THE WAY TO STOP THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR IS IS TWOFOLD .
ONE YOU NEED TO MAKE IT ILLEGAL FOR BOTH .
PARENTS TO WORK WHILE THE KIDS ARE UNDER SEVEN .
I I THINK THAT S VERY IMPORTANT .
OH I M I AGREE VERY MUCH SO ON THAT I YEAH .
AND THEN IF A PARENT HAS PROVED TO BE UNFIT FOR ANY REASON .
HUHUH .
TAKE THE KIDS AWAY FROM THE PARENTS .
YEAH .
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE ARE WHAT .
WE TEACH .
HUHUH .
BECAUSE THAT S WHAT .
OUR SOCIETY BECOMES .
WE HAVE .
COMES YEAH .
WE HAVE JUST A BUNCH OF PEOPLE AND I VE AND I VE I VE LIVED IN THAT THAT ENVIRONMENT FOR QUITE A FEW YEARS WHEN I WAS DOING CONSTRUCTION WORK .
YOU KNOW AND THESE GUYS THEY COME TO WORK EVERY MORNING AND THEY RE STONED TO THE BONE .
I MEAN THEIR SO HIGH THEY COULD FLY UP TO THE TOP OF THAT BUILDING AND THEY WORK ALL DAY AND THEY GO HOME AND THEY SMOKE THEIR DOPE AND DRINK THEIR BOOZE AND SHOOT THEIR DRUGS AND WHEN THEY RUN OUT OF MONEY THEY GO DOWN TO THE CORNER STORE AND POP THE GUY ON THE HEAD AND TAKE HIS MONEY AND THEN THEY GO BACK TO WORK ON MONDAY .
HUHUH .
AND THE KIDS OF THESE PEOPLE MUMBLEX .
SURE THEY JUST THINK THAT S THE NORMAL THING TO DO DO NT THEY .
THEY RE SOCIOPATHIC .
YEAH .
AND I WORKED IN A FIRST GRADE CLASSROOM FOR ONE FULL SEMESTER .

THEY SEE AT HOME .
YOU KNOW .
HUHUH .
IF THEY SEE VIOLENCE AT HOME THAT S WHAT .
YOU RE GOING TO GET FROM THE KIDS AT SCHOOL .
EXACTLY .
YOU KNOW .
IT REALLY IS AND THAT S KIND OF SAD .
WELL YOU CAN SEE IT IN THE WORK PLACE YOU KNOW .
USED TO BE WHEN YOU HAD A PERSONALITY CONFLICT YOU JUST YOU WORKED WITH IT AND YOU GOT THROUGH IT .
HUHUH .
NOW YOU KNOW PEOPLE GET FIRED OR WHAT S EVEN WORSE IS THEY PROMOTE THEM INTO A POSITION THAT THEY CA NT HANDLE AND LET THEM GET FIRED .
YEAH .
OR ONE THING OR THE OTHER .
YOU LOOK AT ANOTHER KIND OF SOCIETY LIKE THE JAPANESE .
YOU PUT THAT MANY PEOPLE ON THAT SMALL OF A SPACE THEY VE LEARNED TO LIVE TOGETHER .
OKAY .
IT S IN THEIR CULTURE .
HUHUH .
AND ONE OF THE THINGS .
THAT S IN THEIR CULTURE THAT I REALLY THINK THE MAJOR CORPORATIONS SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO IS THE FACT THAT WHILE JAPAN WAS BECOMING A GREAT POWER FINANCIALLY THE PEOPLE .
THAT WORKED FOR THOSE COMPANIES WORKED FOR THE SAME COMPANY .
THEY WORKED FOR AT SIXTYFIVE AS THEY DID WHEN THEY WERE EIGHTEEN .
TEEN .
AND THE COMPANY TOOK IT UPON ITSELF TO FIND A POSITION FOR THESE PEOPLE .
IF THEY WERE NT FIT FOR THE JOB .
THEY WERE HIRED FOR THEY DID NT JUST CAN THEM THEY MADE A POSITION FOR THEM .
SOME WHERE .
HUHUH .
YOU LOOK AT FRITO LAY .
MY WIFE USED TO WORK FOR FRITO LAY AS A TYPIST .
YOU KNOW TRANSCRIBING STUFF INTO THE COMPUTER .
HUHUH .
WELL SHE COULD TYPE ABOUT ONEHUNDRED AND FIVE WORDS PER MINUTE BUT SHE DO NT LIKE IT .
SHE JUST DOES NT LIKE TO DO THAT .
I MEAN SHE WILL .
YEAH .
BUT YOU KNOW HER PREFERENCE IS TO BE IN AN OFFICE SITUATION WHERE HER JOB IS .
YOU WANT TO START .
WELL I GUESS I WOULD FIRST IDENTIFY MYSELF AS MIDDLE AGED AND THEREFORE .
UHHUH .
HAVING SEEN THE LAST GENERATION I GUESS IT PUTS ME IN YOU KNOW GIVES ME .
A PERSPECTIVE ON THAT .
YEAH .
UH I AM QUITE POSITIVE ON THE THINGS THAT I HAVE SEEN HAPPEN RECENTLY RELATIVE TO WOMEN IN BOTH IN SOCIETY AND IN THE WORK PLACE UH THERE S NO DOUBT ABOUT THE FACT THAT WHEN I WAS FIRST GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE .
THE IMPRESSION WAS THAT A WOMAN S CAREER WOULD CONSIST OF A CHILDBEARING YEARS AND PERHAPS A RETURN TO THE OFFICE BUT NOT NECESSARILY .
UH NOW I THINK THE CHANGE THAT I VE SEEN AS MUCH AS ANYTHING IS ONE WHERE COUPLES UH ARE MORE CAREFULLY PLANNING THEIR INTENTION ON HOW TO BOTH SHARE HOMEMAKING DUTIES AND ALSO HOW WOMEN WILL UH HAVE THEIR CHILDREN AND THEN DELIBERATELY SORT OF PLAN HOW THEY GO BACK TO THE WORK PLACE .
UHHUH .
AND I GUESS THAT S A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE THAT I VE BOTH PARTICIPATED IN AN AND NOTICED .
I AGREE UH THE EQUALITY OF UH THE ROLES NOW BETWEEN THE SEXES I GUESS HAS BEEN DRAMATICALLY DEMONSTRATED WITH THIS WAR ESPECIALLY COMPARED WITH UH THE VIETNAM WAR AND YOU SEE WOMEN GOING OFF TO WARS AS WELL AS MEN .
UHHUH .
UH I HAVE WONDERED WHY THEY ALLOWED OR LET YOU KNOW BOTH .
THE FATHER AND MOTHER GO UH AND THE CHILDREN ARE LEFT WITHOUT EITHER PARENT .
NOW TO ME THAT S KIND OF A DRAWBACK .
BUT UH I GUESS IT S A PRICE .
YOU PAY .
AND I ALSO WONDER ABOUT THE CHILDREN .
THAT ARE BEING BROUGHT UP IN THE UH UH DAY CARE CENTERS .
WONDER ABOUT THEM IN WHAT WAY .
WELL UH FROM WHAT .
I UNDERSTAND THERE S BEEN STUDIES .
THAT UH THESE CHILDREN ARE UH MORE REBELLIOUS .
UH THEY TERM IT AS MORE UH CREATIVE .
UHHUH .
BUT UH THAT THEY UH ARE MUCH MORE CONTENTIOUS .
SO I I DO NT I I GUESS WE LL HAVE TO SEE ANOTHER GENERATION TO SEE WHAT DIFFERENCES .
A CHILD BEING BROUGHT UP YOU KNOW IN A UH KIND OF A UH COMMUNITY .
UHHUH .
RATHER THAN A HOME .
I HAVE NOT TO BE HONEST HAD MUCH EXPERIENCE .
YEAH .
WITH CHILDREN IN THAT SITUATION .
I I GUESS ONE KNOWS ONE S OWN STORLY AND I KNOW UH IN MY CHILDREN S CASE .
IT WAS ONE WHERE UH PRETTY MUCH UP UNTIL THE OLDER OF TWO WAS IN UH LET S SEE I GUESS BASICALLY STARTING JUNIOR HIGH AND THE YOUNGER WAS IN FIFTH GRADE WHEN MY WIFE REENTERED THE WORK FORCE .
UHHUH .
UH .
SO THEY .
SO I GUESS MY EXPERIENCE IS IS JUST WITH WHAT .
WE DID AND AND SO THEY DID NT REALLY GO THROUGH THE CHILD CARE ROUTE .
YEAH .
THEY WERE ABLE TO BE HOME TOGETHER .
UH AND WE NEVER ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED THAT .
WHAT IN TERMS OF CHANGES RELATIVE TO WOMEN IN THE WORK PLACE AND THE POTENTIAL CHANGES OVER THE THE NEXT GENERATION OR SO I GUESS I ANTICIPATE UH AN INCREASING EQUALITY UH GREATER PRESENCE OF WOMEN IN MANAGEMENT ROLES .
UHHUH UHHUH .
UH I DO NT KNOW WHETHER THERE WILL BE AN INCREASED AMOUNT OF OF SURROGACY THAT WE SEE .
I JUST DO NT KNOW .
WHAT DO YOU MEAN .
UH DELIBERATE CHILDBIRTH BY SURROGATE MOTHER .
OH YEAH .
SORT OF RENTAMOM TO BE YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
NOT TO BE CRASS ABOUT IT BUT UH .
THAT S STRANGE .
UH WHETHER ONE MIGHT CONCEIVE NO PUN INTENDED OF THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE MIGHT BE A KIND OF A DELIBERATE UH UH .
A NANNY SORT OF .
A PROFESSIONAL MOTHER A .
UHHUH .
PERSON .
UHHUH .
FOR INSTANCE THAT AND I COULD YOU KNOW I COULD ENVISION A SOCIETY WHERE THAT WOULD HAPPEN AND MAKE AN INTERESTING UH UH STORY OR WHATEVER .
YEAH .
I I DO NT THINK I HAVE A PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEM WITH THAT .
IN FACT I THINK IT .
SORT OF RAISES NURTURING AND BEING A MOTHER TO WHAT .
IT OUGHT TO BE WHICH IS A RESPECTED PROFESSION .
THAT S RIGHT THAT S RIGHT .
UH I I DO NT HAVE A OTHER THAN THAN A READING AND AND MALE PERSPECTIVE ON ON THE VER ON THE BIOLOGICAL URGES INVOLVED RELATIVE TO BEING A MOTHER OR NOT .
UH I KNOW THAT THAT MY SENSE IS THAT I HAVE VERY MUCH AN INTEREST AND HAD ONE IN BEING A PARENT .
I I DO NT KNOW THAT I UH FELT MYSELF NECESSARILY ENCUMBERED WITH THE NECESSITY TO HAVE HEIRS .
UHHUH .
UH I DO NT HAVE BOYS THAT DOES NT DID NT BOTHER ME NEVER HAS .
VISION MORE WOMEN DELIBERATELY RAISING CHILDREN EITHER IN SURROGACY OR OR AS A PROFESSIONAL NANNY NANNY AS YOU PUT IT UH .
YEAH .
MAYBE WE LL SEE A GROWTH IN THAT WHERE SOMEONE MAKES A CAREER OUT OF SAY TAKING CARE OF FIVE OR SIX CHILDREN AS OPPOSED TO DAY CARE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
IT WOULD BE A SORT OF DAY CARE BUT IT WOULD BE MORE OF A FAMILY SETTING .
RIGHT .
UH I KNOW THAT THERE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE CHARACTERIZED I GUESS AS BEING HALF MY AGE SO THAT BY DEFINITION .
THAT MEANS .
UHHUH UHHUH .
THEY RE YOUNG .
UH THAT IN MY WORK PLACE WHO ARE BOTH OF THEM EARNING RATHER DECENT PROFESSIONAL SALARIES .
WHO PROBABLY WOULD CONSIDER PAYING A WOMAN UH EIGHT OR NINE OR TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS .
A YEAR TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR CHILD .
TO COME IN AND LIVE WITH THEM .
I COULD EASILY ENVISION THAT .
PARDON .
TO COME IN AND LIVE WITH THEM .
OR TO PUT THEIR CHILD INTO A S INTO A HOME SETTING .
UHHUH .
WHERE THEY WOULD YOU KNOW LIKE THEY THEY WOULD GET LEAVE AT EIGHT IN THE MORNING AND AND DROP A TWO YEAR OLD OFF IN A HOME WHERE YOU KNEW THERE WERE GOING TO BE FOUR OTHER KIDS AND .
YEAH .
AND YOU WERE PAYING FOR REALLY HIGH QUALITY CARE .
RIGHT .
UH I HAVE ACQUAINTANCES OF MINE WHERE I KNOW THAT THEY ARE PAYING FIGURES ON ON THE ORDER OF WHAT .
I QUOTED TO SOMEONE BECAUSE THAT S WHAT .
THE EXPERIENCE .
THEY WANT AND I WOULD IMAGINE IF THERE ARE MORE OF PEOPLE LIKE THAT WITH AN OPPORTUNITY THAT THAT S A POSSIBILITY OF A CHANGE .
UHHUH .
THAT WE COULD SEE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS .
AND THEN YOU MIGHT HAVE MORE CONTROL OVER UH THE THE MORALS THAT THEY WOULD BE TAUGHT RATHER THAN IN LIKE A CLASSROOM OR A DAY CARE CENTER .
UHHUH UHHUH .
I KNOW THE DAY CARE CENTERS ARE NOT CHEAP EITHER .
YOU KNOW THEY RE .
I HAVE NT EVER REALLY LOOKED AT THEM .
ARE YOU AWARE AT ALL .
UH WELL NO .
OF OF WHAT .
THEY WOULD WHAT .
THEY COST .
I JUST KNOW I KNOW SEVERAL SINGLE MOTHERS .
WHO ABSOLUTELY CA NT AFFORD IT .
THEY HAVE TO GO WITH THE A SINGLE UH WH I MEAN A BABYSITTER MORE MORE OR LESS .
UHHUH .
BUT I THINK IT S LIKE ABOUT SIXTY DOLLARS .
A WEEK FOR TWO CHILDREN .
UHHUH .
IF I M NOT MISTAKEN .
AND YOU HAVE TO PAY THAT WHETHER YOU RE ON VACATION YOU KNOW AND TAKING CARE OF THE CHILDREN OR IF THE CHILDREN ARE AT HOME AT HOME .
UHHUH .
SICK .
I MEAN THAT IS YOU KNOW JUST A A RATE THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY AND UH .
WHAT WHAT DO YOU ENVISION FOR THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS AS FAR AS WOMEN IN AMERICAN SOCIETY .
UH I THINK I REALLY DO NT HAVE A VISION .
THAT S OKAY TOO .
YEAH I I I THINK THAT THEY WILL BE MORE IN THE WORK PLACE BECAUSE UH THE DOOR S OPEN .
UHHUH .
AND UH IT S JUST HUMAN NATURE TO WALK THROUGH AN OPEN DOOR .
SO AND I WOULD BE GLAD TO SEE THAT .
I HOPE I DO NT SEE A LOT .
MORE SINGLE MOMS BUT .
MUMBLEX .
I IT SEEMS IN MY EXPERIENCE .
I M RUNNING ACROSS SINGLE WOMEN ALL THE TIME .
I M I M NOTICING THAT TOO AND AND I NOTICE THE THE A TERMING EX EM EMERGING CALLED SOLO PARENTS .
YEAH .
THAT I M VERY AWARE OF THE NUMBER OF SOLO MOTHERS THAT THAT I ENCOUNTER IN THE WORK PLACE AND THAT THAT IS A LITTLE TROUBLESOME .
YEAH YEAH .
UH BECAUSE THE PRESSURES ON THEM ARE ARE .
IT S AWFUL .
RATHER RATHER FORMIDABLE .
YEAH .
UH AND MAYBE THAT S A CHANGE .
WE LL SEE .
MAYBE UH THE POSSIBILITY OF OF WOMEN UH WHO DELIBERATELY SAY NO WE LL LET THE MAN WILL TAKE CARE OF THE CHILDREN PERHAPS .
UHHUH .
IN THE EVENT OF A SEPARATION OR WHATEVER .
RIGHT .
SO .
WELL I THINK WE VE DONE IT .
WELL I THINK WE RE ABOUT DONE .
OKAY .
THANK YOU VERY MUCH .
UH GOODBYE .
IT S BEEN INTERESTING .
YOU TAKE CARE .
OKAY .
BYE .
BYE .
I JUST PRESSED MY UH .
WE RE SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT RECENT POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS .
I GOT ONE THAT S INTERESTING NOT TOO NOT TOO CONTROVERSIAL I YOU KNOW NOT DOES NT MATTER WHETHER YOU RE DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN I I DO GET SOMEWHAT OF A KICK OUT OF BECAUSE SCHWARTZKOPF OR THE OTHER GENERALS WHO I ADMIRE HOW EVERYONE WANTS TO MAKE GET THEM IN POLITICS I THINK .
UHHUH .
THAT S KIND OF AN INTERESTING RECENT THING THAT I COULD THINK OF RECENTLY THAT UH I WAS WONDERING WHAT YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THAT .
YEAH .
MAKING THE GENERAL UH GETTING A GENERAL INTO POLITICS .
THEY WANT HIM BECAUSE HE S POPULAR NOT BECAUSE HE CAN DO THE JOB .
RIGHT WELL I VE I VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT AND I UH I KIND OF GET A KICK OUT OF THEY ALWAYS WANT THE HERO THOSE WE RE LOOKING FOR A HERO WELL TIME MAGAZINE WAS SAYING THAT IN ESSENCE THE GENERAL S STAFF WAS COMPARING TO CORPORATE PRESIDENTS AND THEY SAID IN GENERAL GENERALS ARE MORE FAMILIAR WITH TRAINING THAT THEY BELIEVE IN TRAINING MORE .
UHHUH .
THEY ARE MUCH MORE EDUCATED THAN THE AVERAGE CORPORATE PRESIDENT AND SO THEY REALLY WERE VERY POSITIVE ON A GENERAL S STAFF PERSON HAVING A A VERY MUCH BETTER EDUCATION THAN THE AVERAGE UH CORPORATE PRESIDENT SO I THOUGHT WELL MAYBE .
I I THINK THEY PROBABLY HAVE A BETTER EDUCATION THAN THE AVERAGE CONGRESSMAN .
WELL THAT TOO THAT TOO AND UH YOU KNOW THEY TALK ABOUT THE ARMY AND BECAUSE OF THE WAR AND WHY DID WE WIN AND ALL THAT AND THEY TALKED ABOUT HOW THE TRAINING WAS SO IMPORTANT AND THAT S SO IMPORTANT IN INDUSTRY SO YOU KNOW THEY RE LIABLE TO BE RIGHT THAT GENERALS GENERALS IN THE SERVICE AND SCHWARTZKOPF UH YOU KNOW MIGHT MAKE A GOOD UH POLITICIAN WHETHER IT BE GOVERNOR OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW .
HE HE YOU KNOW WE KNOW HE S A GOOD LEADER WE KNOW HE S A GOOD ORGANIZER THE QUESTION IS YOU KNOW CAN HE BE THE MAN WHO S ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE YOU KNOW LIKE WHAT HE SAID IS YOU KNOW A LOT OF TIMES IN HIS INTERVIEWS HE WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW PEOPLE ASKING WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT HE SAYS I M FOLLOWING THE ORDERS OF MY PRESIDENT I M NOT THE ONE WHO WRITES THE ORDERS I M JUST THE ONE WHO FOLLOWS THEM .
YEAH IT S INTERESTING HOW THEY SAY THAT WHEN THEY RE USUALLY THE TOP DOGS YOU KNOW EVERYONE HAS A BOSS OF COURSE .
YOU KNOW SCHWARTZKOPF WAS ORDERED TO GET IRAQ OUT OF KUWAIT .
YEAH .
AND SO HE WENT TO THE PRESIDENT AND SAID OKAY HERE S HOW I WANT TO DO IT BUT HE WAS NT THE ONE THAT DECIDED IRAQ NEEDED TO GET OUT OF KUWAIT .
NO THAT S TRUE THAT S TRUE .
UHHUH .
UH YOU YOU PICK ONE .
I JUST THOUGHT OF THAT ONE WHEN WHEN THEY BROUGHT UP ABOUT POLITICS THAT WAS UH PRETTY EASY .
YEAH .
YOU DO NT HAVE TO PICK DEMOCRATIC OR REPUBLICAN YOU CAN PICK ANYTHING YOU WANT GO AHEAD .
WELL THE THING THAT I M WONDERING ABOUT IS HOW WE GET A NEW CONGRESS HOW DO WE GET SOME OF THESE GUYS THAT HAVE BEEN IN THERE FOR SO LONG HOW DO WE GET THEM TO NOT GET REELECTED OVER AND OVER AGAIN .
WELL I HAVE AN EASY ANSWER FOR THAT OH I WISH THEY WOULD DO IT IS THAT LIMIT IT YOU KNOW TO EIGHT OR TEN YEARS MAX .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW WHETHER THAT S TWO .
I TH YEAH .
FIVE YEAR TERMS OR WHATEVER .
YEAH THAT MAY BE OUR ONLY ANSWER BUT I DO NT REALLY LIKE IT I DO NT LIKE THE FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT IS LIMITED IN THE NUMBER OF TERMS HE CAN SERVE .
OH YOU KNOW YOU RE NOT .
I THINK IF THE PRESIDENT BE HIM REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT I THINK IF THE PRESIDENT CAN PROVE THAT HE S POPULAR YOU KNOW THAT HE CAN DO THE JOB .
YEAH .
THEN THE PEOPLE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO ELECT HIM AS OFTEN AS THEY WANT I THINK THE REASON WHY WE VE GOT THESE GUYS IN CONGRESS IS BECAUSE OF THE FUND RAISING RULES I MEAN HOW MANY OF THESE BIG CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS THAT THEY RE RUNNING ON THIS YEAR DID THEY GET AFTER THEY WERE ELECTED JUST YOU KNOW JUST AFTER THEY WERE ELECTED TWO YEARS AGO .
YEAH .
BASICALLY THE PEOPLE AS SOON AS THEY GET ELECTED THE PEOPLE DUMP ALL KINDS OF MONEY ON THEM AND SAY YEAH YEAH YOU RE MY FRIEND YOU RE MY FRIEND AND TWO YEARS LATER HE REMEMBERS THAT AND WHAT THEY DONE IS THEY VE BOUGHT THIS CONGRESSMAN FOR TWO YEARS .
YEAH I DO NT KNOW I DO LIKE THE LIMITATION OF THE PRESIDENT AND I THINK THERE IS A NEEDED CHANGE I THINK THE SAME THING SHOULD HAPPEN FOR CONGRESS I I D LIK YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE MY ANSWER OF AN .
YEAH WELL .
EASY WAY TO GET THESE GUYS OUT OF THERE FOR TWENTY YEARS MY GOD IT S RIDICULOUS YOU KNOW .
THAT S THAT S THE EASY WAY I THINK THE HARDER WAY OUT WOULD BE TO MAKE THE GUYS THAT ARE IN THERE AND THE GUYS WHO ARE TRYING TO GET IN THERE RUN ON MORE LEVEL GROUND .
WE HAD .
THAT S WHAT THE FINANCING RULES AND THE UH THE MAILING RULES AND THE SIZE OF THE OFFICE STAFF AND ALL THAT STUFF .
I THINK VOTING IS IS A PROB I THINK I HAD ONE OF THE SUBJECT ABOUT VOTING AND UH VOTING APATHY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND I THINK THAT UH THE VOTING RULES NEED TO BE CHANGED WHERE YOU HAVE A LITTLE MORE TIME I CA NT BELIEVE THAT A COUNTRY OUR BIG VOTES FOR A PRESIDENT FROM SEVEN OCLOCK IN THE MORNING TIL SEVEN OCLOCK AT NIGHT YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
OF COURSE THEY HAVE ABSENTEE WHICH IS GETTING TO BE MORE A LOT EASIER AND I I VOTE AS OFTEN ON ABSENTEE AS I CAN BECAUSE IT S SO EASY NOW BUT I THINK GEE WHIZ YOU COULD MAKE IT A COUPLE DAYS IT S JUST IF YOU REALLY WANT THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE TO VOTE .
YEAH .
THEN GIVE THEM A COUPLE OF DAYS .
WELL I THINK A LOT MORE PEOPLE COULD VOTE IF THEY WERE SOMEHOW PERSUADED THAT IT S SOMETHING WORTH CARING ABOUT .
YEAH YEAH .
YOU KNOW LIKE YOU KNOW THE THE RECENT ELECTION ABOUT HOW THE DALLAS CITY COUNCIL SHOULD BE MADE UP THAT ELECTION LAST DECEMBER .
ARE YOU IN DALLAS .
YEAH I M IN DALLAS CITY LIMIT .
BOY I I I LIVE IN ARLINGTON I AM SO HAPPY NOT TO BE PART OF DALLAS .
YEAH .
WHEN I SEE THOSE FOLKS THERE .
IT S AN UGLY MESS .
I MEAN I DO NT KNOW IF YOU LIKE THE MAYOR BUT I THINK YOUR MAYOR THE CITY COUNCIL THE WHAT IS THE WOMAN S NAME WHOSE US NOT THE MAYOR BUT THE .
THE MANAGER .
YEAH THE CITY MANAGER ALL OF THEM NEED TO BE THROWN OUT I MEAN THEY RE JUST AWFUL JUST AWFUL .
WELL WHAT GET S ME IS THIS THING IT WENT DOWN TO DEFEAT LAST DECEMBER BY HOW MANY VOTES BY JUST A FEW HUNDRED VOTES .
UHHUH .
AND IF IT IF IT HAD PASSED IF THESE PEOPLE HAD GOTTEN OUT THE VOTE IT WOULD HAVE PASSED AND THERE D BE NO MORE ARGUMENT BUT THEY RE STILL FIGHTING ABOUT IT BECAUSE OF THE .
I KNOW .
WAY THE ELECTION WENT LAST DECEMBER .
IT S SO AWFUL THAT POLITICIANS ALWAYS SPENT CONSULTING MONEY THAT WE PUT THEM IN OFFICE AND THEN THEY GO OUT AND SPEND A COUPLE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO BUY CONSULTANTS AND THEN THEY DO NT EVEN DO THAT RECOMMENDATION YOU KNOW .
UHHUH YEAH .
I MEAN IT S AMAZING THE MONEY THAT THEY SPEND ONCE THEY GET IN .
BUT BUT THIS IS FOR SUPPOSEDLY TO BENEFIT THE MINORITIES AND ALL THE MINORITIES HAD TO DO WAS GO OUT AND GET A COUPLE MORE HUNDRED PEOPLE TO VOTE .
WELL YOU RE RIGHT THERE .
AND THEY WOULD HAVE HAD THEIR WAY .
YOU RE RIGHT THERE UH UH PEOPLE ARE UH UH POLITICS UH THE VOTING IS STILL NOT AS MUCH AS YOU THINK IN ALL KINDS OF ISSUES REALLY .
YEAH IT S PRETTY SAD .
YEAH IT IS UH HOPEFULLY PEOPLE WILL GET MORE INVOLVED .
MY MY POSITION IS PEOPLE WHO DO NT VOTE DO NT HAVE ANY RIGHT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE WAY THE GOVERNMENT S GOING .
OH YEAH BUT THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE COMPLAINING I I THINK A LOT I SEE IT HERE AT T I THE GUYS THAT DO NT TAKE ANY INTEREST IN AND AND CONSTANTLY ON THE NEGATIVE OF EVERYTHING .
UHHUH .
AND UH .
AND AND YOU ASK THEM WHY THEY DO NT VOTE THEY SAY WELL THEY DO NT WANT THEIR NAME ON THE UH JURY DUTY LIST .
IS THAT RIGHT OOH .
THAT THAT S WHERE THEY GET THE JURY DUTY LIST IS FROM THE VOTER REGISTRATION .
RIGHT YOU RE RIGHT YOU RE RIGHT I THINK THEY COULD DO MORE ABOUT UH VOTING .
MUMBLEX I THINK THEY COULD .
WHAT ARE THE ISSUES I I M A DEMOCRAT I WANT TO JUST SAY THAT I M SO SAD THAT THERE IS NT A STRONG DEMOCRAT I DO NT EVEN KNOW I COULD GO OUT AND DEBATE GEORGE BUSH BETTER THAN I SEE ANY DEMOCRAT DOING IT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW I MEAN AT LEAST I D LIKE TO SEE COMPE BECAUSE I LIKE COMPETITION YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
I THINK ROLLING OVER AND PUT YOUR BELLY UP AND PLAY DEAD I M SO DISGUSTED WITH THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY I CAN NOT BELIEVE IT YOU KNOW .
IN PRESIDENTIAL RACES THAT S ABOUT WHAT THEY VE DONE BUT THEY VE GOT A PRETTY GOOD LOCK ON CONGRESS AND .
YEAH .
A LOT OF LOCAL THINGS .
YEAH BUT I STILL THINK IN THE LAST TEN YEARS YOU KNOW OF COURSE THAT S NOT A RECENT EVENT THAT S ONLY MY OPINION I GUESS I REALLY SHOULD NT TALK ABOUT THAT BUT I DO NT KNOW WHETHER THEY RE RECENT EVENTS I GUESS THEY WE ON THIS UH SPEECH THING THEY WANT US TO USE A VARIETY OF WORDS .
RIGHT .
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU CALLED BY THE WAY .
ACTUALLY I HAVE NT MADE ANY CALLS BUT I RECEIVED ABOUT A DOZEN .
OH REALLY I I I .
I THINK YEAH I HAVE TO MAKE THESE BUT I GET DISTRACTED AND GET TO DO SOMETHING ELSE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN MY PHONE RINGS AND GO WELL WHAT THE HECK WE LL TALK FOR A WHILE .
YEAH I VE ALREADY GOT TWELVE CARDS YOU GET ANY CARDS IN THE MAIL .
YEAH WE GOT A WHOLE BUNCH I CA NT REMEMBER HOW MANY .
I DO NT KNOW I M AMAZED BY OF COURSE WE RE NOT TALKING ABOUT POLITICS BUT I AM AMAZED BY PEOPLE SAY THEY GOT THIRTY WELL I WONDER WHY YOU NEED THIRTY RENDITIONS OF THE PERSONS VOICE BUT I M NOT IN VOICE SYNTHESIS .
BUT I D SURE LIKE TO SEE A SUMMARY OF IT WE LL GET TO POLITICS I M SORRY .
WELL I THINK WE VE USED UP AS MUCH TIME AS WE RE SUPPOSED TO ANYWAY .
YEAH RIGHT .
WE RE SUPPOSED TO DO FIVE MINUTES AND THAT WAS THREE MINUTES AGO .
YEAH .
HEY WELL THANKS FOR THE CALL .
YEAH BYEBYE .
YEAH BYE .
OKAY THE TOPIC WAS SHOULD THE UNITED STATES ADOPT THE METRIC SYSTEM AND IF SO SHOULD UH .
HOW SHOULD THEY DO IT .
WHY DID NT IT WORK LAST TIME .
AND WHY DID NT IT WORK LAST TIME .
WELL I M ALL FOR IT .
YEAH WELL I I AM TOO .
I WISH UH IT HAD STARTED A LONG TIME AGO IS THE PROBLEM BECAUSE WE RE SO WOUND UP IN THE .
YEAH .
IN THE SYSTEM THAT WE VE GOT THAT YOU KNOW TRYING TO CONVERT OVER AND I GUESS WHAT D THEY TRY THEY TRIED WHAT D THE CALL IT SOFT CONVERSION AND HARD CONVERSION .
YEAH THEY TRIED THE .
ONE OF THEM IS WHERE YOU JUST TAKE WHATEVER S ALREADY STANDARD AND YOU GIVE IT .
SOME SORT OF A WEIRD METRIC NUMBER LIKE SIX POINT TWO EIGHT SEVEN INSTEAD OF SIX MILLIMETER .
YEAH YEAH DIRECT CONVERSION .
I I DO NT KNOW .
UH .
I THINK THEY JUST OUGHT TO YOU KNOW START UH JUST GO ALL THE WAY ON NEW PRODUCTS INTRODUCED OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW START YOUR PACKAGING GO TO LITERS INSTEAD OF QUARTS AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE IF THEY HAVE TO ARE GOING TO LEARN TO THINK THAT WAY .
WELL DO NT MOST OF THEM DOES NT JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING NOW HAVE BOTH METRIC AND ENGLISH .
THEY DO BUT THINGS ARE GENERALLY PACKAGED IN THE ENGLISH SIZED PACKAGES YOU KNOW .
YOU BUY A QUART OF MILK AND SURE IT HAS HAS THE METRIC EQUIVALENT WRITTEN ON THERE BUT IT STILL A QUART .
OH YEAH YEAH .
BUT IF THEY STARTED PUTTING IT IN LITERS LITER OF OIL AND YOU KNOW LITERS OF GASOLINE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LEARN TO THINK IN METRIC .
AS LONG AS YOU CAN STILL BUY A PRODUCT IN THE ENGLISH UNITS THAT S HOW YOU RE GOING TO THINK OF IT .
I .
KIND OF REMEMBER BACK WHEN GAS PRICES STARTED UP YOU KNOW PRETTY DRAMATICALLY WHEN THEY STARTED GETTING TOWARD A DOLLAR .
A GALLON RANGE SOMEBODY HAD UH I BELIEVE IT WAS EXXON .
IT FIGURES .
WE WERE LIVING IN LUBBOCK AT THE TIME THEY STARTED MARKETING IT IN LITERS AND IT WAS ONLY LIKE TWENTYNINE AND THIRTY CENTS .
A LITER .
SO THEY COULD PUT THIS SIGN OUT FRONT .
THAT SAID YOU KNOW THIRTYNINE CENTS .
A LITER .
RIGHT .
AND NOBODY HAD ANY IDEA .
WHAT .
A LITER WAS SO UH .
THAT THAT S THE PROBLEM .
WHEN WE FINALLY OUT THAT LITERS WAS ABOUT A QUART THERE S ABOUT FOUR LITERS IN A GALLON SO YOU CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT .
YOU RE ACTUALLY PAYING FOR IT .
RIGHT .
IT .
S KIND OF HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE THAT THIS DAY AND AGE I DO NT KNOW WHEN I WAS GROWING UP WE WERE TALKING METRIC SYSTEM IN SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
I MEAN NOT NOT AT FIRST BUT BY THE TIME .
I WAS IN FIFTH OR SIXTH GRADE ANYWAY .
YEAH .
OH .
I WOULD EXPECT PEOPLE WITH ANY KIND OF BUYING POWER OVER THE AGE YOU KNOW UNDER THE AGE OF THIRTY OR SO TO HAVE SOME IDEA .
WHAT .
IT IS ANYWAY .
A LITER S ABOUT A QUART .
THE UH I THINK MAYBE THERE S WHERE THE PROBLEM CAME IN YOU KNOW .
WE VE TRIED TO INSTEAD OF LEARNING IT S KIND OF LIKE LEARNING A LANGUAGE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LEARN ONE FROM THE OTHER YOU ALWAYS END UP IN THIS CONVERSION THING .
ALL THE TIME .
YEAH .
SO YOU IT S ALMOST LIKE UH COURSE .
THIS COUNTRY IS NT A DICTATORSHIP BUT YOU KNOW IT S LIKE SOMEBODY SAID OKAY AS OF SUCH AND SUCH A DATE YOU KNOW ANYBODY CAUGHT TALKING IN THE ENGLISH YOU KNOW .
WILL BE SHOT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW .
BUT UH .
WELL THING IS IT S A GLOBAL GLOBAL MARKET PLACE THESE DAYS AND YOU KNOW WE RE LIKE WHAT ONE OF TWO BACKWARDS COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD AS FAR AS .
YEAH I READ THAT WHAT UGANDA AND .
SOMETHING .
I DO NT REMEMBER WHAT .
THE OTHER ONE IS BUT .
THERE S ONE OR TWO OTHERS THAT JUST .
IT S JUST TIME .
I THINK FOR FOR US TO GO OVER .
BECAUSE ALL .
YOU END UP DOING IS IF YOU RE IN BUSINESS OR YOU RE IN ANY KIND OF INTERNATIONAL .
UHHUH .
I DO NT YOU KNOW I WORK FOR T I WE RE ALL AROUND THE WORLD YOU HAVE TO .
YEAH UH I .
PERFORM THIS CONVERSION ANYWAY .
YEAH I DO TOO .
AND .
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE VE RUN INTO A PROBLEM COURSE .
YOU RE FAMILIAR WITH THE T I DRAWING WELL WITH ANY DRAWING SYSTEM .
RIGHT .
MILS AND MICRONS .
YOU END UP WITH YOU END UP WITH THINGS IN INCHES .
RIGHT .
IN PARTS OF INCHES YOU KNOW HALF FOURTH YOU KNOW THIS SORT OF THING .
RIGHT .
AND THEN YOU END UP WITH A DECIMAL WHERE YOU START GETTING INTO MILS AND THAT SORT OF THING .
RIGHT .
AND THEN SOME OF THEM ARE DONE IN YOU KNOW PURELY METRIC .
YEAH I REMEMBER THAT STINK CAME AROUND IN THE DESIGN AREA .
A FEW YEARS BACK WHEN IT WAS ALL OVERSEAS DESIGNS WERE IN MICRONS AND OURS WERE IN MILS .
UHHUH .
AND IT GOT TO YOU KNOW SOMEWHERE DOWN THE LINE .
THEY WENT STANDARDIZED THEY WENT MICRONS BUT UH YOU JUST YOU KNOW YOU END UP WITH ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS WITH CONVERTING YOUR DESIGNS .
YEAH .
OH I CAN IMAGINE .
SO .
THE UH THE ONE THAT UH UH HAVE YOU EVER LIVED IN A COUNTRY WHERE THEY USE METRIC .
NO .
I WAS WITH T I IN EL SALVADOR FOR A WHILE AND I HAD TO GET USED TO YOU KNOW PURELY METRIC SYSTEM DOWN THERE BECAUSE THEY DID NT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ELSE .
YOU KNOW IF YOU START TALKING ABOUT MILES THEY D LOOK AT YOU LIKE WHAT .
YEAH .
SO I HAD A LITTLE BIT OF EXPERIENCE WITH IT AND ALSO I NOTICED IN CANADA THEY UH YOU DROP A QUARTER FIFTY CENTS WHATEVER IN A COKE MACHINE UP THERE AND YOU GET THIS FUNNY LOOKING COKE YOU KNOW IT S IN A CAN .
THAT S THAT S TALLER BUT NOT AS BIG AROUND .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW I GUESS THAT S SOME .
ABOUT HALF A LITER .
IT S NOT A LITER IT S LIKE A HALF A LITER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
IT S A STRANGE LOOKING CAN .
BUT MY DAUGHTER IN LAW S FROM PANAMA AND SHE HAS THEY HAVE HAD AMERICANS DOWN THERE FOR SO LONG YOU KNOW THAT THEY RE KIND OF INTO BOTH .
SYSTEMS BUT UH SHE GETS REAL CONFUSED ON DISTANCES AND TEMPERATURE IS THE BIG THING .
YEAH .
THE CENTIGRADE .
I WOULD HAVE MORE PROBLEM .
FOR WHICH .
SHE SAYS CELSIUS .
MORE PROBLEM WITH THE TEMPERATURE EXCEPT THAT YOU KNOW WORKING IN ENGINEERING WE DO EVERYTHING IN CENTIGRADE OR CELSIUS .
WELL I HAD KIND OF GOTTEN USED TO CENTIGRADE TEMPERATURE YOU KNOW IF IT S BETWEEN ZERO AND TEN IT S COLD AND IF IT S TEN AND TWENTY IT S NOT TOO BAD IF IT S BETWEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY IT S PRETTY WARM .
IT S GETTING WARM RIGHT .
IF IT S MORE THAN THIRTY IT S JUST HOTTER THAN ALL GET OUT .
SO BUT UH .
THE BIG PROBLEM IS NOT HAVING THE UH THE RESOLUTION BETWEEN TEMPERATURE YOU KNOW BETWEEN A HUNDRED IF YOU RE TALKING ABOUT A HUNDRED DEGREES OR WHAT THIRTY ZERO YOU KNOW THIRTY FOUR DEGREES WHATEVER .
THAT IS .
YOU KNOW YOU DO NT GET ALL THE LITTLE DIFFERENCES .
YEAH IT S ABOUT .
YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SEVENTY AND SEVENTYTWO OR SEVENTYFIVE DEGREES IS NT MUCH BUT THE DIFFERENCE THIRTY AND THIRTYFIVE DEGREES IS QUITE A BIT .
IS ABOUT TWICE AS MUCH WHAT .
IT WORKS OUT TO .
YEAH FIVE .
ONE POINT EIGHT TIMES AS MANY .
YEAH SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
POINTS .
YEAH SO .
I I THINK AS LONG AS PEOPLE HAVE A CHOICE THEY RE GOING TO STICK WITH THE AMERICAN WAY .
UHHUH .
AND UNTIL WE HAVE TO HAVE TO LEARN TO THINK THAT WAY WE WO NT .
YEAH .
THOUGH WE CALL IT .
THE ENGLISH SYSTEM BUT I M NOT SURE WHAT .
THEY DO IN ENGLAND NOW .
THEY RE THEY RE ON METRIC ARE NT THEY .
YEAH FOR THE MOST PART I THINK SO .
YEAH EXCEPT THEY VE GOT A NOW OKAY WE RUN INTO SOME PROBLEMS ONCE I REMEMBER THEY VE GOT A NUT AND BOLTS SYSTEM CALLED WENTWORTH .
AND THIS THING WAS WAS EVEN DIFFERENT THAN YOU KNOW S .
A E STANDARDS AND STUFF .
SO .
RIGHT .
THIS THIS CA OKAY MY DAD BOUGHT ONE OF THESE LITTLE NASH METROPOLITANS HERE A FEW YEARS BA QUITE A FEW YEARS BACK AND THE THING HAD A AUSTIN HEELEY TYPE ENGINE YOU KNOW IT WAS AUSTIN MOTORS ENGINE AND RUNNING GEAR .
RIGHT .
AND THE BODY WAS BUILT BY NASH OR WHO YOU KNOW AMERI THAT WAS EVEN BEFORE AMERICAN MOTORS BUT NASH ESSENTIALLY IN THE U S SOMEWHERE .
AND THAT THING HAD THE DARNDEST COMBINATION OF METRIC AND WENTWORTH AND UH S .
A E .
HE ENDED UP WITH ABOUT THREE SETS OF TOOLS .
HE JUST GET ONE MORE MUMBLEX .
IN ORDER TO WORK ON THAT FOOL THING .
BECAUSE I THINK THE WENTWORTH AND THE S .
A E BOLT SIZES WERE THE SAME BUT THE THREADS WERE DIFFERENT AND UH .
OH THAT WOULD BE A MESS .
IT WAS A TOTAL MESS .
AND ON MY CHEVY VAN .
THAT S A COUPLE OF YEARS OLD .
PART OF IT S BUILT IN CANADA .
MATTER OF FACT THE THING IS I ALWAYS SAY IT S BUILT OFF SHORE YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT WAS ASSEMBLED IN CANADA .
THE ONLY THING .
THAT WAS IN IT WAS BUILT IN THE U S WAS THE UH DIFFERENTIAL AND IT WAS BUILT IN BUFFALO NEW YORK .
BUT IT S GOT THE HARDEST COMBINATION OF UH METRIC AND MOST OF THE BODY PARTS SEEM TO BE METRIC AND MOST OF THE ENGINE PARTS SEEM TO BE S .
A E SO .
IT S JUST CRAZY .
RIGHT .
IT JUST GETS BAD NOW YOU GOT TO YOU GOT TO HAVE ONE AND NOT MIX THEM UP .
YEAH .
BECAUSE YOU RE NEVER GOING TO GET TO ONE ONE SYSTEM IF YOU STILL GOT A GOT A MIX .
AND OF COURSE HERE THAT THAT WOULD INVOLVE CHANGING ROAD SIGNS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY YOU KNOW MILES PER HOUR TO KILOMETERS PER HOUR AND THE WHOLE NINE YARDS .
KIND OF HARD TO DO GRADUALLY .
I THOUGHT MAYBE THEY WOULD CONVERT TO UH METRIC BACK WHEN THEY WENT TO THE FIFTYFIVE MILE .
AN HOUR SPEED LIMIT BECAUSE WHAT IS IT .
YEAH .
FIFTYSIX OR FIFTYSEVEN S A HUNDRED UH QUA A HUNDRED KILOMETERS AND YOU KNOW .
HELL YOU D HAVE PEOPLE DOING A HUNDRED MILES .
AN HOUR .
YEAH YOU D HAVE HUNDREDS ON THE SIGN LOOKS LOT BETTER THAN FIFTY FIVE YOU D HAVE PEOPLE GOING YOU RE RIGHT A HUNDRED MILES .
AN HOUR .
YEAH .
AND SO .
I DO NT KNOW I D KIND OF AND THE OTHER THING TOO IS YOU KNOW BETWEEN HERE AND EL PASO S WHAT FIVE HUNDRED MILES BUT IT S ALMOST EIGHT HUNDRED KILOMETERS YOU KNOW .
THAT D SURE SEEMS LIKE A LONG WAY .
YEAH BUT THEY D NEED THEY D SEEM TO BE TICKING OFF FASTER TOO .
YEAH I GUESS THAT S IT .
EVERY ROAD SIGN .
YOU COME TO IS LIKE WELL I DO NT KNOW IT THAT FAR .
WELL THEY CONVERTED ALL THE ROAD SIGNS TO FIFTYFIVE MILES .
AN HOUR YOU KNOW THEY COULD VE CONVERTED IT TO METRIC JUST ABOUT AS EASY .
YEAH I THINK THEY YOU GOT THE PROBLEM WITH ALL YOUR CARS ARE STILL YEAH YOU STILL GOT CARS ON THE ROAD .
THAT DO NT HAVE BOTH .
YEAH .
AT THAT TIME ANYWAY THAT WAS STILL WHEN THINGS WERE THE METRIC SYSTEM WAS STILL NOT .
NOT ALL THAT COMMON .
YOU KNOW NOW CARS THEY HAVE BOTH .
SOONER OR LATER THEY LL START PUTTING THE MILES ON THE INSIDE AND THE KILOMETERS IN BIG NUMBERS SO PEOPLE START THINKING THAT WAY .
I KNOW THE ONLY OTHER PLACE THAT I WAS EVER AT WHERE THEY REALLY HAD IT MIXED WAS WAS IN PANAMA WHERE S A LOT OF THE ROAD SIGNS AND EVERYTHING ARE IN IN MILES PER HOUR AND SOME ARE IN KILOMETERS .
AND YOU GOT TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE .
YEAH .
BECAUSE ANYTHING .
THAT WAS THE OLD CANAL ZONE IS GOING TO BE MILES PER HOUR .
HI CYNTHIA .

WELL UH JUST REALLY THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS SINCE THIS UH THE U N DEBATE OR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT THAT UH VOTED ON WHETHER THERE WAS GOING TO BE A CEASE FIRE I GUESS YOU KNOW THE THING REALLY IS NT OVER .
UHHUH .
THEY UH THEY HAD UH KIND OF UH I DO NT KNOW IF YOU CALL IT STANDOUT OR WHATEVER BUT ANYWAY THEY STOPPED AND WAITED TO SEE IF IRAQ WOULD ACCEPT A PERMANENT CEASE FIRE SITUATION THOUGH AS I UNDERSTAND IT FROM THE IRAQI POINT OF VIEW THIS CURRENT CEASE FIRE THING THAT THE U N UH HAD SET UP YOU KNOW THE IRAQIS ARE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO GO FOR AT ALL .
UHHUH .
UNLESS THEY RE JUST ABSOLUTELY FORCED TO .
UM .
SO I GUESS FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THE THING COULD JUST .
START UP .
IT COULD JUST THEY COULD TAKE OFF AT ANY MOMENT WITHOUT UH YOU KNOW YOU KNOW ANY LOCAL YOU KNOW CONGRESSIONAL EFFORT OR ANYTHING ELSE BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT S NOT REALLY SETTLED YET .
THERE S NO OFFICIAL DOCUMENT SIGNED OR ANYTHING .
NOT YET NOT YET AT ALL .
WELL I UM WHEN THE WHEN THE CRISIS BEGAN LAST AUGUST I BEGAN TO THINK WELL I I COULD NT REMEMBER THINGS THAT I HAD STUDIED IN THE PAST IN SCHOOL AND ALL SO I GOT OUT LIKE MY ENCYCLOPEDIAS AND TRIED TO READ ABOUT THE HISTORY .
UHHUH .
AND IT WAS REALLY WHAT I FELT WAS KIND OF CYNICAL BECAUSE IT THERE JUST HAS NT BEEN ANY PEACE OVER THERE EVER .
NO .
IN THOUSANDS OF YEARS .
YEAH I DO NT KNOW .
OF HISTORY .
WHY THEY EXPECT IT S GOING TO START THIS WEEK YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
THAT S RIGHT AND IT JUST IT S JUST NOT PEOPLE THEY AND IT S NOT UH YOU KNOW THERE IS NT ANY REAL ARAB COALITION BECAUSE THEY DO FIGHT AMONG THEMSELVES .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND THEY FIGHT WITH EACH OTHER AND THEY HAVE SUCH HATRED FOR UH ISRAEL AND .
YEAH THE UH THE THING THAT S KIND OF INTERESTING ABOUT THIS MY SONS IN THE AIR FORCE .
OH YEAH .
AND UH HE CAME WITHIN A QUARTER OF AN INCH OF GOING UH TO SAUDI HE ENDED UP IN KOREA INSTEAD AND BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY SPLIT A TRANSPORTATION GROUP OUT IN LUBBOCK .
UM .
SO HE ENDED UP GOING TO KOREA AND HIS BUDDIES ENDED UP GOING TO SAUDI WELL HE S STILL IN KOREA AND HIS BUDDIES HOME NOW .
OH NO .
HE HE ALMOST WISHES THAT THAT HE COULD HAVE GONE HOME .
AND GOT IT OVER WITH .
YEAH .
WELL I JUST THERE S JUST NO WAY FOR US TO BE INVOLVED OVER THERE AND HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE MUCH PEACE .
UHHUH .
AND UM WITH AND THAT I M AFRAID THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO STAY .
YEAH THE THING UH THE OTHER THING TOO WHEN THIS ALL STARTED IF YOU YOU KNOW IF YOU DID MUCH READING ON THE THING YOU KNOW KUWAIT THE COUNTRY OF KUWAIT WAS JUST YOU KNOW SOMEBODY S UH YOU GO BACK TO WORLD WAR I WHEN THE UH OTTOMAN EMPIRE BROKE UP .
UHHUH .
AND THE BRITISH AND THE FRENCH .
UHHUH .
AND THE YEAH THE BRITISH AND THE FRENCH MOSTLY DECIDED TO CARVE UP THAT PART OF THE WORLD AND CALL PART OF IT PERSIA .
UHHUH .
AND PART OF IT IRAQ AND PART OF IT SOMETHING ELSE YOU KNOW AND THEY THEY SPLIT THINGS ALONG UM GEOGRAPHICAL LINES BUT THEY DID NT TAKE ANY KIND OF CONSIDERATION INTO UH SOCIAL OR CULTURAL THINGS AT ALL .
RIGHT .
SO THE COUNTRY OF .
OF KUWAIT REALLY DOES NT MAKE JUST A WHOLE LOT OF SENSE EXCEPT THAT IT IS AN EXCEPTED PLACE YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
IT S LIKE ANY OTHER COUNTRY YOU KNOW FOR WHATEVER REASON IT S IT S ACTUALLY THERE WELL IRAQ HAS HAD UH DESIGNS ON THAT PLACE SINCE NINETEEN TWENTYTWO SO YOU KNOW IT WAS NT LIKE SOMETHING THAT JUST SUDDENLY POPPED UP .
YEAH .
AND IT S JUST THAT THIS WAS AN EXCUSE YOU KNOW TO MAKE SOME NOISE NOW SOMETHING THAT I READ IN THE PAPER THE OTHER DAY THAT I THOUGHT WAS KIND OF INTERESTING WAS THAT THE ARAB UH UH THEIR VERSION OR VISION OR WHATEVER THE UNITED STATES NOW IS SOMEWHAT CHANGED IN THAT WE WON YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
NOW NOW WE ARE A UH A LEGITIMATE PLAYER .
IN THE GAME OVER THERE YOU KNOW THE THE I DO NT THINK WE CAN REALLY UNDERSTAND THEIR ATTITUDE BECAUSE THERE CULTURES ARE JUST SO MUCH DIFFERENT .
RIGHT .
BUT UH WE ARE NOW A LEGITIMATE PLAYER IN THE IN THE IN THE GAME BECAUSE WE CAME IN WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FORCE AND WE YOU KNOW WE DEFEATED YOU KNOW IRAN COULD NT DO IT IN SEVEN YEARS AND WE WENT IN AND DID IN SEVEN DAYS WHAT IRAN COULD NT DO IN SEVEN YEARS YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
SO .
RIGHT .
THAT KIND OF UPS OUR STOCK IN THERE JUST A LITTLE BIT IT MAKES US MORE LEGITIMATE SO NOW WHAT THEY RE SAYING IS THAT WELL SINCE WE WON WHATEVER WE SAY GOES BECAUSE IT S UH A KIND OF A MIGHT MAKE STRIKE SORT OF ATTITUDE ABOUT IT AND YOU KNOW WE VE GOT THE POWER .
YEAH .
WHICH IS WHY FOR CENTURIES OR HUNDREDS OF YEARS THE BRITISH AND THE FRENCH HAD SO MUCH INFLUENCE IN THERE BECAUSE THEY D GO IN AND THEY D WIN SOMETHING .
RIGHT .
AND THEN AND THEN THEY COULD CALL THE SHOTS FOR THE YOU KNOW PERIOD OF TIME UNTIL THE NEXT STRONG MAN CAME UP AND YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
AND CAUSED PROBLEMS .
WELL I JUST UH I M NOT INTERESTED IN KEEPING BIG MILITARY OVER THERE AND HAVING TO GO AND CALL THE SHOTS LIKE YOU SAY .
YEAH YEAH .
AND I JUST WOULD PREFER THAT I MEAN SOMETIMES WE VE SAID LET S KEEP WE RE NOT INTERESTED IN WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES DO .
UHHUH .
AND THEN OTHER TIMES WE JUMP IN AND DO THINGS AND WHILE I M GLAD THAT THEY UH I IT WAS IMPORTANT DE DEMILITARIZE THAT AREA BECAUSE OF ALL THE BUILD UP ARMAMENTS .
YEAH .
I DO NT MUMBLEX I HOPE WE DO NT TRY TO KEEP UH IN THERE AND TRY TO KEEP OUR FINGERS IN THE POT AND TRY TO .
UM .
STAY OVER THERE BECAUSE WE JUST DO NT WANT TO SEND OUR PEOPLE THERE AND MAKE THEM STAY .
YEAH THAT S THAT S THE UH THAT S THAT S THE BIG THING YOU KNOW WE STILL GOT A LITTLE BIT OF THE OLD YOU KNOW VIETNAM UM PROBLEM YOU KNOW IN THE BACK OF OUR MINDS WE .
YEAH .
WE GOT THIS WE RE WE RE USED TO WARS WHERE YOU CAN GET IN DO THE JOB AND GET OUT VIETNAM WE NEVER DID GET OUT YOU KNOW NEVER DID GET THE JOB DONE BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO HAM STRUNG .
YEAH .
UH THIS THING THEY THEY GAVE THE GUYS UH THE POWER AND THE MATERIAL AND THE TOLD THEM TO GO DO IT AND THEY DID IT YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
GOT IN AND GOT OUT I M NOT SURE THE THE BIG FUSS THAT WE RE GOING TO SEE NOW FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS I WOULD THINK IS UH YOU KNOW THE UH THE BUSINESS WITH THE UH THE SHIITES OF ALL PEOPLE YOU KNOW IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY AND ALSO THE KURDS BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE EVIDENTLY ARE YOU KNOW BEING KILLED OFF BY THE THOUSANDS .
YEAH .
AND WHETHER THE THE UNITED NATIONS I DO NT THINK THE U S WILL DO IT ON THEIR OWN BUT WHETHER THE UNITED NATIONS COMES AROUND AND SAYS HEY WAIT A MINUTE WE KNOW THIS THING IS NT UH ALL THAT MUCH OVER WE VE GOT TO GO BACK IN THERE AND AND BE SURE THAT THIS LARGE POPULATION IS NT JUST WIPED OUT .
UHHUH .
WHICH IS SEEMS TO BE EXACTLY WHAT S HAPPENING RIGHT AT THE MOMENT .
UHHUH I NOTICED THAT .
BUT UM YOU KNOW .
WELL I DO NT THINK THERE S MUCH HOPE FOR A LASTING PEACE OVER THERE LIKE THEY .
OH WELL .
EXPECT .
NO NO .
THERE THERE NEVER WILL BE .
YEAH .
I MEAN UH UH THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU RE GOING TO HAVE PEACE OVER THERE IF IF WE DETERMINE THAT WE WANT TO GO IN AND WIPE OUT EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM YOU KNOW UNTIL WE MAKE A DECISION TO DO THAT THERE WO NT BE PEACE BUT I DO NT THINK WE WANT TO MAKE THAT DECISION EITHER .
NO .

WOW .
AND I REMEMBER THAT WHEN I WAS A KID UH .
UHHUH .
TO HAVE THE HAM COOKING UH RATHER THAN THAT WE JUST HAM IS JUST SOMETHING YOU HAVE FOR BREAKFAST OCCASIONALLY YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
AND THAT S IT YOU KNOW .
IN THE OLD DAYS WE HAD HAMS WERE THE MEAL AND I DO NT I DO NT THINK WE .
RIGHT .
REALLY HAVE IT AS A MAIN MEAL .
THAT S TRUE I I DO NT THINK SO ANYMORE NOT WITH MORE BECOMING MORE CONSCIOUS OF UH FAT AND CHOLESTEROL AND AND ALL THOSE .
RIGHT .
GOOD THINGS .
THAT S AN INTERESTING POINT HOW HOW HAVE YOU CHANGED YOUR YOUR MEALS NOW HAVE YOU INTO THAT UH .
OH YEAH .
LOOKING AT THOSE THINGS .
WELL MY PARENTS ACTUALLY STARTED IT .
UHHUH .
AND UH GETTING .
PARENTS THAT S UNUSUAL .
WELL IT IT S TRUE I THINK MY PARENTS ARE VERY UNUSUAL BECAUSE UH WE GREW UP IN THE SOUTH WHERE UH YOU HAVE ALL THE UH YOU KNOW BISCUITS AND GRAVY .
OH YEAH .
AND OH FRIED FOODS GALORE AND THEN GRADUALLY THEY STARTED SWITCHING OVER TO UH PLAIN RICE UH NO GRAVY .
THAT S AMAZING .
IT S JUST IT REALLY IS THEY UH THEY RE ACTUALLY THEY ACTUALLY UH UH LED US THROUGH IT VERSUS UH US TEACHING THEM YOU KNOW THE UH THE FINER POINTS BUT MY MOTHER HAS REALLY HIGH CHOLESTEROL SO IT WAS .
YEAH .
ONE OF THE REASONS WHICH STARTED THEM OFF AND THEY STARTED DOING THIS LIKE IN THE EARLY OR IN ABOUT THE MIDDLE SEVENTIES .
WELL THAT S AMAZING .
UH YEAH .
THEY D GO THAT THEY HAVE STARTED USUALLY IT S THE YOUNGER PEOPLE DOING IT YEAH .
IT S TRUE IT S TRUE I AGREE WITH YOU .
I UH .
SO IT S REALLY NEAT .
MY MY WIFE S MOTHER IS THE ONLY GRANDPARENT LEFT AND UH .
UHHUH .
SHE HAS HIGH CHOLESTEROL OF COURSE I HA I HAVE TOO BUT NOT LIKE HERS .
UHHUH .
AND I ALWAYS GET AFTER HER ABOUT SALT AND EVERYTHING ELSE AND SHE JUST WILL I MEAN SHE S GOING TO EAT THE SAME WAY SHE ATE YOU KNOW .
THAT S RIGHT .
HER WHOLE LIFE AND SHE JUST TELLS MORE OR LESS TELLS ME TO SHUT UP YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
AND UH I LIKE TO I M TRYING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT MY CHOLESTEROL IN THE SAME WAY .
UHHUH .
UH .
UHHUH .
UH IT S IT S NOT THE MUMBLEX I LISTEN TO UH LARRY NEWARTH ON THE WEEKEND HE S A FITNESS EXPERT AND UH HE TALKS ABOUT YOU KNOW THE CHICKEN AND THE RICE .
UHHUH .
AND EVERYTHING ELSE AND AND UH THROWING AWAY PEANUT BUTTER AND ALL THE THINGS .
YOU KNOW THE THINGS NOT TO EAT YOU KNOW EVER I THINK THE PEANUT BUTTER AND MAYONNAISE HE WOULD THROW AWAY FOR EVER AND THEN HE S GOT ME INTO MAKING EGGS WITHOUT THE YOLK .
WOW .
YOU KNOW TRY THAT SOMETIME .
UHHUH .
MY WIFE SAYS SHE CA NT STAND IT BUT UH WHEN I MAKE SCRAMBLED EGGS NOW TALKING ABOUT A RECIPE .
UHHUH .
I SAY IF I HAVE FOUR EGGS NOT NOT FOR ME BUT IF I M MAKING FOUR EGGS UH EVEN FOR MY DAUGHTER AND I I LL TAKE OUT ALL THE YOLKS BUT ONE .
WOW .
AND AND IT S FINE YOU YOU DO NT MISS IT UH .
HUH .
IN FACT WHEN I WHEN I MAKE EGGS FOR MYSELF IF I IF I FRY THEM THROW THEM IN THERE I WILL ALMOST HARD FRY THEM SO I CAN TAKE NOT EAT THE YOLK AT ALL .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND YOU DO NT REALLY MISS IT YOU GET THE FLAVOR OF THE YOLK BUT UH YOU DO NT EAT IT AT ALL YOU KNOW YOU DO NT THEY RE HARD YOU GET LIKE UH A BITE AT AT THE M MOST .
UHHUH .
AND SO UH FOR CHOLESTEROL I MEAN I M TRYING THAT AND IT HAS WORKED MY CHOLESTEROL GONE DOWN TWENTY POINTS SO ALTHOUGH .
WOW THAT S GOOD .
I HAVE NT GOTTEN ON THE WHICH WHETHER YU BUTTER OR CHOLEST NOT CHOLESTEROL MARGARINE AND ALL THAT I DO NT KNOW KNOW WHETHER ANY OF THAT IS TRUE YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
WHETHER THE MARGARINES OR BUTTER .
OKAY .
OKAY WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT CRIME I DO NT KNOW THE ONE THING THAT KEEPS COMING TO MIND TO ME IS THAT THEY RE THEY DO NT HAVE ENOUGH SPACE IN THE PRISONS TO PUT PEOPLE AND THEY KEEP LETTING OUT PEOPLE THAT HAVE YOU KNOW THESE HORRIBLE RECORDS .
UHHUH .
SO MAYBE WE NEED TO HAVE MORE PRISONS OR USE THE OLD ARMY BASES AND MAKE THEM INTO PRISONS OR SOMETHING THAT S ONE THING I GUESS I COULD THINK OF .
UHHUH .
UH IT S DEFINITELY A BIG CONCERN .
I MEAN EVERY DAY IT S YOU KNOW ALL AR WE LIVE IN A LITTLE SMALL TOWN AND THERE S JUST RAPES AND MURDERS AND BURGLARIES AND EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME AND YOU JUST CA NT GET AWAY FROM IT NO MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE .
YEAH WELL I .
SO IT S PRETTY SCARY .
I M I M FROM BUTLER AND I CA NT SAY THAT THERE S TOO MUCH OF THAT THERE .
UHHUH .
UM I KNOW THE BIGGER CITIES HAVE PROBLEMS WITH IT .
YEAH .
UH I REALLY DO NT KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT .
YEAH .
UNLESS .
IT S ROUGH BECAUSE .
THEY START ENFORCING THE UH UH START GIVING MORE PEOPLE DEATH SENTENCES THAT S THE ONLY THING I CAN THINK OF .
YEAH YEAH WELL EVEN SOME OF THE SENTENCES JUST SEEM RIDICULOUS I MEAN YOU HEAR ABOUT PEOPLE YOU KNOW SIX AND SEVEN TIMES HAVE COMMITTED BURGLARIES AND THEY RE STILL YOU KNOW ONLY SERVING SIX MONTHS IN PRISON SO THAT S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THEY COULD HAVE A MORE AUTOMATIC SENTENCE INSTEAD OF HAVING THE JUDGE HAVING THE CHOICE OF LIKE YOU KNOW FROM ONE MONTH TO TEN YEARS OR SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
THAT WOULD BE ONE THING THAT YOU KNOW I THINK COULD HELP IS HAVING THE LAWS BE CHANGED SO THAT THEY WERE MORE STIFF PENALTIES AND MORE AUTOMATIC PENALTIES YOU KNOW FOR CERTAIN CRIMES .
YEAH .
YEAH .
I I UH I DO NT KNOW WHAT THEY RE GOING TO DO WITH THE PROBLEM BECAUSE IT JUST KEEPS GETTING WORSE AND WORSE .
YEAH AND ONE THINGS THAT THEY RE SAYING NOW ARE YOU GOING ARE YOU A STUDENT OR ARE YOU IN THE WORK FORCE OR .
UM I M A SENIOR AT CLARION UNIVERSITY .
OH OKAY BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT L UM LATELY IS THE SITUATIONS ON CAMPUS WHERE CRIME HAS GONE UP SO MUCH AND APPARENTLY MANY OF THE ESPECIALLY LIKE IN DATE RAPE MANY OF THE UH YOU KNOW PERPETRATORS SEEM TO BE GETTING OFF BECAUSE THE UNIVERSITIES KIND OF COVER UP .
WELL .
AND THEY DO NT REALLY .
NOT ONLY THAT A LOT OF THEM S NOT EVEN TURNED IN YOU KNOW .
WOW .
WHAT I MEAN A LOT OF TIMES .
YEAH .
THE GIRLS DO NT EVEN REPORT IT .
YEAH YEAH .
UM I VE HEARD OF A FEW CASE UP HERE BUT I CA NT SAY THAT I VE HEARD OF UH YOU KNOW ANY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT .
YEAH .
UH BUT THEN AGAIN LIKE YOU DO NT KNOW HOW MANY GIRLS ARE REPORTING THEM OR NOT .
YEAH THEY SAY LIKE ONLY ONE IN TEN ARE REPORTED I BELIEVE IT .
UHHUH .
THAT S AWFUL SO ONE THING THEY COULD DO IS PROBABLY SUPPORT PEOPLE MORE REPORTING IT I KNOW SOME POLICE AGENCIES TRY TO HAVE WOMEN POLICE OFFICERS THAT THE WOMEN CAN REPORT TO AND THIS KIND OF THING BUT I M SURE IT S STILL TERRIBLY TRAUMATIZING YOU KNOW FOR PEOPLE TO REPORT IT .
UHHUH .
SO THAT S PROBABLY SOMETHING ELSE THEY COULD DO .
YEAH .
I DO NT KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING ELSE IN TERMS OF CRIME IS CERTAINLY INVOLVED WITH DRUGS .
YOU KNOW AND THAT S LIKE AS LONG AS IT ALMOST MAKES ME FEEL IN A WAY LIKE MAKING DRUGS LEGALIZED JUST TO GET ALL THE MONEY OUT OF IT AND NOT HAVE YOU KNOW BECAUSE THESE KIDS ARE SAYING WHY SHOULD I GO TO HIGH SCHOOL AND SO I CAN GO OUT AND WORK AT BURGER KING YOU KNOW FOR FOUR DOLLARS AN HOUR OR WHATEVER WHEN I CAN MAKE FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS A DAY SELLING DRUGS SO THAT S CERTAINLY A BIG PROBLEM I DO NT KNOW WHAT THE SOLUTION TO THAT IS HAVING MORE DRUG TREATMENT CENTERS AVAILABLE JEEZ I DO NT KNOW .
UH SEE YOU SEE NOW I WOULD SAY THAT THAT S A BIGGER PROBLEM UP HERE THAN EVEN THE DATE RAPE OR ANYTHING .
YEAH .
I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT PARTAKE IN THAT AND I M NOT SAYING THEY RE BAD PEOPLE BUT I I I WOULD SAY THAT S A BIGGER PROBLEM .
YEAH BECAUSE IT ENDS UP EVEN IF IT S JUST KIND OF LIKE THIS SOCIAL DRUG USE YOU RE STILL ENDING UP SUPPORTING THESE BIG DRUG PIN YOU KNOW HUGE AMOUNTS THOUSAND AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE GETTING SPENT YOU KNOW ON HIGHER AND HIGHER UP .
UHHUH .
ON DRUGS AND IT S DEFINITELY GOT TO DO WITH CRIME YOU KNOW YOU HEAR ABOUT PEOPLE SELLING THEIR BABIES YOU KNOW TO GET SOME CRACK .
I MEAN JUST OH GOSH HORRIBLE STUFF LIKE THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THEY RE DOING IS IS THEY RE PROSECUTING THE WOMEN WHO ARE HAVING THESE KIDS THAT ARE ADDICTED TO CRACK .
UHHUH .
THEY SAID UH SOME OF THE STATIS STATISTICS SHOW LIKE ONE OUT OF EVERY TEN BABIES BEING BORN IN THESE PUBLIC HOSPITALS ARE ADDICTED TO CRACK AND THEIR MOMS ARE CRACK USERS SO THAT S YOU KNOW ANOTHER WAY OF LOOKING AT IT IS AS THE WOMAN IS BEING A CRIMINAL YOU KNOW FOR DOING THAT TO HER CHILD .
UHHUH .
SO I DO NT KNOW WHO S THE VICTIM THERE I MEAN THE KIDS ARE THE VICTIM IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF TIMES THE WOMEN ARE VICTIMS BECAUSE THEY RE ADDICTED AND IT S A VERY COMPLICATED PROBLEM I DO NT ENVY THE GOVERNMENT TRYING TO COPE WITH IT GOSH .
NO I DO NT EITHER .
YEAH WELL I GUESS THAT S ABOUT ALL I HAVE TO SAY .
UH .
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WOULD WANT TO .
NO .
OKAY .
I CA NT SAY THAT I I JUST KNOW THAT IT S REALLY BAD IN SOME AREAS AND SOMETHING S GOING TO HAVE TO BE DONE SOONER BUT .
YEAH .
I DO NT I DO NT KNOW WHAT THEY CAN DO .
YEAH YEAH IT S FRUSTRATING .
UHHUH WELL .
OKAY WELL .
IT WAS NICE TALKING TO YOU .
THANKS FOR TALKING HAVE A GOOD DAY .
YOU TOO BYE .
BYE BYE .
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK OF OUR TRIAL SYSTEM .
HUH I DO NT REALLY KNOW WHAT TO THINK ABOUT IT BUT I DO KNOW THAT THEY RE NOT YOU KNOW THEY LL GIVE SOMEBODY TWENTYFIVE YEARS AND THEY LL SERVE WHAT EIGHT MONTHS .
YEAH .
HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT .
YEAH I HAVE NOTICED THAT THAT THAT KIND OF STUFF DOES SEEM TO HAPPEN QUITE A BIT UM YEAH .
UHHUH AND UH .
I DO NT I DO NT I DO NT EVEN KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT THAT SORT OF THING .
BUT I THINK TRIAL BY JURY IS IT S A LOT BETTER THAN LEAVING IT UP TO ONE PERSON .
YEAH I THINK TRIAL BY JURY IS VERY GOOD I ACTUALLY THEY SAID I THINK THE TAPE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT CHANGING UH CHANGING IT SUCH THAT THE .
MUMBLEX .
OR LEAVING SENTENCING UP TO THE JUDGE ONLY I THINK THAT S ACTUALLY GOOD IDEA .
LEAVING IT UP TO THE JUDGE .
WE JUST JUST SENTENCING NOT THE TRIAL ITSELF .
OH OKAY .
UM BECAUSE I THINK THAT TH THAT THAT JUDGES ARE PROBABLY MORE INFORMED AS TO WHAT IS .
YEAH .
HOW SERIOUS THE NATURE OF THE CRIME IS .
WELL RIGHT BECAUSE .
AND STUFF LIKE THAT AN .
THE GENERAL PUBLIC DOES NT KNOW THAT IF I IF THEY RE SENTENCED TO LIFE THAT THEY WO NT SERVE LIFE .
RIGHT .
COURSE THE JUDGE WILL KNOW WHEN HE LL BE UP FOR PAROLE AND ALL THAT SO YEAH .
RIGHT SO HE LL BE ABLE TO GIVE THEM THE MAXIMUM SENTENCE IN SOME CASES THERE .
OKAY I MUST NOT HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE WHOLE THING BECAUSE I DID NT HEAR THEM SAY THAT BUT YEAH .
OH YEAH THE THE THEY GIVE THAT AS AS AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THAT .
UHHUH .
THAT MIGHT HAPPEN YE .
BUT I THINK IF THE ENTIRE TRIAL WAS LEFT TO ONE PERSON I VE GOT A FOUR YEAR OLD YOU CAN HEAR .
OH YES .
BUT UH I DO NT KNOW YOU PE TOO MANY PEOPLE CAN TAKE VENDETTAS OUT ON PEOPLE .
RIGHT .
AND EVERYTHING .
OR JUST YOU KNOW THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE WHO SAY WELL HE JUST LOOKS GUILTY UM .
RIGHT BUT THAT S TRUE .
THAT S ACTUALLY THAT S A WONDERFUL WAY TO GET OFF JURY DUTY YOU KNOW SOMEONE SAYS TO YOU YOU KNOW WHEN THEY ASK YOU IF YOU UH IF YOU WANT TO BE ON YOU KNOW WHEN YOU RE CALLED FOR DUTY SAY OH YEAH I WANT TO BE ON JURY DUTY BECAUSE I CAN SPOT A GUILTY PERSON A MILE A WAY .
YEAH .
THEY QUICKLY LET YOU OFF JURY DUTY I HEAR UM .
RIGHT BECAUSE THEY THEY KNOW THAT YOU RE BIASED .
OH YEAH THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT S THAT S THE WAY IT WORKS THERE UM ANYWAY I THINK THAT PROBABLY FOR FOR HAVING IT WHAT ABOUT YOU KNOW ABOUT BEING UNANIMOUS I MEAN THAT S SORT OF A STRANGE CASE BECAUSE I WONDER WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ELEVEN PEOPLE THINKS SOMEONE S GUILTY AND ONE PERSON DOES NT ONE PERSON THINKS THAT THAT THEY RE NOT GUILTY AND THEY CA NT DECIDE FOR HOURS UNLESS THEY CONVINCE THAT ONE PERSON YOU KNOW .
DOES IT HAVE TO BE UNANIMOUS .
I BELIEVE IT DOES HAVE TO BE UNANIMOUS ACTUALLY .
WELL THEN THEY CONSIDER IT A HUNG JURY I G I THINK AND THEN THEY UH HAVE A RETRIAL OR DO THEY .
YEAH I THINK THEY EITHER HAVE A RETRIAL EVENTUALLY OR OR THEY CALL IT A MISTRIAL OR SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
I HAVE NT BEEN TO LAW SCHOOL .
NO ME NEITHER .
SO I DO NT KNOW MUCH ABOUT THAT .
I JUST KNOW THAT UM I WONDER CAUSE SOMETIMES I THINK ABOUT IT ACTUALLY I THINK WELL WHAT IF I WERE THAT ONE PERSON AND I WAS COMPLETELY CONVINCED THAT THAT THAT THAT THIS PERSON WAS NT GUILTY YOU KNOW .
WELL YOU DO NT HAVE TO BE REALLY CONVINCED THAT HE S GUILTY IT S JUST IF THEY CA NT PROVE HE S GUILTY BECAUSE .
RIGHT UH BUT I MEAN WHAT IF ELEVEN OTHER PEOPLE ARE SAYING ONE THING YOU KNOW AND YOU RE .
YEAH .
YOU RE THE ONE PERSON SAYING THE OTHER THING YOU KNOW WOULD YOU GIVE IN .
I WOULD HATE TO BE THAT PERSON BECAUSE YOU WOULD BE UH YOU KNOW BOMBARDED BY ALL THE OTHER ELEVEN JURORS .
YEAH SAYING .
TO YOU KNOW JUST SAY HE S GUILTY SO WE CAN GET OUT OF HERE AND GO HOME .
YEAH YEAH .
YEAH .
I WONDER ABOUT THOSE THINGS YOU KNOW OR EVEN IF IT S YOU KNOW I I GUESS IF THEY WERE TO SAY WELL IT DOES NT HAVE TO BE UNANIMOUS WHAT S THE CUT OFF NUMBER SEVEN FIVE YOU KNOW SIX SIX .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU DECIDE IS IT YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVE TO SAY THAT .
YEAH I KNOW IT S TOO BAD ONE OF US DO NT HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ON THIS HUH .
BUT BUT UM I DO NT KNOW I JUST HOPE IF I EVER GO TO COURT THAT THEY ALL UNANIMOUS ON NOT GUILTY .
WELL YOU VE SEEN LIKE THESE T V MOVIES .
YEAH .
KYLE I M TALKING HUSH BUT UH WELL HOW THEY LL YOU KNOW THE THROUGH THE WHOLE MOVIE YOU THINK THIS PERSON S I DO NT KNOW BUT ONE THING THAT I THOUGHT WAS PRETTY WEIRD IS HOW SOMEBODY CA NT BE TRIALED TRIED TRI UH EXCUSE ME TWICE FOR THE SAME CRIME .
YEAH I VE NEVER QUITE UNDERSTOOD THAT UM .
WELL I JUST THINK IT S IT S WEIRD BECAUSE I VE SAW WELL OF COURSE SOAP OPERAS I M AN SOAP OPERA FANATIC .
OKAY .
THIS ONE GUY HAD UH FRAMED HIMSELF TO MAKE IT WE WHICH HE REALLY DID KILL THE PERSON BUT THEN HE SET IT UP WHERE IT LOOKED LIKE SOMEBODY WAS TRYING TO FRAME HIM AND HE WAS ON TRIAL FOR IT AND THEN YOU KNOW IT CAME OUT THAT HE WAS BEING FRAMED SO THEN HE WAS FOUND NOT GUILTY AND THEN TH DIRECTLY AFTER THE TRIAL THEY FOUND OUT HE REALLY WAS GUILTY AND HE COULD NT BE TRIED AGAIN .
RIGHT AND THEY CA NT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT .
YEAH BECA .
YEAH I OFTEN WONDER ABOUT THAT I WONDER IF IF MAYBE YOU KNOW I I I DO NT I DO NT I DO NT KNOW THE LAW ON THAT BUT IF THEY HAVE NEW EVIDENCE CAN THEY CAN THEY RETRY OR CAN THEY YOU KNOW BRING YOU BACK .
NO I DO NT THINK THEY CAN YOU KNOW I SAW IT ON L A LAW TOO .
OH ACTUALLY THAT S TRUE I VE SEEN THE SAME THING ON L A LAW AS WELL .
YEAH ABOUT THAT WOMAN .
YEAH W SO I WOND AND THEN I WONDER WHY THAT YOU KNOW THERE THERE MUST BE SOME SORT OF DEEP SEEDED REASON FOR THAT YO YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE SOMETHING LIKE WELL YOU CA NT BE TRIED FOR THE SAME TRIAL BECAUSE THAT WOULD BIAS THE THE THE THE JURY OR SOMETHING OR YOU KNOW .
RIGHT AND I M SURE THAT YOU KNOW IT S THE LAWYERS .
YEAH UHHUH .
UH AFTER THE UH DEFENDANT DEFENDING OH THE DEFENDANT S LAWYER AND THE PROSECUTING ATTORNEY I M SURE THE PROSECUTING ATTORNEY COULD MAKE A REAL GOOD CASE IF HE YOU KNOW KNEW ALL THE DETAILS OF THE DEFENDANT S YOU KNOW CASE .
IN IN OF THE DEFENSE MUMBLEX .
RIGHT .
YEAH WELL WELL THERE S ALSO THE ISSUE OF FOR INSTANCE YOU CA NT UM YOU CA NT VERY OFTEN YOU CA NT UM WHEN SOMEONE IS IS ON TRIAL FOR SOMETHING YOU CA NT BRING UP PRIOR CONVICTIONS .
RIGHT .
WHICH .
LIKE IF THEY RE ON TR UH TRIAL FOR RAPE YOU CA NT HAVE ANY YOU CA NT BRING UP THE SEXUAL ASSAULTS AND STUFF OR WHATEVER .
RIGHT THAT S COMPLETELY BEYOND ME I MEAN THAT S JUS .
YEAH I KNOW IF IT S RELATED .
I WONDER .
IF IT S RELATED TO THE CRIME THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO .
YEAH I MEAN IF THIS MAN IS IS ACCUSED OF RAPING SOMEONE THEN I THINK THAT SOMETHING LIKE SEX YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
THE FACT THAT HE SE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED SOMEONE IS A CRUCIAL BIT OF EVIDENCE .
RIGHT YEAH .
THAT ADDS TO THE FACT AND I I I .
BUT THEY RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT .
I I OFTEN I NEVER UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW HAVIN AGAIN HAVING I M SURE THERE ARE SOME DEEP SEATED REASONS YOU KNOW TO I MEAN OFTEN TIMES I WONDER ABOUT RULES LIKE THIS AND I M SURE THAT THAT THAT THERE ARE SOME REASONS FOR GOOD .
WELL THAT ONE DOES SEEM THAT ONE DOES SEEM OUT OF IT THOUGH BECAUSE IT S IT WE YOU RE ALLOWED TO SHOW THEIR CHARACTER DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN .
RIGHT .
AND IF IT SHOWS THAT THEIR CHARACTER S YOU KNOW CAPABLE OF LESSER THOUGHTS LIKE THAT AND STUFF .
THEN RIGHT THEN THEN .
RIGHT TH THAT LEA LED TO THAT .
THEN THEY SHOULD BE MUMBLEX YEAH I MEAN THAT S WHAT I THINK BUT I DO NT UM BUT I DO NT QUITE UNDERSTAND .
TELL YOU WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS GO INTO LAW AND THEN WE LL BE ABLE TO OR VOTE DO YOU VOTE .
DO I VOTE .
YEAH DO YOU VOTE .
OH YEAH I VOTE YES .
OKAY WE YOU LL HELP OUT A LITTLE BIT .
YEAH .
PUTTING THE RIGHT PEOPLE IN THE OFFICE THAT S A LOT TO DO WITH IT TOO .
OH YEAH .
A LOT UH A LOT OF THE POLITICS WILL PASS LAWS AND STUFF THAT THE UM GENERAL PUBLIC WANTS SO THEY LL BE REVOTED AND ALL THAT .
WELL THAT S THAT S THAT THAT S VERY TRUE BUT THEN AGAIN OFT OFTEN TIMES THEY DO NT AS WELL .
RIGHT .
OFTEN TIMES THEY DO NT UH .
RIGHT .
THEY JUST GO YOU KNOW THEY RE YOU VE GOT PEOPLE LIKE WHO ARE WHO ARE YOU KNOW LAME LAME DUCKS AND THEY SORT OF DO NT CARE ABOUT ANYTHING AND JUST WANT TO GO AHEAD AN .
RIGHT THEY SIT ON THE FENCE SO WELL OH I TALKED ABOUT THIS THE OTHER DAY THEY WO NT SAY YES AND THEY WO NT SAY NO TO JUST CERTAIN ISSUES JUST BECAUSE THEY DO NT KNOW WHAT THE PUBLIC WANTS OR THE PUBLIC S SPLIT ON IT .
THAT S TRUE THAT S TRUE .
YEAH .
I OFTEN I MEAN THAT THAT LIKE YOU SAY THAT S ANOTHER DISCUSSION BUT I HAVE HAD THAT DISCUSSION BEFORE AS WELL WHERE YOU WERE NT I I WONDER ABOUT THE PO POLITICS OF IT ALL SO .
RIGHT BECAUSE MOST OF IT IS POLITICS .
YEAH .
EVEN IN THE COURTS .
WELL EVEN IN THE COURTS YO WELL WELL THEY RE ALL APPOINTED I MEAN .
RIGHT .
THAT S EVEN ANOTHER ISSUE YOU KNOW SHOULD SHOULD SHOULD JUDGES BE APPOINTED YOU KNOW AND OR OR UM OFTEN TIMES I LOOK AT FRIENDS WE HAD UH A SERIAL KILLER AROUND HERE WHO KILLED ELEVEN WOMEN .
UHHUH NOW WAS THAT THE UM UH GREEN OH I DO NT KNOW SOME GUY THAT WAS ATTACKING WOMEN JOGGING NO .
CH OH AND AND CHOKING THEM YEAH UH HIS NAME IS ARTHUR MUMBLEX .
WELL DID THEY HAVE A T V MOVIE ABOUT HIM .
I M NOT SURE IF THEY HAD ONE YET BUT I M SURE THEY WILL UM BECAUSE HE WAS HE WAS ON SOME SORT OF NEWS SPECIAL THOUGH HE WAS HE WAS UH HE KILLED CAUSE HE WAS JUST ON TRIAL LIKE MAYBE A YEAR AGO .
WELL WELL HOW WAS HE KILLING THE WOMEN .
UM HE WAS STRANGLING SOME OF THEM .
WERE THEY JOGGING ON A .
OH NO USUALLY THEY WERE PROSTITUTES ACTUALLY .
OH OKAY .
BECAUSE HE WAS HE WAS ACTUALLY THIS IS A VERY SAD CASE THE MAN WAS LET OUT HE WAS IN PRISON FOR UM SEXUALLY ASSAULTING TWO CHILDREN .
OH SEE THAT S WHAT I MEAN THEN THEY LET THEM OUT AND THEN THEY RE ABLE TO DO IT AGAIN .
RIGHT HE HE THEY LET HIM OUT AND THEN AND THEN HE WA HE WAS NT ALLOWED BACK IN THE TOWN WHERE HE HAD DONE THIS SO HE CAME TO OUR HE CAME TO ROCHESTER INSTEAD AND THEY THEY THEY REALIZED LATER HE HE HAD KILLED ABOUT BETWEEN ELEVEN AND TWELVE WOMEN AT LEAST AND .
I THINK MY SISTER IS MARRIED TO A GUY FROM ROCHESTER .
OH REALLY .
YEAH .
WAY UP NORTH HERE HUH .
YEAH WAY UP NOR WELL UH I M ORIGINALLY FROM KENTUCKY .
OH OKAY STILL WAY UP NORTH SORT OF UM .
YEAH I I M I WAS UP NORTH TOO BUT UH THAT S ONE OF THE REASONS I THINK JUDGES SHOULD BE THE ONES TO SENTENCE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY DO KNOW YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
IF YOU SENTENCE THEM TO THREE LIFE TIMES THEN THEY PROBABLY WO NT GET OUT ON PAROLE .
WO NT GET OUT EXACTLY YEAH THIS THIS THIS MAN WAS SENTENCED TO I THINK LIKE THREE LIFE TIMES BUT HE WAS YOU KNOW IT WAS JUST HORRIBLE BECAUSE UM HIS HIS HIS TRIAL WAS YOU KNOW WAS IT WA IT WAS TELEVISED AND THIS AND THAT AND WHAT THEY WERE PLEADING WAS UM THEY WERE PLEADING INSANITY .
UHHUH .
I MEAN IT S CLEAR TO ME THE MAN IS INSANE .
WELL OF COURSE .
AND AND HE SHOULD BE JUST LOCKED UP FOR LIFE .
BUT THEY JUST NEED TO DO SOMETHING WITH HIM HE NEEDS TO BE ANNIHILATED .
RIGHT I MEAN I DO NT KNOW WHAT YOU DO WITH THEM AT THAT POINT IF YOU RE THAT CRAZY BUT WHAT WHAT STRUCK ME IS YOU KNOW THEY HAD A PSYCHIATRIST TESTIFYING FOR HOURS AND HOURS AND BY THE END I REALIZED THAT MAYBE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF THEY HAD IT WOULD NT HAVE BEEN A JURY OF HIS PEERS BUT IF THEY HAD A JURY OF PSYCHIATRISTS INSTEAD TO SORT LOOK AT IT YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
I MEAN I DO NT THINK IT S FEASIBLE BUT IT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING THOUGHT IF YOU RE .
WELL IT S SUPPOSED TO BE A JURY OF YOUR PEERS THEY COULD NT HAVE A A BUNCH OF PSYCHOTICS UP THERE .
NO OR RIGHT RIGHT EXACTLY BUT GIVE THEM A BUNCH OF PSYCHOTICS BUT AT LEAST HAVE A HAVE A HAVE A BUNCH OF PSYCHIATRISTS .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW JUST TO LOOK AT HIM AND DECIDE FROM THEN I MEAN THEY WOULD MUMBLEX .
DID THEY HAVE A TRIAL BY JURY FOR HIM .

AND THEY SAY IT S GOING TO LAST ABOUT TWO TO THREE WEEKS .
AND THIS GUY IN FRONT OF ME SAID I CA NT BELIEVE I WAS SUMMONSED .
I WAS AN INVESTIGATOR AND I WAS TAILING THE WOMAN .
THAT WAS KILLED .
WELL THEN I HAVE A FRIEND AT SCHOOL .
THAT HAS A BOYFRIEND .
THAT S A LAWYER AND HE SAID THAT THIS WOMAN .
THIS SOCIALITE IN PLANO HAD HIRED FOUR GUYS TO KILL HER HUSBAND AND THE ONE .
THAT S ACCUSED WAS THE ONE .

SO I FIGURE THAT THAT WILL MAKE ME BIASED AND I WO NT BE CHOSEN .
WELL .
HOPEFULLY .
NOT NECESSARILY BUT THERE S PROBABLY SOMETHING ELSE THAT MIGHT MAKE YOU .
BECAUSE YOU COULD KNOW ABOUT YOU COULD KNOW ABOUT THE CRIME BUT NOT NECESSARILY BE TAKEN OFF THE JURY YOU KNOW NOT BE ACCEPTED FOR J THE JURY .
YEAH .
I MEAN PRETTY MUCH A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD KNOW ABOUT IT YOU KNOW AND AND KNOW SOME OF THE DIFFERENT THINGS ABOUT IT BUT UH THEY THEY MIGHT WEED YOU OUT SOME OTHER WAY .
YOU KNOW IF YOU IF YOU DO NT BELIEVE LIKE IF THIS WAS A CAPITAL CRIME AND AND YOU DO NT BELIEVE IN .
THE DEATH PENALTY .
IF YOU DO NT BELIEVE IN DEATH PENALTY YOU RE NOT GOING TO BE PICKED AT ALL .
NO .
SO BUT .
I SAID THAT I COULD BELIEVE IN IT IN CERTAIN INSTANCES BUT I WOULD BE I D FIND IT HARD TO LEVY THAT AGAINST SOMEBODY .
YEAH SO SEE .

THERE THERE THEY WOULD HAVE A DOUBT ABOUT YOU .
UHHUH .
THAT YOU KNOW BECAUSE IF THAT S WHAT IF THAT S WHAT .
THE PUNISHMENT IS IN THAT IN THAT INSTANCE THEN YOU RE ALWAYS GOING TO SAY YOU KNOW NOT GUI YOU RE YOU RE NOT GOING TO WANT TO HAVE HIM HAVE THAT CRI UH THAT PUNISHMENT .
SO .
YEAH .
BUT THEN WHEN YOU RE WHEN YOU RE PICKED SEE I WAS PICKED FOR ANOTHER MURDER TRIAL BEFORE .
UHHUH .
OH GOSH AND IT S SO HARD BECAUSE YOU KNOW EVERYBODY IS WANTING TO GO ON AND GET THE SENTENCE DONE AND IF YOU RE TRYING TO HOLD OUT YOU KNOW THERE S SO MUCH PRESSURE ON YOU AND YOU VE GOT TO COME UP WITH A DECISION .
WELL ESPECIALLY WITH SOMETHING WHERE YOU HAVE TO F YOU HAVE TO FIND IT BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT .
YOU HAVE TO FIND WHETHER THEY RE GUILTY BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT AND IT S LIKE DO YOU REALLY FEEL THAT SURE ABOUT .
OKAY .
UH FIRST UM I NEED TO KNOW UH HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT UH ABOUT SENDING UH AN ELDERLY UH FAMILY MEMBER TO A NURSING HOME .
WELL OF COURSE IT S YOU KNOW IT S ONE OF THE LAST FEW THINGS IN THE WORLD .
YOU D EVER WANT TO DO YOU KNOW .
UNLESS IT S JUST YOU KNOW REALLY YOU KNOW AND UH FOR THEIR UH YOU KNOW FOR THEIR OWN GOOD .
YES .
YEAH .
I D BE VERY VERY CAREFUL AND UH YOU KNOW CHECKING THEM OUT .
UH OUR HAD T PLACE MY MOTHER IN A NURSING HOME .
SHE HAD A RATHER MASSIVE STROKE ABOUT UH ABOUT .
UHHUH .
UH EIGHT MONTHS AGO I GUESS .
AND UH WE WERE I WAS FORTUNATE IN THAT I WAS PERSONALLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE UH PEOPLE .
WHO UH RAN THE NURSING HOME IN OUR LITTLE HOMETOWN .
YEAH .
SO I WAS VERY COMFORTABLE YOU KNOW IN DOING IT WHEN IT GOT TO THE POINT THAT WE HAD TO DO IT .
BUT THERE S WELL I HAD AN OCCASION FOR MY MOTHERINLAW .
WHO HAD FELL AND NEEDED TO BE YOU KNOW COULD NOT TAKE CARE OF HERSELF ANYMORE WAS CONFINED TO A NURSING HOME FOR A WHILE .
THAT WAS REALLY NOT A VERY GOOD EXPERIENCE .
UH IT HAD TO BE DONE IN A HURRY .
I MEAN WE DID NT HAVE YOU KNOW LIKE SIX MONTHS TO CHECK ALL OF THESE PLACES OUT .
AND IT WAS REALLY NOT NOT VERY GOOD UH DEAL .
YEAH .
WE WERE NOT REALLY HAPPY WITH .
YEAH .
NURSING HOME THAT WE FINALLY HAD .
FORTUNATELY SHE ONLY HAD TO STAY A FEW WEEKS AND SHE WAS ABLE TO TO RETURN TO HER APARTMENT AGAIN .
BUT IT S REALLY A BIG UH BIG UH .
YEAH .
DECISION AS TO YOU KNOW WHEN TO DO IT .
YOU KNOW IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE WE COULD HAVE DONE YOU KNOW IN CHECKING OUT ALL THE PLACES .
THAT UH MIGHT BE AVAILABLE .
OF COURSE YOU KNOW THERE S NOT ONE ON EVERY CORNER .
YEAH .
ESPECIALLY YOU KNOW SMALLER AREAS .
UHHUH .
SMALLER TOWNS .
UHHUH .
YEAH .
PROBABLY THE HARDEST THING IN IN MY FAMILY UH MY GRANDMOTHER SHE HAD TO BE PUT IN A NURSING HOME AND UM SHE HAD USED THE WALKER FOR FOR QUITE SOME TIME PROBABLY ABOUT SIX TO NINE MONTHS .
AND UM SHE HAD A FALL AND UH FINALLY UH SHE HAD PARKINSON S DISEASE .
OH .
AND IT GOT SO MUCH THAT SHE COULD NOT TAKE CARE OF HER HOUSE .
RIGHT .
THEN SHE LIVED IN AN APARTMENT AND UH THAT WAS EVEN HARDER .
UHHUH .
ACTUALLY .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE IT WAS YOU KNOW IT WAS JUST A CHANGE OF CHANGE OF LOCATION AND IT WAS VERY DISTURBING FOR HER BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN SO USED TO TRAVELING .
YES .
I MEAN SHE TR SHE HAD SHE HAD CHILDREN ALL ACROSS THE UNITED STATES .
UHHUH .
AND YOU KNOW SHE SPENT NINE MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR JUST VISITING HER CHILDREN .
RIGHT .
UHHUH .
AND UM THAT WAS PRETTY HEARTRENDING FOR HER .
I CAN IMAGINE .
I THINK WHEN SHE FINALLY CAME TO THE REALIZATION THAT YOU KNOW NO I CAN NOT I CAN NOT TAKE CARE OF MYSELF .
UHHUH .
THAT S TOUGH .
THAT S TOUGH .
YEAH .
I MEAN FOR SOMEBODY .
WHO IS YOU KNOW FOR MOST OF THEIR LIFE HAS HAS UH NOT JUST MERELY HAD A FARM BUT HAD TEN CHILDREN .
UHHUH .
HAD A FARM RAN EVERYTHING BECAUSE HER HUSBAND WAS AWAY IN THE COAL MINES .
UHHUH .
AND YOU KNOW FACING THAT SITUATION IT S IT S QUITE A DILEMMA .
YES .
I THINK .
MY MOTHER EXCUSE ME .
GO AHEAD .
YEAH .
WELL MY UH MY UH PROBABLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST DECISIONS I THINK THAT WAS VERY STRENGTHENING FOR OUR FAMILY WAS RATHER THAN HAVE ONE CHILD MAKE THAT DECISION .
UHHUH .
THAN JUST DELEGATE IT .
I THINK THAT THEY THEY HAD A GREAT DEAL OF UM ALL THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS GOT TOGETHER AND THEY ACTUALLY HAD A CONFERENCE .
THAT S GREAT .
AND I MEAN IT WAS JUST IT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST STRENGTHENING THINGS FOR OUR FAMILY GETTING DOWN TOGETHER AND DOING THAT .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND AND JUST THE CHILDREN WERE INVOLVED IN THE DECISION BECAUSE IT INVOLVED JUST THEM .
RIGHT .
YEAH .
AND YOU KNOW MAKING THAT DECISION AND THEN FINDING A PLACE AND EVERYBODY HAD DUTIES .
UHHUH .
TO PERFORM .
YOU KNOW WHETHER IT WAS JUST YOU KNOW GIVING MONEY OR WHETHER IT WAS ACTUALLY TAKING PART IN A LOT .
UHHUH .
OF THE DECISION MAKING YOU KNOW .
YEP .
LIKE FINDING A PROPER NURSING HOME .
YOU WERE VERY .
AND THEY .
FORTUNATE .
I KNOW .
THEY AND WELL THEY HAD WELL THEY HAD THEY HAD SEEN IT COMING .
UHHUH .
SO SO I MEAN IT I MEAN I I I I HAR I I TRULY WISH THAT IF SOMETHING LIKE THAT WERE TO HAPPEN THAT MY CHILDREN WOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE .
UHHUH .
THAT FOR ME .
UHHUH ABSOLUTELY .
UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF TIMES .
IT RESPONSIBILITIES LIKE THAT SEEM TO FALL TO YOU KNOW MAYBE ONE CHILD IN THE WHOLE FAMILY YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
YEAH .
WELL WE WE .
AND UH IT S USUALLY NOT A VERY SMOOTH .
YEAH .
SMOOTH THING .
WE WERE I WAS LUCKY TOO THAT I ONLY HAVE ONE BROTHER .
UHHUH .
AND UH FORTUNATELY WE AGREED YOU KNOW ON EXACTLY YOU KNOW WHAT .
WE THOUGHT SHOULD BE DONE .
MY MOTHER ALSO WAS VERY VERY INDEPENDENT .
SHE HAD HER OWN STILL HAD HER OWN LITTLE HOUSE AND STILL DRIVING HER OWN CAR .
YEAH .
AT AGE EIGHTYTHREE .
WE WERE LUCKY IN THAT IN ONE RESPECT IN THAT AFTER SHE HAD HER STROKE .
SHE .
WAS NT REALLY YOU KNOW REALLY MUCH AWARE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON .
UHHUH .
THAT NURSING HOME LIFE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF HER CHOOSING OF COURSE SHE WOULD SHE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN HAPPY THERE AT ALL .
UM .
BUT AS IT TURNED OUT THE STROKE TOOK CARE OF THAT CONCERN FOR US .
YEAH .
YEAH .
WELL WITH MY WITH MY GRANDMOTHER .
I THINK IT WAS IT WAS SUCH THAT UH THAT SHE DID NOT HAVE THE PROBLEM WITH SHE WAS VERY WELL AWARE AND HER DAUGHTER CAME AND VISITED HER .
UHHUH .
AT LEAST HER DAUGHTER .
UHHUH .
CAME AND VISITED HER AND ALSO HER SEVERAL GRANDCHILDREN .
UHHUH .
CAME AND VISITED HER .
EVERY DAY .
THAT S GREAT .
AND I THINK THAT WHEN SHE PASSED AWAY IT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE GREATEST UM I I I THINK IT WOULD BE IT WAS MORE OF A RELIEF .
UHHUH .
FOR HER .
SURE .
AND UM I MEAN BUT SHE WAS TRULY SHE WAS TRULY AWARE .
I MEAN I I I DI I DO NT KNOW HOW I WOULD HOW I WOULD DEAL IF ONE OF MY PARENTS CAME WITH WITH ALZHEIMER S .
UHHUH .
OR SOMETHING LIKE .
THAT WOULD BE TOUGH .
THAT WHICH IS WHICH IS FAR MORE DEVASTATING .
YES .
ABSOLUTELY .
AND UM I I I THINK THAT WHAT .
ONE THING THAT THEY WERE CONCERNED PROBABLY WAS THE FACT .
IT .
WAS NT NECESSARILY YOU KNOW LIKE THE QUANTITY OF CARE .
UHHUH .
BUT THE QUALITY OF .
YES .
CARE .
THAT THE PEOPLE .
THAT WORKED THERE .
RIGHT .
WERE VERY .
UHHUH .
WERE VERY INTERESTED THAT TO MAKE IT AS CLOSE A HOME ENVIRONMENT .
UHHUH .
AS POSSIBLE .
YES .
IT WOULD .
I THINK I THINK I THINK YOU KNOW FOR MYSELF .
I I SEE THAT AS PROBABLY THE THE WHAT .
EVERYTHING WOULD HINGE UPON .
OH .
IS IT HOW CLOSE IS IT TO A HOME ENVIRONMENT .
YES .
THAT S RIGHT .
THAT S THE THAT S PROBABLY THE MAJOR QUESTION .
I THINK THAT GREAT STRIDES ARE BEING MADE NOWADAYS IN IN CARING FOR THE ELDERLY YOU KNOW IN SEVERAL IN A .
YEAH .
IN A WHOLE LOT OF AREAS .
YEAH .
JUST PEOPLE ARE OF COURSE POPULATIONS GETTING OLDER .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW IT S IT S INTERESTING THAT THAT A LOT THE POPULATION OF THE UNITED STATES IS CHANGING BECAUSE YOU KNOW UH NOW THAT SO MANY MORE MINORITIES WHERE THEY HAVE HAD EXTENDED FAMILIES FOR SUCH A LONG TIME .
UHHUH .
UM MATTER OF FACT IN THE UNITED STATES WE USED TO HAVE EXTENDED FAMILIES .
UHHUH .
IT .
WAS NT .
TRUE .
BUT I GUESS AS WE BECOME MORE INDUSTRIALIZED AND MORE YOU KNOW LESS IN A RURAL SITUATION .
YES UM .
WE WE DO NT WE WE WE CHOOSE NOT TO DEAL WITH THE .
UHHUH .
EXTENDED FAMILY .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE WE FEEL IT S KIND OF CUMBERSOME .
THAT S RIGHT .
WHEN IN REALITY .
IT MAKES THINGS MUCH MUCH EASIER .
SURE .
ABSOLUTELY .
AND .
UH .
PEOPLE THINGS ARE SCATTERED SO MUCH NOWADAYS .
YEAH .
YEAH .
I I I THINK THAT PERHAPS PERHAPS THE EXTENDED FAMILY YOU KNOW THAT IT MAYBE ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS TO A LOT OF THINGS EVEN CHILD CARE .
YES .
YOU KNOW I MEAN OF COURSE THERE THERE COMES OTHER ISSUES YOU KNOW WHETHER OR NOT ANY OF THE GRANDPARENTS WHETHER WE FEEL LIKE ARE GOING TO BE A GOOD THEY RE GOING TO BE A GOOD CARETAKER FOR OUR CHILDREN .
YES .
BUT .
JUST BECAUSE THEY RE GRANDPARENTS .
I MEAN THEY RAISED US AFTER ALL .
YEAH .
JUST BECAUSE THEY RE GRANDPARENTS .
THAT DOES NT AUTOMATICALLY MAKE THEM .
A GOOD CHILD CARER .
YEAH .
BUT UH I I I THINK THAT YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS UH I MEAN I VE I VE HAD A LOT OF GOOD EXPERIENCES WITH UH WITH MANY MANY PEOPLE ESPECIALLY WHERE THEY VE HAD UH EXTENDED FAMILY .
AND I AND I I .
KIND OF SEE THAT THAT YOU KNOW PERHAPS YOU KNOW WE MAY NEED TO LIKE GET CLOSE TO THE FAMILY ENVIRONMENT AND .
UHHUH .
AND GET DOWN TO THE VALUES OF YOU KNOW I MEAN UH IT S MONEY SEEMS TO BE TOO BIG OF AN ISSUE .
OH YEAH .
WITH .
SURE .
WITH WITH .
REALISTICALLY IT IS .
WITH WHAT S GOING ON TODAY AND I I THINK I THINK THAT WE MAY NOT THAT MAY BE YOU KNOW PERHAPS IF WE PUT MONEY ON THE BACK BURNER .
UHHUH .
THAT MAY THAT MAY CHOOSE TO ALLEVIATE A LOT OF THE PROBLEM .
THAT WOULD .
I MEAN .
CERTAINLY HELP .
I MEAN WE MAY NOT WE MAY NOT HAVE AS HIGH A STANDARD OF LIVING .
UHHUH .
BUT THE QUA BUT ACTUALLY HAVE A TRUER STANDARD OF LIVING .
RIGHT .
THAT S JUST A MATTER OF DEFINING PRIORITIES I GUESS .
YEAH .
YEAH .
OR SOME PRIORITIES ANYWAY .
YEAH .
I THINK YOUR RIGHT .
OKAY .
WELL I GUESS THAT WAS IT .
OKAY .
IT WAS GOOD TALKING TO YOU .
OKAY .
YEAH .
ALL RIGHT .
TAKE CARE .
HEY .
BYEBYE .
BYEBYE .
WELL I DO NT I MEAN I DO NT KNOW WHAT .
YOU THINK ABOUT THE SUBJECT I D THE I HAD NEVER REALLY THOUGHT OF WHAT .
THEY SAID BEFORE ABOUT ALLOWING THE THE SENTENCING TO UH TO GO TO THE JUDGE INSTEAD OF THE JURY AND ALLOWING HIM TO DO THAT .
I VE BEEN KIND OF SITTING HERE THINKING ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT WHILE I WAS WAITING FOR THEM TO PHONE SOMEBODY AND I DO NT KNOW THAT THAT S NOT A GOOD IDEA .
THAT S NOT A BAD IDEA .
I UM UH THAT YOU KNOW THEY PROBABLY NEED TO CHANGE IT SOMEHOW UH THE WHOLE SYSTEM NEEDS CHANGING WE VE JUST GOT TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THERE .
I AGREE .
AND UH MUMBLEX ARE PUTTING TOO MANY UH PEOPLE IN JAIL THAT PROBABLY DO NT NEED TO BE THERE AND IT S ANOTHER FORM OF SENTENCING .
UHHUH .
BUT ON THAT ONE THING I I STILL THINK IT SHOULD BE A UNANIMOUS DECISION .
OH YEAH I AGREE .
YEAH .
UH I THINK WE RE GETTING TO THE POINT NOW WHERE THEY RE GOING TO EVENTUALLY LET IT BE UM MAJORITY VOTE .
AND THAT S NOT GOING TO BE GOOD .
I DO NT LIKE THAT NO .
NO .
I DO NT LIKE THAT AT ALL .
I KNOW MY HUSBAND SERVED ON A ON A JURY .
A FEW MONTHS AGO UP HERE IN DENTON BUT UH IT WAS A GUY IT WAS IT WAS A DRUG CONVICTION AND I DO NT REMEMBER HE HAD SOME COCAINE AND TH IT WAS ACCUSED OF SELLING IT AND I DO NT REMEMBER EXACTLY HOW MUCH .
HE HAD BUT UH ACTUALLY NOT SELLING IT THERE S A DIFFERENCE CR CRO COURIERING IT IS WHAT THER IS SUPPOSEDLY A DIFFERENCE FROM SELLING THEN BEING A COURIER AND .
RIGHT .
HE WAS A COURIER .
AND UH THEY HE S HE SAT ON THAT JURY AND THEY FOUND HIM GUILTY AND THEY WENT THROUGH THE SENTENCING PHASE AND EVERYTHING AND UH YOU KNOW THEY WERE TOLD THAT YOU KNOW DURING THE TRIAL THAT THIS IS THIS GUY S FIRST OFFENSE AND HE S GOT THIS CLEAN RECORD AND AND THEY ENDED UP THE JURY YOU KNOW DECIDED HEY IT S TIME TO CRACKDOWN HERE YOU KNOW AND IT WAS TIME TO DO THIS DRUG THING AND LET S CRACKDOWN AND LET S REALLY AND THEY SENTENCED HIM TO FIFTEEN YEARS .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW WHICH .
THEY THOUGHT FIRST OFFENSE OKAY THIS IS THEY THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS THAT WAS A GOOD THING .
AND THEY SENTENCING HIM TO FIFTEEN YEARS AND UM AFTER IT WAS ALL OVER UH THE JUD THEY SIT DOWN WITH THE JUDGE AND WITH THE OTHER TWO LAWYERS LET ME COME OVER IN JUST A SECOND OKAY AND SIT DOWN WITH THE JUDGE AND WITH THE OTHER TWO LAWYERS AND THEY WERE TOLD THAT UH HE WOULD PROBABLY SERVE THREE .
UHHUH .
OF THE FIFTEEN .
UHHUH .
AND THAT HE HAD THREE PREVIOUS CONVICTIONS .
HOWEVER THEY COULD NOT TELL THE JUD THE JURY THAT DURING THE TRIAL BECAUSE ALL THREE OF THEM WERE IN APPEAL .
OH YEAH .
SO THE JURY DID NT KNOW ABOUT IT SO HERE THEY BASED THEIR SENTENCING THINKING THAT THIS WAS THIS GUY S FIRST OFFENSE .
SURE .
AND SO YOU KNOW WE LL GIVE HIM .
FIFTEEN .
WHICH WILL TEACH HIM .
A LESSON BUT IT S NOT JUST YOU KNOW HORRIBLE .
YEAH .
SINCE IT WAS FIRST OFFENSE AND HE D BEEN CONVICTED THREE TIMES BEFORE YOU KNOW .
OH .
AND AND THE JURY WAS VERY UPSET AND MY HUSBAND CAME HOME A HOME VERY UPSET I MEAN HE FELT LIKE THAT THAT THEY HAD BEEN TRICKED YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
AND SO SOMETHING I WONDER IF A JUDGE DID NT HAVE CONTROL OF THAT IF SOME OF THAT WOULD CHANGE YOU KNOW .
YEAH THE JUDGE MIGHT KNOW OR AT LEAST .
IT IT WOULD NT HURT TO SWITCH OVER THERE AND SEE IF IT WORKED ANY BETTER IF IT DID NT WE CAN COME BACK FOR SOMETHING ELSE OR .
THAT S TRUE .
THAT S VERY TRUE .
OR OR WHAT .
WE VE GOT SO .
YEAH .
WELL WE DEFINITELY NEED A CHANGE IN THE SYSTEM AND UH .
YEAH OBVIOUSLY WHAT .
WE ARE DOING IS NOT WORKING YOU KNOW .
IT S NOT WORKING TOO .
NO .
IT S JUST PILING UP ON US .
YEAH AND THERE S YOU KNOW THERE .
S PEOPLE IN OUR PRISONS .
THAT ARE NOT BEING REHABILITATED IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM .
RIGHT .
AND EITHER THEY RE IN THERE .
RIGHT .
FOREVER OR WHEN THEY GET OUT THEY RE YOU KNOW IT S A MATTER OF A FEW MONTHS AND THEY RE GOING TO BE RIGHT BACK FOR THE SAME THING SO THE SYSTEM .
WE RE JUST NOT WILLING TO SET A SOCIETY NOT WILLING TO SPEND THE TIME OR THE MONEY TO DO WHAT .
IT TAKES SO .
THAT S VERY TRUE .
YEAH .
YEAH I WAS TALKING TO A FRIEND OF MINE ABOUT THIS THE OTHER DAY AND I SAID YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF COUNTRIES .
THAT RELY ON THE UNITED STATES TO AND .
UHHUH .
AND THE AND THE PEOPLE IN THOSE COUNTRIES RELY ON OUR MONEY TO SURVIVE BUT I REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES .
RIGHT .
I MEAN WE AND AND THE I KNOW PEOPLE SAY OH IT WOULD BE CRUEL TO YOU KNOW PULL OUR AID FROM THESE OTHER COUNTRIES AND AND MAYBE SO SO TELL THEM YOU VE GOT FIVE YEARS .
RIGHT .
TO WORK OUT A PLAN TO MAKE IT ON YOUR OWN .
YEAH .
AND WE WILL CONTINUE FUNDING YOU FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS AFTER TWO YEARS WE LL CUT IT DOWN SEVEN TO SEVENTY FIV YOU KNOW SEVENTYFIVE PERCENT .
UHHUH .
AND AFTER ANOTHER YEAR .
WE LL CUT IT .
FIFTY PERCENT AND IN FIVE YEARS IT .
SH BY THEN YOU SHOULD ALL SHOULD HAVE A PLAN WORKED WHERE YOU CAN MAKE IT ON YOUR OWN WITHOUT OUR HELP .
SURE .
AND THEN WE LL HAVE ALL WE LL HAVE WE WILL HAVE THE MONEY IF WE WOULD DO THAT TO .
YEAH .
TO WORK ON YOUR OWN SYSTEM BECAUSE WE VE GOT SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS HERE AND WE RE TRYING TO .
VERY SERIOUS YEAH .
HEAL THE WORLD YOU KNOW IT S JUST NOT .
OH YEAH .
IT S JUST NOT WORKING .
YOUR RIGHT MUMBLEX .
I LOOK AT THE I LOOK AT WHAT YOU KNOW THI WHAT THE AID PRESENTED TO THE KURDS AND I I FEEL SORRY FOR THEM AND I KNOW THEY RE SUFFERING AND I KNOW THEY RE DYING EVERYDAY BUT WE VE GOT YOU KNOW KIDS HERE IN THE UNITED STATES .
THAT ARE DYING EVERYDAY TOO .
SURE .
YOU KNOW AND BEING .
OH .
ABUSED AND NEGLECTED AND YOU KNOW I DO NT KNOW .
I JUST HAVE THIS PROBLEM WITH .
YOU BET .
UH TRYING TO HEAL THE WORLD WHEN YOU RE SO SICK YOURSELF YOU KNOW SO .
RIGHT .
WELL WE SEEM TO AGREE ON THE JURY THING AND UH BUT UH WE LL NEED AN UNANIMOUS VERDICT AND .
YEP .
MAYBE LET THE JUDGE HAVE A OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A DECISION .
I THINK WE SHOULD TRY IT LIKE YOU SAY .
YEAH .
IF IT DOES NT WORK WE CAN ALWAYS COME BACK BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO TRY IT .
I DO TOO .
SO ANYWAY WELL WE .
ALL AGREE .
WELL GOOD .
GOOD TO HEAR FROM YOU .
YOU TOO BYEBYE .
BYEBYE .
OKAY WE RE ROLLING I UH WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU WHAT WOULD HAS YOUR EXPERIENCE LEAD YOU TO ADVISE UH IF MY CHILD WERE THINKING OF GOING TO THE AIR FORCE ACADEMY WHAT WOULD YOU SAY .
WELL I D ENCOURAGE IT .
UHHUH .
IT S A GOOD GENERAL E ED EDUCATION FOR A A BACHELOR S DEGREE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND OBVIOUSLY AND OBVIOUSLY IT S WHERE THEY DO NT HAVE A ANY POST GRADUATE PROGRAM THERE BUT YOU GET A AN EXCELLENT WIDE UH BASIS OF TOPICS YOU KNOW YOU GET A GOOD BROAD EDUCATION OUT OF IT .
UHHUH .
YOU DO NT THEY DO NT GRADUATE THE BEST ENGINEERS OR THE BEST ENGLISH MAJORS BUT .
UHHUH .
MAYBE A GRADUATE PRETTY GOOD OVERALL STUDENTS OUT OF THERE .
UHHUH UHHUH UHHUH .
UH .
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IT MUST BE A SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT FROM A REGULAR COLLEGE HOW DOES THAT UH HOW DO YOU FEEL THAT IS FOR SOMEONE AT AT THAT PHASE IN THEIR LIFE .
WELL THE FOR SOME PEOPLE IT S GOOD BECAUSE THEY MAYBE THEY NEED A LITTLE DISCIPLINE NEED A LITTLE REINING IN AT THAT THAT STAGE IN THEIR LIFE UH OTHER PEOPLE IT UH IT S UH SUFFOCATING .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW YOU KIND OF CHOKE ON IT .
UHHUH UHHUH UHHUH .
UH IT IT DEPENDS ON THE PERSON .
UHHUH .
ON THE INDIVIDUAL BUT UH THE ONE FACTOR I THINK MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THIS DAY AND AGE THAT S GOT TO BE A BIG FACTOR IN YOUR DECISION S JUST THE THE COST OF HOW MUCH YOU RE GOING TO PAY .
UHHUH .
NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO TO SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
AND IF YOU VE BEEN IN FOR TWELVE YEARS I M SURE YOU VE .
YOU VE GOT A YOUR SHARE OF STUDENT LOANS THAT UH YOU RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE PAYING OFF OR HAVE BEEN OR .
WELL I SORT OF ONE OF THE REASONS IT S TAKEN SO LONG IS I VE BEEN WORKING ALL YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
SORT OF HALF STUDENT HALF WORKING AND SOURCE OF INCOME AND STUFF SO I M ACTUALLY MANAGING TO DO THIS WITH ZERO DEBT .
OH THAT S GOOD .
UH I COULD NT YOU COULD NT DO IT OTHERWISE .
OH Y I MEAN I KNOW PEOPLE THAT GRADUATED OR THAT I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL WITH THAT WENT TO CIVILIAN COLLEGES AND THEY THEY VE GOT TWENTY THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR DEBTS I MEAN YOU COULD HAVE UH .
YEAH I THINK IF THERE S ANY MAJOR PIECE OF ADVICE I D GIVE IS TO FIND A WAY OF GETTING AN EDUCATION THAT DOES NT INCUR THAT KIND OF DEBT .
YEAH .
IT S NOT I MEAN I REMEMBER SEEING AN ARTICLE ONE TIME ABOUT YOU KNOW IF THE AVERAGE PERSON WHO SPENT THAT MUCH MONEY GOING TO COLLEGE JUST TOOK THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY AND PUT IT IN A A IN AN INVESTMENT FUND THEY D BE CONSIDERABLY WEALTHIER THAN THEY WOULD BE FROM THE JOB THEY D GET AFTER COLLEGE .
EXACTLY .
SO IT S IT S REALLY KIND OF CRAZY .
IT S IT S STAGGERING WHEN YOU THINK THAT JUST HERE IN CENTRAL NEW YORK IS UH HAMILTON COLLEGE IS JUST A FEW MILES SOUTH OF YOU KNOW MAYBE ABOUT TWENTY MILES TO THE SOUTH FROM WHERE I AM .
UHHUH .
AND UH THEY RE LOOKING FOR TWENTYTWO THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR TUITION AND ROOM AND BOARD NOW .
REALLY .
A YEAR .
HUH .
AT JUST A SMALL I MEAN THEY THEY THEY ARE S IT IS A SELECT .
YES YES I KNOW .
COLLEGE .
I WAS ACTUALLY I TH I WAS THINKING OF TRYING TO GET A JOB THERE I HEARD OF IT .
OH YEAH BUT YOU RE TALKING INCREDIBLE TUITIONS NOW .
UHUH .
I DO NT KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY PAY THE WHOLE SHOT VERY FEW I WOULD IMAGINE .
YEAH .
BUT UH I GET I JUST COULD NT IMA I MEAN IT S MORE MONEY THAT I MAKE IN A YEAR SO .
YOU KNOW IT YOU KNOW ME BEING ONE PERSON WITH A ABOVE THE MEDIAN INCOME .
YEAH .
FOR NEW YORK STATE YOU KNOW I M A S I M A SECOND LIEUTENANT IN THE AIR FORCE NOW AND .
UHHUH .
UH I EVEN AS A SOMEBODY MAKING TWICE WHAT I WAS MAKING HOW COULD YOU PUT HALF OF THAT INTO .
UHHUH .
TO YOUR CHILD S EDUCATION AND THEN JUST WHEN THEY MAKE MADE MAKE IT TO THE COLLEGE YEARS IT S .
YEAH YEAH .
MY GOD I CA NT IMAGINE .
WELL MY MY REAL FEELING ABOUT ABOUT THE PURPOSE OF UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION IS IT S REALLY THE TIME YES YOU DO GET AN EDUCATION YOU DO LEARN SOME THINGS BUT YOU EVENTUALLY FORGET MOST OF IT .
YES .
BUT WHAT YOU DO NT FORGET IS THE GROWING UP IT S REALLY THE PERIOD WHEN PEOPLE BECOME ADULTS I MEAN PEOPLE WHO DO NT GO TO COLLEGE BECOME ADULTS IN OTHER WAYS BUT REALLY IT S THE ENTRY INTO ADULTHOOD I THINK AND I THINK THAT THE BEST WAY TO CHOOSE A COLLEGE IS TO DECIDE WHAT KIND OF ENVIRONMENT YOU WANT TO BE FOSTERED IN AS YOU BECOME YOU KNOW AS YOU GAIN NEW SOCIAL SKILLS AS YOU BECOME YOU KNOW MORE OF A FUNCTIONING MEMBER OF SOCIETY AND MAYBE THE AIR FORCE ACADEMY IS A PERFECT AS YOU SAID FOR SOMEONE WHO YOU KNOW A MORE YOU KNOW WHO NEEDS TO LEARN SELFDISCIPLINE AND SO FORTH WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR THEM .
OR IT S ALSO A GOOD ENVIRONMENT IT MAY BE GOOD FOR SOMEONE WHO ALREADY HAS SELF DISCIPLINE WHO HAS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF LEADERSHIP QUALITY IN THEIR OWN .
YEAH .
THAT .
AND WANT TO DEVELOP THAT .
AND THAT YEAH THE S IT S THE SAME .
UHHUH .
IT CAN BENEFIT DIFFERENT PEOPLE DIFFERENT WAYS .
UHHUH UHHUH .
BUT UH YOU KNOW I I AGREE WITH THAT BECAUSE I SEE PEOPLE THAT I KNOW F AGAIN FROM HIGH SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
THAT I STILL KEEP IN TOUCH WITH .
UHHUH .
THAT DID NT GO TO COLLEGE AND THEY DO THE SAME OLD THINGS THEY DID IN HIGH SCHOOL AND .
THE SAME PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOR YOU MEAN .
SAME PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOR .
YEAH YEAH .
SAME UH SAME SOCIALIZING SAME EXACT CROWD THAT THEY HANG WITH AND IT S LIKE IT S LIKE FROZEN TIME YOU KNOW .
EXACTLY IT S KI I FIND IT KIND OF SAD I REALLY DO .
IT IS IT REALLY IS THAT THEY HAVE NT FOUND ANYTHING ANYTHING BETTER THAT UH OR THEIR THEIR EXPERIENCES HAVE NT BEEN BROADENED AT ALL .
UHHUH .
TO TO YOU KNOW YOU KNOW IT S IT S A IT S A TREMENDOUS THING WHEN YOU SIT IN A IN A COLLEGE ENVIRONMENT AND DISCUSS SOME ISSUES AND REALLY SIT THERE WITH PEOPLE WITH DISAGREEING OPINIONS AND YOU HEAR ALL THESE DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE STORY .
YEAH .
THAT YOU NEVER THOUGHT OF .
RIGHT .
AND UH THAT S ANOTHER BIG THING I THINK PEOPLE GET OUT OF COLLEGE IS THE APPRECIATION FOR DIFFERENT POINT DIFFERING POINTS OF VIEW .
UHHUH UHHUH .
YOU KNOW OR DIFFERENT OPINIONS .
YEAH IN HIGH SCHOOL EVERYONE SORT OF TRIES TO HAVE THE SAME OPINION IT SEEMS .
YEAH EXACTLY YEAH .
YEAH THE THE ONE THING I THINK THAT S NO GOOD FOR ANYONE IS THESE MONSTER INSTITUTIONS THESE INSTITUTIONS OF TH THIRTY THOUSAND STUDENTS AND SUCH .
OH I .
AND I SEE SOME FRESHMEN WANDERING AROUND IN THERE AND THEY RE THEY RE JUST LIKE YOU KNOW SOMEONE FROM THE COUNTRY LOST IN THE BIG CITY I MEAN .
YEAH .
THEY THEY I DO NT SEE THEM GETTING I MEAN WHEN I WAS UNDERGRADUATE I WENT TO A RELATIVELY SMALL SCHOOL FOR MY FIRST TWO YEARS AND THEN I TRANSFERRED TO A VERY LARGE SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
AND THAT WORKED OUT PRETTY WELL I WENT FROM A YOU KNOW A SECOND RATE INSTITUTION TO A HIGHER RATE INSTITUTION .
UHHUH .
BUT THE FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS IT DOES NT MATTER TO ME WHAT THE QUALITY OF THE EDUCATION WAS I NEEDED TO MAKE FRIENDS I NEEDED TO SORT OF LEARN THE ROPES YOU KNOW THERE WERE THINGS LIKE THAT THAT MATTERED A LOT MORE AND I NEEDED BASIC REALLY SIMPLE EDUCATION THAT YOU CAN GET PRETTY MUCH ANYWHERE FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS .
WELL YOUR EDUCATION S A LOT WHAT YOU MAKE OF IT TOO SO .
YEAH YEAH EXACTLY AND IF YOU RE ALIENATED I MEAN I SEE PEOPLE AT SUPPOSEDLY REALLY GOOD UNIVERSITIES WHO ARE JUST HAVING PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS .
YEAH .
THAT YOU THINK THIS IS NT SINKING IN .
WELL I I VE SEEN MORE GRADUATES FROM M I T AND THAT .
UHHUH .
BEING I WORK IN A IN A LABORA AN AIR FORCE LABORATORY AND SO WE VE GOT A LOT OF UH M I T GRADUATES THAT ARE IN THERE AND THEY ARE THE BIGGEST COLLECTION OF SCREWED UP PEOPLE THAT I THINK I VE EVER RUN INTO .
YEAH YEAH .
EVEN EVEN MORE SO UH LIKE MILITARY ACADEMY GRADS ARE A STRANGE LOT TOO I I MEAN I HAVE TO AD CONFESS TO THAT .
YEAH IT S SORT OF A A RARE SELECT ENVIRONMENT .
YEAH AND THEY HAVE THEIR OWN QUIRKS AND TOLERANCES AND .
YOU KNOW CERTAIN THINGS THAT DO NT BOTHER US AT ALL .
YEAH .
THAT WOULD DRIVE OTHER PEOPLE NUTS AND THEN CERTAIN THINGS THAT WAYS THINGS WE DO THE WAY WE DO IT THAT DRIVE OTHER PEOPLE NUTS THAT .
RIGHT RIGHT SURE .
BUT THESE M I T GRADS ARE OFF IN THEIR ABSOLUTE OWN WORLD IT IT S A I I HAVE MORE RE I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR M I T MASTER S AND DOCTORATE UH .
YEAH IT S A TOP RATED INSTITUTION AND NOW I .
DEGREES BUT THEY RE UNDERGRADS ARE LIKE I I M AMAZED AT AT THAT S A LOT OF THEM EVEN GRADUATED .
UHHUH UHHUH .
BUT UH I DO NT KNOW .
WELL I I HAD KNOWN A LOT OF UNDERGRADUATES WHO PICK SCHOOLS BECAUSE THEY WANT THE BEST REPUTATION FOR A SCHOOL .
RIGHT .
NOT REALIZING THAT THE REPUTATION FOR M I T IS BECAUSE OF THE OF THE DOCTORATE RESEARCH .
RIGHT .
AND THE PROFESSORS WHO GO THERE AND YOU RE NOT GOING TO SEE THE PROFESSORS .
NOPE .
YOU KNOW YOU RE GOING TO SEE SOME T A YOU KNOW UH SO THEY P THEY THEY WANT YOU KNOW THEY WANT THE BEST AND THEY DO NT THINK THEY THINK WHAT THE BEST IS IS .
YEAH .
REPUTATION FOR FOR RESEARCH AND THAT S A ONE STANDARD BUT IT S NOT RELEVANT .
NO .
TO WHAT THEY NEED .
IT S INTERESTING THAT YOU MENTION AND I DID NT THINK ABOUT THAT BEFORE WHEN YOU WERE TALKING BUT THE SERVICE ACADEMIES HAVE ALL ALL THE FACULTY UH FOR THE MOST PART IS IS MILITARY WITH A FEW EXCHANGE .
UHHUH .
INSTRUCT PROFESSORS FROM OTHER .
UHHUH UHHUH .
SCHOOLS BUT UH HAVING THE MILITARY FACULTY IS REALLY BENEFICIAL BECAUSE THEY SEE IT AS DOING THEIR JOB AND SPENDING TIME WITH THE CADETS THERE UH IS INVESTING IN THE AIR FORCE AND IT .
RIGHT .
OR THE THE MILITARY ITSELF IT S THE FUTURE OFFICER CORPS AND SO I HEAR HOR HORROR STORIES FROM FRIENDS OF MINE THAT THEY COULD NEVER SEE THEIR INSTRUCTORS THEY COULD NEVER GET EXTRA HELP .
UHHUH .
FOR ME ANY TIME I NEEDED EXTRA HELP ANY TIME OF THE DAY .
UHHUH .
I HAD ALL MY INSTRUCTORS HOME PHONE NUMBERS .
UHHUH .
AND COULD CALL THEM YOU GO TO THEIR OFFICE ANYTIME I HAD SOME INSTRUCTORS THAT UH WOULD INVITE ME OVER TO THEIR HOUSE FOR EXTENDED STUDY THINGS ON WEEKENDS .
HUH .
WHEN I WAS HAVING TROUBLE WITH SOMETHING AND .
YEAH YOU WO NT GET THAT AT M I T OR VIRTUALLY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT .
NO NO AND THAT .
AND YOU C YOU KNOW AND YOU CA NT BLAME THE PROFESSORS EITHER .
NO .
BECAUSE YOU LOOK AT THEIR JOB DESCRIPTION YOU D S YOU KNOW TEACHING IS THIRD DOWN ON THE LIST OF IMPORTANCE THINGS AND .
RIGHT RIGHT PUBLISH FIRST AND THE .
YEAH AND AND THAT S APPROPRIATE IF THE UNIVERSITY IS TRYING TO DO SERIOUS RESEARCH BECAUSE IT S HARD TO BE A RESEARCHER AND A TEACHER AT THE SAME TIME .
RIGHT .
SO I D SAY GO TO A GO TO A COLLEGE THAT HAS TEACHERS PEOPLE WHO REALLY ARE COMMITTED TO THE STUDENTS AND CAN AFFORD TO BE BECAUSE THAT S THEIR JOB .
YEAH .
BUT OH WELL .
YEAH IT S THERE S A LOT OF FACTORS THAT PEOPLE DO NT EVER EVER CONSIDER .
UHHUH .
IN IN THEIR SELECTION OF A COLLEGE AND UH I DO NT KNOW MAYBE I WONDER IF IF THEY ENTER THESE CONVERSATIONS THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HAVING UH .
ALL RIGHT WELL I HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT TEAMS THAT I LIKE TO TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH OF COURSE TEXAS RANGERS BEING ONE OF THEM I MEAN UH YOU KNOW YOU CA NT LIVE IN DALLAS WITHOUT YOU KNOW .
WELL WHAT ARE THE OTHERS .
WELL UH I ORIGINALLY CAME FROM SAINT LOUIS SO UH THE SAINT LOUIS CARDINALS ARE ONE UH I MOVED TO KANSAS CITY SEE I HAVE I HAVE A TENDENCY TO A ADOPT TEAMS WHEN I WEN GO TO A TEA UH GO TO A TOWN .
WELL IT S HELPFUL .
YEAH SO UH I LIVED IN KANSAS CITY FOR A COUPLE YEARS AND I ADOPTED THE ROYALS I LIVED IN HOUSTON FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS SO I ADOPTED THE UH UH THE HOUSTON ASTROS SO I MEAN YOU KNOW I VE GOT QUITE A FEW .
WELL DO YOU KEEP UP WITH THE STATISTICAL STUFF .
NO I DO NT I DO NT GET INTO THAT TOO MUCH EVE EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I WILL KEEP IN IN TOUCH WITH MAYBE LIKE WHO S IN THE TOP FIVE OF HITTING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT I DO NT GET INTO YOU KNOW HOW MANY ERRORS .
SOMEBODY HAS OR THINGS LIKE THAT .
WELL THERE S THERE S A GUY ON THAT WAS ON MUMBLEX SHOW THAT I LISTEN TO GOING TO WORK IN THE MORNING .
UHHUH .
WHO DOES UH UH IT S ESSENTIALLY TRIVIAL STATISTICS .
UHHUH .
BUT THEY VE GOT A ST IT S A STATISTIC .
THAT HAS TO DO WITH WINNING AND LOSING ONE RUN GAMES .
I VE HEARD OF THAT ONE .
AND APPARENTLY THE RANGERS LAST YEAR WON A LOT OF ONE RUN GAMES .
WELL I DID NT KNOW THAT THAT S SUPPOSED TO BE A REAL GOOD STATISTIC UH .
WELL IT IT IT IS BUT IT S THE IT S IT S A REVERSE INDICATOR .
WELL THAT S TRUE THEY DO NT HAVE THE OFFENSE TO UH TO GET OUT OR TO HAVE THE THE MORE RUNS SO .
WELL WHAT .
THE WHAT .
THE ARGUMENT IS AND IT IT IT IT S ONE OF THESE STATISTICAL GEE HOW CAN YOU DRAW A CONCLUSION FROM IT BUT THEY FIND THAT THA THA THERE S A CONNECTION BETWEEN THAT AND HOW THEY DO IN SPRING TRAINING THE FOLLOWING YEAR .
UHHUH .
AND UH IT S STRANGELY ENOUGH IT S ALMOST LIKE THE LAW OF AVERAGES CATCHES YOU ON THE FOLLOWING YEAR .
HUH .
WHICH MEANS THAT IF YOU HAVE A GOOD YEAR WINNING ONE RU ONE RUN GAMES THAT THE FOLLOWING YEAR YOU LL HAVE A BAD YEAR .
AND THEY THEY VE GOT UM THEY VE LOOKED AT I THINK TWENTYTHREE TEAMS UH AND AND THE UH STATISTICS ARE SOMETHING LIKE TWENTYONE OUT OF TWENTYTHREE .
IT WAS WHICH MEANS THE RANGERS ARE GOING TO HAVE A TERRIBLE YEAR I UH .
WHICH .
I WAS KIND OF LEANING TOWARD ANYWAY TO TELL YOU .
THE TRUTH .
WELL I MEAN AND IT S UH UH I DO NT KNOW WHAT DO YOU WHAT DO YOU THINK OF INCAVIGLIA S LOSS .
I .
KIND OF THINK IT WAS NECESSARY I MEAN I I I I DO NT I M NOT A A BIG UM PURE POWER HITTER ANYWAY .
I MEAN I DO NT LIKE THESE GUYS .
THAT GET UP THERE AND SWING FOR THE DOWNS .
EVERY TIME .
I MEAN UH I THINK THAT UH THAT A PLAYER OUGHT TO HIT A HOME RUN IF HE S GOT THE PITCH TO DO IT BUT WHEN YOU GET TWO STRIKES ON YOU YOU HAVE A TEND YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD YOU KNOW SHORTEN YOUR SWING .
A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW IF IT S A PERFECT SHOT GO FOR IT BUT I MEAN YOU KNOW THE STRIKE OUTS WERE A BIG PROBLEM FOR HIM AND UH PLUS SUPPOSEDLY WHAT .
I HEARD HE WAS NOT MUCH OF A TEAM PLAYER ANYWAY SO .
WELL IT IT S AN INTERESTING CONCEPT THOUGH WHEN YOU LOOK AT UH OF OF HOW BASEBALL HOW APPARENTLY I WAS READING IN THE PAPER TONIGHT THAT THE DETROIT TIGERS ARE GOING TO SIGN HIM .
AND UH AND THE POINT OF OF I GUESS I DO NT UNDERSTAND THE THE STRATEGY OF HOW BASEBALL WORKS BUT IT SEEMS THAT YOU KNOW THEY CAN SIGN HIM .
TOMORROW .
UHHUH .
AND HE COULD GO IN THE TEAM .
THE NEXT DAY AND AND AND THEY PUT HIM IN THE LINEUP AND HE HITS A HOME RUN AND ALL OF A SUDDEN .
HE BECOMES A HERO .
YEAH WELL THAT S TRUE .
AND AND ALL HE HAS TO DO IS HIT THE BALL I MEAN YOU RE NOT A AND ALL HE HAS TO DO IS ONE YOU KNOW HIT IT ONCE .
IT DOES NT HE CAN HE CAN STRI HE CAN SWING A COUPLE TIMES MUMBLEX IF HE FOULS IT UP HE CAN SWING AS MUCH AS HE CAN .
RIGHT .
IT S AN INTERESTING UH AN INTERESTING CONCEPT OF OF HOW THEY DO IT .
BUT I AGREE WITH YOU .
I THINK THAT I THINK THAT S PART OF WHAT UH BASEBALL NEEDS MORE OF .
I UH I I GUESS WHAT BOTHERS ME IS IS THAT WHEN YOU GO UM YOU WAIT AND WAIT AND WAIT AND FINALLY A GUY GETS UP THERE AND BLASTS A HOME RUN AND THAT S ALL THE GAME IS .
I D RATHER SEE THE BALL HIT AROUND AND HAVE THE PEOPLE .
YEAH WELL THERE S THERE S ANOTHER POINT TO THAT TOO .
THEY SAID THE THAT UM THAT HE WAS HORRIBLE AT UH AT BATTING WITH WITH MEN ON BASE .
NOW HAVING SOMEBODY GET UP AND HIT A SOLO HOME RUN DOES YOU YOU KNOW GIVES YOU RUN OBVIOUSLY .
YES .
BUT I MEAN IF YOU CA NT DO IT WITH MEN ON BASE THERE S SOMETHING DEFINITELY WRONG UM YOU KNOW YOU YOU VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO GET THE TWO AND THREE RUN HOME RUNS YOU KNOW TO TO BE ABLE TO UH SCORE ENOUGH RUNS TO BE ABLE TO WIN IN THESE UH IN THIS DAY AND AGE SO .
YEAH WELL HOW DO YOU THINK THE ROYALS ARE GOING TO DO .
I THINK THE ROYALS WILL DO OKAY .
THEY HAVE THEY HAVE SEVERAL PITCHERS .
THAT HAD BADLY YEARS LAST YEAR AND THEY ARE THEY RE THESE UH CYCLE PITCHERS THEY THEY PITCH ONE YEAR BAD ONE YEAR GOOD ONE BEER BAD ONE YEAR GOOD .
SABERHAGEN HAS WON UH SUPPOSEDLY THE CY I THINK HE WON CY YEAR UH TWO OUT OF THREE YEARS AND UH YOU KNOW SO HE S VERY MUCH DUE FOR A GOOD YEAR .
WELL ARE THEY GOING TO BEAT ARE THEY GOING TO BEAT OAKLAND .
WELL NOW SEE THAT S A GOOD QUESTION I THAT S I DO NT KNOW HOW OAKLAND S GOING TO REACT TO BEING UH SWEPT IN THE WORLD SERIES LAST YEAR .
THEY COULD VERY EASILY UH TAKE THAT AS A CHALLENGE .
WHICH IS THE WAY MOST TEAMS NAT YOU KNOW NATURALLY DO .
YEAH .
UH AND AND JUST GO OUT AND NOT GIVE ANYBODY A CHANCE TO BEAT THEM SO .
WELL I GO TO SAINT LOUIS FROM TIME TO TIME AND I WATCH I I WATCH THEIR SPORTS UP THERE AND THEY RE .
UHHUH .
UH THEY RE CERTAINLY INTENSE ABOUT THE CARDINALS THEY .
OH YEAH BASEBALL IS THEIR IS THEIR LIFE UP THERE LIKE FOOTBALL IS DOWN HERE I THINK .
Y DID YOU ACTUALLY LIVE IN SAINT LOUIS .
I LIVED IN THE SUBURBS OF SAINT LOUIS YEAH .
YE EVERYBODY DOES RIGHT .
YEAH THAT S TRUE TOO .
I THINK THAT S ALL THAT THEY HAVE .
I HAD A FRIEND FROM COLLEGE .
THAT LIVES IN UH MUMBLEX IT S WELL I SHOULD SAY ON THE WEST SIDE I MEAN EVERYTHING S ON THE WEST SIDE .
MANCHESTER .
UHHUH .
UH OUT THAT WAY .
UM .
AND I WENT AND VISITED HIM BUT ANYWAY IT IS INTERESTING .
WELL HOW ARE THE CARDINALS .
DO YOU STILL KEEP UP WITH THEM OR SOMETH .
YEAH OH YEAH I I DEFINITELY DO IN FACT .
I VE GOT FAMILY .
THAT STILL LIVES UP THERE .
UM FROM WHAT .
I HEAR FROM EVERYBODY UP THERE THEY RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A GOOD YEAR BECAUSE THEY LET TOO MANY PEOPLE GO .
BUT I VE BEEN FOLLOWING SPRING TRAINING AND THEY RE LIKE ONE OF THE BEST TEAMS IN SPRING TRAINING SO FAR .
WELL IS THAT A GOOD INDICATOR .
THAT WELL IT CAN BE .
IT IT REALLY KIND OF DEPENDS ON ON UM WHAT .
THEY WERE YOU KNOW WHAT .
THEY WERE LOOKING FOR .
IN OTHER WORDS IF IF IN SPRING CRA TRAINING THEY WERE LOOKING AT ALL THEIR KIDS LIKE A LOT OF THEM DO UM THEN IT REALLY DOES NT GIVE YOU .
ANY INDICATION .
BUT IF THEY WERE UH PLAYING THE PEOPLE THAT THEY RE GOING TO PLAY THEN THAT MIGHT BE PRETTY GOOD INDICATION SO YOU KNOW IT S IT S NOT A GREAT INDICATION BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN TEAMS .
THAT HAVE JUST YOU KNOW COME OUT AND JUST WON ALL KINDS OF GAMES IN SPRING CRANI TRAINING AND THEN GONE ON A YOU KNOW FOURTEEN GAME LOSING STREAK IN THE FIRST OF THE SEASON SO .
YOU KNOW WHAT .
I THINK IS REMARKABLE IS UH IT SEEMS THAT WHAT .
YOU REALLY NEED TO DO TO WIN THOUGH IS TO HAVE A TEAM .
THAT HAS REASONABLE TALENT AND HAS SOME PEOPLE .
THAT HAVE HAVE HAVE REAL BREAKTHROUGH YEARS .
EXACTLY YEAH .
AND AND THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU FORECAST THAT .
YOU CA NT .
IF YOU HAD TO IF YOU HAD TO BET ON WHO WOULD BE IN THE WORLD SERIES I MEAN IT WOULD BE REALLY TOUGH .
RIGHT TH I THINK THE BEST THING THAT YOU CAN DO IS GO WITH UM THE PLAYERS .
THAT ARE THAT HAVE THE TALENT TO DO THE BEST YEARS .
AND UM THAT THEY HAD NT HAD THESE UH GIGANTIC UH CAREER YEARS YET AND .
YEAH .
AND JUST KIND OF ASSUME THAT YOU KNOW SO ONE OF THEM IS GOING TO BREAK THROUGH EVENTUALLY SO .
AND I I THINK THEY SAID THE REDS UM THIS LAST YEAR I M NOT SURE THAT THEY SAID THAT THEY HAD THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVING CAREER YEARS .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW AND AND SO THEY MAY BE EVEN BE BETTER THIS YEAR .
WELL WELL WHEN ARE THE RANGERS GOING TO COME THROUGH TH .
UH THAT S A GOOD QUESTION .
I THE RANGERS HAVE A HAVE A PITCHING PROBLEM AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN FIX THAT OR NOT IS GOING TO BE AN INTERESTING QUESTION .
THEY RE DOING THE RIGHT THING THOUGH UH THEY ARE GOING WITH THEIR FARM SYSTEM .
THEY RE LETTING THEIR FARM SYSTEM UH BUILD UP AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND .
WELL IS THERE ENOUGH MONEY THAT S PART OF IT I UH THAT WAS PART OF SKIP BAYLESS ARGUMENT .
UHHUH .
I DO NT KNOW IF YOU READ SKIP BAYLESS BUT .
NO .
A A LOCAL COMMENTARY AND .
UHHUH .
HIS ARGUMENT IS THAT UH THE OWNERSHIP IS NOT INCLINED TO LOSE BIG MONEY LONG ENOUGH TO TO BRING IN THE BIG DOLLARS .
UM THAT S PROBABLY TRUE .
WOULD YOU WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT .
WELL CONSIDERING WHAT .
I VE SEEN IN THE LAST UH YOU KNOW TWO SEASONS I M BEGINNING TO AGREE WITH THAT YEAH .
BUT I MEAN YOU DO NT HAVE TO SPEND THE BIG MONEY AS FAR AS I M CONCERNED TO UH TO WIN .
YOU JUST HAVE TO SPEND IT IF IT S NECESSARY .
UH .
IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU VE GOT A PLAYER ON YOUR TEAM .
WHO S HELPING YOUR TEAM THEN KEEP HIM THERE .
DO NT LET HIM GO AWAY .
YEAH .
AND I THINK THAT S REALLY WHAT S BEEN HURTING UH THE UH RANGERS .
WELL DID NT KANSAS CITY PUT UP QUITE A BIT OF MONEY FOR THEIR .
OH YEAH THEY THEY SPENT MORE MONEY .
PITCHING STAFF .
LAST YEAR THAN ANY OTHER TEAM IN THE IN THE LEAGUE AND THEY WERE YOU KNOW TOWARD THE BOTTOM OF THE LEAGUE .
UH SO IT S LIKE I SAID SPENDING MONEY DOES NT GUARANTEE YOU UH WINNING A PENNANT .
YEAH .
IT REALLY DOES NT SO .
WELL AND THAT I THINK THAT S MAYBE PART OF IT THAT THAT THE UM AND IT YOU KNOW IF I OWNED THE TEAM .
I THINK YOU D LIKE THEM TO DO WELL BUT THE QUESTION OF LOSING BIG BIG MONEY THAT WHAT DID DID DID STEINBRENNER ACTUALLY MAKE MONEY ON THE .
UH YOU GOT ME .
I YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THERE S COMING TO A POINT REAL SOON WHEN TICKET PRICES ARE GOING TO BE TO THE POINT WHERE THE AVERAGE FAN CA NT GO AND ONCE YOU DO THAT YOU LOSE EVERYTHING I MEAN .
WELL IT S IT IT YEAH IT S A LITTLE BIT LIKE ANY OTHER SPORT YOU KNOW .
WHEN IT STARTS COSTING YOU .
FIFTY OR A HUNDRED DOLLARS TO GO TO A GAME .
UHHUH .
AND UH YOU KNOW I MEAN I I GUESS AS WE GET OLDER I YOU RE PROBABLY GOING IF IF YOU IF YOU COMPARE TO GO TO A A SPORT A A SAY .
YOU GO TO A ROCK CONCERT .
UHHUH .
OR OR EVEN A PERFORMANCE A AN OPERA OR THE SYMPHONY OR SOMETHING UH IF YOU KNOW I BUT HOW HOW OFTEN DO YOU DO THAT .
RIGHT .
AN .
I I I WOULD I WOULD THINK BASEBALL PROBABLY FEEDS ON A NUMBER OF PEOPLE .
THAT CAN GO OUT THERE YOU KNOW SEVERAL TIMES .
A .
THAT THAT S THE WHOLE POINT .
THERE ARE SO MANY GAMES IN IN A YEAR THAT THEY VE GOT TO HAVE REPEAT CUSTOMERS .
YEAH .
THEY CA NT AFFORD NOT TO AND YOU KNOW THAT S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK SAINT LOUIS HAS DONE UM I MEAN THEIR YOU KNOW THEIR TICKET PRICES ARE YOU KNOW KIN I GUESS AS HIGH AS ANYBODY ELSE S BUT WHAT SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER THEY ATTRACT UH SO MANY PEOPLE FROM SOM I MEAN THEY RE A IT S A SMALL MARKET AND YET THEY ATTRACT AS MANY IF NOT MORE THAN MOST UH UH MOST OTHER CITIES SO .
YEAH BUT DO NT YOU THINK THERE S A THERE THERE ARE OLDER FANS THERE .
I I DO NT MEAN OLDER UM YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT THAT IT S IT S A BETTER ESTABLISHED AND THAT THE THE CITY IS IS IS MORE OF A .

GOOD LUCK IN SCHOOL .
THANKS .
BYE BYE .
BYE BYE .
HERE WE GO .
OKAY UM NOW WE RE SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT SOCIAL ACTIVITIES RIGHT .
WELL THE CHANGES THAT S OCCURRED LIKE IT HOW WAS IT MAYBE TEN TWENTY THIRTY YEARS AGO AS OPPOSED TO WHAT IT IS TODAY .
UHHUH .
HOW WE RE LIVING SOCIALLY IN COMPARISON TO MAYBE FROM THAT TIME PERIOD FROM TEN TWENTY OR WHATEVER YOU REMEMBER IT TO BE .
I THINK UM WELL I GUESS IT WOULD BE LIKE YOUR GENERATION COMPARED TO MY GENERATION I THINK YOUR GENERATION IS UM WHAT DO I SAY UH UH THEY RE THEY RE THEY RE POLITE THEY HAVE MORE RESPECT FOR .
OTHER PEOPLE JUST IN IN GENERAL I THINK AND JUST JUST TOWARDS PEOPLE AND PROPERTY AND UM I I GUESS THEY WOULD WOULD BE MORE CONSERVATIVE SOME OF THEM I GUESS .
YEAH WE ARE UH SOMEWHAT CONSERVATIVE BUT AS FAR AS THE UH SOCIALLY OUR CRIME RATE HAS INCREASED AND ALTHOUGH IT S MORE PUBLICIZED AS OPPOSED TO WHAT IT USED TO BE IT SEEMS LIKE .
UHHUH .
VIOLENT CRIME IS ON THE INCREASE FROM WHAT I VE SEEN AND UM OUR PRISON POPULATION HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED I WOULD SAY UM OUR ECONOMY TOO IS REALLY IT S JUST NOT WHAT IT USED TO BE IN THE SIXTIES OR EVEN FIFTIES FROM HISTORY FROM WHAT I VE READ AND .
UHHUH .
UH EVEN THE WELL IT STARTED SPIRALING DOWN I SUPPOSE IN THE SEVENTIES AND UH OUR RECOVERY UH ECONOMICALLY HAS NOT BEEN LIKE IT USED TO BE TO ME ALSO OUR NUCLEAR FAMILY IS NOT THE SAME BECAUSE MORE PEOPLE ARE LIVING TOGETHER .
UHHUH .
THAT ARE NT MARRIED .
UHHUH .
UH I DO NT I DO NT KNOW IF UH CA NT MAKE ANY JUDGMENTS OF THAT NATURE BUT UH I DO NT REALLY WANT TO EITHER .
BECAUSE I HAVE NO PROBLEMS ABOUT IT EITHER WAY .
UHHUH .
AND UM KIDS ARE I I SUPPOSE HAVE BEEN RAISED BY SINGLE PARENTS MORE THAN THEY EVER USED TO .
YES I AGREE WITH .
WOMEN ARE MORE ON THE RISE TOO .
UHHUH .
SO FAR AS GETTING THEIR CAREERS ESTABLISHED AND UH THEY DO NT .
WELL .
NO LONGER FEEL DEPENDENT UPON MEN .
WELL DO YOU THINK THAT THAT MAYBE I MEAN UH I VE HEARD DIFFERENT YOU KNOW LIKE UM LIKE I KNOW MY MOM AND LIKE OTHER LADIES THEY COMPLAIN BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT UM THE WOMEN NOW ARE TOO BUSY WITH THEIR OWN PERSONAL LIFE AND CAREER THAT THEY REALLY DO NT HAVE TIME FOR THEIR KIDS .
THAT S PROBABLY TRUE I MEAN THEY THEY ARE A LOT OF THEM THAT HAVE TO PUT THEIR KIDS INTO DAY CARE .
UHHUH .
OR HAVING MORE WITH BABY SITTERS AND ESPECIALLY IF THEY DO NT HAVE BOY FRIENDS OR HUSBANDS AND UH I GUESS THAT S WHY YOU ALWAYS HEAR THESE STORIES ABOUT KIDS BEING NEGLECTED .
YEAH .
UH IN FACT UH THERE WAS ONE LADY IN THIS AREA SHE WAS CAUGHT GOING TO WORK AND LEAVING HER DAUGHTER IN HER CAR ALL DAY .
OH MY GOSH JUST A BABY .
NOT A BABY SHE WAS OLD ENOUGH TO UH I WOULD SAY SHE WAS FIVE TO EIGHT YEARS OLD .
OH MY GOSH .
SOMEWHERE ALONG THAT RANGE BUT THAT S JUST AN EXTREME EXAMPLE .
UHHUH .
I WOULD IMAGINE YOU KNOW THE SITUATIONS ARE OUT THERE .
YEAH .
UM .
WELL UM UM WELL I THINK THE EDUCATION LIKE OUR EDUCATION HAS UM INCREASED DRAMATICALLY BUT THEN I THINK ALSO THAT WE RE FORGETTING LIKE BASIC THINGS LIKE WE SHOULD KNOW .
I AGREE THERE .
LIKE I I THINK WELL UM IN THE MORALS AND VALUES OF LIKE MY GENERATION FOR THE MOST FOR MOST PEOPLE ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE MORALS AND VALLEYS UM VALUES OF LIKE PER SE YOUR GENERATION BUT I THINK AS WE GET OLDER IT GETS TO YOUR YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN I THINK THE KIDS NOW ARE ARE I WOULD SAY LOUDER NOW UNTIL AFTER THEY REACH LIKE TWENTYFIVE AND THEN I THINK THEY REALLY HAVE A STRONG DECLINE AND START TO SETTLE DOWN AND REALIZE THINGS .
YEAH UM I COULD AGREE WITH THAT BECAUSE USED TO CONSERVATISM WAS INHERENT AT A MUCH YOUNGER AGE .
UHHUH YEAH BECAUSE I THINK WE RE GIVEN MORE NOW WHEREAS YOU HAD TO WORK FOR EVERYTHING AND KIDS NOWADAYS ARE JUST GIVEN SO MUCH THAT THEY REALLY DO NT HAVE TO WORK AND YOU KNOW AND THEY THEY DO NT HAVE ANY INTENT TO GO WORKING UNTIL THEY HAVE TO .
UHHUH THAT S AN AGREEABLE TOPIC THERE .
UM WHAT ELSE CONSIDERING BESIDE FAMILY ECONOMICS UM OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM HAS CHANGED FOR US I MEAN WE CAN WE CAN NOW TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD IN NO TIME IT S JUST A HOP SKIP AND A JUMP TO GET INTO A PLANE TO GO FROM THE EAST TO THE WEST COAST .
UHHUH .
AND UH WELL I I THINK WHAT S HAPPENED TOO IS JUST OUR TECHNOLOGY IS JUST ADVANCING SO RAPIDLY THAT AND THERE S SO MUCH INFORMATION AVAILABLE OUT THERE THAT FOLKS OUT THERE JUST HAVE A HARD TIME KEEPING UP ASIDE FROM JUST GOING THROUGH THEIR DAILY ROUTINE OF LIVING TO GET FROM DAY TO DAY .
UHHUH .
AND TO KEEP ABREAST OF THE KNOWLEDGE OUT THERE WE GOT TO CONSTANTLY READ GO TO SCHOOL UH T V WATCHING HAS SURE HAS NT GONE TOO MUCH OUT THE DOOR BECAUSE T V IS STILL WELL THE CABLE SYSTEM AND THE SATELLITE DISHES HAS MADE IT TO WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN JUST LEAVE REGULAR T V PROGRAMMING AND WATCH A LOT OF OTHER A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS OUT THERE AS WELL AS USE OF THE V C R .
UHHUH .
SO THAT I DO NT KNOW IF IT REALLY HAMPERS OR IT HELPS OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM .
I DO NT KNOW BECAUSE I KNOW I DO NT WATCH WHILE I M UP HERE AT SCHOOL I DO NT WATCH HARDLY ANY T V LIKE THURSDAY NIGHT I LIKE TO SIT DOWN AND WATCH A FEW SHOWS BUT I .
DO YOU WATCH L A LAW .
NO I DO NT WATCH THAT I USED TO BUT I DO NT ANY MORE .
I LIKE THAT .
BUT ALL I MEAN THERE ARE EVEN THOUGH THERE S A FEW UP HERE WE CALL THEM COUCH POTATOES THEY LOVE TO SIT IN FRONT OF THE T V I MUMBLEX BUT FOR THE MOST PART I WILL I WILL WELL I LIVE IN AN ALL GIRLS DORM BUT FOR THE MOST PART WE RE ALL BETWEEN THE AGES OF EIGHTEEN AND LIKE TWENTYONE .
UHHUH .
AND THERE IS NT REALLY A LOT OF T V WATCHING .
WELL THAT S GOOD AT LEAST YOU RE HITTING THE BOOKS RIGHT .
THEY RE EITHER HITTING THE BOOKS OR SOMETHING ELSE I DO NT KNOW WHAT BUT I KNOW OH WELL I GUESS THEY HAVE THEIR CROWDS LIKE DURING THE SOAP OPERAS YOU KNOW LIKE IN BETWEEN CLASSES OR SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
BUT I CA NT SAY THAT THERE S REALLY THAT MANY PEOPLE THAT LIKE SIT IN FRONT OF THE T V ALL DAY .
WELL THAT S A CHANGE THEN OH OF COURSE GOING TO SCHOOL TOO IT S DIFFERENT FROM THE HOME ENVIRONMENT .
UHHUH BUT THEN UM LIKE I KNOW THIS GIRL SHE S DOING HER STUDENT TEACHING OR SHE S JUST WORKING LIKE WITHIN THE SCHOOL AND UM YESTERDAY SHE WAS AT THE KINDERGARTEN AND THERE S THIS LITTLE BOY HE LIKE DID NT WANT TO DO ANYTHING AND HE SAID I M NOT DOING THIS I DO NT LIKE IT AND HE SAT AT HIS DESK WITH TWO PENCILS IN HIS HAND AND PRETEND LIKE HE S PLAYING NINTENDO .
UM .
YOU KNOW SO UH I DO NT KNOW HOW I MEAN I NEVER REALLY WATCHED THAT A LOT OF T V WHEN I WAS YOUNGER BUT MY PARENTS REALLY DID NT ALLOW US TO WATCH THAT MUCH T V SO I DO NT KNOW .
I AGREE WITH YOUR PARENTS .
BECAUSE UH T V KIND OF RUINED ME BECAUSE THAT S THAT S ALL THAT WE HAD .
UHHUH .
WELL NOT REALLY BUT I MEAN IT S UH FOR THE TOP MEDIUM OF ENTERTAINMENT .
YEAH WELL WE WATCH A LOT OF I GUESS WE WATCHED A LOT OF T V IN THE WINTER TIME BUT IN THE SUMMER LIKE RIGHT NOW MY MOM WELL LIKE SHE DOES NT LET US WATCH T V UNTIL LIKE EIGHT OCLOCK AT NIGHT YOU KNOW .
EVEN AT YOUR AGE .
WELL LIKE MY YOUNGER BROTHERS AND SISTERS AT HOME LIKE WHEN IT STARTS .
UHHUH .
GETTING NICE OUTSIDE IN THE SUMMER AND EVERYTHING .
UHHUH .
SHE LL SHE MAKES US GO OUTSIDE EVEN NOW WHEN I GO HOME FOR THE SUMMER SHE MAKES US GO OUTSIDE AND WE RE ALLOWED TO COME IN AND WATCH T V UNTIL IT S DARK BECAUSE SHE DOES NT LIKE THE T V HERSELF .
I SEE .
AND IF IT WAS UP TO HER WE WOULD NT HAVE ONE SO YOU KNOW SHE FEELS THAT KIDS ARE TOO DEPENDENT ON IT ALSO .
UHHUH OH IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE .
UM .
UM .
WHAT ABOUT IN OUR WORK ETHICS .
WORK ETHICS OH .
I .
MUMBLEX IT S GET IT S MAYBE GETTING BETTER UM A LITTLE OF COURSE WE WE WE RE HAVING TO WEATHER THROUGH THE SAVINGS AND LOANS .
UHHUH .
ALL THE OTHER SCANDALOUS ITEMS THAT WELL THE GREED THAT OVERWHELMED US IN THE EIGHTIES .
UHHUH .
AND UH I THINK I THINK IT S GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE IT S PATCHWORK PUT ON US .
UM .
BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MUCH TO PAY FOR NOW IT S GOING TO BE REALLY PASSED ON TO YOUR GENERATION AND MAYBE A FEW OTHERS .
YEAH .
INCLUDING WHAT S LEFT OF OURS .

ROBERTO DIED WHILE WE WERE DOWN THERE AS A MATTER OF FACT .
THAT YEAH THAT S EXACTLY ABOUT TWENTY YEARS NOW .

UH WHAT WAS IT LIKE LIVING THERE I MEAN DID YOU FIND THAT PEOPLE APPRECIATED HAVING THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING .
IT S LIKE ANYWHERE ELSE PEOPLE ARE INDIVIDUALS AND I FIND IT REALLY DIFFICULT AN AND FRUSTRATED TRYING TO MAKE STEREOTYPES YOU KNOW .
RIGHT I AGREE WITH THAT YEAH .
AND UH I I CAN UNDERSTAND THE THE FRUSTRATION YOU MUST HAVE GONE THROUGH UH GOING TO THE THE SCHOOL UH .
WE I DID NT MEAN THAT IN A TOTALLY NEGATIVE SENSE .
NO NO IT S JUST IF IF IT S NOT PART OF YOUR CULTURE .
RIGHT .
AND YOU COME UPON SOMETHING THAT YOU RE TOTALLY UNPREPARED FOR .
UHHUH .
UH THE FIRS I HAD GONE TO A VERY UH UH UM CONSERVATIVE UH COLLEGE AND WHEN I STARTED TEACHING SCHOOL IT WAS IN AN INNER CITY SITUATION .
ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT PUERTO RICAN IT WAS UH A MEXICAN AMERICAN AND BLACK STUDENTS .
UHHUH .
THEY WERE NT LIKE ANY OF THE MEXICAN AMERICAN OR BLACK PEOPLE I HAD GONE TO SCHOOL WITH SO IT WAS .
RIGHT THAT YOU HAD EVER BEEN .
IT WAS VERY VERY DIFFERENT .
RIGHT I MEAN I LL GIVE YOU AND IDEA THAT I HAD UM AND I WOULD SAY I WOULD SAY THE ONES THE MAJORITY APPRECIATED WHAT THEY WERE HAVING IN THIS COUNTRY .
YEAH .
UH BUT A LOT OF THE ONES THAT DID NT E EVEN IN THE MINORITY NOT IN THE SENSE OF THE CULTURAL WORLD WORD THEY MADE IT WORSE FOR THE OTHER KIDS IN SCHOOL AND YOU KNOW CHICAGO BACK THEN EVEN HAD BILINGUAL CLASSES .

I M NOT SO MUCH AGAINST THEIR MAKING UH IT A STATE .
UHHUH .
BUT I WOULD WANT A VERY VERY VERY CLEAR MAJORITY BECAUSE IF THE MINORITY CAN BE SO VOCIFEROUS WHETHER YOU RE TALKING THIS GROUP OR OR .
UHHUH .
ANY OTHER GROUP THAT THAT HAS A STAKE IN SOMETHING .
RIGHT THAT S EXACTLY .
AND THEY CAN MAKE AS YOU SAID UH SO WELL THE A A FEW CAN MAKE IT SO MISERABLE FOR EVERYBODY ELSE .
AND THAT S EXACTLY I MEAN I CAN REMEMBER INSTANCES THAT UH WAS NT AS UH YOU KNOW BAD LORD I DO NT KNOW HOW IT WOULD BE TODAY WELL I KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE .
I VE BEEN BACK UP FOR A REUNION .
THAT THAT MY GIVE YOU A CLUE .

AND I SAID THAT S REALLY IRRELEVANT WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT UM IF YOU CAN TALK TO LIKE I MEAN I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT THE UM ISLAND OF PUERTO RICO FROM TALKING TO THESE KIDS .
OH I M SURE .
YOU KNOW AND YOU LIVED THERE SO YOU KNOW THAT PARTS OF IT ARE BEAUTIFUL AND PARTS OF IT ARE SQUALOR .
SAME AS AS ANY OTHER PART OF THE WORLD .
LIKE HERE YEAH .
REALLY .
IT S THE SAME .
I I DO NT I DO NT THINK IT S REALLY TO THEIR BEST INTERESTS .
UHHUH .
TO UH UH ATTAIN STATEHOOD AS IT IS RIGHT NOW THEY HAVE THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS THEY HAVE UH REPRESENTATION .
UHHUH .
BUT THEY DO NT HAVE TO PAY ALL THE TAXES AND SO FORTH THAT WE DO .
THIS IS TRUE .
UH BEING THAT IT S AN ISLAND ECONOMY UM EVERYTHING IS IMPORTED AND YES THE COST OF LIVING IS SUPER HIGH BUT BUT THEY RE PROTECTED IN SO MANY WAYS WITHOUT HAVING TO TO PAY FOR THE RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES .
UHHUH I KNOW WHAT YOU RE SAYING YEAH TH .
SO SO YOU KNOW I I WOULD JUST AS SOON AN AN AND IF IF THEY VOTED TO FOR INDEPENDENCE I WOULD BACK THEM A HUNDRED PERCENT AND THAT S .
UHHUH .
THAT S BECAUSE I I GUESS BECAUSE I M NOT INTO TERRITORIALISM OR WHATEVER THAT WE HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST .
RIGHT RIGHT I PROBABLY WOULD SAY THE SOMETHING IF I KNEW THAT INTE INTELLECTUALLY THAT IT WAS GOOD AND EMOTIONALLY THAT THE PEOPLE THERE WANTED IT .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW IT S JUST UM I MEAN R RIGHT NOW THEY HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF VOTING WITH THE UNITED STATES DO NT THEY .
YEAH YEAH .
THEY COUNT YEAH AS A PRINCIPLE THAT S WHAT I THOUGHT UM BUT I VE ALSO BEEN DOWN THERE WE TRAVELED A LOT TO THE B V I THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS .
OH YES UHHUH .
SO YOU ALWAYS PASS THROUGH SAN JUAN IN GOING TO PLACES LIKE MUMBLEX OR MUMBLEX .
UHHUH .
I UM AND IT S JUST IT S I THINK WHAT THEY DO NEED IS AN INFUSION OF SOME OF THE UNITED STATES UM PRIVILEGES SOME OF OUR RESOURCES THE EDUCATIONAL THE TEACHERS THE UM .
UHHUH .
ACADEMIC OPPORTUNITY YOU KNOW I DO NT THINK WE DO EN DO ENOUGH OF A RESOURCE TRANSFER IF THERE IS SUCH A THING .
PART OF THAT THOUGH HAS BEEN I THINK UH SELECTED BY BY THEM .
UHHUH .
IN THAT THAT WHEREAS THEY WANT THE BENEFITS OF SOME OF OF WHAT THE CONTINENTALS CAN OFFER THEY .
UHHUH .
THEY WANT TO MAINTAIN THAT UM CULTURE OF THEIRS .
UH .
WHICH WHICH I UNDERSTAND .
UHHUH .
AND AND SO OFTEN WHEN YOU WHEN YOU BRING IN THE ADVANTAGES THE RESOURCES AND SO FORTH THERE THERE IS A TRADE .
THEY LL LOSE THEIR ETHNICITY AS THEY SAY YEAH THAT S .
MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO THAT I THAT I KNOW ABOUT WHO REALLY UH WOULD FA FAVOR STATEHOOD .
UHHUH .
HAVE PRETTY MUCH ASSIMILATED INTO THE THE CONTINENTAL STATES ALREADY .
SEE .
OR THEY HAVE FAMILY HERE AND THIS WAY THEY CAN GO BACK AND FORTH AND AND IT S NOT THAT MUCH OF A STRAIN AND .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THEY RE KIND OF LACKADAISICAL ABOUT IT .
UHHUH .
AT LEAST AT THE PRESENT TIME THAT S THE WAY THE WAY THE PENDULUM SEEMS TO BE SWINGING RIGHT NOW .
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU PROBABLY KNOW QUI I MEAN TO THIS DAY ARE YOU STILL IN TOUCH WITH ANY NATIVE PUERTO RICANS THAT YOU HAVE MADE FRIENDS WITH OR .
NO WE REALLY DID NT KEEP THAT UP IT S JUST .
NO THAT S NATURAL I JUST THOUGHT I D ASK THAT BECAUSE I WONDERED WHAT YOU THOUGHT THEY MIGHT THINK .
UM .
BECAUSE I REALLY DO NT HAVE ANY UM PERSONAL OR PROFESSIONAL OR FAMILIAL TIES DOWN THERE I DO NT KNOW THE PEOP THE THE THE THAT S JUST CHILDREN BUT THE THE PEOPLE THAT I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL WITH UM I THINK THE MAJORITY ARE IN THAT THE PROBABLY THE GENERATION YOURS AND MINE AND THE ONE RIGHT AFTER US THAT UM THEIR PARENTS DID NOT WANT TO ACCLIMATE TO THE UNITED STATES .
UHHUH .
UM IN TERMS OF RETAINING UM AND MY BACKGROUND S EUROPEAN HERITAGE AND THEIR BACKGROUND IT WOULD BE YOU KNOW THE WE I GUESS I WOULD SAY THE LA LATIN OR LATINO HERITAGE .
UHHUH .
NOT SPEAKING IN ENGLISH UM HAVING THE CHILDREN DRIVE THEM EVERYWHERE AND THESE WERE NOT OLD PEOPLE THESE WERE LIKE IN THEIR EARLY FORTIES .
UM .
UM AND I ALWAYS THAT ALWAYS BOTHERED ME AND THEN THERE WERE SOME CHILDREN THAT I NOTICED AS SOON AS ALL THE KIDS WERE OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL I MEAN THEY WENT BACK TO PUERTO RICO TO LIVE YOU KNOW THEY HAD MADE ENOUGH MONEY HERE .
AND SO TH .
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I GUESS IT S ALL ABOUT CHOICE .
YEAH .
IN EVERYTHING UM WAS IT I MEAN HOW WERE THEY TOWARD THAT S INTERESTING THE THE WAY TERM YOU USED CONTINENTALS WHICH I M SURE IS THE PROPER TERM HOW WERE THEY TOWARD THE UNITED STATES IN TERMS OF JUST GENERAL RELATIONSHIPS I MEAN WERE THEY GLAD .
THERE REALLY WERE THREE MAJOR UM CAMPS .
UHHUH .
AND THERE WERE THOSE WHO WHO UH WERE VERY FRIENDLY VERY OPEN ANY ANYTHING WE CAN DO FOR YOU UH UH EITHER WAY YOU KNOW WAS GREAT AND THEN THERE WERE THOSE AT THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM AND THOSE THAT HO HUM WHATEVER .

YEAH UM WE HAVE A COUPLE WE HAVE LIKE A STEEL MILL AND A COUPLE REFINERIES AND STUFF AND I KNOW THERE S A LOT OF AIR POLLUTION GOING IN THERE AND LIKE THEY THEY GET FINED WHENEVER THEY DO THE AIR POLLUTION .
UHHUH .
BUT THE FINE IS NOTHING YOU KNOW .
YEAH IT S IT S .
IT S LIKE NOTHING TO THEM .
LIKE LIKE TWO HOURS OF OUTPUT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
YEAH YEAH .
THAT S TRUE THAT S TRUE .
UHHUH .
YEAH I A UH I GREW UP IN SOUTH DAKOTA SO I WAS NEVER I WAS NEVER EXPOSED .
UHHUH .
TO ANYTHING OF OF THE OF THE SORT UM THERE WERE ALWAYS E P A PEOPLE AND WHAT NOT WERE ALWAYS TELLING US THAT UH FARM CHEMICALS AND WHAT NOT WERE DESTROYING OUR WATER SYSTEM AND ALL THAT .
UHHUH .
BUT WE JUST WE JUST NEVER SAW THE RESULTS THERE WAS THERE WAS DUST IN THE AIR DURING PLANTING SEASONS AND WHAT NOT BUT THAT THAT WAS ALL WE EVER SAW AND THEN FIVE YEARS AGO I MOVED TO DALLAS AND I SUDDENLY STARTED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT BURNING EYES AND ALL THAT STUFF IS ABOUT THAT I D ALWAYS HEARD ABOUT IT UH IT S IT GETS IT S REAL DEPRESSING IN THE MORNING SOMETIME YOU CAN TELL IF IT S A GOOD DAY OR A BAD DAY BY UH HOW FAR OUT FROM DOWNTOWN UH YOU CAN BE ON THE ROAD AND STILL NOT SEE IT .
OH MY GOD .
AND UH YEAH I MEAN IT S NOT I DO NT THINK DALLAS IS CONSIDERED UH A REAL BAD PLACE FOR AIR POLLUTION BUT YOU YOU CAN TELL YOU CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCES IN THE DAYS WHEN IT S WHEN THE HAZE IS KIND OF YELLOWISH GRAY INSTEAD OF JUST BEING A A FOGGY MISTY COLOR .
UHHUH .
AND UH IT IT S A LITTLE IT S A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING SOMETIMES YOU START TO REALIZE WHAT YOU RE BREATHING .
UH YEAH BUT I DO NT KNOW WHAT THEY CAN DO TO REALLY PREVENT IT YOU KNOW LIKE HOW WHAT CAN THEY DO ABOUT THE OIL BURNING OVER IN KUWAIT WHAT YOU KNOW I MEAN THEY FINE THE INDUSTRIES BUT YOU KNOW THAT DOES NT SEEM TO STOP THEM THERE .
RIGHT .
I DO NT KNOW WHAT ELSE THEY CAN DO .
RIGHT IT IT S THAT THERE REALLY IS NT A WHOLE LOT IT S ONE OF THOSE UH IT S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT IF THEY DO A LITTLE BIT AND UH AND YOU KNOW E EVERY LITTLE BIT DOES HELP I DO BELIEVE THAT UM BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE EARTH IS A KIND OF A SELFREGULATING SYSTEM AND UH IT WILL CLEAN ITSELF UP EVENTUALLY IT THE WHOLE IDEA IS NOT TO NOT TO PUSH THE LIMIT TOO HARD I GUESS .
UHHUH .
LET THE YOU KNOW LET THE NATURAL NATURAL SYSTEMS TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE .
YEAH I I YEAH I JUST DO NT UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE ANYONE CAN DO ABOUT IT I DO NT THINK IT S SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE REALLY THINK ABOUT EITHER .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW IT S I MEAN IT IT SHOULD PROBABLY BE A BIG ISSUE YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT S IT S DOING A LOT OF DAMAGE BUT I IT S SOMETHING YOU KNOW I DO NT THINK MANY PEOPLE REALLY THINK ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT S NOTHING THEY I DO NT THINK WE REALLY HAVE TOO MUCH CONTROL OVER IT .
RIGHT AND IT S ONE OF THOSE THINGS IT IT S SO HARD TO MEASURE WHAT WHAT THE DAMAGE IS .
UHHUH .
IT S KIND OF LIKE OH I GUESS IT S KIND OF LIKE KIND OF LIKE CIGARETTE SMOKING YOU KNOW IT IT COULD GO ON FOR YEARS AND YEARS UNTIL THEY START TO SEE SOME RESULTS AND PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY ACTUALLY SAY YEAH IT S IT S IT S DOING DOING SOME DAMAGE .
UHHUH .
AND SOMETHING S GOT TO BE DONE UM THERE S YOU KNOW THERE S A LOT OF THINGS LIKE THAT IT YOU CAN UH YOU CAN POUND ON SOMETHING FOR A LONG TIME BEFORE IT FINALLY BREAKS BUT UNTIL IT BREAKS YOU DO NT REALLY KNOW THAT THERE YOU WERE DOING ANYTHING TO IT .
YEAH EXACTLY .
BUT UH .
WELL I REALLY DO NT KNOW TOO MUCH ELSE ABOUT IT .
YEAH WELL THAT S THAT S I THINK WE BOTH AGREE IT S IT S ONE OF THOSE DEALS THAT UH I JUST THINK THERE S A LOT OF OTHER PROBLEMS RIGHT NOW .
UHHUH .
AND UH WE VE DONE A LOT TO TAKE CARE OF IT .
YEAH .
AND UH .
YEAH WE HAVE TRIED I MEAN YOU KNOW AND UM I I KNOW WHERE YOU KNOW WHERE A COUPLE OF THE MILLS THAT HAVE I KNOW THEY PUT THINGS ON THEIR STACKS YOU KNOW TO FILTER THE SMOKE AND DO ALL KINDS OF THINGS BUT I MEAN EVERY NOW AND THEN IT BREAKS YOU KNOW AND .
OH SURE .
AND YOU JUST HAVE SMOKE GOING OUT INTO THE AIR FOR A DAY OR TWO UNTIL YOU CAN GET IT FIXED .
SURE .
AND SO SO YOU KNOW IT S SOMETHING WE WE HAVE TRIED TO HELP .
OH THERE S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT .
YEAH .
I DO NT KNOW IF YOU EVER HAPPENED TO SEE SOME OF THE LIKE TWENTY TWENTY AND WHAT NOT ABOUT RUMANIA AND EAST GERMANY WHEN THEY FIRST GOT PICTURES OUT OF THERE .
UHHUH .
ABOUT HOW SOME OF THEIR SYSTEMS HAD BEEN RUNNING FOR TWENTY AND THIRTY YEARS .
UHHUH .
AND UH YOU KNOW THEY HAD ABSOLUTELY NO REGULATIONS NO CONTROLS WHATSOEVER AND THEY HAD DESTROYED ENTIRE FORESTS AND WHAT NOT JUST BECAUSE THE AIR WAS SO POLLUTED THAT S THAT S THE KIND OF THINGS THAT UH YOU DO NT SEE IN THIS COUNTRY AND THAT S THAT S WHY I THINK THAT YOU KNOW IT S I DO NT KNOW IF YOU CAN EVER DO ENOUGH BUT UH I THINK IT S ALL RELATIVE TO THE TO THE TIME AND PLACE AND I THINK RIGHT NOW IT S IT S PRETTY MUCH UNDER CONTROL .
YEAH OKAY WELL .
ALL RIGHTY .
UHHUH IT S BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU .
WELL YOU BET .
OKAY BYEBYE .
BYE .
I GUESS I DON DO NT REALLY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH CAPITAL PUNISHMENT .
I M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT .
THE EXACT UH SPECIFICATIONS ARE FOR TEXAS .
I KNOW THAT THEY UH HAVE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT FOR CERTAIN CRIMES AND THAT S PROBABLY THE WAY .
I FEEL ABOUT IT IS IS UH IT .
KIND OF DEPENDS ON THE CRIME .
THAT S COMMITTED .
MY BELIEF .
ALL MY LIFE I GUESS HAS BEEN THAT THAT IF YOU TAKE SOMEONE ELSE S LIFE THEN YOU AUTOMATICALLY ARE GIVING UP UH YOURS IN PLACE OF IT .
BUT I DO NT SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF CONTROVERSY ABOUT THAT .
YEAH .
UH UH I TEND TO AGREE WITH YOU UH YOU KNOW PROBABLY PRETTY SIMILAR VIEWS ON IT BUT THAT S THAT S ONE OF THE THINGS I DO NT DO NT UNDERSTAND IS IS SO MUCH OF THE CONTROVERSY BECAUSE UH YOU KNOW I I DO ALSO MYSELF BELIEVE IN CAPITAL PUNISHMENT UH UH YOU KNOW IT IT REALLY IRKS ME TO SEE SO MUCH EFFORT PUT INTO PREVENTING SOMEONE BEING PUT TO DEATH BY THE STATE WHEN THEY SO CALLOUSLY AND USUALLY SO YOU KNOW WITHOUT EVEN THINKING OR WITHOUT ANY CONCERN UH YOU KNOW END SOMEBODY ELSE S LIFE AND IN A LOT OF CASES SEVERAL PEOPLE S LIVES .
THAT S TRUE .
I GUESS WELL THERE S THERE S PROBABLY TWO OR THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF OF VIEWS AS FAR AS THE CONTROVERSY GOES .
I CAN SEE WHERE IF A LIFE WAS TAKEN BY ACCIDENT OR UH I DO NT KNOW WHAT .
YOU D CALL IT NOT PREMEDITATED OR I GUESS PRIMARILY BY ACCIDENT UH THERE MAY BE CASES WHERE THE DEATH PENALTY IS NOT CALLED FOR BUT I LEAN TOWARDS .
OH YEAH .
IF IT S PREMEDITATED OR IF IT S UH KIND OF A HABITUAL OR OR A HABIT THAT UH A TENDENCY THAT PEOPLE UH MAY GET INTO THEN I GUESS I DO NT REALLY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT .
YEAH THAT S THAT S KIND OF THE WAY .
I FEEL .
IF IF YOU VE GOT A GUY .
WHO S WHO S BEEN TO TRIAL AND HAS BEEN IN AND OUT OF JAIL YOU KNOW BASICALLY A A THREE TIME LOSER FOR THE TWELFTH TIME YOU KNOW AND HE GOES OUT AND KILLS SOMEBODY HE S NOT GOING TO BE REFORMED HE S NOT GOING TO GET ANY BETTER YOU KNOW IT S IT S NOT GOING TO IT S JUST NOT GOING TO GET ANY BETTER .
AND AND THE ONLY THING YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE THE OPINION THAT YOU KNOW DO NT DO NT HAVE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT BUT GIVE THEM .
LIFE IN JAIL AND YOU KNOW I COULD GO ALONG WITH THAT IF IF I COULD BE ASSURED THAT IT WOULD BE THEIR NATURAL LIFE IN JAIL AND NOT PAROLE AFTER TEN .
YEAH .
OR TWELVE YEARS .
YEAH I THINK THAT S WHAT AGGRAVATES A LOT OF PEOPLE IS SOMEBODY DOES GET A LIFE SENTENCE IN PLACE OF THE DEATH PENALTY AND THEY WIND UP BACK ON THE STREETS AFTER FIVE YEARS OR SIX YEARS OR LIKE THE KID ON THE NEWS TONIGHT OUT IN MESQUITE .
WHO WAS OUT IN SIX MONTHS .
UHHUH .
YEAH IT S IT S JUST OUR CRIMINAL SYSTEM IS JUST SO I GUESS OVERLOADED BUT THE YOU KNOW THE THE PROBLEM IS NOT SO MUCH WITH THE PRISON SYSTEM YOU KNOW I MEAN BECAUSE THE THE COPS ARE OUT THERE DOING THEIR JOB ENFORCING THE LAWS AND THE PRISON SYSTEM ARE JUST YOU KNOW THEY RE TRYING TO COPE WITH THEM BUT YOU KNOW THE THING ABOUT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT I I YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE DO NT THINK IT WOULD BE A DETERRENT UH TO TO FUTURE CRIME AND THE WAY .
IT IS NOW IT S NOT .
NO .
BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU IF LIKE THE STATE OF TEXAS FOR EXAMPLE MAY UH YOU KNOW MAY EXECUTE SOMEBODY TWICE A YEAR .
YOU KNOW THAT S THAT S NO KIND OF DETERRENT BECAUSE WE WE VE GOT LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ON DEATH ROW AND AND MANY OF THEM .
WHO HAVE BEEN THERE FOR LITERALLY FOR TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS .
RIGHT .
ON DEATH ROW AND THAT S THAT S CERTAINLY NO KIND OF DETERRENT AND I WOULD TEND TO AGREE WITH ANYBODY .
WHO SAYS RIGHT NOW THAT IT IT S NOT A TERRENT A DETERRENT BECAUSE IT S NOT .
NO IT S NOT .
YOU THINK OF YOUR CHANCES OF GETTING THE DEATH PENALTY AFTER CRE UH COMMITTING A CRIME ARE REALLY PRETTY SLIM RIGHT NOW .
AND YOU CAN .
OH YEAH .
PROBABLY SPEND UH A LOT OF TIME UH OR MAYBE EVENTUALLY UH JUST WAITING IT OUT .
UHHUH .
AND THAT S WHERE A LOT OF AGGRAVATION COMES I THINK IS IS UH THESE GUYS SPEND SO MUCH TIME IN THE APPEAL PROCESS OR JUST IN THE WAITING PROCESS .
UHHUH .
THEY MAY SPEND YEARS AND YOU KNOW THE LAST I HEARD IT WAS COSTING TEN TWENTY THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS .
A YEAR UH .
MUMBLEX .
TO KEEP THESE GUYS WAITING .
YEAH IT IT S AMAZING .
THERE S UH THERE S A GIRL .
I WORK WITH OUR SECRETARY AS A MATTER OF FACT HER HER FATHER WAS MURDERED HER FATHER AND THREE OTHER GUYS UP HERE IN SHERMAN .
AND THE UH THE GUY THAT THEY TRIED AND CONVICTED AND SENTENCED HIM TO DEATH YOU KNOW HE S BEEN ON DEATH ROW FOR LIKE EIGHT YEARS .
YEAH .
AND YOU KNOW THIS THIS WAS HER .
FATHER UH YOU KNOW THAT THAT GOT KILLED YOU KNOW JUST COLDBLOODED MURDER HIM AND THREE OTHER PEOPLE AND BUT STILL FOR SOME REASON YOU KNOW THIS THIS GUY S SENTENCE HAS NOT BEEN CARRIED OUT YOU KNOW HE S SITTING ON DEATH ROW FOR EIGHT YEARS AFTER HAVING KILLED FOUR PEOPLE AND THE STATE STILL CA NT BRING ITSELF TO TO EX EXECUTE .
TO YEAH TO CARRY IT OUT .
THIS GUY .
IT .
SORT OF TAKES THE JUSTICE OUT OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM .
IT DOES IT REALLY DOES YOU KNOW .
SHE AND THEY HAVE TO GO BACK UH OCCASIONALLY YOU KNOW SHE HAS TO WRITE LETTERS TO THE PAROLE BOARD AND YOU KNOW LAWYERS AND JUST JUST EVER SO OFTEN SHE MENTIONS WELL SHE S GOT TO DO SOMETHING ELSE YOU KNOW WRITE ANOTHER LETTER .

YEAH IT IS .
AND SHE WINDS UP BEING A A VICTIM .
YEAH .
DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY .
YEAH RIGHT .
A VICTIM NOT ONLY OF INDIRECTLY OF THE CRIME BUT ALSO INDIRECTLY BY THAT .
RIGHT .
INDIRECT INVOLVEMENT .
IT S JUST IT S .
SHE .
IT S RIDICULOUS .
SHE S AN EMOTIONAL VICTIM .
YEAH .
YEAH IT IT S TERRIBLE YOU KNOW AND .
AND YOU KNOW THE LIKE YOU SAY THE COPS .
THAT ARE OUT DOING THE WORK .
YEAH .
DAY BY DAY HAVE GOT TO HAVE A LOT OF FRUSTRATION WHEN THEY SEE ALL THEIR WORK .
OH THAT .
BASICALLY GO OUT THE WINDOW .
OH MAN I I COULD NT BE A COP FOR THAT FOR THAT VERY REASON YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY DO .
THE THE CRIMINAL GETS RIGHT BACK OUT AND YOU KNOW THE COP S JUST GOT TO GO BACK AND AND DO HIS THING .
ALL OVER AGAIN BECAUSE SO MANY OF THE CRIMES ARE ARE DONE BY REPEAT OFFENDERS .
YES THEY ARE .
IT S .
WELL THAT S ABOUT FIVE MINUTES SO .
YEAH .
UNLESS YOU VE GOT SOMETHING ELSE WELL .

PUT HIMSELF THROUGH SCHOOL AND HE DID AND HE WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL .
WELL MY PARENTS WANTED TO SEND ME TO COLLEGE AND I WAS DEAD SET AGAINST IT .
YOU KNOW I HAD WANDERLUST YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
AND I GOT IN AND AFTER AFTER WASTING THE FIRST SIX YEARS PARTYING AND EVERYTHING ELSE I DECIDED UHHUH TIME TO SETTLE DOWN AND DO SOMETHING SO I STARTED TO WORK ON MY EDUCATION .

UHHUH .
AND STILL I ENDED UP GOING TWO SEMESTERS WHEN I GOT OUT JUST TO GET MY DEGREE .
THAT S PRETTY GOOD .
BUT I VE BEEN IN SCHOOL EVER SINCE .
THAT S GOOD .
YEAH I GUESS .
YEAH THAT S UH I DO NT KNOW THERE S OTHER KINDS OF SERVICE TO THE COUNTRY THAT COULD BE DONE YOU KNOW .
YEAH I MEAN IF YOU DO NT LIKE .
I MEAN WORKING IN THE NATIONAL PARKS .
SURE .
UH WORKING CLEAN UP THE ROADSIDES .
EXACTLY .
I MEAN I VE ALWAYS FELT THAT PEOPLE ON WELFARE SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO SPEND AT LEAST PART OF THEIR TIME .
OH YEAH ABSOL .
NOT ALL THE TIME BECAUSE THAT TAKES AWAY FROM THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK FOR A JOB BUT AT LEAST SOME OF THEIR TIME TO LOOK FOR TO GO OUT AND CLEAN UP THE ROADS .
ABSOLUTELY .
YOU KNOW I MEAN .
ALL THESE ALL THIS MONEY THAT WE RE THROWING AWAY TO PAY PEOPLE TO GO OUT AND DO THINGS WHEN WE RE PAYING ALL THESE WELFARE RECIPIENTS AND IF THEY RE ABLEBODIED PEOPLE I DO NT SEE ANY PROBLEM AT ALL WITH HAVING THEM GO OUT THERE AND AND IF NOTHING ELSE GET A GROUP OF THEM TOGETHER AND TAKE THEM AROUND TO OLD FOLKS .
YEAH .
PLACES AND LET THEM CUT THE YARDS PAINT THE HOUSES .
YEAH WE D LEARN SERVICE TO OTHER PEOPLE .
SURE SURE .
IN THIS COUNTRY .
SO I M GET SOMETHING OUT OF THAT MONEY .
COUNTRY WOULD BENEFIT .
YEAH I VE .
I MEAN UH .

YEAH .
THEY GET ALL THIS STUFF TOGETHER AND SIT DOWN AND HAVE POKER GAMES .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW AND I M I JUS I HAVE A HARD TIME DEALING WITH THAT .
WHAT I HEAR ONE TIME I THINK IT WAS ON PAUL HARVEY S UH RADIO SEGMENT THAT HE SAID THAT IF THE MONEY THAT GOES INTO WELFARE EACH YEAR WAS TO BE GIVEN DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE WITHOUT ALL THE MIDDLE PEOPLE IN THE GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY EACH PERSON WOULD RECEIVE LIKE FORTYFIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS .
UHHUH .
I MEAN I WAS ASTOUNDED I DO NT EVEN MAKE THAT .
NO I KNOW I YOU YOU THINK ABOUT YOU THINK ABOUT THE LAYER OF BUREAUCRACY BETWEEN THE MONEY AND THE RECIPIENT .
YEAH AND SOMEBODY S TAKING THAT AWAY .
AND AND THERE S PROBABLY THERE S EASILY PROBABLY SIX OR SEVEN TIMES THAT AMOUNT BEING SPENT ON THE BUREAUCRACY .
YEAH NO DOUBT .
YOU KNOW IT S IT S IT S TOTALLY RIDICULOUS AND NOW I I I UH STARTED OUT WHEN I FIRST GOT IN GRADUATE SCHOOL I WAS GOING INTO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND UH QUITE HONESTLY I JUST GOT SO FED UP WITH IT I JUST COULD NT STAND IT ANY MORE .
IS THAT RIGHT .
YEAH I MEAN THIS IS THE KIND OF THING YOU LOOK AT .
YEAH .
YOU SIT THERE AND WHEN YOU RE WRITING UP BUDGETS YOU WONDER OKAY HOW MUCH MONEY DO WE NEED WELL YOU NEED X NUMBER DOLLARS FOR THE RECIPIENTS BUT YOU NEED X NUMBER DOLLARS TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM WELL JUST RIDICULOUS .
YEAH .
THIS IS RIDICULOUS .
IT S SAD .
IT IS IT S PATHETIC I MEAN THERE S GOT TO BE A DIFFERENT WAY THERE S GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY BUT IT LL NEVER HAPPEN I MEAN THESE .
YEAH .
THESE PEOPLE OUT HERE GETTING THAT MONEY ARE BIG VOTING BLOCKS .
YEAH WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE MUMBLEX REQUIRED YOUNG PEOPLE TO DO SERVICE TO THE COUNTRY WHAT SHOULD THEY GET IN RETURN I WONDER LIKE UH .
I THINK I THINK THERE OUGHT TO BE SOME KIND OF ASSISTANCE AS FAR AS UH AND I WOULD LIMIT IT STRICTLY TO SOMETHING LIKE TUITION ASSISTANCE .
YEAH .
GIVE AN INCENTIVE .
EDUCATIONAL OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING OR SOMETHING .
YEAH SOMETHING THAT S GOING TO HELP THEM ALONG THE WAY .
AND THEY LL HELP THE COUNTRY EVENTUALLY TOO .
SURE I MEAN .
BECAUSE RATHER THAN HAVING A BUNCH OF UNEDUCATED PEOPLE WE CAN HAVE EDUCATED PEOPLE .
WELL THIS I MEAN .
AND THAT S ONLY GOING TO HELP .
I MEAN LOOK AT THE STATISTICS I MEAN IT S SAD ONE IN FIVE AMERICANS CA NT READ .
YEAH .
ADULTS THAT IS CA NT EVEN READ AND AND WE VE GOT THE LOWEST RATES OF THE CIVILIZED COUNTRIES IN SCIENCE AND MATH .
YEAH .
I MEAN WHAT ARE WE WHAT ARE WE BECOMING WE RE BECOMING A SERVICE COUNTRY .
AS OPPOSED TO WHAT WE WERE TWENTY YEARS AGO .
YEAH WE WERE AN INDUSTRIAL GIANT AND NOW WE RE NO WE RE NOT GOING TO DO IT BECAUSE EVERYBODY IS BEATING US AT THE GAME WE TAUGHT THEM HOW TO DO IT AND THEY THEY DID IT BETTER THAN WE DO .
YEAH .
SIMPLE AS THAT .
BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE AMBITION I GUESS .
YEAH SIMPLE AS THAT .
YEAH WHICH IS GOOD FOR THEM BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WE KIND OF LOSE OUT .
YEAH IT S TERRIBLE FOR US .
I THINK THAT IF UH YOUNG PEOPLE HAD SERVICE TO THE COUNTRY MIGHT GIVE THEM MORE AMBITION .
YEAH .
BECAUSE THEY LEARN THAT SERVING OTHER PEOPLE IS A GOOD THING .
YEAH AND AND IT CAN BE GOOD FOR THEM TOO .
YEAH OH YEAH .
I MEAN EVEN EVEN THE GREEDY KIDS THAT WE VE GOT NOW .
OH GOD YOU GO TO THE MALL AND YOU SEE YOU KNOW FOURTEEN YEAR OLD KIDS FLAUNTING MONEY BECAUSE THE PARENTS GIVE THEM MONEY TO GO DOWN AND PLAY VIDEO GAMES ALL NIGHT YOU KNOW .
I KNOW .
FOR WHAT .

WELL YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WHY THEY DO IT IS SO THEY CAN GET THEM OUT OF THE HOUSE .
YEAH .
YEAH UH THAT S MY OTHER COMPLAINT PARENTS ARE NT PARENTS ANY MORE .
NO THEY VE THEY VE RELINQUISHED THEIR PARENTING .
YEAH ONE OF THE OTHER SUBJECTS IS DO YOU THINK THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEMS ARE IN TROUBLE .
YEAH .
WELL AS A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER FOR A YEAR I I CAN SAY YES .

YEAH .
YOU KNOW I DO NT WANT TO LIVE IN A LITTLE ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT THE REST OF MY LIFE .
EXACTLY .
I MEAN THAT THAT S A SAD THING TO THINK AND THAT S KIND OF SELFISH ON MY PART AND I ADMIT THAT .
WELL IN A WAY IT IS BUT YOU HAVE TO LOOK OUT FOR YOURSELF .
YEAH THAT S RIGHT .
YOU KNOW I MEAN THAT S SOME AND WHEN WE PAY GARBAGE MEN MORE THAN WE PAY TEACHERS .
THAT S WRONG .
YEAH GOSH I MEAN .
I M NOT SAYING THAT GARBAGE MEN SHOULD BE PAID LESS I SAYING TEACHERS SHOULD BE PAID MORE .
NO I MEAN YEAH THEY DO AN ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY JOB I MEAN I I HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF ADMIRATION FOR THESE PEOPLE WHO CAN GO OUT THERE AND DO THAT .
YEAH .
BUT UH I MEAN THERE S THERE S A SENSE OF PRIORITIES HERE TOO .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW WE NEED WHAT S MORE IMPORTANT PICKING UP THE GARBAGE OR EDUCATING OUR KIDS .

YEAH THEY THEY SURE .
BUT YOU KNOW WHEN IT GETS RIGHT DOWN TO IT .
I MEAN ONE S IMPORT I MEAN ON THE OTHER HAND I MEAN YOU TAKE A GARBAGE MAN IN NEW YORK CITY STARTS OUT AT TWENTYSIX THOUSAND DOLLARS .

I MEAN MY OTHER PET PEEVE IS UNIONS .
YEAH OH YEAH .
YOU KNOW IT S JUST IT S IT S RIDICULOUS THE WAY UNIONS HAVE GONE THERE WAS A TIME WHEN UNIONS WERE NEEDED .
AND THEY SERVED A GOOD FUNCTION .
AND THEY SERVED A GOOD FUNCTION BUT THERE ARE ENOUGH LAWS ON THE BOOKS NOW THAT UNIONS ARE OUTDATED AND THEY RE ONLY THERE TO PERPETUATE THEIR OWN THEIR OWN POWER STRUCTURE .
I REMEMBER THE COMPANY MY DAD WORKED FOR THE PEOPLE THERE WENT ON STRIKE AGAINST THE MANAGEMENT IT WAS A STEEL MANUFACTURING PLACE AND THEY UH THIS WAS DURING A TIME WHEN THE IMPORT STEEL WAS SO CHEAP AND THEY WERE HAVING A HARD TIME AND THEY TOLD THE STRIKERS THERE LOOK WE NEED YOU TO COME BACK AND GET THIS STUFF DONE OR ELSE WE RE GOING TO BE OUT OF BUSINESS AND THEY WOULD NT COME BACK SO THEY WENT BANKRUPT .

BYE .
BYE .
WELL I REALLY ENJOY READING THE NEWSPAPER WE GET THE DAILY UH DALLAS MORNING NEWS AND I TRY TO LOOK AT IT IF I GET BUSY I DO NT GET A CHANCE TO PICK IT UP LIKE THIS WEEK I NOTICED SEVERAL COPIES HAVE BEEN UN HAVE NT BEEN TOUCHED BUT .
WELL DO YOU HAVE TIME TO READ THE PAPER IN THE MORNING .
WELL NOT IN THE MORNING BUT UH IF THE WELL I HAVE TWO CHILDREN AND IF THEY UH GO OUT TO PLAY OR SOMETHING I LIKE TO KEEP MY EYE ON THEM SO I LL YOU KNOW MAYBE GO OUTSIDE AND READ THE PAPER WHILE THEY RE PLAYING OR SIT IN A CHAIR BY THE WINDOW OR SOMETHING .
YOU KNOW A LOT A LOT OF PEOPLE DO NT TAKE NEWSPAPERS AT ALL WE WE TOOK THE MORNING NEWS FOR A WHILE .
UHHUH .
AND THEN UH WELL WE VE BEEN TAKING THE TIMES HERALD FOR AGES AND THEN UH DOG JUST RAN OFF WITH MY SHOE THAT S OFF THE SUBJECT .
WENT OUTSIDE PICKED IT UP AND RAN OFF ANYWAY UH AND THEN WE SWITCHED THE MORNING NEWS BUT WE FOUND WE COULD NT READ ENOUGH OF IT AND BY THE TIME I GOT HOME AND HAD TIME TO TO READ SOME BUT BUT I GUESS THE THE ISSUE IS UH BESIDE THE NEWSPAPER DO YOU TAKE ANY NEWS MAGAZINES .
WELL WE I DO NT TAKE LIKE TIME OR NEWSWEEK OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT I DO LIKE TO WATCH UH C N N I HAVE SEVERAL CHORES AND THINGS TO DO SO IT COMES ON AT LIKE THE NINE OCLOCK P M AND SO I WILL TURN THAT ON WHILE I M DOING SOME WORK AND I CAN HEAR THE NEWS NOT HAVE TO SIT RIGHT DOWN AND LISTEN TO IT .
DID DID YOU DID YOU HEAR WHAT SCHWARTZKOPF HAD TO SAY ABOUT UH PETE ARNETT AND UH THE THE NEWS COVERAGE .
WELL HE DID NT HAVE TOO GOOD OF OPINION OF IT NO I MEAN YES I DID HEAR THAT AND SO UH I DO TRY TO KEEP THAT IN MIND THAT WHENEVER YOU RE READING A PAPER IT USUALLY HAS A PARTICULAR FLAVOR .
WELL ANY YOU KNOW TIME MAGAZINE AND EVEN THE NEWS THAT SOMETIMES THAT THAT S WHY I LIKE SOME DIVERSITY THE IDEA THAT I WE HAVE TIME WHICH WHICH WE TAKE FROM TIME TO TIME AND WE THE PROBLEM IS THEY CALL UP AND MAKE THIS DEAL YOU KNOW AND .
UHHUH .
WELL WE RE TAKING THAT AND AND WE ALSO HIT THE GARLAND GARLAND DAILY NEWS I GUESS IT S IT COMES OUT SPORADICALLY LIKE .
UHHUH .
TWICE A WEEK OR SOME BUT I THINK WHAT S INTERESTING IS THAT IF YOU RE THAT THERE UH THAT AS DIFFICULT AS IT IS OR AS AS MUCH AS THEY TRY THEY PUT SOME BIAS I HAD THE CHANCE TO HEAR TRACY ROWLETT SPEAK TO A GROUP AND IT WAS INTERESTING THAT THEY THINK THAT THEY RE BASICALLY IMPARTIAL .
UM .
AND THAT BUT AND AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE ACCUSE THEM OF CONTROLLING THE NEWS HE SAYS YOU KNOW WE DO NT CONTROL THE NEWS WE JUST REPORT IT THE WAY WE THE WAY IT IS .
UHHUH .
AND .
WELL I WOULD NT THINK TH I WOULD REALLY SAY THAT THAT S NOT TRUE BECAUSE UH IT SEEMS LIKE CERTAIN NEWSPAPERS ALWAYS ESPOUSE CERTAIN CANDIDATES .
YES .
AND SO UH NEWS STATIONS ALWAYS TELL THE STORY FROM A CERTAIN ANGLE AND THAT S WHY IT S A GOOD IDEA TO GET A WIDE VARIETY OF COVERAGE SO THAT YOU GET A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPINIONS YOU MAY NEVER GET THE TRUTH BUT YOU LL HAVE A VARIETY TO CHOOSE FROM .
YEAH AND I I THOUGHT THAT WAS PARTICULARLY INTERESTING IN THE THE GULF WAR THAT THERE WERE PIECES OF INFORMATION THAT THAT WERE APPARENTLY UH LEAKED JUST AS A AS AS UH A PLOY .
UHHUH .
WHICH WAS UH I I FIND THAT FASCINATING THAT UH .
YEAH I DO TOO DO YOU EVER LISTEN TO THE RADIO OR ANY .
I LISTEN TO K R L D AND UH UH K L I F THE NEWS TALK RADIO .
UHHUH .
AND I ACTUALLY LISTEN TO C N N RADIO DO YOU KNOW IT WAS ON RADIO NOW .
NO I DO NT .
IT S ON ELEVEN NINETY .
UM I REALLY UH HAVE GOTTEN OUT OF THE HABIT OF LISTENING TO THE RADIO FROM ANY KIND OF EVEN MUSIC AND UH .
WELL WHEN I GO TO WORK I LISTEN .
YEAH MY HUSBAND DOES AND IT S HOW COME HE USUALLY CALLS ME SOMETIMES .
AND SAYS OH I JUST HEARD ON THE NEWS THAT SUCH AND SUCH HAPPENED YOU KNOW IF IT S SOMETHING REALLY INTERESTING AND .
YEAH .
AND THEN I LL KNOW TO TO KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR IT BUT I VE GOT OUT OF THE HABIT OF LISTENING TO THE RADIO .
WELL WITH WITH YOUR YOU KNOW IF YOU RE AROUND THE HOME THOUGH AND AND AND CAN WATCH T V AND READ THE PAPER THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES OF NEWS RADIO OR THIRTY MINUTES IS AND THEN THEY START REPEATING EVERYTHING .
UHHUH .
AND AND SO IT S KIND OF A OH THAT S WHAT S INTERESTING IS THE C N N UH I DO NT THINK I M TRYING TO THINK IF IT S MUCH LOCAL I LISTEN TO A LITTLE OF THAT AND I LISTEN TO A LITTLE OF NINETY POINT ONE I I M I M INVETERATE SWITCHER .
UHHUH .
THAT AND NINETYEIGHT POINT SEVEN I M ECLECTIC APPROACH .
DO YOU HAVE A PARTICULAR LOCAL CHANNEL THAT YOU WATCH .
WELL I WATCH CHANNEL FIVE BUT THAT HAS TO BE THAT S ANOTHER BIAS .
UHHUH .
THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE WEATHER REPORTING I M NOT SURE THAT ACTUALLY I THINK CHANNEL EIGHT IS PROBABLY BUT I KNOW DAVE FOX HE GOES TO OUR CHURCH SO .
UM WELL I AM WE RE FAIRLY NEW TO THE AREA AND SO WE RE STILL SHOPPING .
WELL THE .
FOR A FAVORITE CHANNEL .
CHANNEL EIGHT WHEN THEY CAME HERE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN YEARS AGO DAVE FOX AND TRACY ROWLETT CAME TOGETHER .
UHHUH .
UH FROM OKLAHOMA CITY AND APPARENTLY CHANNEL EIGHT WAS WAY DOWN AND NOW THEY HAVE TURNED IT ALL AROUND AND DONE A PRETTY REMARKABLE JOB AND THEN THEY VE BEEN SOME PEOPLE MOVE AROUND AND UH JOHN CHRISWELL IS ANYWAY THE I I DO NT KNOW DO YOU DO YOU DO YOU SEEM TO CAN YOU TELL MUCH DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LOCAL RADIO T V STATIONS .
WELL I REALLY THINK SO I NOTICED ON CHANNEL EIGHT THAT THERE S ALL OF THE UH ANCHORS ARE SEEM TO BE LIKE WHITE ANGLO SAXON PROTESTANT TYPE PEOPLE AND THEY ALL SEEM TO BE YOU KNOW FAIRLY SIMILAR AND I KIND OF PREFER A YOU KNOW SOME FEMALES I DO NT RECALL THAT THEY HAVE ANY FEMALE ANCHORS AND I LIKE DIFFERENT I LIKE THE ANCHORS TO BE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PEOPLE .
I THINK THAT ADDS TO THE DIVERSITY I THINK THAT UH I LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
UH THERE I KNOW YOU KNOW JOHN WYLIE PRICE I DO NT KNOW IF YOU KEPT UP BUT HE S BEEN PROTESTING .
YES I HAVE AND UH I PREFER YOU KNOW TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF VARIETY LIKE THAT BECAUSE I THINK YOU RE YOU RE MORE LIKELY TO GET .
YEAH AND I THINK HE HAS LEGITIMATE ARGUMENT I MEAN YOU CAN UH I I I GREW UP IN ALABAMA AND SO I I HAVE SOME PREJUDICES .
UHHUH .
BUT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT THAT FROM A A JUSTICE STANDPOINT BECAUSE WE HAVE THE OPTION OF NOT WATCHING THAT STATION .
UHHUH .
UH I M NOT SURE I I M TOTALLY IN FAVOR OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN SOME OF THE PROGRAMS BUT I THINK THAT UH IN SOME CASES THIS SHOULD BE SOME REAL OPPORTUNITY AND AND SOME DIVERSITY AND .
YEAH .
AND THIS KIND OF THING AND I THINK THAT DALLAS IT TURNS OUT THOUGH FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND HAS QUITE GOOD I OCCASIONALLY GO TO SAINT LOUIS .
UHHUH .
AND UH THERE FOR A FEW DAYS AND WATCH THE NEWS AND AND THINK DALLAS REALLY DOES HAVE HAVE QUITE GOOD NEWS I THINK CHANNEL EIGHT IS THE NUMBER ONE UH A B C AFFILIATE IN THE U S I THINK TRACY ROWLETT WAS SAYING THAT HE .
OH REALLY .
COURSE HE PUMPING HIS OWN .
WELL WE YOU KNOW LIKE ALL OF THE STATIONS SEEM TO BE PRETTY GOOD IT S JUST WE HAVE NT FOUND ONE THAT WE VE SNUGGLED INTO .
WHERE D YOU MOVE FROM .
HOUSTON SO WE HAD A A FAVORITE OR I DID HAVE A FAVORITE CHANNEL THAT I USUALLY TUNED INTO FOR LOCAL NEWS I GUESS BECAUSE YOU GET USE TO YOU LIKE THE ANCHORS .
YEAH .
AND YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THEM AND .
IT IS INTERESTING THOUGH IT BECOMES A LITTLE OF PERSONALITY IN FACT THE THE GUY THAT WAS ON THE WEATHERMAN ON CHANNEL EIGHT WORKED FOR ME OH LONG TIME AGO .
UHHUH .
TWENTY YEARS OR SO EVEN LONGER THAN THAT TWENTYONE TWENTYTHREE YEARS AGO OR SO TWENTYFOUR ANYWAY LONG TIME AGO AND AND SHORTLY AFTER I GOT WE GOT HERE FOURTEEN YEARS AGO AND UH THEY HAD THEY HAD FIRED HIM UH BECAUSE HE WAS TOO T ANYWAY DID NT HE DID NT HAVE THE PERSONALITY .
UHHUH .
AND WAS NT DRAWING THE CROWDS AND THAT S INTERESTING THAT S THAT S WHAT THE T V STATIONS DO THEY RE TRYING TO GET RATINGS .
THAT S TRUE .
AND I THINK .
THEIR JOB .
IF WE REMEMBER THAT THAT THEY RE OUT AFTER THE RATINGS .
THAT S TRUE SO THAT REALLY EFFECTS HOW THEY REPORT THE NEWS .
WELL IT S LIKE THE THE DALE HANSEN ON CHANNEL EIGHT IS A SOMETIMES A LITTLE TOO CUTESY BUT .
IS HE THE SPORTS .
I WONDER IF WE RE COMING UP ON TEN MINUTES HAVE YOU TALKED HAVE YOU BEEN ON THE CONVERSATION WHEN THEY BEEPED YOU AT TEN MINUTES .
YEAH I GUESS IT IS TIME TO CLOSE NOW SO I CAN RUN GO HELP PUT THE KIDS TO BED .
OKAY WELL GOOD TALKING TO YOU .
YEAH .
GOODNIGHT .
BYEBYE .
OKAY UH FAR AS YOU KNOW CRIME IN THE CITIES I M SURE LIKE IN YOURS IT S PRETTY PRETTY BAD UH PROBABLY THE BIGGEST THING WE VE GOT GOING NOW IS THE ROBBERIES AND THEFT AND PROBABLY MURDER .
UHHUH .
ARE THE TWO TOP ONES THAT WE HAVE HOW ABOUT YOU .
UH WELL I DO NT ACTUALLY LIVE IN THE CITY BUT I D PROBABLY SAY THAT S ROUGHLY RIGHT I MEAN CRIMES AGAINST PROPERTY SEEM TO OUTNUMBER CRIMES AGAINST LIFE BUT I I THINK WITH THE CURRENT WAR ON DRUGS AND ALL THIS KIND OF STUFF I D SAY PROBABLY THE POLICE DEPARTMENT WOULD CLAIM THE NUMBER ONE CRIMES CRIMES ARE PROBABLY SOLICITATION OF PROSTITUTION UH AND SALE OF DRUGS .
UHHUH PROB PROBABLY RIGHT IF YOU LOOK AT IT FROM THAT STAND POINT .
UHHUH .
WHAT UH IS THERE ANYTHING UH THAT YOU PARTICULARLY ARE CONCERNED WITH IN YOUR PARTICULAR AREA AS FAR AS SECURITY AND THAT SORT OF THING .
UH WHERE I LIVE NOW IT S IT S NOT SO BAD I MEAN I CAN BASICALLY LEAVE MY FRONT DOOR UNLOCKED AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT UH BUT I DO HAVE FRIENDS THAT LIVE IN THE CITY AND I THINK THAT THEY GET A LOT OF FALLOUT FROM THIS WAR ON DRUG THING UH JUST BECAUSE THERE ARE LIKE CRACK HOUSES YOU KNOW ON THEIR STREET AND STUFF LIKE THIS .
UHHUH DO YOU LIVE IN A REAL SMALL TOWN OR OR OUT IN THE COUNTRY .
I LIVE OUT IN THE COUNTRY YEAH .
HOW FAR OUT FROM THE CITY I MEAN DO YOU .
I M ABOUT FIFTEEN MILES OUT .
ABOUT FIFTEEN MILES I LIVE IN A LITTLE SUBURB UH WHICH IS I GUESS FROM DALLAS IS TWELVE MILES OR SO .
UHHUH .
BUT IT S PRETTY CONGESTED WE ARE CONSIDERED IN THE COUNTRY .
UM .
BUT IT DOES NT REALLY FEEL LIKE YOU RE IN THE COUNTRY .
UM .
OUR MAJOR CRIMES IN OUR IMMEDIATE TOWN UH IS PROBABLY ROBBERIES HOUSE ROBBERIES .
UHHUH .
AND VERY FEW INSTANCES OF YOU KNOW ALCOHOL DRUGS UH REPORTED HOWEVER I M SURE THEY RE THERE .
UHHUH .
BUT UH RIGHT NOW OUR NEIGHBORHOOD IS RUNNING ABOUT UH EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE HOMEOWNERS HAVE BEEN ROBBED .
WOW .
SOMETIME DURING THEIR THEIR UH EXISTENCE IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD .
THAT S HUGE .
AND SINCE THAT TIME EVERYBODY S GOT SOME SORT OF BURGLAR SYSTEM OR YOU KNOW UH BURGLAR ALARMS .
UHHUH .
UH AND INCLUDING THE OUT UH THE OUTER PERIMETER TYPE UH DEVICES .
UHHUH .
SENSORS AND THINGS LIKE THAT IT S CUT BACK YOU KNOW CONSIDERABLY BUT IT IT JUST SHIFTS IT FROM OUR NEIGHBORHOOD TO ANOTHER NEIGHBORHOOD TO OTHER NEIGHBORHOOD SO IT STILL UH REMAINS CITY WIDE PRETTY PRETTY HIGH .
ARE THERE ARE THERE ANY THEORIES ON WHY THIS IS HAPPENING .
UH I WOULD SAY THE MAJORITY OF IT S HAPPENING DURING THE DAY UH BETWEEN PROBABLY TEN IN THE MORNING AND THREE IN THE AFTERNOON .
UHHUH .
MOST .
BUT WHY WHY IS IT HAPPENING .
WELL MOST FAMILIES MOST FAMILIES ARE YOUNG AND BOTH PEOPLE ARE WORKING .
UHHUH .
SO THEY RE HAPPENING DURING THE HOURS THEY RE GONE FROM WORK .
UHHUH .
UH SO UH I WOULD SAY THAT S PROBABLY THEIR PRIME MOTIVATION THEY LL THEY LL STOCK YOUR HOUSE AND UH LOOK AT YOUR PATTERN AND THEN GO FROM THERE .
SO THEY RE PROFESSIONALS .
UH THEY CLASSIFY MOST OF THEM AS PROFESSIONALS .
UM .
UH YOU GET A FEW OF THEM THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT SLOPPIER UH JUST TAKING UH YOU KNOW JUST JUNK ITEMS THAT THEY THEY CAN JUST GET YOU KNOW TEN TO TWENTY BUCKS FOR REAL QUICK .
UHHUH .
PROBABLY THE BIGGEST ITEMS THAT UH THAT YOU GET IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD OR WOULD BE THE HIGH CLASSED AUTOMOBILES THE YOU KNOW MERCEDES VOLVOS THINGS THAT THEY CAN GET YOU KNOW BIG DOLLARS FOR .
UHHUH .
AND THE JEWELRY ARE THE MAJOR TARGETS GUNS THAT SORT OF STUFF .
UM .
VERY FEW YOU KNOW PENNY PENNY ANTE STUFF .
WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK CAN BE DONE TO REDUCE THAT SORT OF CRIME .
WELL UH THE POLICE FORCE FOR ONE I THINK THEY COULD UH DEFINITELY ADD TO THE POLICE FORCE AND THE TYPE EQUIPMENT THAT THEY USE UH IT S OH RIGHT NOW I THINK WE ARE ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE AND THERE S ONLY EIGHT OFFICERS THAT PATROL FOR THIRTY .
UHHUH .
FOR THAT AMOUNT OF PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
WHICH IS NOT VERY MANY .
RIGHT .
AND .
BUT I MEAN THAT S GOING TO TEND TO I MEAN IT SEEMS TO ME THAT SORT OF APPROACH WILL TEND TO SIMPLY MAKE THE COST OF COMMITTING THE CRIME SLIGHTLY HIGHER IN OTHER WORDS YOU VE INCREASED THE PROBABILITY OF SOMEBODY BEING CAUGHT A LITTLE BIT THE REAL QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU CONVINCE PEOPLE NOT TO COMMIT SUCH CRIMES IN THE FIRST PLACE .
WELL THE COURSE IN OUR PARTICULAR STATE UH WE HAVE THE PRISON OVERCROWDING WHATEVER SO THEY RE GIVING THE EARLY RELEASE UH .
RIGHT THEY RE DOING THAT IN OUR STATE TOO .
YEAH AND AND IT S I THINK WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IS STOP BUILDING MORE JAILS AND START GIVING STIFFER SENTENCES UH BUT FOR THE .
SO YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE A DETERRENT .
THAT WOULD BE CERTAINLY BE A DETERRENT .
UHHUH .
AND UH NOT NECESSARILY YOU KNOW GIVE IN TO THEIR UH HUMAN RIGHTS DESIRES YOU KNOW IF THEY RE OVERCROWDED JUST KEEP CRAMMING THEM IN THERE TILL THEY JUST SUFFOCATE UH .
WELL WHAT ABOUT AN INNOCENT PERSON WHO HAPPENS TO HAVE BEEN FOUND GUILTY .
UH I THINK THEY D HAVE TO GO TO EXTRA MEASURES TO MAKE SURE A PERSON S GUILTY YOU KNOW IN A LOT OF CASES COURSE I I KNOW YOU CA NT BE A HUNDRED PERCENT FOOLPROOF .
RIGHT .
UH .
SO YOU D YOU D RATHER SEE IT HARDER TO CONVICT SOMEBODY .
I D RATHER SEE IT A LITTLE BIT HARDER AND HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE EVIDENCE .
UHHUH .
UH TO CONVICT SOMEBODY AND THEN THOSE CONVICTED ESPECIALLY OF YOU KNOW MURDER AND AND UH YOU KNOW MAJOR CRIMES .
UHHUH .
UH TO REACH THE LIFE SENTENCES AND YOU KNOW DEATH PENALTIES AND FOLLOWTHROUGH WITH THAT .
HUH .
UH ESPECIALLY YOU KNOW IN THE CASE OF MURDER .
RIGHT .
UH I KNOW IN MY CASE I MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER WERE KIDNAPPED .
OH WOW .
DURING A HOUSE ROBBERY BACK IN EIGHTYFIVE .
OH MY GOODNESS .
AND WE CAUGHT THE INDIVIDUALS GOT CAUGHT WE UH .
UHHUH .
WE WENT THROUGH THE COURT SYSTEM AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING AND UH YOU KNOW TWO COUNTS OF KIDNAPPING UH .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THE THE FORTYFIVE TO THE HEAD YOU KNOW JUST THE THE MENTAL ANGUISH AND THE WHOLE NINE YARDS .
RIGHT .
UH YOU KNOW THE GUY ONLY GOT FIVE YEARS .
WOW .
AND YOU KNOW HE WAS OUT WITHIN TWO MONTHS BECAUSE OF THE PAROLE SYSTEM SO WHAT WHAT .
DID YOU DID YOU SUE HIM UNDER THE CIVIL SYSTEM .
DO WHAT NOW .
DID YOU SUE HIM UNDER THE CIVIL SYSTEM .
N NO I M NOT REAL FAMILIAR WITH THAT .
WELL YOU COULD PROBABLY SUE HIM FOR MENTAL ANGUISH OR SOMETHING RIGHT .
OH .
AND TRY TO GET MONEY FROM HIM AND .
WELL THE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND ALL THAT TRIED TO TRIED TO GO AFTER HIM AND THEY SAID WELL YOU KNOW HE THEY RE HE HAS NO JOB HE HAS NOTHING THERE S NOTHING THAT HE HAS THAT THAT YOU COULD GO AFTER .
YEAH MAKES YOU WISH THAT HAD UH STILL HAD INDENTURED SERVITUDE FOR THIS SORT OF THING .
YEAH UH VERY SELD .
BUT THEY GIVE THE GUY A JOB IN PRISON AND MAKE HIM PAY HIS DAMN DEBT .
YEAH THEY DO NT DO THAT HERE COURSE THEY PAY THEM BUT THEY DO NT YOU DO NT YOU OR THE INSURANCE COMPANIES NEVER SEE ANY OF THAT MONEY .
YEAH THAT S TOO BAD .
AND UH YOU KNOW AND THEY RE RIGHT NOW THEY RE RELUCTANT TO GO AFTER HIM BECAUSE THEY RE YOU KNOW THEY RE THEY RE REPEAT OFFENDERS THEY UH BEEN IN JAIL BEFORE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
THEY VE BEEN RELEASED YOU KNOW SEVERAL TIMES WHICH IS ANOTHER .
UHHUH .
UH DEAL I HATE TO SEE .
UHHUH .
BUT UH YOU KNOW BASICALLY THE GUY COMMITS YOU KNOW THREE MAJOR CRIMES AND AND UH .
YEAH I I THINK THAT S RE .
AND CAR THEFT ON TOP OF IT .
YEAH .
DESTROYS MY CAR .
YEAH .
AND WE RE OUT YOU KNOW UH YOU KNOW FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND .
THAT S AWFUL .
YOU KNOW THE GUY GETS OUT IN TWO MONTHS AND HE GOES OUT AND COMMITS IT AGAIN FACT HE S BACK IN JAIL NOW SO WHAT WHAT UH .
GIVES YOU SYMPATHY FOR THE VIGILANTES .
YEAH WHAT WHAT DETERRENT DOES HE REALLY HAVE .
YEAH .
YEAH I THINK IN OUR IN OUR PARTICULAR NEIGHBORHOOD VIGILANTISM IS BECOMING A REAL REAL POSSIBILITY .
UHHUH .
UH WE VE HAD A COUPLE INSTANCES WHERE BREAK INS WHERE THE PEOPLE HAVE ACTUALLY YOU KNOW SHOT THE PEOPLE .
OH MY GOD .
AND UH RETURN OFFENDERS HAVE THEY VE ACTUALLY WAITED FOR THEM WHERE THEY VE ROBBED YOU KNOW PARTICULAR NEIGHBORHOOD THEY LL ROB ONE HOUSE THEN OTHER PEOPLE WILL WAIT UP YOU KNOW AND WAIT FOR SOMEBODY TO DO SOMETHING ELSE TRY TO TAKE IT IN THEIR OWN HANDS .
RIGHT .
COURSE IT DOES NT ALWAYS WORK OUT IN THEIR FAVOR .
RIGHT .
BUT UH NEVERTHELESS .
UHHUH .
I THINK PEOPLE ARE JUST GETTING FED UP AND SAYING YOU KNOW YOU CA NT ARREST ALL OF US YOU CAN .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW YOU CAN GET SOME OF US YOU CA NT GET ALL OF US .
UHHUH .
UH AND WE RE BEGINNING TO SEE MORE AND MORE OF THAT .
AND THAT THAT S A DETERRENT TOO IF YOU THINK THE HOME OWNER MIGHT BE ARMED RIGHT AND AWAKE .
YEAH .
HERE YOU BREAK IN AND YOU RE GOING TO GET SHOT .
YEAH THAT S I MEAN THAT S CERTAINLY A POSSIBILITY IN IN WE HAVE HAD A FEW CASES WHERE THE GUY HAS BROKEN IN YOU KNOW DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND GOTTEN HIMSELF SHOT TO DEATH .
UHHUH .
AND UH IT HELPS FOR A WHILE .
UHHUH .
BUT THEN JUST ANOTHER DIFFERENT SET OF PEOPLE COME IN AND MOST OF THE PEOPLE ARE TRANSIENTS FROM OUT OUTSIDE OF THE STATE .
HUH .
UH I WOULD SAY PROBABLY EIGHTY PERCENT OF THEM THAT ARE CAUGHT THEY RE FROM PLACES LIKE UP IN OKLAHOMA AND LOUISIANA ARKANSAS YOU KNOW ACROSS THE THE BORDER .
WOW .
SO YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO DO NT READILY READ THE NEWSPAPERS IN OUR TOWN OR WHATEVER .
UHHUH .
IT S NOT MANY FROM THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES .
UHHUH .
BUT UH IT S A PROBLEM AND I I JUST I THINK THAT THE COURT SYSTEMS NEED TO BE MORE ACCURATE IN IN STIFFER IN THEIR PENALTIES .
YEAH .
WOULD BE A DEFINITE DETERRENT AND .
YEAH .
AND UH GIVING THE UH POLICE UH AGENCIES A LITTLE BIT MORE JURISDICTION OVER WHAT THEY DO WHEN THEY WHEN THEY CATCH THESE PEOPLE .
UHHUH I MEAN I I TEND TO AGREE WITH YOU I THINK UH WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS NUMBER ONE COMPLETELY GETTING RID OF THESE VICTIMLESS CRIMES UH THERE S NO REASON TO ENFORCE THOSE AND SPEND TIME AND MONEY DOING IT .
RIGHT .
AND AND WORRY ABOUT THESE THINGS WHERE PEOPLE ARE GETTING HURT AND I THINK ONE OF THE BIG THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO IS TO INCREASE DETERRENCE IS UH IF SOMEONE IS FOUND GUILTY OF A UH FELONY LEVEL OFFENSE THEY LOSE THEIR CITIZENSHIP AND THEY LOSE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND JUST A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE RE TRYING TO WORRY ABOUT YOU KNOW PROTECTING THESE PEOPLE FROM WE JUST DO NT PROTECT THEM .
I KNOW LIKE IN MY WIFE S CASE THEY MADE HER FEEL LIKE THE CRIMINAL .
I KNOW AND I THINK I THINK THAT S RIDICULOUS .
THEY THEY WENT TO ALL ALL .
OKAY UM I GUESS UM THIS IS PROBABLY REALLY A GOOD SUBJECT FOR ME BECAUSE I REALLY LIKE TO DO UH HAND WORK .
UH MOSTLY I DO NEEDLEPOINT I GUESS .
OH REALLY .
BUT UM .

AND FOR TWO YOU KNOW THAT IT DOES HELP .
I MEAN YOU KNOW I THINK THE PEOPLE IN THOSE COUNTRY DO WANT OUR HELP .
THE PEOPLE .
THAT ARE UNDER CONDITIONS .
THAT ARE YOU KNOW NOT FAVORABLE TO THIS THEIR RIGHTS .

BUT UH I WISH WE DID NT HAVE TO .
I MEAN I D RATHER EVEN IF A COUNTRY CHOOSES A GOVERNMENT .
THAT S NOT YOU KNOW EXACTLY THE KIND OF GOVERNMENT THAT WE HAVE YOU KNOW OR OR AS IN COMPLETE OPPOSITION TO IT AT LEAST .
IT S THEIR CHOICE AS LONG AS LONG IT .
S .
ONE .
THAT S THAT THAT MAKES SINCE SO TO SPEAK YOU KNOW IT IS A GOVERNMENT .
THAT STAYS IN POWER THAT CAN STAY IN POWER BUT IT SEEMS LIKE MOST OF THEM DO NT .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
WELL SOMETIMES THAT S THAT S AMERICA DOING THAT TOO .
OH YEAH .
YOU KNOW WE WE FALL OUT OF UH AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN LEADERS AND THEN AMAZINGLY ENOUGH THE COUNTRY STARTS TURNING AGAINST OUR LEADER YOU KNOW .

I DO NT KNOW REALLY WHAT S GOING TO HAPPEN .
BUT WE DO NT WE RE NOT INTERVENING IN THAT OR DO YOU THINK THAT WE ARE TO THE DEGREE THAT WE ARE CAUSING .

I THINK WE RE GETTING QUITE A PUT IT .
THIS WAY I THINK NO I THINK THE PEOPLE ARE .
AND .
REVOLTING THEMSELVES .
YEAH .
AND WE RE UH .
SEE I .
ALLOWING .
I AGREE WITH THAT .
IT TO HAPPEN .
YEAH .
YEAH .
I I AGREE THAT THAT THE COMMUNICATION THAT NOW THAT COMMUNICATION HAS .
BECOME SO MUCH MORE WIDESPREAD AND YOU KNOW WORLDWIDE THAT PEOPLE ARE REALIZING HEY WE DO NT HAVE IT SO GOOD AND LET S STAND UP .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW UH THIS IS RIDICULOUS WE RE LIVING WITH THESE KIND OF CONDITIONS IN A WORLD .
THAT S ADVANCING AS FAST AS IT IS .
UHHUH .
THAT UH I THINK PEOPLE ARE JUST SAYING NO WAY WE DO NT WANT ANYWHERE OF THIS .
YEAH .
I THINK .
UH CENTRAL AMERICA HAS ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF THOSE PLACES WHERE PEOPLE ARE MORE PASSIVE YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
WHERE IT S ALWAYS THE MINORITY .
THAT ARE ARE TRYING TO MAKE THE COUNTRY BETTER .
YEAH .
WELL I MEAN I DO NT MEAN TO WELL I GUESS I DO IN A WAY SOMETIMES I THINK A RELIGION HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THAT .
I THINK THAT THAT UH BECAUSE OF THOSE CO COUNTRIES .
A LOT YOU KNOW WHERE SUCH CATHOLIC INFLUENCE .
AND I THINK THE CATHOLIC RELIGION .
ITSELF WAS WAS SUCH A DOMINANT FACTOR AS FAR AS KEEPING THE PEOPLE DOWN .
SO TO SPEAK .
I THOUGHT .
BUT .
IT WAS THE OTHER WAY AROUND .
THEY WERE ALWAYS HAVING TO MEET IN THE CATACOMBS AND ALL THIS SO ALL THE PERSECUTION THAT THEY RE SORT OF USE TO IT IT S BEEN .
UH .
SORT OF LIKE YOU KNOW .
BUT BUT SEE BUT I DO NT AGREE WITH THAT BECAUSE THE CATHOLIC RELIGION AS FAR AS THROUGH THE AGES HAS BEEN THE RULE SO TO SPEAK .
YOU KNOW THEY ARE THE ONES .
THAT SET THAT SET A LOT OF THE RULES AND THEY ARE THE ONES .
THAT DO KEEP THE PEOPLE DOWN .
I MEAN WHEN YOU .
A RELIGION THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLE GO TO CHURCH AND THEY DO NT UNDERSTAND WHEN ANYTHING IS BEING SAID YET THEY RE YET THEY RE EXPECTED TO BOW DOWN TO IT I THINK THAT KEEPS PEOPLE IN SORT OF LINE YOU KNOW .
I DO NT QUITE UNDERSTAND THAT .
DO THEY EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT S BEING SAID .
WELL WHEN WHEN IT USE TO BE LATIN .
I M JUST SAYING .
OH YEAH .
THAT .
THE OLD CHURCH .
THE OLD CHURCH .
YEAH .
YEAH .
WHICH .
IT S NOT THAT WAY NOW BUT I THINK THAT THERE IS JUST THAT I THINK THAT IT S JUST LATIN COUNTRIES ARE SLOWER IN COMING AROUND .
WELL THEY ACTUALLY UNDERSTOOD IT IS IN AMERICA WHERE IT WAS HARD .
LATIN YOU KNOW .
WELL LATIN .
IS VERY VERY VERY CLOSE TO SPANISH .
UH THEY STILL DID NT UNDERSTAND IT THOUGH I DO NT THINK .
YEAH .
BECAUSE I I DESCEND FROM THAT .
AND I YOU KNOW I DO NT CA NT I DO NT UNDERSTAND LATIN .
UH .
AND I M OF SPANISH DESCENT .
SO .
YEAH .
UM I I JUST THINK THAT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH WHY LATINOS OR TEND TO BE YOU KNOW THE MEE THE MORE MEEK YOU KNOW THEY TEND TO BE MORE LIKE NOT STAND UP FOR THEIR RIGHTS AS MUCH .
THEY RE NOT REALLY SURE OF WHAT .
THEY ARE .
I DO NT THINK .
UH I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT OF .
WELL I MEAN HOW .
IT .
THAT WAY .
CAN YOU CONTRAST THE EUROPEANS AND THEIR VOCALISM ON THEIR RIGHTS TO TO SAY THE PEOPLE IN LATIN AMERICA .
I MEAN WHY ARE THEY WHY ARE THEY NOT AS VOCAL OR WHY DO THEY NOT YOU KNOW STAND UP SO TO SPEAK FOR THEIR RIGHTS .
I DO NT KNOW COULD BE THE .
THE ECONOMIC STILL .
YOU KNOW THE THERE S THE POVERTY LEVEL IS CERTAINLY UH YOU KNOW MUCH WORSE IN THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES .
I MEAN YOU CAN SAY THAT ABOUT AFRICA TOO .
I THINK IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE POVERTY LEVEL BECAUSE AFRICA IS CERTAINLY NOT A CATHOLIC UH COUNTRY .
UHHUH .
AND YET YOU KNOW THEY HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM WHERE YOU KNOW .
UH I DO NT .
WHERE KINGS AND SUCH .
AGREE WITH THAT .
I DO NT AGREE BECAUSE I THINK THAT THEY ARE PRETTY VOCAL ABOUT IT IN IN UH AFRICA .
I THINK THEY VE MADE A LOT MORE CHANCES .
THEY THEY VE THEIR VERY VOCAL .
WELL IN SOUTH AFRICA YEAH .
IN SOUTH AFRICA I THINK THEY ARE BUT YET YOU KNOW .
SO WHAT S THE DIFFERENCE .
IDI AMIN WAS YOU KNOW IN POWER FOR SO LONG .
YEAH .
SO WHAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SAY SOUTH AMERICA AND THE REST I MEAN SOUTH AFRICA AND IT IS REST OF AFRICA .
UH RACIAL I THINK OR LIKE YOU SAY MAYBE COMMUNICATION OF KNOWING THAT HEY UP IN OTHER ENGLISH COLONIES OR PREVIOUS ENGLISH COLONIES EVERYTHING IS EQUAL AND YET DOWN THERE .
IT S NOT .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW I THINK COMMUNICATION DOES HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH IT YOU KNOW IN EDUCATION .
YEAH .
MAYBE .
I DO NT KNOW ABOUT EDUCATION BECAUSE THE BLACK COMMUNITY IS STILL NOT VERY EDUCATED DOWN THERE .
SO I THINK IT IS COMMUNICATION IT S JUST OOPSY .
I THINK IT MAYBE HAS TO DO WITH A LO A LOT TO DO WITH EDUCATION BECAUSE YOU LOOK AT THE UH EUROPEAN COUNTRIES I THINK THEY TEND TO BE MORE EDUCATED MUCH MORE .
UHHUH .
EDUCATED THAN THAN AFRICA OR THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
YOU KNOW THAT I DO NT KNOW WHETHER UH ACTUALLY I I VE ALWAYS WONDERED WHETHER HOW THE EDUCATION SYSTEM WORKS IN THE RUSSIAN COUNTRIES .
UHHUH .
THE REPUBLICS YOU KNOW .
WELL I KNOW THAT RUSSIA THEY RE THEY RE COMPARABLY MORE BETTER EDUCATED THAN WE ARE .
REALLY .
IN OUR COUNTRY .
THAT S GOOD IN A WAY .
YOU KNOW UH SOMETHING .
WE COMPETE WITH .
YEAH .
UH AND I VE BEEN SORT OF DISAPPOINTED HOW THAT THEY THEY SAY LITERACY RATE HAS GONE DOWN YOU KNOW THAT S SORT OF UPSETTING .
YEAH .
TO THINK THAT WE RE RICHER AND YET EVERYBODY IS INTELLECTUALLY POORER .
IN OUR COUNTRY .
IN OUR COUNTRY YEAH .
YEAH .
THAT IS REALLY UPSETTING AND AND CONSIDERING IT S FREE YOU KNOW I MEAN GOOD EDUCATION IS REALLY STILL FREE .
YEAH .
WELL THAT S JUST IT THOUGH GOOD EDUCATION .
UHHUH .
IS IT GOOD EDUCATION .
IT MAY BE FREE BUT IS IT GOOD EDUCATION AND THAT S JUST IT ARE WE WILLING TO PAY FOR IT .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
I MEAN A LOT OF PEOPLE BITCH AND MOAN ABOUT THE TAXES AND ALL BUT SO ARE THEY WILLING TO .
UH .
PAY FOR YOU KNOW QUALITY EDUCATION YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
SO YOU KNOW AND YET THEY YET PEOPLE GET VERY FRIGHTENED WHEN THEY SEE THE JAPANESE MOVING IN AND THE RUSSIANS MOVING IN CERTAIN AREAS OF TECHNOLOGY YOU KNOW THAT WE USE TO DOMINATE AND IT .
S LIKE WELL YOU KNOW THEY RE EDUCATING THEIR PEOPLE TO HIGHER DEGREES THAN WE DO .
SO YOU RE GOING TO HAVE TO EXPECT IT .
SO WHAT .
YOU ARE YOU WILLING TO COMPROMISE A LITTLE AND AND PAY PAY SOME TAKE SOME OF THAT MONEY OUT OF YOUR POCKET AND PAY FOR GOOD QUALITY EDUCATION .

UHHUH .
RIGHT AND NOW THEY RE TRYING TO TAKE SOME MONEY AWAY FROM THE RICHER DISTRICTS LIKE THE ONE THAT I M IN IN DALLAS AND MAKE US PAY OUR MONEY TO THE SMALLER ONES AND MAKE IT MORE EQUITABLE .
AND IF THEY CA NT COME UP WITH SOMETHING BY THE FIFTEENTH THEN THE STATE S SUPPOSED TO DECIDE THE COURTS .

I THINK THEY RE MAYBE GOING TO GIVE US A STATE INCOME TAX DO YOU HAVE ONE .
YEAH .
I M NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO IT BUT SOMETHING S GOT TO BE DONE .

OH IS IT LIKE A FOREIGN EXCHANGE TYPE STUDENT .
HUHUH YOU KNOW WE VE HAD A LOT OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE .
GO AHEAD SO KEN HOW DO YOU DO YOUR FAMILY BUDGET .
WELL WE DO NT ACTUALLY HAVE A BUDGET BUDGET PER SE WHAT WE DO IS UH MAINTAIN A NORMAL CHECKBOOK YOU KNOW LIKE .
HUHUH .
EVERYONE IN THE WORLD DOES I GUESS AND OCCASIONALLY IT ACTUALLY BALANCES AND UM WE ALSO WE UM WE HAVE A A U S AIR AND VISA CARD .
HUHUH .
EVERY EVERY DOLLAR WE EVERY DOLLAR WE CHARGE IS A MILE FOR OUR FREQUENT FLIER MILEAGE .
OH YEAH .
IT S A REAL GOOD DEAL ACTUALLY IF YOU CHARGE A LOT SO WHAT WE WHAT MY WIFE AND I HAVE TAKEN TO DOING IS CHARGING EVERYTHING IN SIGHT ANYTHING WE BUY WE CHARGE INCLUDING GROCERIES AND SO FORTH .
HUHUH .
SO WHAT WE LL DO IS .
WELL THEN YOU JUST PAY IT OFF AT THE END OF THE MONTH .
RIGHT WE ACTUALLY MAINTAIN A WE HAVE A WE WE WE WE HAVE A CHECKING ACCOUNT THAT WE TREAT LIKE A SAVINGS SCRATCH THAT WE HAVE A SAVINGS ACCOUNT THAT WE TREAT LIKE A CHECKING ACCOUNT .
HUHUH .
AND SO WHAT WE DO IS WE ANYTIME WE DO OR MAKE OR CHARGE SOMETHING WE WRITE IT OUT AS IF WE WROTE A CHECK .
HUHUH .
AND THEN AT THE END OF THE MONTH ALL THE MONEY TO MUMBLEX COVERED ALREADY SO WE JUST PAY IT OFF WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT ANY INTEREST OR ANYTHING .
OH THAT S A REAL GOOD IDEA .
IT KEEPS US HOPPING .
YEAH SEE NOW I D NEVER GET MY WIFE TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THAT BEFORE WE GOT MARRIED I HAD MONEY IN THE BANK I OWNED MY OWN HOME I PUT IN SO MUCH MONEY EACH YOU KNOW MONTH TOWARDS LONG TERM SAVINGS YOU KNOW LIKE IN UH MUTUAL FUNDS AND THINGS YOU KNOW .
HUHUH .
AND UH AFTER I GOT MARRIED NO IT JUST DID NT WORK ANYMORE SHE SPENDS A LOT SHE LIKES TO SPEND ON ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING WITH BODY LOTION EVERYTHING SO WE REALLY HAVE NT WE DO NT HAVE A GOOD ORGANIZED SYSTEM YET MAYBE AFTER AWHILE I LL RUB OFF ON HER OR SOMETHING I DO NT THINK .
WELL YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT S ALWAYS GOOD IS SORT OF A FOR SAVINGS WHERE THEY JUST TAKE MONEY OUT OF YOU RE PAY .
YEAH .
WE DID THAT FOR AWHILE WHERE UM WE ACTUALLY STILL DO IT WITH WITH MY WIFE S SALARY .

HUHUH .
AND PUT IT IT GOES DIRECTLY TO ANOTHER ACCOUNT THAT WE DO NT AT AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT BANK THAT WE DO NT HAVE ACCESS TO SO EASILY AND IT GOES THERE AND IT STAYS THERE AND IT BUILDS UP UNTIL WE NEED IT FOR SOMETHING .
YEAH SEE I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE TO DO THAT .
OF COURSE SHE LOOKS AT WHAT SHE BRINGS HOME EACH WEEK IT S GOING TO BE HARD FOR HER TO UH NOT HAVE HER OWN MONEY BECAUSE LIKE NOW YOU KNOW I PUT MONEY IN THE BANK AND SAVED TO GO BACK TO GRADUATE SCHOOL FOR TWO YEARS AND NOW SHE WANTS TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL BUT SHE SAVED ENOUGH MAYBE TO GET HER THROUGH AUGUST .
OH .
YOU KNOW AND THAT S IT AND I KEEP SAYING NOW LAURA YOU RE GOING TO HAVE TO SAVE A LITTLE MONEY I DO NT KNOW IF MY PALTRY GRADUATE STUDENT FEES ARE GOING TO GET US THROUGH IT DOES NT WORK KEN .
GEE .
MY MOTHER ALWAYS SAID NOW DO NT ARGUE ABOUT MONEY SO WE DO NT .
RIGHT .
BUT YOU KNOW THERE GOES MY SAVINGS .
GOD .
BUT YOU KNOW IT S ONE OF THOSE THINGS .
I GOT LUCKY MY WIFE APPARENTLY IS NOT A SHE LIKES TO SPEND BUT SHE S PRETTY GOOD ABOUT THINGS .

YEAH .
I THINK THAT S UH .
NOW DO YOU STILL OWN A HOUSE YOU SAID YOU OWNED ONE .
I SOLD MY HOUSE AND THAT S WHAT S REALLY PAYING FOR MY TIME UNEMPLOYED OR WHATEVER .
THAT S GREAT .
BECAUSE THE GRADUATE ASSISTANTSHIP REALLY DOES NT COVER THE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TUITION REALLY DOES NT COVER LIVING EXPENSES UM .
RIGHT .
WE ACTUALLY LIVE IN TWO DIFFERENT PLACES RIGHT NOW BECAUSE SHE HAS HER JOB SO THAT MAKES IT HARD WITH UH YOU KNOW WE RE PAYING DOUBLE RENT DOUBLE UTILITIES .
OH WOW .
AND THAT MAKES IT SORT OF EXPENSIVE BUT SEE I LIVE WITHIN MY .
MUMBLEX .
I LIVE WITHIN MY ME VERY MENIAL INCOME AND SHE DOES NT SHE DOES NT LIVE WITHIN HER PROFESSIONAL INCOME YOU KNOW SO I JUST GET A .
THAT S THE KILLER TWO APARTMENTS .
YEAH AND THEN EVEN IF WE WANT TO SEE EACH OTHER ON WEEKENDS IT S TWENTYFIVE THIRTY DOLLARS IN GAS EVERY WEEKEND AND THAT REALLY ADDS UP TOO YOU KNOW SO IT GETS TOUGH .
WOW .
I THINK WE LL DO MUCH BETTER WHEN WE RE LIVING TOGETHER AND WE RE ONLY PAYING ONE RENT AND ONE TELEPHONE YOU KNOW IT WILL CUT OUR TELEPHONE BILLS YOU KNOW BY FIVE BY FOURFIFTHS YOU KNOW .
EVENTUALLY RIGHT I MEAN YOU RE NOT GOING TO RIGHT .
IF SHE S HERE SO IT S ACTUALLY TOUGH THIS YEAR BUT IT WILL BE BETTER IN JUNE SHE WILL MOVE IN WITH ME IN JUNE SO HOPEFULLY OUR BUDGET WILL IN INCREASE THEN .

A HAS GONE OVERBOARD THE WRONG WAY .
YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
THEY RE SITTING THERE ON NUMBER TEN THEY RE SAYING ABSOLUTELY NO GUN CONTROL .
WE DO NT EVEN WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT AND AND I THINK THAT S A DUMB .
YEAH .
SITUATION .
BECAUSE THERE HAS GOT TO BE SOME KIND OF BACKGROUND CHECK TO SEE .
THAT THE PEOPLE .
WHO ARE BUYING A GUN ARE BUYING IT FOR A USEFUL PURPOSE YOU KNOW IF IF YOU RE GOING TO HUNT WITH IT .
UHHUH .
OR IF YOU RE GOING TO DO SPORT SHOOTING YOU CAN WAIT A WEEK .
RIGHT .
THAT S TRUE .
IT S NOT A BIG DEAL FOR THEM TO GO .
IF THEY RE CAN CHECK YOUR DRIVERS LICENSE EVERY TIME .
YOU GET A TICKET YOU KNOW I MEAN THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO BACK AND FIND OUT IF YOU VE HAD ANY KIND OF PSYCHIATRIC RECORD .
RIGHT .
ARMED YOU KNOW FELONY RECORD .
THAT S TRUE .
ANY OF THAT KIND OF STUFF .
AND IT SEEMS TO ME RIGHT NOW THAT THERE S NOT THERE S NOT THAT MUCH OF A CHECK .
I I M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT .
TEXAS LAW I THINK THERE S A CHECK FOR MUMBLEX FELONIES ON YOUR RECORD .
RIGHT .
BUT .
IF THE GUN SHOP OWNER DOES IT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW BUT .
YEAH BUT HE HAS TO GO OUT AND DO IT .
THAT S TRUE I THINK .
YEAH IF AND IF IT S A PRIVATE SALE OF COURSE THEN THERE S NOTHING .
RIGHT .
AND SEE THAT S MY ONLY PROBLEM WITH UH MAKING YOU UM YOU KNOW GET THE CHECK AND EVERYTHING IS IS I GUESS BAD GUYS IF YOU WANT TO CALL THEM BAD GUYS THEY ARE GOING TO GET A GUN .
NO MATTER .
WHAT .
UHHUH .
THEY RE NOT I DO NT THINK THEY RE GOING TO GO TO A GUN STORE OR PAWN SHOP AND GET IT .
THE RIGHT WAY WHEN THERE S A CHECK I THINK THEY RE GOING TO GO OUT AND FIND IT SOMEWAY INDIVIDUAL SALE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
YES .
BUT BUT MAYBE WE LL PREVENT A FEW JOHN HINCKLEY S .
YEAH .
I HOPE .
THAT S TRUE .
YOU KNOW I I THAT THAT S THE KIND OF PEOPLE LIKE I SAY I DO NT THINK THE GUY .
WHO S GOING TO ROB A SEVEN ELEVEN IS GOING TO ROB A SEVEN ELEVEN WHETHER HE HAS A GUN OR A KNIFE BASEBALL BAT .
KNIFE EXACTLY .
OR YOU KNOW WHATEVER .
HE S GOING TO DO WHAT .
HE WANTS TO DO .
BUT YOU KNOW .
THAT S TRUE .
I I JUST THINK IT MAKES HONEST PEOPLE MORE HONEST AND .
YEAH .
AND AND THE PEOPLE .
WHO WANT IT IT S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL LIKE I SAY TO WAIT .
RIGHT .
RIGHT .
AND IF YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT IN A HURRY SOMETHING S WRONG .
YEAH IT MAKES YOU WONDER .
WHAT .
THEY NEED IT FOR ALL OF A SUDDEN HERE .
UM .
THAT S RIGHT .
THAT S RIGHT .
OH .
WELL I M MARRIED TO A POLICEMAN SO WE WE TALK ABOUT THIS A LOT .

YEAH .
ON THE .
YEAH .
SCALE OF ONE TO TEN HE NEEDS SOME MORE .
YEAH .
I WAS WATCHING A .
GOSH IF I WAS A COP .
I WOULD BE .
WORRIED ABOUT THAT .
TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVE TOO MANY TOO MUCH ACCESS .
YEAH THEY DO .
THEY DO .
AND I GUESS I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT WE OUGHT TO CONTROL TO SOME EXTENT IS THERE SHOULD BE SOME LAW AGAINST THE TYPES OF GU I MEAN .
SOME OF THESE SATURDAY NIGHT SPECIALS THAT THESE COMPANIES PUT OUT .
RIGHT .
THAT ARE PIE I MEAN THEY RE ARE BASICALLY IT SAYS HERE BUY ME AND GO ROB A SEVEN ELEVEN .
RIGHT OR EVEN EVEN THE UM THE LITTLE UM TOY GUNS LOOK REAL .
I MEAN .
YES THEY .
THAT S REALLY GOTTEN BAD .
I VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT THAT ON TV AND THAT S KIND OF SCARY TO THINK THAT YOU MAY BE SHOT FOR HOLDING ONE .
OR YOUR CHILD .
YEAH .
ACCIDENTLY .
IF YOUR CHILD IS OLD ENOUGH I MEAN THERE ARE A LOT OF KIDS .
WHO WHEN THEY RE TEN LOOK LIKE THEY RE TWELVE .
RIGHT .
OR FOURTEEN OR AND AND ESPECIALLY SOME OF THE MINORITY CHILDREN .
WHETHER .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW A RACIST OR NOT THAT S THE TRUTH .
AND AND IF SOME OF THEM ARE DOING SOMETHING THAT THEY SHOULD NT BE AND THEN THEY HAVE ONE OF THOSE TOY GUNS IN THEIR HANDS AND A COP COMES UP .
RIGHT .
I MEAN YOU CA NT BLAME THEM .
IT LOOKS .
YOU CA NT MUMBLEX .
LIKE THEY VE GOT A WEAPON .
JEEZ AND YOU CA NT TAKE THE CHANCES .
THAT S RIGHT .
BECAUSE THERE S BEEN KIDS .
THAT AGE .
WHO HAVE KILLED PEOPLE .
EXACTLY .
AND YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THERE WAS A LAW IN I THINK IT S IN OREGON WHERE THEY VE NOW MADE ALL TOY GUNS THEY RE MAKING THEM .
NEON COLORS .
RIGHT AND I THINK THAT S A GOOD IDEA .
YOU KNOW LIKE YEAH AND THE KIDS DO NT CARE .
THAT S RIGHT .
MY KID DID NT CARE .
I KNOW .
HE PICKS UP A STICK AND GOES BANG .
RIGHT RIGHT .
IT DOES NT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO HIM .

I LEARNED TO SHOOT WHEN I WAS REAL LITTLE .
UHHUH .
I THINK THAT S A LOT OF IT TOO IS THAT PEOPLE NEED TO TEACH THEIR KIDS .

OH YEAH .
AND I WAS LIKE I LIVE IN A NICE NEIGHBORHOOD BUT STILL .

AND THEN I VE GOT IT SO FAR SOMETIMES I THINK I WONDER IF I I M NOT ABOUT TO LOAD IT BECAUSE I YOU KNOW I ASSUME THAT THE KIDS ARE NOT GOING TO EVER GET UP THERE .
UHHUH .
AND IT S IN A CASE AND IT S YOU KNOW IT S PUT UP AND IT S AWAY AND ALL THAT .

WHO ARE AT THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM .
RIGHT .
RIGHT .
I M GLAD YOU RE NOT .
ME TOO .
I M GLAD TO FIND THERE S ANOTHER REASONABLE PERSON IN GARLAND .
OKAY .
WELL GOOD .
WELL IT S BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU .
YOU TOO THANKS .
BYEBYE .
BYEBYE .
GO AHEAD .
OKAY DO I STILL CAN STILL CAN FEEL THAT THE SOVIET UNION AS SUCH IS STILL A THREAT TO THE CIVILIZED WESTERN WORLD .
ABSOLUTELY .
AND MY REASONS ARE BASED UPON NOT ONLY FROM WHAT .
I READ IN THE NEWSPAPERS WHAT .
I SEE ON THE NEWSPAPERS BUT UP AGAINST SOME OF THE FUN AND EXCITING THINGS I RAN INTO DURING MY SIX YEARS AS A SOLDIER IN THE FIFTH SPECIAL FORCES GROUP .
UM .
OKAY .
I GUESS I DO NT SEE THEM AS MUCH OF A THREAT AS THEY USED TO BE BUT I THINK JUST THE INSTABILITY OF THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW IS SORT OF SCARY .
WELL THAT S WHAT MAKES IT .
A POWDER KEG .
THE UM I LL GO BACK IN TIME .
A LITTLE BIT TO ABOUT EIGHTYONE .
UHHUH .
WHEN MY FIRST REAL INVOLVEMENT WITH THE MILITARY STARTED .
UM NATURALLY WE WERE AT THE TIME THE SOVIET UNION WAS CONSIDERED TO BE THE BIG MILITARY POWER AND THE BIG THREAT .
SO WE GOT LOTS QUITE A BIT OF INFORMATION AS WELL AS INDOCTRINATION ON SOVIET TACTICS AND WEAPONS .
UHHUH .
I WENT TO LEBANON IN EIGHTYTHREE BEFORE THE MARINES EVER GOT THERE WITH THE U N PEACE KEEPING FORCE .
AND WITH THE TRAINING .
I RECEIVED PRIOR TO GOING THERE WITH CAPTURED WEAPONS WE KEPT RUNNING UP AGAINST .
THESE WERE NT THESE WERE NT CHINESE MADE COPIES .
THESE WERE SOVIET MADE TOP OF THE LINE FRESH OUT OF THE BOX A K FORTYSEVENS .
UM UHHUH .
AS WELL AS A LOT OF THE EXPLOSIVES WE WERE RUNNING INTO .
IN GRANADA IN OCTOBER TWENTYFIFTH EIGHTYTHREE WE INVADED THE PLACE .
SURE THERE WERE CUBAN SOLDIERS THERE BUT THERE WAS ALSO A BUNCH OF RUSSIAN ADVISORS .
THAT WERE DAMN GOOD SHOTS .
THE TEAM .
I WAS WITH WE JUMPED IN ON THE WESTERN TIP OF OF THE ISLAND DOWN ON POINT SALINAS .
AND FOR EVERY CUBAN THERE WAS AT LEAST FIVE RUSSIAN ADVISORS .
HUH .
AND THEY WERE ALL SHOOTING STATE OF THE ART SOVIET WEAPONS .
IN EIGHTYFOUR I WAS DOWN IN CENTRAL AMERICA AS AN ADVISOR TO THE HONDURAN ARMY .
AGAIN WE WERE RUNNING UP AGAINST CUBANS QUITE A BIT PLUS SOVIET ADVISORS .
AND THE EQUIPMENT .
WE WERE CAPTURING AND TAKING FROM THE NICARAGUANS WAS BRAND NEW OUT OF THE CRATE SOVIET MADE MATERIAL .
DO I CONSIDER THEM .
A THREAT .
ABSOLUTELY .
THEY HAVE A UNIVERSITY IN MOSCOW CALLED THE PATRICE DE LAMUMBA UNIVERSITY .
ABOUT LIKE A AND M OR U T WHERE THEY RE TEACHINGS SUBJECTS LIKE THAT THEY RE TEACHING TERRORISM .
SOME OF THE PEOPLE WE WENT UP AGAINST IN LEBANON WERE GRADUATES FROM THAT PLACE .
AND LET ME TELL YOU THEY ARE NOTHING NICE TO GO UP AGAINST .
HUH .
I M SURPRISED DURING THIS IRAQI CRISIS .
WE DID NT HAVE MORE INCIDENTS THAN THEY DID .
THESE GUYS ARE TOP OF THE LINE .
WHEN THEY WHEN THEY GRADUATE FROM THERE THEY CAN PULL TERRORIST ACTIONS ANYWHERE IN THE FREE WORLD .
AND THEY ARE VERY VERY GOOD AT WHAT .
THEY DO .
SO UNTIL I SEE THE ENTIRE QUOTE OLD GUARD OF THE SOVIET MILITARY OF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT COMPLETELY ROLL OVER AND DISAPPEAR PREFERABLY BURIED I STILL CONSIDER THEM .
A THREAT .
UHHUH .
THEIR MILITARY IS DIFFERENT FROM OURS TO WHERE THERE ARE EXTREMIST GEN GENERALS .
THAT ACTUALLY CONTROL TENS AND THOUSANDS OF TROOPS .
THAT IRREGARDLESS OF WHAT .
SOVIET POLICY IS THEY RE GOING TO DO WHAT .
THE GENERAL TELLS THEM .
YEAH .
I GUESS THAT S WHAT CONCERNS ME .
THE MOST .
IS THEY RE THEY RE SO UNSTABLE THAT SOMEBODY LIKE THAT COULD MAKE UH DECISIONS .
THAT WOULD JEOPARDIZE A LOT OF PEOPLE .
WELL IT S IN INTERESTING WATCHING THE DIFFERENT SOVIET STATES ALBANIA LITHUANIA DOING THEIR LITTLE REVOLTS DOWN THERE .
UHHUH .
EACH ONE OF THOSE SECTORS HAS GOT A SOVIET GENERAL OVER THE TROOPS .
THAT ARE THERE .
SO FAR THEY HAVE NT RUN INTO THE REAL PSYCHOS YET .
THERE S PROBABLY FIVE OR SIX WHICH WOULD BE AN EQUIVALENT OF OUR JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFFS THAT ARE IN POSITIONS OVER SOME OF THESE SOVIET STATES .
IF UPRISINGS HAP HAPPEN IN THEIR SECTORS IT IS IT S GOING TO BE A TOTAL BLOOD BATH .
YEAH IT LOOKS LIKE IT S COME CLOSE TO THAT AS IT IS .
ACTUALLY THEY RE SHOWING REMARKABLE RESTRAINT .
THEY GET REAL NASTY THE HYUNDEE HELICOPTERS COME OUT AND THEY WOULD LEVEL ENTIRE AREAS .
OKAY YOU RE FROM THE DALLAS AREA RIGHT .
UHHUH .
OKAY YOU KNOW BASICALLY THE SIZE OF UH THE AREA AROUND RICHARDSON .
YEAH .
YOU PUT FIVE SOVIET HYUNDEE HELICOPTERS IN THE AIR THEY CAN LEVEL THE ENTIRE AREA AND THERE WO NT BE ANYTHING LEFT ALIVE .
AND THEY CAN DO THAT IN ABOUT FOUR MINUTES .
HUH .
AND THEY VE GOT ENTIRE SQUADRONS OF THOSE JUST STANDING BY .
THEY USED THEM IN AFGHANISTAN DID RE REMARKABLY WELL CONSIDERING THE TERRAIN .
THEY WERE FLYING IN .
BUT ON A HIGHLY POPULATED AREA LIKE SOME OF THE SOVIET CITIES WOULD BE WITH THE WEAPONRY .
THAT S ATTACHED ON THOSE THINGS THERE IS NO PLACE TO HIDE .
IF THE BOMBS DO NT GET YOU IF THE BULLETS DO NT GET YOU THEN THEN THE NERVE GAS DEFINITELY WILL GET YOU .
THE ONLY DRAWBACK ON THAT LITTLE PIECE OF MACHINERY IS THEY ONLY GOT FIVE MINUTES OF AIR TIME .
THEY DRINK THAT MUCH FUEL .
UHHUH .
WERE .
YOU HAVE YOU I TAKE IT .
YOU HAVE NT SPENT ANY TIME IN THE MILITARY .
NO I HAVE NT .
AS A CIVILIAN .
THAT S NEVER BEEN ATTACHED TO ANY FORM OF THE MILITARY I KNOW A LOT OF THIS STUFF THAT I WAS INVOLVED IN NEVER DID MAKE THE NEWSPAPERS .
UHHUH .
BUT DURING THAT SAME TIME FRAME DID NT YOU GET SOME FEELING THAT I MEAN THEY RE GETTING ALL THESE WEAPONS AND STUFF .
DID NT IT BUG YOU .
A LITTLE BIT WHY THEY KEPT COMING UP WITH ALL THIS STUFF .
YOU MEAN IN THE IN THE MOST RECENT CONFLICT .
IN ANY OF THEM SINCE EIGHTYONE .
OH .
YEAH DEFINITELY .
I I M I M A LITTLE BIT SHOCKED TO WHAT .
THE U S HAS DONE IN TERMS OF SELLING TO IRAQ IN THE PAST TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS .
YEAH I THINK WE WE .
KIND OF SHOOT OURSELVES IN THE FOOT .
THAT WAY TOO .
IT S BAD ENOUGH THAT THE SOVIETS DO IT .
IT .
ALL BOILS DOWN TO WHETHER IT S OUR SIDE THEIR SIDE IT S A MATTER OF MONEY .
UM .
TO A CERTAIN EXTENT .
UHHUH .
THE DEAL .
THE IRAQI S HAVE WITH THE RUSSIANS WAS FOR OIL .
YEAH .
IT S SCARY TO KNOW THAT THEY RE SUPPLYING THAT MANY PEOPLE WITH WEAPONS .
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT S TO THE SOUTH OF US .
UH THE ONES TO THE SOUTH ARE MORE REGIONAL CONFLICT .
THEY RE NOT REALLY THAT WORRIED ABOUT INVADING NORTH .
THEY RE MORE INTERESTED IN THEY VE GOT A SCREWED UP SITUATION I LL GIVE THEM .
THAT .
FROM MEXICO ALL THE WAY DOWN INTO CEN CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA .
THE SITUATION DOWN THERE IS WEIRD AND IT S VERY SCREWED UP .
UHHUH .
INFLATION IS OUT OF THIS WORLD AND THE GOVERNMENTS WHICH .
OUR GOVERNMENT HAS TECHNICALLY SUPPORTED FOR YEARS ARE CORRUPT AS ALL GET OUT .
AND GENERALLY THE PEOPLE .
ARE GETTING SCREWED AND THEY RE TIRED OF IT AND THEY RE WILLING TO TRY ANYTHING TO GET OUT FROM UNDER IT EVEN IF THAT MEANS GOING TO COMMUNISM .
YEAH .
WELL I THINK RUSSIA IS GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE THEY RE THEY RE ABOUT TO DO SOMETHING TO GET OUT OF COMMUNISM .
I GUESS I D WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOMEBODY LIKE YELTSIN TO GET MORE POWER .
I THINK GORBACHEV HAS ABOUT HAD HIS DAY .
UNFORTUNATELY YELTSIN S GOT TOO MANY CONNECTIONS WITH THE OLD GUARD .
THAT S THE ONLY DRAWBACK THAT I SEE WITH THE ENTIRE THING .
YEAH .
GORBACHEV HAS MADE HIS ATTEMPT AND HE .
S HAD HIS PROBLEMS WITH SOME OF THE OLD GUARD .
HIMSELF .
UHHUH .
YELTSIN S IN TIGHT WITH THE OLD GUARD .
SO IT MAY BE TRYING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS .
UHHUH .
AT THIS POINT .
TRUE .
I DO NT KNOW I SURE WOULD NT TURN MY BACK ON THEM .
YOU MEAN I UNDERSTAND WHEN THEY PULLED THE TROOPS OUT OF UH OR THEY REDUCED THE NUMBER OF TROOPS IN EUROPE AFTER THE BERLIN WALL WENT DOWN I THOUGHT THAT WAS GREAT .
BUT BY NO MEANS DO I ENDORSE OR APPROVE PULLING EVERYBODY OUT .
UHHUH .
IT MAY BE A MUCH REDUCED FORCE THAN WHAT .
WE USED TO HAVE OVER THERE .
BUT YOU STILL BETTER HAVE THE KEY PLAYERS IN PLACE IF SOMETHING DOES GO DOWN .
EVEN IF IT S A REGIONAL CONFLICT .
IF UNITED STATES IS GOING TO FLEX ITS MUSCLE AND BE THE SUPER POWER THAT IT IS NOT ONLY DOES IT IT CAN TALK THE TALK BUT IT S GOT TO BE ABLE TO WALK THE WALK .
IT .
S GOT TO HAVE THE STUFF TO BACK IT BACK UP WHAT .
IT S SAYING .
IF YOU VE ONLY GOT A TOKEN FORCE THERE YOU CA NT HOLD YOUR GROUND .
AT LEAST THEY RE LEARNING A LITTLE BIT FROM HISTORY .
I MEAN UH .
I GUESS WE RE ON .
WELL HANG ON LET ME TRY IT AGAIN BECAUSE USUALLY UM .
DO YOU USUALLY GET A MESSAGE .
YEAH .
UM .
UM .
HANG ON LET ME CHECK ON IT .
I DO NT KNOW .
WELL LET ME TRY IT ONCE MORE .
WELL I THINK WE RE ON MAYBE .
OKAY .
I GUESS WE LL FIND OUT .
YEAH .
SO IN MARYLAND ARE YOU UH ARE YOU .
A SKINS FAN .
UM WELL NOT NOT REALLY FROM YOU KNOW I REALLY WAS NT FROM HERE SO UH THE TEAMS I REALLY ROOT FOR IN FOOTBALL ARE THE NINERS AND THE SEAHAWKS UM YOU KNOW MOSTLY BECAUSE ONLY THE NINERS BECAUSE I USED TO LIVE OUT IN CALIFORNIA .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW LIKE I LIKE SEATTLE BECAUSE I LIKE SEATTLE AND BESIDES I LIKE THE CITY .
OH OKAY .
SO YOU WERE OUT THERE IN SAN FRANCISCO .
UH YEAH .
SAN JOSE ACTUALLY BUT .
OH YEAH .
BUT CLOSE .
OH .
YEAH .
YEAH IT S UM UM OTHER THAN THE UH THE BIG CATCH UH WITH THE FORTYNINERS AND THE COWBOYS BA BACK A FEW YEAR AGO I LIKE SAN FRANCISCO .
OH OKAY .
BUT UH I I DO NT KNOW I I NEVER REALLY WAS A COWBOYS FAN UNTIL I MOVED DOWN TO TEXAS .
OH IS THAT WHERE YOU ARE NOW .
YEAH .
OH OKAY .
I M IN DALLAS AND UH UH I GUESS WHEN YOU RE DOWN HERE IN DALLAS YOU FINALLY GET INDOCTRINATED INTO THE COWBOYS .
UHHUH .
UM BECAUSE UH YOU KNOW THIS IS A BIG FOOTBALL TERRITORY DOWN HERE .
OH YEAH .
AND UH UH UNFORTUNATELY OF COURSE THE COWBOYS HAVE BEEN DOING SO BAD IN THE PAST FEW YEARS .
UHHUH .
THAT UH UH I DO NT KNOW EVERYBODY .
S KIND OF THEY RE STILL BEHIND THEM BUT UH IT S NOT LIKE IT USED TO BE .
YEAH .
WELL YOU KNOW YOU YOU BACK THE WINNERS AND YOU DO NT BACK THEM WHEN THEY RE NOT DOING WELL .
THAT S RIGHT .
BUT I THINK UH ACTUALLY UH IN IN TRYING TO FOLLOW UH YOU KNOW THE COWBOYS OVER THE YEARS I THINK UH UH THEY USED TO HAVE A UM A PHILOSOPHY FOR WELL I DO NT KNOW PROBABLY THE LAST TWENTYFIVE YEARS EXCEPT FOR ABOUT THE LAST ABOUT FIVE OR SIX YEARS .
UHHUH .
UH THEY ALWAYS WENT OUT AND TRIED TO DRAFT THE THE BEST UM ATHLETES .
UHHUH .
AND DID NT REALLY PUT THEM DRAFT FOR ANY PARTICULAR SPOT .
BUT THEY WOULD GO OUT AND TRY TO GO FOR UH THE BEST PEOPLE AND THEN MOLD THEM INTO DIFFERENT AREAS OR FIND THEIR NATURAL NICHE .
UHHUH .
AND THEN ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO FOUR OR FIVE YEARS AGO UH THEY STARTED GOING AFTER UH UH SPECIFIC PLAYERS OR POSITIONS YOU KNOW LIKE THE PRESS WOULD GET DOWN ON LANDRY AND THIS IS WHEN SCHRAMM WAS STILL THERE .
UHHUH .
AND UM THEY D GO AFTER THEM SAYING UH JEEZ WHAT .
YOU REALLY NEED IS A DEFENSIVE END .
SO THEY D GO OUT AND TRY TO FIND A DEFENSIVE END AND WHEN THEY WHEN THEY DRAFTED SOMEBODY AND HE DID NT WORK OUT AT THAT SPOT .
IT REALLY WAS NT A GOOD ENOUGH ATHLETE TO MOVE TO ANY PLACE ELSE .
UHHUH .
AND UH SO I THINK IT WAS KIND EVER INTERESTING .
I THINK THE DECLINE OF THE UH OF THE COWBOYS AS A POWERHOUSE REALLY KIND OF STARTED WITH UH NOT DRAFTING PEOPLE THE BEST ATHLETES .
YEAH .
IT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU YOU VE GOT THE FLEXIBILITY IF THEY RE GOOD ATHLETE .
THEY CAN YOU KNOW DO A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT THINGS .
YEAH YEAH .
UM .
BUT .
AND I DO NT YOU KNOW MY MY MY MY MAIN SPORT IS BASEBALL BUT YOU KNOW UM I VE BEEN ENJOYING FOOTBALL BUT I DO NT KNOW IT AS WELL .
YEAH .
UM I JUST YOU KNOW UM COWBOYS ARE GOING TO HAVE A PROBLEM ARE NT THEY .
IS IT IS IT .

UH THE ONLY THING THAT DISTURBS ME IS THAT NOW THEY THINK THEY HAVE TO ADD JUST A LITTLE BIT OF SEX AND VIOLENCE IN ORDER TO GET A A TOUGHER RATING WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THAT YOU KNOW IT WILL BE MORE ENTICING TO THE TO THE PUBLIC AND A LOT OF TIMES IT IS ADDED FOR NO REAL UH VALID REASON .
UHHUH .
UH WHICH DOES NOT MAKE AND I THINK SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT WAS A LITTLE BIT LIKE THAT .
YEAH .
UH BUT DANCES WITH WOLVES DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE ANYTHING ADDED IT WAS JUST ALL LEGITIMATE KIND OF UH FILM AND THAT IS WHERE REASON WHY I SUPPOSE IT WON SO MANY OSCARS UH BECAUSE IT REALLY WAS GOOD EVEN THOUGH IT IS SUCH A LONG MOVIE YOU KNOW THEY SAID OH PEOPLE WO NT WO NT BE INTERESTED IN A THREE HOUR MOVIE BUT IT CERTAINLY GOTTEN GOOD ACCLAIM EVERYWHERE IT HAS GONE .
AND IT WAS SHOCKING AT THE END TOO SO .
OH OH YEAH .
YEAH .
ABSOLUTELY UH BUT MUCH MORE TRUE TO LIFE AND I THINK THAT IS THAT IS THE POINT .
YEAH THAT IS RIGHT .
UH THEY DO NOT HAVE TO KEEP MAKING UP STUFF IF THEY WANT TO MAKE SOMETHING GOOD .
UHHUH .
I HATE SEQUELS TOO I HATE THESE UH YOU KNOW NUMBER ONE TWO THREE FOUR .
UHHUH .
USUALLY IF A MOVIE IS GOOD ONCE IS ENOUGH .
YEAH ESPECIALLY JAWS .
RIGHT THAT WAS ON PRIME TIME TELEVISION HERE UH RECENTLY AT SEVEN THIRTY IN THE EVENING AND UH IT WAS KIND OF SHOCKING BECAUSE THAT IS A SCARY MOVIE AND CHILDREN YOUNG CHILDREN COULD SEE COULD HAVE SEEN THAT MOVIE .
UHHUH .
UH AT THAT HOUR AND I THOUGHT THAT YOU KNOW THAT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THE SORT OF THING I WOULD HAVE WANTED MY CHILDREN TO SEE AT THAT AGE UH I MEAN WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG AND HERE IT WAS QUITE EASILY SEEN BY ANYBODY THAT TURNED ON THE T V .
RIGHT .
UH WHICH WAS A IT WAS A GOOD MOVIE I MEAN IT WAS WELL DONE BUT UH THAT IS ONE REASON WHY IT WAS SCARY .
UHHUH .
SO BUT I DO NOT KNOW THAT I HAVE SEEN ANY OF THE UH SEQUELS TO THAT I THINK ONE IS ENOUGH .
YEAH .
UH .
JUST MORE OF THE SAME .
YES UHHUH THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE SAY .
IN ONE OF THEM THEY HAVE A MOTHER SHARK UH DESTROY A WHOLE UH MARINA AND AQUARIUM .
OH .
WHICH IS KIND OF FAR FETCHED .
YEAH IT JUST A TOUCH .
YEAH .
WELL THE WHOLE MOVIE IS KIND OF FAR FETCHED .
UHHUH .
BUT I MEAN THE WHOLE IDEA BEHIND IT IS FAR FETCHED .
THEY HARDLY EVER PLAY MUSIC WHEN A SHARK ATTACKS SOMEBODY .
NOT NOT TOO OFTEN .
YEAH .
THAT HAS GOTTEN TO BE A WHOLE CAMP I IDEA NOW THOUGH YOU KNOW IF YOU HEAR THAT MUSIC YOU KNOW EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT .
YEAH .
IT S FUNNY WELL IT SOUNDS LIKE NEITHER ONE OF US ARE REAL MOVIE BUFFS .
WELL UH EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I GO BUT IT IT HAS TO BE LIKE SOMEBODY THAT I LIKE OR .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW I DID NOT I DID NOT GO SEE FIELD OF DREAMS WHEN IT WAS IN THE THEATRE BECAUSE I DID NOT KNOW IT WAS ANY GOOD .
UHHUH .
AND THEN WHEN IT WAS I I FOUND OUT IT WAS KEVIN COSTNER WHEN IT WAS ON UM I GUESS A B C THE OTHER WEEK THEN I .
RIGHT YEAH I SAW IT THEN TOO .
YEAH AND THEN I REALLY LIKED IT .
YEAH IT WAS GOOD .
UHHUH .
IT WAS VERY GOOD BUT UH UM UH SEE I HAVE UH TEENAGERS IN MY HOUSE AND OF COURSE SOMETIMES THEY RENT MOVIES AND YOU KNOW HAVE FRIENDS OVER OR SOMETHING AND SOMETIMES MOVIES ARE HERE THAT I DID NOT I AM NOT EVEN AWARE THAT I COULD HAVE SEEN YOU KNOW BECAUSE MY FAMILY TELLS ME THAT THAT THAT IT HAD BEEN ACTUALLY IN THE HOUSE BEFORE .
HUH .
BUT I HAD MISSED IT BUT I DID SEE IT ON T V AND I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD .
YEAH IT WAS REALLY AND THEN AND THEN UH SHOELESS JOE JACKSON REALLY WAS A PLAYER I THOUGHT THEY MADE HIM UP AND THEN I FOUND OUT YOU KNOW AFTER I SAW THE MOVIE THAT THEY THEY STARTED TALKING ABOUT THAT SCANDAL AND .
OH REALLY .
YEAH WHEN THE WHEN THE ANNIVERSARY CAME UP .
UHHUH .
THAT WAS AROUND THE TIME OF ANNIVERSARY YOU KNOW .
NO KIDDING .
AND THEN .
OH I DID NOT REALIZE THAT .
IT WAS ON THE NEWS .
YEAH UH YOU KNOW THE CHARACTER THAT UH JAMES EARLE JONES PLAYED .
UHHUH .
UH UH I TEACH IN SCHOOL AND WE ARE DOING A BOOK CALLED INVISIBLE MAN BY RALPH ELLISON .
UHHUH .
AND I WONDERED IF MAYBE HE WAS PATTERNED AFTER HIM .
YEAH .
UH I DO NOT KNOW I HAD NOT HEARD ANYBODY TALK ABOUT IT BUT UH HE CERTAINLY COULD HAVE BEEN UH WHICH WAS KIND OF INTERESTING .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO UH WHO WAS A REAL ACTIVIST BUT THEN TOOK UP THE CAUSE UH KIND OF GAVE UP YOU KNOW BECAUSE HE DID NOT THINK ANYTHING WAS HAPPENING AND SO UH IT WAS KIND OF FUN .
YEAH AND I WONDERED WHO IT WAS TOO .
I DO NOT KNOW FOR SURE BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN UH QUALITIES THAT SUGGEST IT COULD BE HE BECAUSE THEY WERE UH THEY WERE SUGGESTING THAT THIS BEN WAS SOMETHING OF A RECLUSE THAT HE HAD STOPPED WRITING AND HAD STOPPED YOU KNOW AND THAT IS TRUE FOR ELLISON HE HE WROTE THAT ONE BOOK AND A FEW ESSAYS AND THAT IS ABOUT IT .
HUH .
AND UH HAS PRETTY MUCH DROPPED OUT OF PUBLIC LIFE BUT HE IS STILL ALIVE AND THAT YOU KNOW THAT IS WHAT MAKES IT SO INTERESTING .
UHHUH .
AND THAT BOOK HAVE YOU EVER READ THAT BOOK .
UH I D .
INVISIBLE MAN .
WHAT IS THAT INVISIBLE MAN .
INVISIBLE MAN BY RALPH ELLISON .
UH NO HUHUH .
IT IS AN INCREDIBLE BOOK IT UH REALLY IS VERY VERY INTERESTING I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT .
UH DID THEY MAKE THE MOVIES AFTER THAT OR .
UH THE YEAH THE MOVIE THE IN FIELD FIELD OF DREAMS CAME OUT AFTER UH THAT NOVEL .
UHHUH .
SO I IT COULD EASILY HAVE BEEN PATTERNED AFTER HIM BUT THE THE MOVIE DID NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WITH THE STORY THAT I AM TALKING ABOUT BUT .
RIGHT .
I JUST THOUGHT THE ACT THE UH AUTHOR COULD HAVE BEEN PATTERNED AFTER THAT UH I MEAN TH THAT CHARACTER COULD HAVE BEEN PATTERNED AFTER HIM OR SOMEONE LIKE HIM CERTAINLY .
UHHUH .
SORT OF INTERESTING SO WELL I GUESS WE HAVE TALKED PROBABLY OUR L TIME LIMIT HAVE NT WE .
OH YEAH .
OKAY .
OKAY IT WAS N .
VERY GOOD IT WAS NICE TALKING TO YOU .
NICE TALKING TO YOU .
OKAY BYEBYE .
BYEBYE .
I M ACTUALLY AT WORK .
OH O .
I I M IN FACILITIES AND HAPPEN TO HAVE UH WEEKEND DUTY HERE .
OH OKAY WHAT BUILDING DO YOU WORK IN .
I M IN THE SOUTH BUILDING .
OH OKAY OKAY .
WE WE PULL MOSTLY EVENINGS WE ARE HAVING THERE S THREE OF US UH FACILITIES MANAGERS ARE COVERING THE OFF SHIFTS JUST TO HAVE SOMEBODY HERE UH FROM MANAGEMENT TO UH SEE IF THEY NEED ANYTHING .
OH OKAY OKAY .
OH THE HOW MANY CALLS HAVE YOU MADE .
I VE ONLY MADE A FEW .
OKAY .
UM .
I M UH GETTING CLOSE TO TWENTY THIS IS THE YEAH HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE A LOT TO TALK ABOUT IN THIS ONE BUT I DO NT REALLY HAVE A LOT IN THIS ONE USUALLY I CAN TALK FOR HOURS ON MOST OF THE SUBJECTS THEY PICK .
GO AHEAD YOU FIRST .
OKAY OUR TOPIC FOR TODAY IS INVASION OF PRIVACY SO I GOT A GOOD ONE .
OKAY GOOD .
WHEN THE PHONE RINGS AND YOU VE GOT A RECORDING AND THIS ALWAYS HAPPENS LIKE AROUND FIVE OR SIX OCLOCK .
OKAY YEAH .
AT NIGHT IT RINGS AND YOU GET THIS RECORDING AND THEN IT WO NT GO AWAY AND ANY ANY OF THE TYPE OF SOLICITATION THAT WHERE THEY CALL ALL THE TIME YOU KNOW THERE ARE EVENINGS ESPECIALLY FRIDAY NIGHTS THURSDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHTS WELL WE MUST GET IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF ANYWHERE FROM THREE TO SIX CALLS ABOUT THAT TIME OF NIGHT MORE PEOPLE CALL THAT S WHERE YOU WANT TO JERK THE PHONE OUT OF THE WALL YOU KNOW YOUR SITTING DOWN TO EAT AND THE PHONE RINGS AND .
RIGHT .
IT S LIKE I DO NT WANT ANYTHING THANK YOU VERY MUCH .
YEAH I THE WORST ONE I GUESS IS LIKE YOU WHEN IT S A RECORDING I THIN I DO NT MIND SO MUCH SOMEONE CALLS AND IT S A AND IT S A SALESPERSON AT LEAST YOU CAN CHAT OR WHATEVER AND SAY OKAY NOW WE WANT TO GO AND THEN WHEN WHEN THEY ACTUALLY START OFF WITH A A COMPUTER .
UHHUH .
AND EXPECT YOU TO TALK TO A COMPUTER UH THAT S WHERE I DRAW THE LIN I JUST HANG UP IMMEDIATELY YOU KNOW .
UHHUH OH YEAH .
UH SHUT MY OTHER RADIO OFF HERE .
YEAH THAT S THAT S REAL IRRITATING TO ME .
UH I GUESS THEY GET THEIR NAME I M I M AMAZED THE MUMBLEX QUESTION ABOUT THAT THE MY CONCERN WOULD BE EVERYONE SEEMS TO HAVE AN ANSWERING MACHINE AND I HAVE ONE TOO .
UHHUH .
AND THEY SAY THAT THEY CAN TIE UP YOUR ANSWERING MACHINE AND JUST HAVE A BIG LONG IF THEY CATCH YOUR ANSWERING MACHINE .
THEY CAN LEAVE THEIR WHOLE SPIEL ON IT .
YEAH THEY THEY CAN ERASE ALL YOUR OTHERS YOU KNOW BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE I THINK THAT S THE WAY IT IS NO MINE I GUESS IF IT S FULL IT WILL NOT TAKE IT I M NOT SURE BUT THEY CAN CERTAINLY UH BLOCK YOUR ANSWERING MACHINE SO SOMEONE ELSE CALLS YOU UH AND YOUR ANSWERING MACHINE IS FULL YOU KNOW .
HUH .
IT WO NT ERASE .
YEAH I .
BUT YOUR RIGHT THAT WAS A GOOD ONE .
YEAH THAT S THAT S A HIGH IRRITANT FOR ME DRIVES ME CRAZY AND IT DOES NT MATTER IF YOU HAVE AN UNLISTED NUMBER OR NOT BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES THESE COMPUTER THINGS WILL JUST MAKE UP NUMBERS AT RANDOM AND JUST CALL THEM .
UHHUH .
AND SO IT REALLY REALLY DOES NT MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A UNLISTED NUMBER OR NOT AND THEY PASS AROUND UH CARDS THAT HAVE EVERYBODY S NAME ON IT LIKE IF YOU ORDER SOMETHING THROUGH A MAIL ORDER CATALOG .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THEN YOU LL START GETTING A BUNCH OF STUFF IN AND A BUNCH OF STUFF AND A BUNCH OF STUFF BECAUSE THEY SELL THEIR CUSTOMER LIST OR THEY SELL THEIR CATALOG LIST OF PEOPLE .
YEAH .
TO DIFFERENT COMPANIES AND EVERYTHING .
I VE GOT ONE IT S NOT REALLY AN INVASION OF PRIVACY BUT IT S UH ANNOYANCE FOR ME IN THE OFFICE WITH UH SPEAKER PHONES YOU KNOW I THE THEY RE GREAT FOR AN OFFICE BUT THIS ONE GUY NEXT TO ME WHO S NOT HERE JUST SO I COULD TALK ABOUT HIM .
HE USES HIS SPEAKER PHONE ALL THE TIME AND IT CARRIES OVER AND SO NOT ONLY WOULD YOU HEAR IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU TALK LONGER FROM WH YOU KIND OF YELL INTO IT .
RIGHT RIGHT .
UH AND SO HE YELLS INTO IT AND YOU HEAR THE OTHER PERSON TOO SO IT S KIND OF A DOUBLE ANNOYANCE HE ACTUALLY UH RUINS MY PRIVACY YOU MIGHT SAY BECAUSE THE THE T I OFFICES ARE SO OPEN ANYWAY .
UHHUH UHHUH .
UH THAT I M AMAZED THAT THE FACT THAT I M ABOUT READY TO SAY SOMETHING UH IF HE S EVEN THOUGHT OF THAT THAT S A REAL UNCOURTEOUS THING AN AN INVASION OF EVERYONE ELSE S TIME AND AND CONCENTRATION TO JUST BE LOUD I DO NT KNOW WHETHER THAT S AN INVASION OF PRIVACY JUST BEING LOUD AND AND ANNOYING YOU KNOW UH THAT S .
UHHUH .
PERHAPS NOT QUITE AN INVASION OF PRIVACY BUT I THINK IT IS AND YO WE BOTH PICKED PHONE ITEMS THERE .
OH YEAH OH YEAH .
GO AHEAD DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE .
LET S SEE I M TRYING TO THINK OH HAVE YOU HEARD THAT THAT I M TRYING TO THINK OF WHAT COMPANY IT WAS THERE WAS A COMPANY THAT WAS GOING TO UH BE GIVING OUT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR FINANCIAL STATUS .
OH YEAH THAT S THAT S A GOOD ONE TOO YEAH .
I HEARD SOMETHING ABOUT NOT THAT EXACTLY BUT GO AHEAD .
WELL UM I WORK IN THE COMPUTER SCIENCE CENTER AND SO WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT THINGS THAT ARE THAT COMPUTERS ARE CAPABLE OF DOING .
YEAH .
AND UH THIS WAS A SOFTWARE PROGRAM THAT A COMPANY WAS DEVELOPING THAT WAS GOING TO HAVE X AMOUNT OF MILLION PEOPLES FINANCIAL HISTORY AND INFORMATION ON IT AND THEY WERE GOING TO SELL IT TO COMPANIES WHO WOULD UP IN TURN SOLICIT YOU FOR BUSINESS ET CETERA ET CETERA .
UHHUH .
AND UH THEY FINALLY UH STOPPED PRODUCTION OF IT BECAUSE OF ALL THE HULLABALOO IT CAUSED .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A BIG DEAL AND I WOULD NT HAVE BEEN TOO THRILLED ABOUT IT EITHER I MEAN THERE WAS A LOT OF STUFF GOING ON ABOUT IT .
WELL I UH HEARD SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THAT I LISTEN TO I M A UH UH TALK SHOW PERSON AND THERE WAS .
OKAY .
WHEN I WHEN I DO MY CHORES UP AT THE RAD I M A RADIO PERSON I GUESS IS WHAT I MEAN .
UHHUH .
AND SO I LISTENED TO WAS IT FIVE SEVENTY WHICH HAS CONTINUOUS TALK ON THE WEEKENDS .
UHHUH .
AND NEIL SPERRY AND EVERYBODY I MEAN THE LAWYERS AND VETERINARIANS AND ALL THAT AND UH I DO NT KNOW IF IT WAS A LAWYER OR WHATEVER IT WAS TALKING ABOUT WHEN YOU MAKE OUT A FIN A FINANCIAL APPLICATION ALL THAT INFORMATION ON THERE IS REALLY NOT NECESSARILY EVEN A YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER YOU KNOW THEY .
HUH .
YOU SHOULD JUST PUT DOWN THE BASICS AND PUT N A WHERE YOU DO NT WANT TO ANSWER .
UHHUH .
WHETHER IT S YOUR PERSONAL SALARY OR WHATEVER UH IF YOUR JUST MAKING OUT A CREDIT CARD APPLICATION YOU DO NT NEED TO PUT DOWN AND I WAS CURIOUS AS TO W YOU KNOW WHAT SPECIFIC THINGS YOU YOU DID HAVE TO PUT DOWN .
HUH .
BUT HE SAYS SOCIAL SECURITY YOU DO NT NEED TO PUT THAT DOWN THERE WHICH I THOUGHT WAS SURPRISING SO MAYBE THERE S SOMETHING ALONG THAT SAME LINE WHERE YOU KNOW IN ALL THESE FINANCIAL UH APPLICATIONS THAT YOU MAKE OUT YOU DO NT HAVE TO PUT ALL THAT STUFF DOWN THERE IT WOULD BE NICE TO KNOW WHAT S WHAT WAS OF COURSE OF COURSE THEY COULD SAY WELL I CA NT GIVE YOU A CARD AND YOU COULD SAY FINE BUT YOU KNOW SOME THINGS WILL BE PRIVATE YOU KNOW BUT HE SAID JUST PUT N A AND HE SAID USUALLY YOU LL GET APPROVED ANYWAY BECAUSE THEY JUST WANT YOUR MONEY THEY WANT YOUR CARD .
BUT IF YOU DO NT FEEL LIKE PUTTING IT DOWN JUST PUT N A YOU KNOW .
UHHUH WELL THAT S REAL INTERESTING I KNOW THAT A LOT OF TIMES THEY ASK FOR INFORMATION THAT THEY DO NT REALLY NEED .
YEAH YEAH .
ON SEVERAL THINGS AND YOU KNOW YOUR CREDIT AP AND TH ALL ALL THEY EVER NEED YOU TO DO IS GIVE THEM PERMISSION TO TO PULL A CREDIT THING ON ON YOURSELF AND THERE IT IS THAT S ALL THEY REALLY CARE ABOUT .
YEAH .
THEY JUST WANT THAT CREDIT HISTORY TO SEE IF YOU RE A MUMBLEX PERSON IF YOU RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PAY YOUR BILLS ON TIME AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
I HAVE NT I DO NT HAVE ANY FRIENDS DOWN AT THE THE AUSTIN PLANT BUT I HEARD THAT THEY WERE REALLY UPSET ABOUT THE DRUG THING AND WE SEEM TO UP HERE HAVE JUST BREEZED THROUGH THAT AND APPARENTLY SOME OTHER COMPANIES ARE HAVING TROUBLE THAT I DO NT HAVE ANY TROUBLE WITH IT UH IT S KIND OF UNUSUAL HERE WE ARE IN DALLAS YOU KNOW THE BIGGEST LOCATION AND AND IT JUST BREEZED THROUGH AND WAS NT REALLY NO ONE WAS I GUESS WAS REALLY TOO CONCERNED ABOUT IT UH YET IN AUSTIN THERE THERE WERE WHETHER IT WAS A CLASS ACTION OR HOW FAR IT GOT I DO NT REALLY KNOW BECAUSE T I ONLY HAD A FEW THINGS ON T I NEWS I THINK ABOUT IT .
UHHUH .
THAT THEY WERE OBJECTING TO BUT THE SOME PEOPLE OBJECT TO THAT WHICH I DO NT MIND NO PROBLEM AT ALL YOU KNOW .
OH I KNOW THAT THERE S SEVERAL PEOPLE I VE TALKED TO THAT REALLY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT AND .
HUH .
I M FORMER MILITARY SO YOU GET KIND OF USED TO .
YEAH RIGHT .
TO GOING THROUGH STUFF LIKE THAT YOU KNOW YOU DO NT PAY ANY ATTENTION TO IT I MEAN .
RIGHT .
ONCE YOU SIGN OVER YOUR SOUL TO UNCLE SAM .
MUMBLEX YOU KNOW YOU JUST KIND OF .
I KNOW .
KIND OF BLOW IT OFF BUT .
I KNOW YEAH I SERVED MY TIME TOO YEAH .
SO I THINK I THINK THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE WHO HAVE BEEN DOWN THAT ROUTE OR HAVE HAD IT TO DEAL WITH ANYTHING LIKE THAT HAVE LEARNED YOU KNOW IT S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS YOU JUST DO IT AND BE DONE WITH IT AND DO NT WORRY ABOUT IT .
YEAH .
BUT I DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL SITES I DID NT I WAS NT AWARE THAT AUSTIN WAS ONE OF THEM BUT I THINK JOHNSON CITY WAS ONE .
OH DID THEY OBJECT TOO .
YEAH THERE S THERE S SEVERAL OF THE CITIES THAT HAVE BEEN HAVING REAL TROUBLE WITH THE ISSUE .
UHHUH .
AND THE BUT ALSO ON THINGS THAT I D HEARD TOO FROM A STOCKHOLDERS MEETING WAS THAT THERE WERE PEOPLE UH THERE WERE THE SAME PLACES WHERE THEY HAD A REAL BAD PROBLEM WITH PEOPLE FIGHTING IT WERE ALSO PLACES THEY HAD A BIG BAD PROBLEM WITH THE DRUG USAGE TOO .
YEAH WELL I M I M ALL FOR IT I UH IT DOES NT BOTHER ME THAT WHETHER THEY DO IT IN HIGH SCHOOLS OR YOU KNOW CARRY IT TO WHEREVER YOU WANT TO CARRY IT REALLY UH .
UHHUH .
UH OF COURSE THAT WOULD REALLY BE A BIG THING IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL BUT UH I M SAYING CERTAINLY AT WORK I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH IT UH UH AND I THINK IT IS THEY THEY FOUND THAT IT S BEEN VERY LOW REALLY .
UHHUH .
I GUESS MAYBE AT THE LOCATIONS THOUGH I DO NT KNOW IF THEY HAVE IT DONE BUT DONE IT BY LOCATION I DO NT REALLY KNOW IF UH THEY NEED TO PUBLISH THAT REALLY .
OH I DO NT THINK IT S A NECESSARY THING TO PUBLISH IT THEY JUST NEED TO DEAL WITH IT AND MUMBLEX ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS .
RIGHT .
I MEAN .
RIGHT .
IF THEY RE GOING TO DO IT JUST DEAL WITH IT AND .
RIGHT .
BE DONE WITH IT .
BUT I THINK THAT WAS AN ACTU ACTUALLY A GOOD THING THAT HAPPENED UH I NEVER CONSIDERED IT I GUESS IT S AN INVASION OF YOUR PRIVACY BUT IT S SOMETHING THAT IS FOR THE GOOD OF SO MANY PEOPLE YOU KNOW TO .
UHHUH .
HAVE EVERYONE UH TAKE THE TEST RIGHT AWAY AND UH AND HOPEFULLY MAYBE SOME PEOPLE WILL CONVINCE OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE ON DRUGS THAT WELL UH I MIGHT AS WELL GET OFF YOU KNOW IF I WANT TO STAY SO YOU KNOW .
OH I .
IF THAT WAS AN INVASION OF PRIVACY MAYBE IT WAS GOOD .
OH I THINK IT S A SAFETY FACTOR TOO BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE ARE INEBRIATED WHETHER IT S ALCOHOL OR DRUGS OR WHATEVER THEY ARE VERY UNSAFE FOR THE THEIR COWORKERS YOU KNOW .
OH SURE .
IT S LIKE YOU KNOW MY FATHER WAS A FIREMAN AND I CAN JUST IMAGINE IF YOU KNOW YOU KNOW SOME GUY BEING ON DRUGS THEY GO THERE AND .
RIGHT .
AND YOU KNOW YOU VE GOT SOMEBODY THAT S SUPPOSED TO TAKE CARE OF YOU AND THEY FALL THEY FALL OUT BECAUSE OF THE DRUG ISSUE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW I MEAN YOU CAN FORGIVE SOMEBODY BECAUSE ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY MAYBE GET HURT OR WHATEVER THAT THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BUT THE MUMBLEX USE OF DRUGS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT .
RIGHT .
WILL UH BE A PROBLEM .
GO AHEAD YOU GOT ME MORE I THIS IS THIS IS A TOUGH ONE I DO NT REALLY HAVE NT THOUGHT ABOUT ANY OF THIS .
THEY HAD GARDENING YESTERDAY AND ALL THE REPAIRS AND BOY I COULD .
HI THIS IS JUDY I M FROM MARYLAND AND I M IN CALIFORNIA VISITING RIGHT NOW .
HI JUDY THIS IS NORMA AND I LIVE IN VIRGINIA .
OH OKAY .
WE GOT A GREAT TOPIC .
I KNOW I M SITTING HERE GOING OH DEAR .
SHOULD WE GIVE IT A TRY .
I GUESS WE MIGHT AS WELL .
OKAY OKAY .
OKAY .
WELL UM SO .
LET YOU START .
SO SO WHAT CHANGES HAVE YOU SEEN .
WHAT CHANGES UH .
I GUESS THE BIGGEST I DO NT KNOW YOUR AGE JUDY BUT UH IN MY LIFETIME THE BIGGEST IS IN MORE WOMEN WORKING .
WELL ACTUALLY .
DEFINITELY .
THAT S WHAT I WAS THINKING TOO .
YEAH .
AND UM YOU KNOW JUST TO JUMP AHEAD A LITTLE BIT BUT THEN WE CAN BACK UP IS IT PERHAPS WOMAN IN POLITICS IS FOR THE FUTURE .
FOR THE FUT WELL YEAH .
BECAUSE I DO NT SEE THAT REALLY YET IN POSITIONS OF POWER REALLY .
RIGHT I DO NT SEE THEM IN POSITIONS OF POWER IN CORPORATION EITHER .
UHHUH .
NOT MANY .
THAT S TRUE THAT S TRUE UM DO YOU WORK IN PRIVATE CORPORATION OR GOVERNMENT .
I DID WORK IN GOVERNMENT .
UHHUH .
AND BEFORE THAT I WORKED IN A BANK FOR EIGHT YEARS .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND NOW I M RETIRED .
OH YOU .
THAT S THE BEST STATUS .
THAT S RIGHT .
YES UM I DO NT I SEE UM AND .
WHICH DO YOU WORK IN EXCUSE ME .
A GOVERNMENT .
A GOVERNMENT .
AND I WORK IN ACADEMIA BEFORE .
UHHUH .
AND UM ACTUALLY THERE S ONE UM WOMAN IN OUR I DO NT KNOW WHAT YOU D CALL IT UH INSTITUTE WHO IS A MANAGER AND I MEAN IN A SINCE PERHAPS UM A LOT OF SHE GETS PROTECTED A LOT BECAUSE IT S ALMOST LIKE A TOKEN .
OH .
AND AND IT S SORT OF UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE I THINK THAT THEY DO NT ACCEPT HER TECHNICALLY AND BUT SHE S A GOOD PAPER PUSHER .
UHHUH .
AND IT S IN A TECHNICAL POSITION REALLY AND YOU KNOW SHE SHOULD BE MORE TECHNICAL FOR WHAT SHE DOES .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK THAT S SORT OF UNFORTUNATE .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE IT DOES NT IT DOES NT REALLY HELP THE CAUSE IN THE LONG RUN .
BUT UM YOU KNOW I DO NT KNOW AND AND TEACHING I STILL SEE THAT THAT S WHERE MOST OF THE WOMAN ARE .
IN TEACHING .
IN TEACHING AND YOU KNOW AND IT S ALWAYS BEEN THAT WAY .
BUT NOT AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL .
RIGHT NOT WELL .
WE LIVE IN A COLLEGE TOWN AND I WORKED AT THE UNIVERSITY FOR A WHILE .
UHHUH .
AND THERE ARE THERE ARE WOMAN THERE BUT THEY RE NOT THE HIGH PAID .
UHHUH NOT DEPARTMENT .
PROFESSORS THAT .
CHAIRMEN .
THE MEN ARE .
YEAH NOT THE DEANS AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
WELL THEY DID HAVE ONE WOMAN DEAN BUT AND I GUESS SHE SHE PROBABLY DID VERY WELL BUT THAT S THE MINORITY .
UHHUH UHHUH UM AND DO YOU THINK IT S BECAUSE WOMEN ARE NT QUALIFIED OR OR JUST DO NT OR DO NT WANT THE JOB OR JUST ARE NT HIRED FOR THE JOBS .
NONE OF THE ABOVE .
I THINK THEY ARE EXTREMELY WELL QUALIFIED .
UHHUH .
UH I DO NT KNOW HOW .
THEY RE JUST NOT SELECTED SOMEHOW .
I THINK THEY RE NOT SELECTED .
UHHUH .
AND OF COURSE AT THIS UNIVERSITY UH THIS IT S A BIG ENGINEERING SCHOOL AND I DO NT THINK THERE ARE MANY WOMEN IN THE ENGINEERING COLLEGE .
UHHUH .
AND THAT S WHERE THE HIGH PAY IS .
OH OKAY BUT I M WONDERING HOW MANY WOMEN ACTUALLY MAJOR IN ENGINEERING ACT BUT YOU KNOW I SAY THAT BUT YET I KNOW TOO .
QUITE AN WELL I THINK THERE ARE MORE THAN THERE USED TO BE .
YEAH I M SURE THERE ARE YEAH .
BUT THEY MAY NOT GO INTO TEACHING .
UHHUH YEAH I MEAN THE TWO THAT I KNOW OBVIOUSLY ARE NOT IN TEACHING BUT .
UHHUH .
UM IT S IT I SUPPOSE IN A SINCE I WAS SURPRISED WHEN THEY TOLD ME THEY MAJORED IN ENGINEERING I DO NT KNOW WHY I BUT I DO NT KNOW THAT MANY MEN THAT HAVE MAJORED IN ENGINEERING .
UHHUH .
EITHER I MEAN IT S JUST BECAUSE I M IN THE HUMANITIES IT S JUST .
OH UHHUH .
YOU KNOW IT S NOT .
YEAH .
IT S NOT SOMETHING THAT I TEND TO HEAR ABOUT .
UHHUH .
BUT UM YEAH IT S A .
WELL I MET ONE ONE DAY THAT UH HAD JUST JOINED THE FACULTY IN AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING AND THAT REALLY SURPRISED ME .
OH THAT S INTERESTING .
UHHUH .
YEAH YEAH I MEAN I I SUPPOSE THAT THAT IT S DIFFICULT TO REALLY SAY WHY BECAUSE UH YOU KNOW THERE THERE PROBABLY ARE A LIMITED NUMBER OF WOMEN WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THE SUBJECT AND WELL QUALIFIED .
UHHUH .
AND MAYBE THERE ARE NT YOU KNOW MAYBE THEY DO NT APPLY FOR THE JOB .
I DO NT KNOW I DO NT I DO NT KNOW HOW MANY GO ON AND GET A P H D IN ENGINEERING .
RIGHT RIGHT WHICH COULD BE YOU KNOW PART PARTIALLY CULTURAL ANYWAY .
THAT COULD BE THAT S TRUE .
SO THAT IT MIGHT BE CIRCULARLY BEING THE SAME PROBLEM OF OF EXPECTING NOT TO GET HIRED FOR THE GOOD JOBS ANYWAY .
UHHUH .
SO WHY SPEND YOUR TIME GETTING QUALIFIED .
THAT S RIGHT .
IT S A IT S A ROUGH .
IT S A ROUGH A ROUGH SITUATION UM AND I GUESS WHAT I WHAT AMA AMAZES ME IS THE NUMBER OF MEN WHO ARE WILLING TO STAY HOME WITH THE KIDS OR AND IN OUR CASE WE ACTUALLY HAVE ONE FATHER WHO WORKS PARTTIME A SIX .
OH .
HOUR DAY SO THAT HE CAN TAKE THE KIDS KIDS OR KID I M NOT SURE .
THAT S INTERESTING .
TO SCHOOL IN THE MORNING AND BE HOME WHEN THE CHILDREN OR CHILD .
COMES HOME IN THE AFTERNOON .
IS IT UH WAS SHE THE MAJOR WAGE EARNER .
THIS IS UH .
I MEAN DID SHE EARN MORE MONEY THAT HE DID OR .
WELL SEE .
YOU KNOW .
I DO NT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE FAMILY BUT BUT YEAH I WOULD IMAGINE SHE MIGHT UM BECAUSE HE S YOU KNOW HE S A REALLY NICE GUY BUT HE DID SAY THAT BECAUSE HE WAS IN THE HUMANITIES AND HE S NOW WORKING IN MORE OF A TECHNICAL SITUATION THAT HE HAD TROUBLE FINDING A JOB .
OH UHHUH .
SO THAT MAYBE HE YOU KNOW MAYBE SHE WAS MORE QUALIFIED BUT BUT STILL IT S INTERESTING THAT YOU KNOW HE .
UHHUH .
HE S BEEN DOING THIS EVIDENTLY FOR A A GOOD NUMBER OF YEARS .
AND UH BUT IT S UNUSUAL .
UH I KNOW ONE UH GAL THAT S SHE S A C P A AND HER HUSBAND IS A HOUSE HUSBAND .
UHHUH YEAH I .
AND THEN THEY HAD A CHILD AND HE HE WAS STILL THE HOUSE HUSBAND HE WAS NT .
OH HE WAS .
GOING TO .
EVEN BEFORE THEY HAD CHILDREN .
UHHUH EVEN BEFORE THAT RIGHT .
OH NOW THAT THAT REALLY IS .
SHE WAS A LITTLE PERTURBED ABOUT IT .
OH SHE WAS .
AT ONE TIME .
UHHUH .
I DO NT KNOW HOW SHE S MOVED AWAY I DO NT KNOW HOW IT IS NOW BUT I KNOW UH WE RE WE ALL WENT OUT ONE EVENING AND AFTER WORK AND UH SHE WAS THERE WAS AN UNDERLYING NOTE SHE WAS PERTURBED ABOUT IT .
UHHUH YEAH I MEAN I THINK THAT WOULD BE IT WOULD IT WOULD STRIKE ONE AS STRANGE IF THERE S NO REASON FOR .
UHHUH .
SOMEBODY TO STAY HOME THAT .
I DO NT THINK THERE WAS A VALID REASON .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
BECAUSE HER STATEMENT WAS I TOLD HIM LET S FACE IT YOU RE A HOUSE HUSBAND THAT S WHAT YOUR GOING THAT S WHAT YOU LL ALWAYS BE .
BUT BUT YET YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IF IF SHE HAD OFFERED TO STAY HOME WE WOULD NT HAVE THOUGHT ANYTHING STRAN .
SHE WOULD NT HAVE BE THAT S RIGHT UHHUH THAT S RIGHT .
SO SO WE RE .
IT WOULD IT WOULD NT HAVE BEEN A DOUBTER .
CARRYING OUR OWN PREJUDICE .
UHHUH THAT S TRUE .
YEAH OH GEE .
I GUESS WE CA NT WIN .
HUHUH OH .
BECAUSE IF YEAH IF IF SOMEBODY DOES IF AND BREAKS TRADITION YOU RE SURPRISED BUT IF .
THAT S RIGHT .
OH DEAR SO SO .
I THINK MAYBE MORE MEN WOULD LIKE TO BE IF THEY .
IF THEY COULD GET AWAY WITH IT .
WERE NT PUT DOWN SO BADLY .
OH DEAR YOU KNOW WELL UH I MEAN IT IT S AN INTERESTING TOPIC YET I MUST SAY IT S NOT ONE THAT I VE GIVEN A GREAT DEAL OF .
HUHUH .
OF THOUGHT TO BUT UH .
NO I DID NT .
IN THE PAST IT S UM ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW SEEMS TO HAPPEN .
HOW DO YOU FEEL YOUR CAREER HAS GONE .
I DO NT I DO NT FEEL FOR THE MOST PART THAT I VE BEEN DISCRIMINATED AGAINST .
YOU DO NT THAT S GOOD .
NO I WAS A DEPARTMENT CHAIRMAN I BUT I DO NT LIKE ADMINISTRATION .
OH .
SO THEN I M UH UH PROBABLY A POOR EXAMPLE ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW I WAS AN ADMINISTRATOR AND COULD STILL BE I SUPPOSE .
UHHUH I WAS DISCRIMINATED AGAINST VERY DEFINITELY IN BANKING .
UHHUH .
IT WAS TERRIBLE .
OH REALLY YOU WERE YOU WERE MORE AMBITIOUS THAN THEY WOULD LET YOU BE .
RIGHT AND THE MONEY DID NT GO WITH THE POSITIONS .
YEAH YEAH WELL I WOULD .
THE PROMOTION PROMOTIONS CAME BUT THERE WER THERE COMPARABLE PAY FOR THE RESPONSIBILITY .
UH .
AND I WAS TOLD YOU DO NT NEED AS MUCH PAY AS I HAVE BECAUSE YOUR CHILDREN ARE OLDER THAN MY CHILDREN OR YOUR HUSBAND HAS A GOOD JOB AND .
OH JEEZ .
YEAH ACTUALLY IN A SINCE I SUPPOSE WHEN I WAS HIRED INTO THE GOVERNMENT UM AT I WAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF AND AND THAT S TRUE THAT YOU KNOW SOMETIMES OTHER PEOPLE GET GET HIGHER INCREMENTS .
I THI UHHUH .
FOR YOU KNOW EVEN .
I THINK WE UH ARE PROGRAMMED TO JUST TAKE IT .
RIGHT .
AS IT COMES .
RIGHT THAT S PROBABLY TRUE I HAD NT I HAD NT THOUGHT ABOUT IT BECAUSE I DO LIKE WHAT I DO AND .
UHHUH .
UH I JUST SORT OF IGNORE THE ADMINISTRATIVE .
UHHUH .
PART OF IT SINCE I DID NT LIKE IT WHEN WHEN I HAD TO DO IT .
SO I I FIGURE YOU KNOW NOBODY MUST UH NOBODY MUST LIKE IT IT MUST BE A ROTTEN JOB FOR EVERYBODY .
BUT I KNOW SOME PEOPLE THRIVE ON IT OH GEE WELL SINCE I DO NT HAVE A WHOLE LOT MORE TO SAY ON THE TOPIC .
I DO NT .
OKAY SO .

AND WHAT .
YOU READ TO THEM .
WHEN MY CHILDREN WER WERE YOUNGER OF COURSE THEY WERE ALL MARRIED AND GROWN AND I HAVE GRANDCHILDREN NOW THEY WERE UH I I READ TO THEM .
A LOT .
THAT S GOOD .
AND UH I THINK THEY VE ALL DEVELOPED KIND OF AN INTEREST IN READING ALSO .
THAT S RE YEAH .
I M NOT SAYING THEY READ ALL THE RIGHT THINGS BUT THEY DO READ .
UH WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE DO NT HAVE ANY INTEREST IN IT AT ALL AND I THINK IT S IMPORTANT .
OH YEAH .
BECAUSE UH EVEN TODAY WHERE PEOPLE ARE SO ILLITERATE AND THEY GO OFF TO SCHOOL AND REALLY NOTHING HAPPENS I MEAN THEY DO NT LEARN ANYTHING .
IT .
S BECAUSE THEY CA NT READ .
YEAH IT S REALLY SURPRISING HOW MANY PEOPLE GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL .
YEAH .
AND THAT I WORK WITH AND PEOPLE I MEAN I GET MEMOS ALL THE TIME ACROSS MY DESK AND THINGS ARE MISSPELLED AND .
OH IT S BE UNBELIEVABLE .
IT S REALLY .
IS NT IT .
IT S PRETTY SAD .
YEAH .
A LOT OF PEOPLE .
THAT WORK FOR ME .
THAT CA NT EVEN SPELL OR READ YOU KNOW .
EXACTLY AND I THINK THAT THAT S WHY READING IS SO IMPORTANT .
YEAH .
BECAUSE UH I THINK EVEN MENTALLY WHEN YOU CAN DO SOME .
UH WELL WHAT WOULD YOU SAY YOUR OPINION IS ON GUN CONTROL .
WELL I DO NT KNOW I VE I VE HAD MIXED EMOTIONS I GUESS WHEN I LISTEN TO UH THE RADIO AND AND WATCH T V ABOUT THE DIFFERENT UH THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING UH I M AGAINST IT BUT ON THE SAME TOKEN UH I WENT OUT AND PURCHASED A GUN JUST BECAUSE I WANTED THE RIGHT TO DO THAT .
YE .
SO I I HAVE A RIFLE IN THE HOUSE UH THE AMMUNITION IS PROBABLY SO OLD I M AFRAID TO USE IT BUT UH I BOUGHT IT FOR TARGET PRACTICING AND UH AND ALSO BECAUSE I WANTED A WEAPON UH HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IT .
WELL I THINK UH DOWN HERE IN TEXAS THEY DO NT HAVE A WAITING PERIOD ON HANDGUNS .
HUH .
AND I THINK THEY NEED THAT UH AND I DO HAVE A I HAVE A PISTOL IT S A LITTLE TWENTYTWO AND I HAVE A TWENTYTWO OR A TWELVE GAUGE SHOTGUN .
UHHUH .
AN YOU KNOW I DO LIKE TO HAVE MY GUNS .
UH I DO NT KNOW IF I LL EVER USE IT YOU KNOW AND LIKE YOU MY BULLETS TO MY LITTLE PISTOL S PROBABLY UH ABOUT THREE YEARS OLD UH MY GUN HAS NT BEEN SHOT IN A YEAR OR TWO .
UHHUH .
BUT UH I LIKE TO HAVE THEM WHERE HANDY .
WELL UP UH UP IN NEW ENGLAND WHERE I M FROM UH YOU HAD TO GET A PERMIT BEFORE YOU COULD BUY ANY AMU AM AMMUNITION AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS REALLY GOOD AND I THINK IF THEY UH .
TAKES TWO WEEKS FOR THAT SYSTEM TO PROCESS UH YOUR REQUEST FOR UH NOT AS A GUN PERMIT BUT UH BUT TO BUY AMMUNITION YOU HAVE TO GET A PERMIT FROM THE POLICE STATION IN YOUR LOCAL AREA TO DO THAT .
I VE NEVER HEARD OF ANYTHING LIKE THAT .
YEAH UH .
THAT WOULD BE NICE BUT .
A YOU KNOW THE CRIMINALS THAT ARE GOING TO GET THEIR GUNS ONE .
I .
WAY OR THE OTHER .
I I AGREE I THINK YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IS UH TO TO STOP THE IMPULSE BUYER FROM UH BUYING IT QUICKLY AND AND UH .
MAYBE PUTTING A WEEK S WAITING PERIOD OR SOMETHING ON IT BUT IF SOMEONE S REALLY DETERMINED TO TO PICK UP A FIREARM YOU CAN PICK IT UP ANY PLACE .
YEAH .
AND YOU CAN GET THEM REALLY CHEAP .
I KNOW I I HAD A WAITING PERIOD ON MY PISTOL BECAUSE I WAS DOWN IN UH TENNESSEE .
UHHUH .
AND UH THEY HAD A WAITING PERIOD AND UH WE BOUGHT IT THERE AND .
HOW LONG WAS THE WAITING PERIOD OUT THERE .
ABOUT NINE DAYS .
HUH THAT WAS NT TOO TOO BAD .
NO NO .
BECAUSE IF IF YOU RE GOING TO GO BUY SOMETHING UH UH OF THAT NATURE I THINK YOU YOU RE GOING TO HAVE SOME IDEA AS TO WHAT YOU RE GOING TO DO WITH IT YOU RE NOT GOING TO REACT THAT QUICKLY IN OTHER WORDS YOU KNOW YOU DO NT HAVE A NEED TO GO BUY A GUN TO GO SHOOT IT THE NEXT DAY .
TH SOMEBODY WANTS TO DO THAT I I AT TIMES I THINK THEY OUGHT TO HAVE A WAITING PERIOD ON ALL FIREARMS .
YEAH I DO TOO UH BECAUSE IT DOES NT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE UH UH WHETHER IT S A PISTOL OR A SHOTGUN I SUPPOSE THEY BOTH DO THE SAME KIND OF JOB .
A SHOTGUN HURTS WORSE THAN A PISTOL DOES .
UH YEAH I SUPPOSE I NEVER GOT SHOT WITH EITHER ONE BUT I DO NT KNOW UH I THINK YOU COULD RECOVER FROM A PISTOL BUT NOT FROM A SHOTGUN .
NO A SHOTGUN S GOT TOO MUCH OF A SPREAD OR AT .
YEAH .
LEAST OURS DOES UH IT S YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A LITTLE UH THING ON THE BO BOTTOM OF TH ON TOP OF THE BARREL .
UHHUH .
WHERE YOU YOU TURN IT YOU CAN MAKE IT EITHER TIGHT OR AS LOOSE AS LOOSE CAN GET .
OH .
AND THE SPREAD CHANGES .
UH I VE GOT A MANUAL SINGLE SHOT AND I GUESS IT DOES NT HAVE ANY ANY AUTOMATIC FEATURES TO IT THE FURTHER AWAY I GET THE THE UH WIDER THE SHOT GETS .
YEAH .
FROM THE TARGET AND THE CLOSER THAT I GET THE TIGHTER THAT IT GETS IT S GOT A HELL OF A KICK TO IT .
YEAH MY HUSBAND HAD A UH A POLICE GUN AT ONE TIME AND I SHOT THAT THING ONE TIME ALMOST KNOCKED ME DOWN .
AND IT JUST A LI I DON I FORGET I THINK IT WAS A THREE FIFTYSEVEN I M NOT SURE .
DO YOU BELONG TO A GUN CLUB OR YOU .
HE BELONGED TO ONE AWHILE BACK UH SINCE WE MOVED WE VE ONLY BEEN HERE IN TEXAS FOR ABOUT A YEAR .
UHHUH .
AND UH WE CA NT EVEN FIND A PLACE TO SHOOT JUST FOR .
NO KIDDING .
TARGET PRACTICE I D LOVE TO GET USED TO THAT SHOTGUN WE TRADED HIS PISTOL FOR THAT SHOTGUN .
HUH WELL THE THE UH CLUBS THAT WE VE GOT AROUND HERE ARE KIND OF EXPENSIVE BUT UH IT S WELL WORTH IT YOU CAN GO DOWN AND SHOOT UP AGAINST A SAND BAG AND SOME TARGETS AND HAVE UH COMPETITION UH I VE NEVER REALLY JOINED A CLUB BECAUSE I HAVE NT GOT THE TIME NOT BECAUSE I HAVE NT GOT THE DESIRE UH THERE S AN ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP FEE UH THAT S THAT S FAIRLY HIGH PLUS THERE S INI AN INITIATION FEE THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY BECAUSE OF FIRST TIME UH UH MEMBER .
SO THE WHOLE PROCESS CAN COST YOU A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS TO JOIN THE CLUB PLUS YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR THE THE AMMUNITION IN ANY TOURNAMENTS THAT YOU WOULD JOIN IN .
YEAH WELL THAT S WHAT MY HUSBAND WHEN HE WAS IN THAT GUN CLUB WHERE HE WAS DOING THAT IT YOU KNOW HE WENT MOSTLY JUST TO UH SHOOT AT PAPER TARGETS .
UHHUH .
UH BUT YOU KNOW THEY USED SPEED AND ACCURACY AND ALL THAT .
I THINK THAT THAT THE GUN CLUBS SERVE A USEFUL PURPOSE IN FACT I D LIKE TO SEE SOMEHOW THEY TIE THE LEGISLATION INTO NOT ONLY WHEN YOU BUY A WEAPON YOU HAVE TO UH SHOW THAT YOU VE GONE TO SCHOOL OR GONE TO SOME CLASS TO KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THAT WEAPON .
THAT S A GOOD I VE NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT .
THAT S A GOOD POINT .
AND YOU KNOW IT IT EVEN AFTER YOU WAIT YOUR NINE DAYS IF YOU DO NT KNOW HOW TO HANDLE IT IT S JUST LIKE PUTTING SOMEONE IN AN AUTOMOBILE THAT DOES NT KNOW HOW TO DRIVE AND YOU GIVE HIM A LICENSE BECAUSE HE WAITED NINE DAYS .
YEAH THAT S AND YEAH .
HE COULD HE COULD NOT ONLY UH UH SHOOT HIMSELF HE COULD HE COULD UH MISHANDLE A WEAPON LEAVE IT AT HOME AND LET A CHILD GET AT IT .
IT WELL WE UH WE WAS LIVING ON A NAVY BASE DOWN IN MEMPHIS AND UH THIS ONE GUY DECIDED TO PLAY UH LONESOME COWBOY OR SOMETHING AND HE WAS TWIRLING HIS GUN AROUND AND SHOT HIMSELF IN HIS FOOT .
WOW HE WAS FORTUNATE HE COULD HE COULD OF HIT SOMETHING ELSE .
WELL HE WENT TUMBLING DOWN THE STEPS ALONG WITH UH SHOOTING HIS FOOT ALMOST OFF HE BROKE HIS LEG AND .
WOW .
COLLAR BONE AND A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS I M SURE BEING .
MISTER COWBOY I CA NT REMEMBER WHAT THE NA THE TERM WAS GOING AROUND IT WAS ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS AGO .
BUT NOW I GUESS THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA .
ABOUT UH PRIVATE CITIZENS SELLING A WEAPONS LIKE IF YOU WANTED TO SELL YOUR PISTOL TO ME HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT DO YOU BELIEVE THERE OUGHT TO BE LEGISLATION GUIDING THE UH BUYER AND THE SELLER AND OR DO YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO SELL YOUR SYSTEM UH .
BECAUSE YOU OWN IT .
UH THAT S A HARD ONE BECAUSE WE DID THAT BUT UH I THINK THERE OUGHT TO BE SOME RULE AGAINST IT I LL UH YOU KNOW THE PERSON WHO SELLS THE GUN OUGHT TO PROTECT THEMSELVES BECAUSE IF THAT GUN S REGISTERED TO THEM AND SOMEBODY ELSE USES THAT GUN IN SOMETHING THE COPS ARE GOING TO COME TO YOU .
YEAH I IS NT .
UH .
THERE A WAY TO UH TO DEREGISTER YOURSELF AFTER YOU REGISTER A GUN .
I HAVE NO IDEA I VE ONLY .
BECAUSE I .
HAD ONE GUN AND I VE KEPT IT YOU .
HAVE .
KNOW THE ONE GUN THAT WAS IN MY NAME .
YEAH IS IT REGISTERED .
YEAH I .
THE UH THE RIFLE THAT I VE GOT IS NOT REGISTERED .
AND UH I DO NT KNOW WHY I NEVER REGISTERED IT BUT THE UH .
I DO NT THINK YOU HAVE TO REGISTER A SHOTGUN .
UM I I THINK IT S IT S VOLUNTARY THE UH THE .
WELL SEE UH MY HUSBAND HAS A THING IF THEY GO TO UH REGULATING UH ALL RIGHT UH BANNING GUNS PRI PRI PRI PRIVATE CIT CITIZENS .
YEAH .
THIS MY KID IS JUMPING ON ME I CA NT HARDLY TALK .
MY HUSBAND FEELS THAT THEY LL COME AND COLLECT EVERYBODY S GUNS .
YEAH I GUESS THAT COULD HAPPEN IT S JUST LIKE THE UH THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM ONCE THEY UH THEY GAVE EVERYBODY A NUMBER AND NOW THEY RE MAKING YOU UH UH GET ONE AT AT BIRTH .
AND .
YEAH .
ONCE THEY HAVE YOUR NUMBER THEY HAVE YOUR IDENTIFICATION AND IF YOU TRY TO DO ANYTHING UH LIKE UH NOT IDENTIFY YOURSELF TO THE GOVERNMENT THEY KNOW WHO YOU ARE .
YEAH AND EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU .
AND THAT S TRUE .
UH I BU BU YOU KNOW THEY KNOW SO HOW MUCH MONEY YOU MAKE A WEEK TO UH PROBABLY YOUR UH MY KID IS BANGING I WAS SEEING WHAT THEY WAS BANGING ON UH I VE LOST MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT I M SORRY .
THAT S ALL RIGHT YOU YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT UH UH .
OH THE SOC .
FED WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT KNOWS ABOUT PEOPLE .
YEAH THEY THEY PROBABLY KNOW EVERYTHING FROM HALF THE TIME WH HO WHAT TIME YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM .
THEY PROBABLY DO .
NO THAT S THAT S A LITTLE BIT EXTREME BUT THEY COULD KNOW ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU AND UH I D LIKE TO HAVE MY GUN IF THEY GO TO BANDING BANNING THEM I D LOSE MY GUN BUT WE WOULD NT LOSE OUR PIS OUR UH SHOTGUN .
YEAH .
AND UH WE RE WANTING TO GET A COUPLE OF MORE THAT NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT .
UHHUH .
BUT I DO NT I DO NT UH .

YOU CALL WE SOLD A REFRIGERATOR THROUGH IT AND IT TOOK US ALL OF TWELVE HOURS .
TO SELL THE REFRIGERATOR .
YEAH .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW AND I M SURE IT D BE EVEN LESS FOR SOMEBODY WITH A GOOD GUN .
HUH AND I THINK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS UH IS REALLY FAR AWAY FROM UH UH CONTROL I I DO NT BELIEVE IN UH I M S I SHOULD NT PROBABLY SAY CONTROL I MEAN REGULATION CONTROL IS SOMETHING THAT I WOULD NT WANT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO HAVE UH BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM HAVE A MONITORING CAPABILITY SO THAT THEY KNOW WHO HAS WHAT WEAPONS .
YEAH WELL I AGREE WITH YOU THERE THEY DO HAVE TOO MUCH CONTROL OVER US ALREADY .
YEAH .
UH WE COULD LOOK AT OUR PAYCHECKS AND SEE HOW MUCH CONTROL THEY HAVE .
UNFORTUNATELY WE UH WE VOTE FOR THE THE PEOPLE WHO SPEND THE MONEY SO I CA NT COMPLAIN TOO MUCH .
YEAH I GUESS SO I DO NT KNOW THEY RE .
OKAY .
ALL RIGHT I HAD TO REGISTER US IN THERE HOPEFULLY YOU RE A BASKETBALL FAN .
EXCUSE ME .

SINCE YOU RE BEING YOU CAN TALK FOR HOURS GO AHEAD YOU YOU IF YOU LIKE SPORTS GO RIGHT AHEAD WITH THIS ONE .
UM WELL I KNOW LIKE WHAT YOU JUST SAID UM PURDUE HAD TO HAD TO UH THEIR BEST PLAYER THIS YEAR YOU KNOW AVERAGED TWENTY POINTS A GAME .

THEY HAD TO MAKE HIM SIT THE BENCH AND ACTUALLY KICKED HIM OFF THE TEAM BECAUSE UM HIS UH GRADES EVEN THOUGH THEY PASSED BIG TEN STANDINGS AND THEY PASSED YOU KNOW N C DOUBLE A THEY WERE NT THEY DID NOT PASS UM PURDUE REQUIREMENTS AND SO .
THAT S SURPRISING THAT THEY THAT THEY HAVE BETTER REQUIREMENTS THAT S GOOD .
YEAH .
THAT S WHAT I LIKE TO SEE GO AHEAD .

I M ALL FOR THAT .
SO HE WAS TREATED LIKE ALL THE REST OF STUDENTS YOU KNOW .
THAT S GREAT .
AND SO UM THEIR VERY BEST PLAYER THEY PROBABLY LOST OVER HALF THEIR GAMES BECAUSE YOU KNOW BY TWENTY POINTS WHICH IS WHAT HE AVERAGED UM AND SO YOU KNOW HE HAD TO SIT YOU KNOW HE WAS KICKED OFF THE TEAM AND THEN THEY VE GOT THREE PLAYERS TOP YOU KNOW RECRUITING CLASS THIS YEAR THAT THEY RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE WELL THE THE PREP SCHOOL THEY GO TO BEFORE THEY CAN PLAY .
OH .
BECAUSE THEY ARE NT SMART ENOUGH .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW IT S JUST SAD BECAUSE I MEAN PURDUE EVEN THOUGH THEY RE ONE OF THE FEW SCHOOLS THAT REALLY UH STRESS ACADEMICS THEY RE SUFFERING YOU KNOW AND .
OH I I AGREE I THINK THAT THAT THERE S A LOT OF INCONSISTENCIES WHEN SOME CONFERENCE UH PLAYERS COME FROM OUTSIDE OF TEXAS YOU KNOW AND PLAY US HERE UH THEY RE OBVIOUSLY PRACTICING SIXTY HOURS A WEEK YOU KNOW AND THERE S NO CONSISTENCY SEEMS TO ME THAT LIKE PURDUE WHEN THEY RE TRYING A STUDENT ATHLETE IS SPENDING SO MANY HOURS IN CLASS HE ONLY HAS TWENTY TWENTYFIVE WHATEVER HOURS HE HAS TO SPEND ON PRACTICE .
YEAH .
HE SHOULD BE PLAYING THEY ALL SHOULD BE PLAYING ANOTHER TEAM THAT THAT HAS ABOUT TWENTY HOURS TO PRACTICE A WEEK .
LIKE .
BUT THERE ARE TEAMS THAT PRACTICE SIXTY HOURS A WEEK THEY RE NOT GOING TO CLASS AT ALL I MEAN THAT S THAT S .
YEAH .
WHAT I MEAN BY SEMIPRO THERE S TOO MANY SEMIPROS IN COLLEGE AND I THINK THEY OUGHT TO GET RID OF THAT .
THAT S WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS GUY I MEAN HE WAS UH HE DID NT GO TO CLASS AND SO THEY JUST SAID YOU KNOW YOU CA NT MAKE THE GRADES YOU RE GOING TO HAVE TO SEE YOU LATER .
WELL I M ALL FOR I M ALL FOR THE OH BASEBALL HAS A UH A UH MINOR LEAGUE SYSTEM AND I THINK THAT THE FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL THEY ASKED US TO TALK ABOUT BASKETBALL SHOULD YOU KNOW LET LET THEM GO HAVE A SEMIPRO TEAM BUT I THINK I D LIKE TO SEE COLLEGE ATHLETES LET S TALK ABOUT COLLEGE BASKETBALL I LIKE THAT .

AND I SAW PRINCETON I THINK IT WAS OR HARVARD PLAY THIS YEAR THEY RE LIKE ALL WHITE AND THEIR STARTING GUARD HAD S A T SCORES OF FIFTEEN HUNDRED .
UHHUH .
AND IT WAS SO FUNNY TO WATCH THEM PLAY AGAINST THE OTHER TEAMS BECAUSE IT WAS LIKE THEY PLAYED SO MUCH SMARTER AND MORE DISCIPLINED .
YEAH .
I DO NT KNOW IF THEY WON VERY MANY GAMES BUT I DO NT KNOW THEIR STYLE OF PLAY WAS SO MUCH DIFFERENT FROM .
YEAH .
FROM THE TEAMS THAT JUST RUN AND GUN .
YEAH I LIKE HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL WHICH AGAIN IS NOT THE SUBJECT BUT THAT S SO MUCH FUN TO WATCH BECAUSE THEY RE THEY RE PURE AMATEURS YOU KNOW AND THERE S NO MONEY INVOLVED .
YEAH .
YOU GO TO COLLEGE YOU DO NT REALLY KNOW IT LOSES IT SOMEWHERE .
YEAH .
WHATEVER SPORT IT IS IF THEY RE REALLY PUTTING A LOT OF MONEY IN THESE PLAYERS LET S FACE IT NINETY PERCENT ARE BEING PAID SO .

I WISH IT D RETURN TO THE GOOD OLD DAYS OF THE AMATEUR EVERYBODY PLAY THAT S WHAT I LIKE EVERYBODY SHOULD PLAY YOU KNOW .
I M KIND OF RACIST I GUESS WHEN I SAY I LIKE TO SEE THE WHITE GUYS DO WELL YOU KNOW INSTEAD OF THE RUN AND GUN ALL THE TIME .

IN FAC .

THERE S JUST SO MUCH PRESSURE ON THE SCHOOLS I THINK TO WIN THOUGH YOU KNOW .
TO WIN AND MONEY YEAH .
YEAH AND YOU KNOW IT S LIKE IF THEY DO NT WIN THEY DO NT GET ANY MONEY SO AND THE SCHOOL SUFFERS WHICH IS KIND OF BAD BUT THAT S JUST HOW IT ALWAYS IS .

REALLY .
IT JUST SEEMS SO SAD TO HAVE TO ONLY RELY ON YOU KNOW COLLEGE FOOTBALL IS THAT ALL THEY RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE MONEY YOU KNOW .

UHHUH .
AND THEN I LIKE THE THEY HAVE A NEW ONE NOW .
THE STAR TREK .
THE NEXT GENERATION .
RIGHT .
WHICH .
IT S AN ALL NEW CAST BUT KIND OF THE SAME IDEA GOING OUT TO NEW PLACES AND AND DOING NEW THINGS AND FINDING OUT ABOUT DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND I VE I VE ALWAYS LIKED THAT SHOW PROBABLY THE VERY BEST .
UHHUH .
I THINK I VE ACTUALLY SEEN A NUMBER OF STAR TREKS ONE WAY OR ANOTHER OVER THE YEARS .
UH ALTHOUGH I NEVER WATCHED IT REGULARLY .
I M CERTAINLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHARACTER .
UHHUH .
THE CHARACTERS .
AND THEN I VE SEEN SOME OF THE STAR TREK MOVIES .
YEAH THOSE THE MOVIES ARE GOOD TOO .
AND I I GUESS ALL MOST OF THE SHOWS I LIKE ARE ARE KIND OF ALONG THE SAME LINE BECAUSE THEY RE ALL ADVENTURE .
UHHUH .
WHEN I WHEN I STARTED THINKING ABOUT THIS THAT THOSE ARE SOME OF MY FAVORITE SHOWS MCGYVER BECAUSE IT S IT S ONLY ONE PERSON THERE MORE THAN UH YOU KNOW INSTEAD OF A CAST .
UHHUH .
OF PEOPLE BUT HE S ALWAYS GOING OUT AND INVENTING NEW THINGS OUT OF SCRAP AND GRABBING WHAT .
HE CAN AND YOU KNOW PIECES OF BALING WIRE AND AND A FEW TIRES AND ALL OF A SUDDEN .
HE .
S GOT A HANG GLIDER AND .
I DO NT THINK I I VE EVEN HEARD OF THAT SHOW .
YOU HAVE NT .
IT S CALLED MCGYVER .
UHHUH .
AND WHAT IS WHAT IS HE .
HE .
S LIKE A SEMIGOVERNMENT TYPE AGENT .
WHO GOES OUT THEN TO UH WORKS FOR THE PHOENIX FOUNDATION SUPPOSEDLY .
UHHUH .
AND UH H HIS BIG THING IS THAT HE CAN TAKE PIECES OF LITTLE BITS AND PIECES OF STRING AND BALING WIRE AND TURN THEM INTO FANTASTIC DIFFERENT THINGS .
HE TOOK A CAR BATTERY AND SOME WIRE AND TWO WASHERS ONE TIME AND MADE A WELDER .
UHHUH .
SO HE HE DOES ALL KINDS OF STRANGE THINGS LIKE THAT .
OH GREAT .
BOEING OUGHT TO HIRE HIM AND GIVE HIM .
A JUNKYARD .
YEAH .
AND SEE IF HE COULD BUILD A SEVEN FORTYSEVEN OUT OF IT .
SEE WHAT .
WE CAN COME UP WITH .
DO YOU LIKE THE UH NEWS SHOWS TWENTY TWENTY SIXTY MINUTES THOSE KIND OF THINGS .
WELL UH I USED TO WATCH SIXTY MINUTES AS A MATTER OF FACT AND UH AND I USED TO LIKE THE SHOW VERY MUCH .
UHHUH .
BUT UNFORTUNATELY I FIND GETTING RID OF YOUR T V SET YOU DO THROW OUT SOME SOME OF THE BABY .
SOME OF THE .
WITH THE BATH WATER .
LITTLE THINGS YEAH .
AND UH I JUST DECIDED I HAD TO DO THAT .
I THINK IN PART BECAUSE IT WAS EASY FOR ME TO BECOME ADDICTED TO IT I MEAN I COULD JUST SIT MINDLESSLY IN FRONT OF A T V SET FOR HOURS .
UH .
AND I JUST REALIZED I WAS SORT OF LIKE AN ALCOHOLIC IF I DID NT GET THE BOOZE OUT OF THE HOUSE I WAS GOING TO DRINK .
OH .
SO .
I GUESS I HAVE NT EVER HAD ANY TROUBLE WITH THAT .
I HAVE MORE OR LESS I HAVE MY FAVORITE SHOWS AND I USUALLY MAKE TIME IN MY DAY OR MY WEEK YOU KNOW TO WATCH THOSE .
YEAH .
BUT FOR THE MOST PART I TRY I HAVE SMALL KIDS AND I TRY AND KEEP IT ON JUST A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF TIME REALLY WHEN THEY RE UP .
YEAH YEAH .
BECAUSE THEY RE I GUESS THAT THAT THAT FALLS MUMBLEX AND ONE OF MY OTHER FAVORITE SHOWS IS SESAME STREET BECAUSE OF THE KIDS .
I LIKE THAT REAL WELL .
RIGHT WELL WHEN MY KIDS WERE LITTLE I DID HAVE A T V SET AND I DID WATCH A LOT OF SESAME STREET AND A LOT OF ELECTRIC COMPANY AS WELL .
I DO NT THINK THEY HAVE THAT ON ANYMORE .
WELL THAT WOULD BE A SHAME .
I HAVE NT SEEN THE ELECTRIC COMPANY IN A LONG TIME .
I I REMEMBER IT WHEN I WAS YOUNGER OF YOU KNOW CATCHING IT ON P B S BUT UH I DO NT THINK THEY SHOW IT MUST BE IN MAYBE IT S IN IF IT WAS IN REPEATS BUT THEY RE NOT MAKING NEW ONES .
HUH .
I HAVE NT SEEN IT IN A LONG TIME .
BUT SESAME STREET IS STILL REALLY GOOD .
YEAH .
HOW ABOUT MISTER ROGERS IS HE STILL AROUND .
YES .
YEAH .
THEY STILL SHOW MISTER ROGERS .
I DO NT THINK HE S MAKING NEW ONES BUT THEY REPEAT ALL THE OLD ONES .
I SEE .
I SEE .
SO THAT S STILL A REAL GOOD SHOW TOO .
I THAT ONE TENDS TO COME ON EARLIER IN THE DAY THAN I WANT TO TURN THE T V ON .
UHHUH .
SESAME STREET COMES ON FROM LIKE NINE TO TEN WHICH IS A GOOD TIME AND EVERYBODY IS UP AND HAD BREAKFAST AND DRESSED AND READY TO GO SO IT S THE TIMING OF OF IT IS GOOD BESIDES THE AMO WHAT S ON .
RIGHT .
I FIGURE YOUR CHILDREN ARE PRESCHOOL .
YES I HAVE TWO LITTLE ONES .
YEAH .
SO THEY LIKE THAT .
YEAH I SEEM TO REMEMBER THOSE SHOWS BEING ON IN THE AFTERNOON .
THEY COME ON BOTH .
THEY COME ON LIKE FROM NINE TO TEN AND THEN FROM UH FIVE TO SIX .
UHHUH OKAY .
THEY JUST REPEAT .
OKAY .
OVER AGAIN .
WHICH IS ALSO THAT S ANOTHER THING .
THAT S GOOD ABOUT IT WHEN IT COMES ON RIGHT IN THE DINNER HOUR .
I F CAN FEEL LIKE I CAN LET THEM SIT IN FRONT OF THE T V AND WATCH AND THEY RE WATCHING SOMETHING WORTHWHILE WHILE I CAN MAKE DINNER AND DO THINGS I NEED TO DO .
YEAH .
WITHOUT THEM UNDER FOOT .
YEAH LITTLE WITH LITTLE KIDS .
THE T V SET REALLY IS A I MEAN I USED IT AS A PACIFIER .
YEAH .
I M NOT SURE IT WAS THAT GREAT FOR MY CHILDREN BUT THEY TURNED OUT OKAY SO .
UH IT DID NT HURT THEM .
ANY .
YEAH .
SOME SHOWS ARE GOOD FOR I THINK SOME SHOWS SOME STAR TREK I FOR THE IMAGINATION OF IT .
ALL .
THE IDEA I I THINK THAT S ONE OF THE THINGS I LIKE ABOUT STAR TREK .
UHHUH .
AND IS IS THE EVEN IN FOR KIDS WATCHING SOME OF IT CAN BE A LITTLE VIOLENT SOMETIMES AND STUFF .
I DO NT LET MY LITTLE ONES WATCH IT BUT THE IMAGINATION OF LOOK WHAT .
WE CAN DO YOU KNOW IN THE FUTURE THIS IS PERHAPS THIS WILL BE POSSIBLE .
YEAH .
THAT KIND OF THING .
YEAH .
OKAY WELL I THINK WE VE COVERED MOST OF MY FAVORITE T V SHOWS .
WELL I M TRYING TO THINK IF I EVER EVEN HAD A FAVORITE ONE AT ONE TIME UH .
LET S SEE HOW ABOUT UH MAN FROM UNCLE .
I DO SEEM TO REME IS THAT THE ONE WHERE THEY UH HE ALWAYS GOT THIS THIS TAPE RECORDING THAT SELFDESTRUCTED .
THAT S MISSION IMPOSSIBLE .
UH MISSION THAT S RIGHT MISSION IMPOSSIBLE .
YEAH I USED TO WATCH THAT .
IN FACT I CAN STILL REMEMBER A COUPLE OF THOSE .
THEY WERE I THOUGHT THOSE WERE VERY GOOD .
YEAH THEY ALWAYS HAVE I VE I VE SEEN SOME OF THEM ON REPEATS .

THE DOORS .
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO AND THEY HAD THIS SCENE UH THAT POR PORTRAYING THE DOORS APPEARANCE ON THE ED SULLIVAN SHOW .

ANY I REMEMBER THE MILTON BERLE SHOW EVEN I WAS .

I WAS WELL I GUESS I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT I AM .
MY T V VIEWING STARTED SORT OF MIDSIXTIES SO .
I SEE .
MY FOLKS DID NT MY FOLKS I M NOT EVEN SURE IF WE HAD ONE WHEN I WAS REALLY LITTLE .
THAT MAY BE WHY BU THEY PROBABLY DID NT HAVE A T V UNTIL I GOT TO BE YOU KNOW GRADE SCHOOL OR SO .
YEAH .
AND THE SHOWS THAT I LIKE NOW THEY WOULD NT LET ME WATCH .
I HAD TO CATCH THEM .
ALL ON REPEATS .
LIKE STAR TREK THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS MUCH TOO VIOLENT FOR SMALL CHILDREN .
SO .
HUH .
I I I ENDED UP WATCHING A LOT OF THESE THINGS ON YOU KNOW REPEATS IN THE AFTERNOONS OR SOMETHING .
YEAH .
THAT S THAT S INTERESTING .
UH I THINK IT S INTERESTING THAT PARENTS THINK THAT THEIR SMALL CHILDREN LEARN VIOLENCE FROM TV PEOPLE WERE JUST AS VIOLENT BEFORE T V WAS INVENTED MAYBE EVEN MORE SO .
YEAH .
BUT I GUESS THAT S THAT S A DIFFERENT TOPIC IS NT IT .
PROBABLY SO .

I WAS REALLY REALLY TIRED OF THE COLOR THAT IT S IT S HELPING WE RE NOT QUITE THROUGH BUT IT S IT REALLY IS LOOKING GOOD UH WE WENT THROUGH A PROCESS OF OF UH HOME REPAIRS ON A ON A RENTAL HOUSE WE HAD PROBABLY THE MOST EXTENSIVE AND UH THE INTERESTING PART OF IT WAS HOW MUCH WE LEARNED ABOUT WHAT WE COULD DO UM WE DID NT HAVE VERY MUCH MONEY AND SO WE HAD TO DO IT OURSELVES IN KIND OF A SLOW PROCESS BUT WE LEARNED HOW TO DO UH RETILE BATHTUBS AND UH OH JUST ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE UNUSUAL .
HUHUH SO THE OTHER THING THAT WE DID WAS THE ROOF OF OUR HOUSE .
HUHUH .
AND UH WE DID THAT A DIFFERENT COLOR ALSO .
YEAH .
OF COURSE UH BEING A WOMAN MOST OF THESE THINGS WERE DONE BY THE MEN .
HUHUH .
AND UH SO I WAS NT DIRECTLY INVOLVED BUT UH THEY REALLY WERE HELPFUL I KNOW TO OUR HOUSE .
IT S NICE TO NOT HAVE A DRIP THROUGH FROM THE ROOF IS NT IT .
YEAH YES .
THAT S AWFUL UM HOWARD AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT HOME REPAIR THE OTHER NIGHT AND UH IN CONNECTION WITH SCOUTING WE VE GOT A SCOUT COMING UP AND UH UH I THINK IT S NEAT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO LEARN HOW TO UH TAKE CARE OF THEIR OF A HOUSEHOLD YOU KNOW LIKE UH FIXING FAUCETS DRIPPING FAUCETS .
HUHUH .
AND PUTTING IN PANES OF GLASS AND STUFF LIKE THAT .
AS A MATTER OF FACT ONE THING I HAVE A YOUNG SON AND ONE THING WE DID WAS WE HAD PANELING ON THE INSIDE OF OUR UH FRONT OF OUR HOUSE OR THE HALL WAY OF OUR HOUSE RATHER AND WE WERE REPAINTING THE THE FRONT ROOM IN THE HALL THERE AND WE TOOK DOWN THAT PANELING AND HE HELPED ME AND AND UH HE WAS IT WAS FUN TO WORK WITH HIM .

HUHUH .
SO THAT WAS A REALLY POSITIVE UH UH IT WAS FAIRLY EXPENSIVE THOUGH I I WAS IMPRESSED I THINK THAT UH WE HAD SOMEBODY DO IT AND IT WAS IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE IT S PROBABLY MORE EXPENSIVE TO PUT DOWN LINOLEUM ALMOST THAN IT IS TO PUT DOWN CARPET .
HUHUH .
KIND OF DEPENDS ON THE QUALITY OF CARPET I SUPPOSE .
YEAH .
BUT UH IN THE CASE OF THE LINOLEUM THEY HAVE TO RIP UP EVERYTHING AND AND FIX THE FLOOR SO IT S UH I DO NT KNOW WHAT EVER BUT THEY HAVE TO PUT STUFF ON THE FLOOR AND IT S UH KIND OF A PROCESS WELL IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE SOME PRETTY GOOD EXPERIENCES WITH UH WITH UH UH HOME REPAIR .

OKAY BYEBYE .
BYE .
ALL RIGHT UH I I WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT JUST BRIEFLY .
WHAT HAPPENED OVER THERE IN SAUDI ARABIA IN THE POLITICAL CONTEXT .
I THINK IT S UH REFRESHING TO SEE THE UH THE SUPPORT THAT THE PRESIDENT GOT FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE .
YEAH IT WE I I READ AN INTERESTING ARTICLE IN THE PAPER THAT DISCUSSED UH THAT UH SEEMED THAT EVERY OTHER TIME .
A PRESIDENT TRIED TO GET SUPPORT FOR AN ACTION LIKE UH UH PRESIDENT CARTER AND HIS THING WITH THE THE HOSTAGE CRISIS .
RIGHT .
AND HE ALWAYS DID IT THROUGH RHETORIC .
RIGHT .
AND THIS TIME PRESIDENT BUSH DID IT THROUGH ACTION AND HE .
UM .
HE DROVE POLICY BY THE COURSE .
HE TOOK AND ALMOST FORCED PUBLIC SUPPORT .
YES .
OR UH I MEAN HE LEFT ALMOST NO ALTERNATIVE .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND AND IT WAS VERY INTERESTING HOW HE DID IT AND UH I MEAN I M I M AN AIR FORCE OFFICER SO IT UH .
REALLY .
IT WAS INTERESTING FOR ME UH YOU KNOW I D CERTAINLY UH I I MEAN I THINK IT S GREAT THAT ALL THE SUPPORT .
I HAVE UH FRIENDS OF MINE FROM THE AIR I M I M AN ENGINEER AND WORK IN THE ROLM LABORATORY .
RIGHT .
BUT OTHER ENGI GUYS HERE ON BASE THIS IS A B FIFTYTWO BASE WHERE I WORK SO .
YEAH .
WE HAD ABOUT A THOUSAND PEOPLE GONE FROM THE BASE .
THAT WENT OVER THERE AND THEY RE GETTING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF SUPPORT OUT OF IT .
THAT S GREAT UM IF IF YOU REMEMBER THE VOTE IN THE CONGRESS TO AUTHORIZE WAR IF NECESSARY WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY CLOSE .
YES IT WAS .
AND IF IF MY MEMORY SERVES ME RIGHT I BELIEVE A MAJORITY OF DEMOCRATS MAY EVEN HAVE OPPOSED IT IT IT WAS .
YEAH I M I DO NT KNOW THE EXACT FIGURE BUT I I WOULD IMAGINE THAT BECAUSE OF THE HOW CLOSE THE THE VOTE WAS I M UH I MEAN ALMOST CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE TO BE .
JUST BASED ON THE SHEER NUMBERS OF UH THE DISPARITY OF EXCUSE ME DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS .
HE D THINK THAT IT WOULD HAVE TO HAVE BEEN UM .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND UH I I GOSH THIS UH THIS WHOLE THING NOW WITH ALL THE UH ALL THE POLITICAL CARTOONS ON THE DEMOCRATS AND HOW THEY RE UH UH .
YEAH .
THEY RE IN IN A SAD WAY FOR NINETYTWO NOW IN TERMS OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION ANYWAY .
ESPECIALLY THE ONES .
THAT CAME OUT AND SAID OH COME ON GUYS LET S TALK ABOUT THIS LITTLE WHILE LONGER .
YEAH YEAH .
I MEAN HOW MANY YEARS ARE WE GOING TO WAIT AND AND WHAT WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE PEOPLE .
THAT ARE OVER THERE IN THE MEAN TIME .
RIGHT RIGHT I THINK THAT WAS ALL THOSE FACTORS PLAYED A PART IN YOU KNOW UH THE .
NO DOUBT .
EVERYONE WAS DISCUSSING WHETHER WE SHOULD UH WAIT LONGER BUT I I I KNOW THAT THERE S A LOT OF REASONS TO WAIT LONGER BUT I THINK WE WERE GENUINELY CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THEIR MILITARY CAPABILITY AND WE UH I THINK WE OVER ESTIMATED IT BUT STILL .
I THINK SO TOO .
WE WERE REALLY HIGHLY CONCERNED ABOUT IT AND THAT WE WERE WORRIED THAT THEY WERE GETTING DUG IN AND UH .
WELL THEY WERE .
YEAH .
AND IN FACT .
THEY WERE SO WELL DUG IN THAT UH WHEN WE SENT OUR TANKS AROUND BEHIND THEM .
THEY COULD NT GET TURNED AROUND IN TIME .
RIGHT THEY COULD NT YEAH THEY COULD NT YEAH IT S TRUE THEY SADDAM THOUGHT HE HAD THE WHOLE THING UH FIGURED OUT TO TO WHICH WAY .
WE WERE COMING AND WHICH WHAT WHAT .
OUR DOCTRINE WAS THAT UH .
WELL HAD HAD WE DONE A FRONTAL ASSAULT .
IT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE WORKED MORE TO HIS FAVOR .
THAT S RIGHT THAT S TRUE .
THAT S INTERESTING I THINK UH THIS POLITICAL SITUATION OVER THERE NOW IS UH UH IT LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT COMES OUT OF IT WHETHER THE THIS OPPOSITION WILL UH UH TODAY .
THE TURKS UH AGREED TO SUPPORT THE KURDS WHICH IS SOMETHING .
THEY VE NEVER DONE BEFORE AND UH .
UM INTERESTING .
AND UH THIS AND THE ISRAELIS UH AND NOT THE ISRAELIS BUT THE ARABS ALL OF A SUDDEN ARE UH ARE CHEERING FOR BAKER ON HIS DRIVE FOR TO RECONCILE RELATIONS WITH THE ISRAELIS SO IT S LIKE .
WELL BAKER IS REALLY NOT VERY MUCH PRO ISRAEL .
YEAH I .
AND DID YOU KNOW JOHN SUNUNU IS UH HALF ARAB .
NO UH I I THINK I DID HEAR THAT AT ONE TIME .
A LONG TIME AGO .
YEAH .
BECAUSE I USED TO LIVE IN UH MASSACHUSETTS BUT UH .
RIGHT IN IN FACT WHEN HE WAS GOVERNOR OF NEW HAMPSHIRE I BELIEVE .
YEAH NEW HAMPSHIRE .
OKAY .
I BELIEVE HE WAS THE ONLY ONE OF FIFTY GOVERNORS .
THAT VOTED AGAINST SOME KIND OF RESOLUTION OF SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL .
A FEW YEARS BACK .
OH MY GOSH .
AND UH NOW HE IS A CONSERVATIVE BUT HE IS NOT A CONSERVATIVE .
THAT FAVORS ISRAEL .
UH .
AND THAT THAT CONCERNS ME GREATLY .
WELL I DO NT YEAH I D CERTAINLY UH SUPPORT ISRAEL IN IN THEIR THEIR POLICY THAT IN DEFENDING THEMSELVES AND IN UH IN THEIR HANDLING OF THEIR FOREIGN POLICY I THINK I THINK THE STAND .
THEY HAVE OR OR THE WAY .
THE COMMAND RESPECT I I SUPPORT THAT .
I THINK THAT IS A A POSITIVE THING FOR THEM AFTER UM UH THOUSANDS OF YEARS THEY HAVE TO UH THEY HA I THINK THEY IN WHEN THEY BE BECAME A COUNTRY .
THEY MORE THAN OR MORE OR LESS DECIDED THEY WERE NT GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE AND UH .
WELL THEY DID NT HAVE MUCH CHOICE THEY COULD EITHER FIGHT OR DIE .
YEAH EXACTLY EXACTLY AND UH UM SO GEE I LOST MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT HERE .
BUT UH UM SO OKAY SO I CA NT SAY WHETHER THAT THAT I M PRO ISRAEL OR ANTI ISRAEL .
I MEAN I D LIKE TO SEE THEM RESOLVE SOMETHING IN THAT SITUATION AND GET SOME STABILITY IN THE REGION AND LOOKS UH THAT THE JOINING OF FORCES FOR THIS UH UH DESERT SHIELD AND DESERT STORM THING ENDED UP BEING A POSITIVE THING .
IT IS A POSITIVE THING UM HOWEVER UH EVERY TIME .
AN ORGANIZATION SUCH AS THE P L O SAYS WELL WE LL SEE IF WE CAN WORK WITH ISRAEL THEN UH THEY GET EMBARRASSED SOME EVERY FEW MONTHS BY DOCUMENTS .
THAT REVEAL THAT THEIR ULTIMATE PURPOSE IS TO TOTALLY ELIMINATE THEM .
RIGHT .
AND SO YOU YOU BASICALLY HAVE UH MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE INTERESTS EITHER ISRAEL IS GOING TO OCCUPY THE AREA OR THE ARABS ARE GOING TO OCCUPY THE AREA AND I M JUST NOT SURE THAT THAT THERE S GOING TO BE ANY EASY PERMANENT SOLUTION .
YEAH SOMEBODY S GOING TO AND I THINK THAT S THE PROBLEM .
THE P L O HAS IS THAT WHEN THEY WHENEVER ONE GROUP OF THEM DECIDES THAT THEY RE GOING TO NEGOTIATE OR THEY RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING THEY RE GOING TO TRY TO MAKE SOME PEACE BUT UH THE END RESULT IS THAT THEY THERE SO MANY FACTIONS OF THEM AND UH SOME MORE VIOLENT THAN OTHERS SOME WITH A CERTAIN AGENDA DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHERS OR THEY SPLIT THEY END UP BEING BECOMING DIVISIVE .
THEMSELVES .
EXACTLY .
UH I IT S INTERESTING .
IT IS .
I I M I M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT HAPPENS OVER THERE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS BUT UH THAT S .
YEAH I I COMMEND ISRAEL FOR THEIR RESTRAINT IN NOT RESPONDING TO THE SCUD ATTACKS .
YEAH I KNOW THAT THAT IS ALMOST I MEAN THAT S ABSOLUTELY UNPRECEDENTED THAT WAS .
YEAH .
AN AN INCREDIBLE FOREIGN POLICY COUP ON THE PART OF THE PRESIDENT AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT .
EXACTLY EXACTLY .
AND THAT I MEAN THAT S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE .
NO .
AND I DO NT KNOW IF IT WILL EVER HAPPEN AGAIN BUT .
MAY NOT .
WELL IT S BEEN FUN I ENJO ENJOYED TALKING WITH YOU .

WELL YEAH YEAH YEAH .
UH DO YOUR KIDS GO TO GARLAND HIGH YOU SAID .
NO NO THEY RE STILL IN ELEMENTARY .
OH OKAY .
SO YEAH .
WELL THERE S A IT S UM SHE WENT FROM AUSTIN ACADEMY WHEN IT OPENED UP .
UHHUH .
OVER TO UH TO NORTH GARLAND FOR NINTH GRADE BUT AT NORTH GARLAND THE THE DIFFICULTY I SEE WITH THE EDUCATION SYSTEM IS THAT UH IS THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN YOU CAN GET SOME MASSES BUT UNLESS IF THE KID S REALLY DEDICATED IT SEEMS LIKE THEY DO ALL RIGHT BUT IF IF IF YOUR CHILD IS JUST PRESSING ALONG UH I I M FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT TEACHERS ARE NT BEING PAID ENOUGH WOULD YOU ARGUE WITH THAT .
I M DEFINITELY NOT ARE YOU KIDDING NO .
WELL YOU KNOW THE THE THE THING THAT I DO NT SEE AND MAYBE YOU WOULD TAKE ISSUE WITH IT IS THAT IF IF WE WENT TO IF THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR TEACHERS TO TEACH YEAR AROUND .
NO I WANT THAT .
WELL WOULD .
I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR THE TEACHERS AND FOR THE CHILDREN BECAUSE WE WOULD DO AWAY WITH SO MUCH OF THE BURNOUT THAT WE HAVE I KNOW WHEN YOU GET THE KIDS THAT HAVE GONE THE SUMMER BEING OUT OF SCHOOL THEN IT S LIKE THEY VE LOST SO MUCH GROUND WE SPEND AT LEAST THE FIRST SIX WEEKS JUST BACKING UP RETEACHING WHAT THEY HAD THE YEAR BEFORE YOU KNOW .
WELL HOW DO WE ACCOM HOW DO WE GET THAT .
WELL WE RE STARTING PILOT SCHOOLS IT S A DALLAS IS DOING IT I KNOW I THINK PLANO DO NT THEY HAVE SOME AND RICHARDSON S SUPPOSED TO START SOME PILOT SCHOOLS GOING TO SCHOOL YEAR AROUND .
YEAH .
AND THEN WE YOU KNOW WE INVESTIGATED THIS BY FLYING SOME PEOPLE OUT FROM DALLAS TO OBSERVE SOME OF THE SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA THAT ALREADY HAD IT .
DOES IT WORK WELL OUT THERE .
YEAH IT SEEMS TO AND ONE THING IT LL SAVE US MONEY BECAUSE WE VE GOT THE BUILDINGS SITTING THERE RIGHT AND WE MIGHT AS WELL USE THEM .
WELL WHAT ABOUT THE WHAT ABOUT THE ISSUE OF AIR CONDITIONING IS NT THAT A S AN AREA OF CONCERN IN THE COST OF AIR CONDITIONING .
WELL AIR CONDITIONING WHAT S AND AND HEATING .
OH YEAH .
IS NT AIR CONDITIONING LESS THAN HEATING BECAUSE WE HAVE TO JUST UP LIKE IF WE GET IN THE THIRTIES WE RAISE IT UP TO THE SEVENTIES RIGHT THAT S FORTY DEGREES .
YEAH .
IS NT IT LESS .
YEAH IT S IT S LESS DEGREE DAYS YOU RE RIGHT BUT I THINK I THINK .
AND IT S NOT LIKE THE KIDS ARE GOING TO GO A LOT LONGER REALLY IF YOU GO YEAR AROUND .
YEAH .
THERE S NOT THIRTY DAYS DIFFERENCE .
W WELL HOW DO THEY DO IT DO THEY PUT UH LONG DO THEY PUT TWO OR THREE WEEK BREAKS BETWEEN .
THERE S DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO IT LIKE I I THINK GOING TWO SIX WEEKS AND THEN HAVING TWO TWO WEEKS OFF EACH AFTER A TWO SIX WEEKS PERIOD IS ONE WAY .
IS THAT FROM FROM WHAT YOU VE SEEN IS THAT THE DESIRABLE WAY TO DO IT .
SEE I DO NT KNOW BECAUSE I VE NEVER SEEN IT IN ACTION .
OH YOU SAID YOU HAD SOME PEOPLE FROM CALIFORNIA OH I THOUGHT YOU .
NO THE SCHOOL SYSTEM IN DALLAS HAS SENT PEOPLE THERE .
OH OKAY .
TO DO THAT NO .
BUT YOU DID NT GO .
BUT I THINK I D LIKE IT AND I KNOW A LOT OF TEACHERS THAT WOULD LIKE TO TRY IT .
WELL THE THE OTHER ISSUE HAS TO THAT I HEAR THAT THE LOCAL COMMENTATOR I LISTEN TO MUMBLEX SOME THE IDEA THAT THE NUMBERS OF ADMINISTRATION AND THE FACT THAT THE PRINCIPAL DO YOU SEE THAT THE PRINCIPALS ARE NT REALLY IN CHARGE .
THE PRINCIPAL S THEIR T HANDS ARE TIED BY ALL THE ADMINISTRATORS AND I HEARD THAT IN DALLAS IT S ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE IS ACTUALLY IN THE CLASSROOM OF THE EDUCATORS THAT WERE HIRED .
WELL I HAD HEARD THAT ONE OF THE COMMENTS WHEN THEY WHEN THEY BROUGHT IT .
IT S JUST YOU DO NT EVEN KNOW WHO ALL YOUR BOSSES ARE IT S RIDICULOUS .
UM THEN WHY THE THE ONE THEY BROUGHT IN THE NEW SUPERINTENDENT FOR DALLAS SCHOOLS THE ADMINI UM CA NT THINK OF HIS NAME BUT THE IDEA .
MARVIN EDWARDS .
YEAH THAT HE HAD SUGGESTED THAT THAT MAYBE THEY COULD REDUCE THE NUMBER OF ADMINISTRATORS AND AND SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE ADMINISTRATORS SAYING THAT THAT UH THAT S NOT WHAT HE WAS HIRED FOR BUT THEY RESENTED THE FACT THAT HE WOULD TRY TO SAVE SOME COSTS THERE .
WELL YOU KNOW HE DID SUPPOSEDLY CUT ADMINISTRATORS BUT WHAT THEY VE DONE IS CREATE OTHER OFFICES FOR THOSE SAME PEOPLE AND JUST REHI RENAMED THEIR JOBS .
UM .
AND YOU KNOW OPENED UP N OTHER N OTHER THINGS ONE THING WE VE GOT GOING IS CALLED READING AND INITIATIVE AND THEY VE HIRED ALL THESE ADMINISTRATORS IN ON THAT YOU KNOW .
WELL YOU KNOW THE OTHER THING THAT BOTHERS ME IS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IT TAK THAT IT TOOK TO CONTEST THE THE FOOTBALL UM ISSUE .
PASS OR NO FAIL WHAT IS IT .
YEAH BUT THE .
NO PLAY .
I CA NT THINK OF THE NAME OF THE SCHOOL .
NO PLAY .
THAT THAT UH BUT IN ANY EVENT THEY THEY THEY KEPT ARGUING .
CARTER HIGH SCHOOL .
YEAH .
YEAH .
AND THEY WENT TO COURT I MEAN I YOU KNOW GUESS I I M SYMPATHETIC WITH THE KIDS BUT BUT HOW MUCH MONEY DID THAT COST DALLAS TO TO TO FIGHT THAT IN COURT .
AND ALL THE THINGS THAT DALLAS FIGHTS COSTS THOUSANDS PROBABLY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS I BET YOU .
BUT JUST THINK OF ALL THE THE ALL THE LAWYERS YOU VE KEPT EMPLOYED SEE .
YEAH I KNOW .
AND PSYCHOLOGISTS AND STUFF .
THAT S RIGHT .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND AND ALL THESE OTHER PEOPLE ARE OUT RUNNING AROUND I GUESS THAT S THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH JOBS BEING RELATIVELY SCARCE SO BUT YOU NEED TO KEEP ALL THESE PEOPLE EMPLOYED RIGHT .
NO WE DO NOT .
AND AND .
NO .
YOU MEAN YOU MEAN WE NEED A LITTLE MORE OF OUR TAX MONEY LIKE MAYBE UH .
WE NEED MORE OF THE TAX MONEY TO ACTUALLY GET DOWN TO THE STUDENTS BECAUSE IT S PRETTY FRUSTRATING WHEN YOU SEE YOU DO NT EVEN HAVE PAPER AND YOU RE TRYING TO RATION IT YOU KNOW NOW THAT S SAD WHEN THERE S SUPPOSED TO BE WHAT YOU KNOW ONE THOUSAND WHAT SIXTYFIVE DOLLARS SOMETHING LIKE THAT SPENT ON EACH PUPIL .
YEAH MUMBLEX .
UM IT S IT S WRONG ANYWAY I WAS THINKING ABOUT ONE THING THAT S WRONG WITH SCHOOLS IS THAT WE RE NOT TEACHING TO THE CHILDREN S MODALITIES AND I THINK IN NINETEEN UH NINETYTHREE WE RE SUPPOSED TO BEGIN THAT IF IF A CHILD IS A VISUAL LEARNER WE RE SUPPOSED TO PRESENT HIM WITH ALL THESE VISUAL THINGS AND IF HE HAS TO LEARN JUST BY KINESTHETIC WE RE SUPPOSED TO TEACH WHATEVER WAY THAT THAT CHILD HAS TO HAVE IT LEARNS THE BEST WAY AND THAT S GOING TO BE QUITE A PROBLEM .
MUMBLEX OH THAT S .
BUT IF WE COULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT I M SURE IT WOULD CERTAINLY HELP .
UM THAT S INTERESTING AND HOW MANY ADMINISTRATORS IS THAT GOING TO TAKE .
I DO NT KNOW NO TELLING I DO NT KNOW AND YOU KNOW AT NONGRADED SCHOOLS THEY VE HAD ONE IN GLADEWATER FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS IF WE COULD JUST LET THESE KIDS GO AT THEIR OWN RATE I HAVE CHILDREN EVEN I I TEACH CHAPTER ONE AND IT S FOR KIDS THAT HAVE FALLEN BEHIND IN THEIR READING ACCORDING TO LIKE I T B S SCORES .
YEAH .
AND SOME OF THE KIDS REALLY THEY SHOULD NT BE IN THERE AND THEY RE YOU KNOW THEY RE NOT BEING CHALLENGED AND THEY RE NOT BEING CHALLENGED IN THEIR HOME AND WE ALWAYS HAVE TO TEACH TOWARD THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD .
YEAH WELL THAT S THAT S PART OF WHERE MY SON IS UM WOULD LIKE TO GO TO RICE BUT I DO NT THINK HE S WELL THE THE DIFFICULTY IS IS IS THE PEOPLE THAT GET IN ARE ARE ARE OVERACHIEVERS .
UHHUH .
AND HE S NOT AN OVERACHIEVER BUT THE SAME TIME EVERYBODY CA NT GO BUT IT THE QUESTION OF OF YOU KNOW OF HOW FAR SHOULD YOU TAKE A KID IN THE MOTIVATION I M NOT SURE I THINK MAYBE THERE S TOO MUCH RESPONSIBILITY PUT ON THE TEACHERS TO MOTIVATE THESE KIDS I HAD A A FRIEND THAT WAS ADMINISTRATOR IN RICHARDSON SAID IF THE PARENTS READ BOOKS THEN THE KIDS PROBABLY WOULD READ BOOKS .
RIGHT .
BUT THAT A LOT OF THE SCHOOLS I WOULD THINK THE KIDS YOU RE TALKING TO QUESTION OF OF HOW MUCH READING DO THOSE KIDS PARENTS DO .
MY CHILDREN S PARENTS ARE NT EVEN THERE AT NIGHT MOST OF THE TIME .
WELL .
TO DO ANYTHING WITH THEM .
WELL BUT THAT S THE POINT AS I WOULD SAY UH .
YEAH .
AND THAT IS THAT S WHAT MAKES THERE S A LOT OF PROBLEMS BUT ANYWAY UM I M TRYING TO THINK HOW MUCH LONGER I HAD A CONVERSATION WEEK OR SO AGO AND WE GOT CARRIED AWAY AND THEY CUT IT BEEPS IN AT TEN MINUTES SO .
I KNOW IT I KNOW IT .
SO ANYWAY .
I WENT FOR A COUPLE AND I DID NT KNOW THAT THERE WAS EVEN A CUT OFF OR ANYTHING OH ANOTHER THINGS THAT S WRONG WITH SCHOOLS THIS IS BIG THERE S TOO MUCH EMPHASIS ON TEST WE RE SPENDING THE FIRST HOUR OF EVERY DAY TEACHING FOR THE MUMBLEX TEST AT MY SCHOOL AND WE RE GOING TO DO THAT UNTIL AT LEAST THE FIRST PART OF MAY .
HUH WELL SEE THAT S IN THE GARLAND SCHOOLS THE NUMBERS THEY I DO NT THINK THEY HAVE TO DO THAT BECAUSE MOST EVERYBODY PASSES .
BUT SEE THEY RE NOT IN DALLAS .
WELL OPPORTUNITY RIGHT IF YOU GET GRADED ON PERCENT IMPROVEMENT BUT SEE THAT .
YEAH WE RE NOT WORKING WITH THE SAME TYPE OF STUDENTS .
YEAH .
THAT MOST OF THESE KIDS IN GARLAND ARE .
AND UNFORTUNATELY THE UH THAT S THAT S TOUGH THAT S A REAL CHALLENGE THOUGH BUT UH .
BUT SEE WHAT WE RE DOING IS WE RE TURNING THESE KIDS OFF TO SCHOOL EVEN MORE THAN THEY ARE .
YEAH .
AND WE RE NOT TEACHING TOWARD THE TEST WE RE TEACHING YOU KNOW I ALWAYS OBJECTED YOU KNOW IT S LIKE THERE S NOT A WHOLE LOT OF YOU KNOW FUN TIME LIKE WE USED TO HAVE IN SCHOOL LIKE OUR PRINCIPAL SAYS I WANT EVERY CHILD TO BE ON TASK ALL THE TIME .
YEAH .
AND YOU CA NT DO THAT AS ADULTS BUT WE RE EXPECTING KIDS TO AND LIKE AFTER AFTER RECESS PLAY .
YEAH .
WE DO NT GET THAT OKAY .
YEAH .
IF THEY FINISH BEFORE THEIR THIRTY MINUTES IS UP THEN THEY CAN GO OUT AND PLAY FOR LIKE MAYBE FIVE OR TEN MINUTES PROBABLY BE THE MOST .
YEAH .
BUT WE ALWAYS GOT THAT DID NT YOU .
WELL YEAH YOU KNOW OUR S SON HAD THAT HE WAS HAD AN ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER AND THEY WERE KEEPING HIM FROM RECESS AND IN REALITY THAT S UH THAT S ONE OF THOSE REALLY TOUGH SITUATIONS I THINK THE KIDS NEED SOME TIME TO PLAY .
YEAH .
BUT MUMBLEX PEOPLE LIKE IF MORE PEOPLE LIKE YOU THOUGH THAT UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEMS GET IN AND MUMBLEX AND CHANGE SOME EDUCATION SO UH I GOT SOME BACKGROUND NOISE THERE BUT I GUESS .
OKAY UH MY FAVORITE SHOW IS MASTERPIECE THEATRE AND IT HAS BEEN FOR A LONG TIME BUT I FEEL ALMOST ASHAMED TO SAY THAT TO ANYBODY NOW BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER MET ANYBODY .

DO YOU WORK FOR T I .
NO NO I WORK FOR G T E .
REALLY .
IN MARYLAND YES .
HOW DID YOU HEAR OH WE RE NOT EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE TALKING ABOUT THIS THOUGH ARE WE .
I GUESS NOT .
HOW DID I HEAR ABOUT IT .

WHO ARE DOING THIS AND I HEARD ABOUT IT SO I CALLED THEM AND ASKED IF I COULD PARTICIPATE .
AND UH .
OH .
YOU KNOW SEND IN THE FORMS ET CETERA AND UH SO FORTH .
RIGHT .
WE COULD GO BACK TO TELEVISION SHOWS .
WELL YOU KNOW SPEAKING OF PUBLIC TV HAVE YOU CAUGHT ANY OF THIS SERIES ON THE BIBLE .
YES I HAVE .
I VE HEARD THAT IT S REALLY AGAINST THE WELL I MEAN THAT IT S COMING OUT WITH THE IDEA THAT THE BIBLE S NOT TRUE .
WELL NO .
THAT S UH YOU COULD INTERPRET IT .
THAT WAY .
UHHUH .
UH I I THINK WHAT .
THEY ARE TRYING TO SAY IS THAT THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF HISTORICAL TRUTH BUT THE INTERPRETATION .
THAT ACTUALLY GOT INTO THE WRITING OF THE BIBLE .
ITSELF IS PROBABLY UH AFTER THE .
WHAT UH WAS IS IT .
THE KING JAMES VERSION WHEN THE COMMITTEE DID IT WROTE THE TRANSLATION THAT SO MUCH WAS LOST IN THE TRANSLATION PARTICULARLY SINCE MOST OF THE TRANSLATIONS WERE IN GREEK .
YEAH .
WELL FOR EXAMPLE .
IN GREEK THERE ARE SEVEN DIFFERENT WORDS FOR LOVE .
RIGHT .
OKAY SO YOU CAN HAVE THERE S ONE .
WORD FOR LOVE OF YOUR BROTHER ONE WORD FOR LOVE OF YOUR WIFE ONE WORD FOR YOU KNOW UH LOVE OF YOUR FATHER AND THAT SORT OF THING .
SO IN AS TO THOSE TYPES OF INTERPRETATIONS UH REALLY MADE A DIFFERENCE IN HOW ONE MIGHT INTERPRET THE BIBLE NOW AND WHAT .
IT S AT .
UHHUH .
SO THAT S YOU KNOW YOU CAN LOOK AT IT AS THOUGH THEY ARE SAYING IT S NOT TRUE BUT THERE S TOO MUCH HISTORICAL FACT INVOLVED JUST FROM THE UH THE HISTORIES .
THAT ARE WERE DEVELOPED AROUND THAT TIME THAT ARE AVAILABLE .
YEAH .
TO DENY THAT AT LEAST THE MAJORITY OF IT IS TRUE .
SO YOU KNOW IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU LOOK AT IT .
YEAH .
YOU CAN LOOK AT IT YOU KNOW IF YOU WANT TO SAY THAT IT S PROVEN THAT IT IS NT TRUE THEN YOU CAN VERY MUCH LOOK AT IT .
THAT WAY .
I GUESS IF YOU RE LOOKING FOR THAT YOU RE .
YEAH WELL .
THAT UH .
WELL YOU CAN INTERPRET THAT THE WHAT .
THE T V SHOW IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOU CAN INTERPRET THE BIBLE .
UHHUH .
SO .
REALLY .
BUT UH AS AS FAR AS THAT GOES I WE AT LEAST AGREE ON WHAT .
WE ENJOY .
YEAH THAT S RIGHT .
BUT UH I DO NT KNOW IF THERE IS THERE IS A TIME LIMIT ON THIS .
YEAH .
SO UH .
SURELY WE VE MADE IT .
I THINK SO TOO .
LET S JUST IT S BEEN VERY PLEASANT TALKING TO YOU .
IT WAS VERY NICE TALKING TO YOU .
AND HAVE A GOOD EVENING .
YOU TOO .
GOOD NIGHT .
BYEBYE .
I STARTED WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE .
YOU KNOW THEY ALWAYS OFFER CREDIT CARDS FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS .
YES .
SO I WENT AHEAD AND ACCEPTED EVERY ONE THAT I WAS OFFERED .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE I KNEW IT WOULD BE EASIER TO GO AHEAD AND GET THEM AND ESTABLISH CREDIT EARLY .
RIGHT .
SO I P I PACK AROUND A LOT OF THEM BUT I ONLY USE A FEW OF THEM .
YOU HAVE A LOT OF DISCIPLINE .
THEY MAKE IT REALLY EASY FOR PEOPLE TO UH TO GET CREDIT CARDS ESPECIALLY COLLEGE STUDENTS .
YEAH .
I HAVE UH TWO DAUGHTERS .
WHO WHO .
BOTH ARE IN COLLEGE OR IN FACT ONE HAS FINISHED NOW .
BUT THEY .
BOTH HAVE A LOT OF CREDIT CARDS .
AND THEY GIVE YOU SUCH HIGH CREDIT LIMITS .
UHHUH .
IT S IT S EASY TO GET CAUGHT UP IN THE MINIMUM PAYMENT TRAP .
UH RIGHT .
AND THEN THEY THEY GIVE YOU UH UH THE CREDIT LIMIT AND THEN YOU RE ALWAYS S SEEMINGLY UP TO THAT LIMIT .
NOW I HAVE QUITE A FEW CREDIT CARDS THAT I M ALWAYS ALMOST UP TO THE LIMIT ON MOST OF THEM .
AND THAT S THAT S HOW A LOT OF PEOPLE GET INTO TROUBLE .
YEAH .
I VE GOT I VE GOT TWO THAT I YOU KNOW THAT USUALLY I LL HAVE A BALANCE ON .
UHHUH .
AND THEN ALL OF THE OTHERS I JUST TRY TO USE KIND OF LIKE YOU WOULD AN AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD AND AND PAY IT OFF EVERY MONTH .
RIGHT .
AND THAT WAY .
I FEEL LIKE I M GETTING YOU KNOW A THIRTY DAY LOAN .
YEAH .
BUT I DO NT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT YOU KNOW RUNNING THEM UP TOO HIGH EXCEPT AT CHRISTMAS .
THEN THEY USUALLY GO THEN THEY USUALLY GET RUN UP PRETTY GOOD .
YEAH .
WELL YOU HAVE A LOT OF DISCIPLINE .
I UH I M TRYING MY BEST RIGHT NOW TO PAY OFF SOME OF MINE .
I I VE I VE PAID OFF ABOUT FOUR CREDIT CARDS .
THIS YEAR .
UHHUH .
AND UH BUT STILL I HAVE SOME .
THAT ARE ARE UP TO THE LIMIT .
AND ESPECIALLY THE VISA CARD .

I M SHORT OF CASH I JUST GO GET GET IT FROM VISA .
NOW THAT S ONE THAT S I VE NEVER USED MY VISA FOR CASH BEFORE .
UHHUH .
CAN YOU USE IT LIKE AT A BANK MACHINE J .

THE VISA CARD AND SAY I WANT A CASH ADVANCE .
OR IF THEY VE SENT YOU .
A UH A NUMBER THAT YOU CAN USE .
YOU KNOW A A PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBER .
YEAH .
THAT YOU CAN USE IN THE UH IMPACT MACHINES OR WHATEVER YOU .
OH OKAY .
YOU CAN DO THAT .
BECAUSE I HAVE ONE THAT I DO NT HAVE A PIN NUMBER FOR .
YOU KNOW SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO ASK THEM FOR THAT .
YEAH .
AND THEN I HAVE ONE THAT UH JUST GAVE ME .
THE PIN NUMBER AUTOMATICALLY .
NOW WE GOT THAT S THAT S FUNNY YOU SAID THAT .
BECAUSE WE GOT A CREDIT CARD UH MY HUSBAND AND I GOT CREDIT CARDS IN THE MAIL ONE DAY THAT WE HAD NT EVEN APPLIED FOR .

RIGHT .
AND WE WE CUT THEM UP AND SENT THEM BACK BECAUSE WE WE HAD NT EVEN APPLIED FOR THEM AND WE DID NT WANT THEM .
BUT THEY THEY HAD JUST AUTOMATICALLY APPROVED US AND SENT THEM WITHOUT EVEN CONTACTING US .
OH WOW .
SO I THOUGHT MAN I DO NT KNOW IF I TRUST THIS OR NOT .
WELL THEY THEY DO THAT A LOT IF YOU HAVE GOOD CREDIT AND YOU HAVE BEEN PAYING YOUR BILLS ON TIME .
EV EV EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD WILL OFFER YOU .
A A CREDIT CARD .
IT .
S LIKE LET S SEE IF WE CAN GET HER TO RUN UP HER BILLS .
BUT IT S HARD I MEAN IT S IT S TEMPTING WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING TO SAY WELL I LL JUST CHARGE IT .
AND SOMETIMES I LL DO THAT BUT USUALLY I I WILL TRY TO PAY EVERYTHING OFF THE NEXT MONTH OR .
UHHUH .
THE ONES .
THAT USUALLY HAVE AN OUTSTANDING BALANCE .
ALL THE TIME I LL I LL PAY MORE THAN THE MINIMUM PAYMENT .
UHHUH .
JUST I FE I FEEL LIKE EVEN THAT LITTLE BIT HELPS .
RIGHT .
WELL YOU KNOW THE WAY .
THE ECONOMY S GOING AND INFLATION AND THE RECESSION AND ALL THAT I THINK WE WE REALLY NEED TO TRY TO STAY OUT OF DEBT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE .
THAT S THAT S WHY I VE I VE REALLY STARTED TO TRY TO TO PAY OFF MINE AND GET OUT OF DEBT .
BECAUSE WE NEVER KNOW WHEN WE MIGHT YOU KNOW GET LAID OFF OR .
I KNOW IT .
SOMETHING .
ESPECIALLY ME .
I WORK FOR TEXAS INSTRUMENTS AND THEY VE HAD HAD A LOT OF OF UH YOU KNOW LAYOFFS LATELY .
WELL I WORK FOR T I TOO .

IT IT CERTAINLY IS .
I VE UH I HAVE WORKED ON A PART PART TIME JOB UH WHERE I WAS A COLLECTOR .
UHHUH .
FOR UH UH A JEWELRY COMPANY .
PEOPLE UH THAT THEY JUST HAD THIS JEWELRY ACCOUNT .
IT WAS ZALES JEWELRY IN FACT .
AND UH A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOP I MEAN THEY HAVE ABOUT A THOUSAND COLLECTORS I GUESS .
MAN .
AND UH THERE S JUST SO MANY PEOPLE .
THAT HAVE BOUGHT JEWELRY WHICH IS REALLY A LUXURY ITEM .
YEAH .
AND THEN THEY THEY JUST CA NT PAY FOR IT .
SOMETHING SOMETHING HAPPENS YOU KNOW AND YOU HEAR SO MANY STORIES LISTENING TO THEM .
LIKE UH YOU KNOW THEY LOST THEIR JOB OR UH THEY THEY VE SIGNED FOR A FRIEND .
YOU KNOW THEY GOT IT IN THEIR NAME BUT THEY .
OH .
GOT IT FOR A FRIEND AND THEN THE FRIEND .
DID NT PAY THEM .
WOULD NT PAY THEM .
AND NOW THEY RE STUCK WITH THE BILL AND IT S RUINING THEIR CREDIT AND .
MAN .
YOU REALLY HAVE TO WATCH IT THIS YOU KNOW .
BECAUSE .
THAT S SCARY .
YEAH .
BECAUSE EVERY EVERY MONTH .
ALL OF THESE CREDIT CARDS REPORT TO THE CREDIT BUREAU YOU KNOW .
AUTOMATICALLY MO MOST OF THEM DO .
I DID NT REALIZE THAT .
YEAH .
AND IF YOU IF YOU RE UH IT S BAD BECAUSE IF YOU YOU KNOW YOUR BILL IS DUE ON THE FIFTEENTH .
YEAH .
THEN I Y Y Y YOU YOU RE NOT PAST DUE UNTIL THE FIFTEENTH OF THE NEXT MONTH .
OH OKAY .
BUT YOU KNOW IF YOU IF YOU PAY ONE DAY AFTER THAT FIFTEENTH YOU RE NOT ONE DAY LATE YOU RE THIRTY DAYS LATE .
THEY DO NT THEY DO NT RECOGNIZE ANY TIME DIFFERENCE DO THEY .
RIGHT .
OOH .
RIGHT .
THAT S SCARY .
A A AND ANYWAY WE NEED TO WATCH OUR CREDIT REPORTS AND ALL THAT KIND OF .
THAT S SOMETHING .
I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT GETTING YOU KNOW CHECKING WITH TO SEE WHAT WHAT .
YOUR CREDIT REPORT LOOKED LIKE .
UHHUH .
WELL YOU KNOW YOU YOU CAN DO THAT .
I BELIEVE IT COSTS ABOUT TEN DOLLARS .
MIGHT BE WORTH IT FOR PEACE OF MIND .
OH YEAH .
IT IS IT IS .
YOU MIGHT EVEN FIND SOMEBODY S BEEN REPORTING ON YOU AND YOU DID NT EVEN KNOW IT .
YOU KNOW YOU I MEAN YOU MIGHT THINK YOU RE PAYING SOMETHING ON TIME OR AND YOU BY THAT DAY AND YOU RE THIR THIRTY DAYS IS NOT REAL BAD THOUGH ANYWAY .
YEAH .
IF YOU VE GOT A CHARGE OFF ON YOUR CREDIT REPORT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
THAT S WHEN IT REALLY GETS BAD .
OR SOMETHING .
YOU HAVE NT PAID IN SIXTY DAYS OR NINETY DAYS YOU KNOW .
AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
I THINK THAT DISCOVER CARD HAS A GOOD IDEA WITH YOU KNOW GIVING YOU .
A LITTLE CASH BACK INCENTIVE FOR EACH AMOUNT YOU YOU PURCHASE .
AS LONG AS YOU DO NT GO CRAZY TRYING TO GET CASH BACK .
UHHUH .
AND SINCE THEY DO NT HAVE THE YEARLY FEE .
DO THEY CHARGE A LOT OF INTEREST ON THAT CARD .
I DO NT KNOW .
I DO NT .
I VE NEVER I HAVE NT GOTTEN ONE .
UHHUH .
JUST BECAUSE IT S UH UH I FELT LIKE WITH VISA AND MASTERCARD AND AMERICAN EXPRESS YOU DID NT NEED ANOTHER ONE .
UHHUH .
I WOULD THINK IT WOULD NT BE YOU KNOW MUCH MORE THAN THE EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN PERCENT .
EVERYONE ELSE CHARGES .
YEAH .
SO THAT THAT WOULD NT BE TOO BAD .
WELL ALWAYS WATCH OUT FOR S ANYBODY .
WHO BILLS YOU OUT OF ATLANTA GEORGIA .
OR THERE S A COUPLE OF OTHER PLACES .
THAT ARE ABLE TO CHARGE US LIKE TWENTYONE AND TWENTYTWO PERCENT INTEREST .
I KNOW I HAD A CHARGE WITH UH SPIEGEL AND I HAD NT READ THE UH TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT REALLY .
YEAH .
AND UH WHEN I DID I YOU KNOW I REALIZED THAT THAT IT JUST LOOKED SEEMED LIKE I WAS NEVER PAYING THE BALANCE OFF .
YOU KNOW .
AND I LOOKED AT THE CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT ONE DAY AND IT WAS LIKE TWENTYTHREE PERCENT INTEREST .
HOLY COW .
AND THAT S THE ONE BILL THAT I HURRY UP HURRIED AND PAID UP .
DEFINITELY .
AND .
THAT S AWFUL .
AND I VE ALWAYS WATCHED IT SINCE THEN .
YOU REALLY HAVE TO WATCH THOSE INTEREST RATES .
I MEAN .
I MEAN THERE S NO POINT IN GIVING THEM .
ANY MORE MONEY THAN WE HAVE TO .
THAT S TRUE .
SO .
SO ANYWAY THEY CA NT BILL YOU ANY HIGHER THAN EIGHTEEN PERCENT I THINK IN IN TEXAS .
BUT .
OH THAT S GREAT .
THERE THERE ARE A COUPLE OF STATES .
THAT CAN .
AND ONE TO WATCH OUT FOR IS ANYBODY .
THAT BILLS YOU OUT OF ATLANTA ATLANTA GEORGIA .
I LL TRY TO REMEMBER THAT ONE .
WELL .

I WAS TRYING TO THINK IF THERE WAS ANYTHING ELSE .

YEAH .
BUT .
THERE S .
ANYWAY UH .
I VE I VE READ A LOT OF THINGS UM SINCE I GOT INVOLVED IN THE WATER BUSINESS BACK IN EIGHTYTHREE .
UHHUH .
UM AND IT S AMAZING THAT THE THE LEGISLATION THEY HAVE UM FOR FOOD THAT DOES NT APPLY TO WATER THEY DO NT CONSIDER WATER A FOOD .
UHHUH .
AND UH THE BASICS PREMISE IS THAT IF WATER WAS A FOOD IT WOULD BE YOU KNOW THEY WOULD NT BE ABLE TO SELL IT TO YOU THROUGH YOUR PIPES BECAUSE IT S TOXIC UM CHLORINE .
BECAUSE IT S WHAT .
IT S TOXIC IT S A .
OH .
I DO NT KNOW IF YOUR ON CITY WATER CITY WATER HAS CHLORINE IN IT CHLORINE .
UHHUH .
CAUSES CANCER .
UHHUH .
THEY KNOW THAT THEY VE PROVEN THAT UM YET THEIR SAYING WELL WE RE PUTTING SUCH LOW DOSES IN THERE THAT WELL .
UHHUH .
YOU DO NT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT DYING FROM IT THE PROBLEM IS THAT I VE THAT I VE READ BOOKS THAT .
UHHUH .
UH HAVE PROVEN THAT THERE IS A LINK BETWEEN THE INGESTATION OF CHLORINE AND ARTERIOSCLEROSIS WHICH IS HEART ATTACK .
UM .
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF HEAR ATTACKS HEART ATTACKS WERE NONEXISTENT PRIOR TO NINETEEN TWENTY .
REALLY .
AND WE STARTED DOING UM LARGE QUANTITIES OF CHLORINATION OF WATER STARTING AROUND UH WHERE WE EXPERIMENTED WITH IT IN NINETEEN OH THREE AND NINETEEN THIRTEEN MOST OF THE MAJOR CITIES HAD CHLORINATED WATER .
REALLY YOU KNOW I BET THAT S WHY WE HAVE SOME FRIENDS THAT EAT ONLY I JUST TOOK THIS AMISH BREAD OUT OF THE OVEN MAN IT S GOING TO BE GOOD I HAD A STARTER THAT FRIEND OF MINE MADE ANYWAY UH I HAD A FRIEND THAT READ A BOOK ON THAT AND UM I VE ALL MY RELATIVES MY M YOU KNOW YOU PROBABLY READ BACK TO EDEN OR SOMETHING I DO NT KNOW MUMBLEX WE READ A LOT I KNOW PEOPLE HAVE READ ALL THOSE BOOKS BUT THE UM THEY DR THEY DRILLED A WELL I DO NT KNOW HOW MANY FEET BUT IT S THREE OR FOUR TIMES DEEPER THAN IT NEEDED TO BE .
UHHUH .
AND SO THEIR WATER COMES OUT THEY LIVE IN GRAND PRAIRIE BUT IT S THEY LIVE KIND OF IN A THE PLANES GO RIGHT OVER FROM D F W SO IT S NOT REAL DEVELOPED AND SO THEY HAVE A .
YEAH I M VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE AREA .
PROBABLY HALF AN ACRE AND YEAH AND THEY DRILLED THIS WELL AND THE WATER COMES OUT AT THIRTYTWO DEGREES SO IT S KINDS OF NEAT WOULD THAT BE HEALTHIER DO TO DO THAT TO DRILL YOUR OWN FRESH WATER WELL LIKE THAT .
IT DEPENDS A LOT OF UH A LOT OF THINGS WERE THOUGHT THAT UH AS YOU KNOW THE FARMERS THOUGHT OKAY WE GOT CHEMICALS WE RE PUTTING CHEMICALS ON THE FIELD WELL THE GROUND WILL NATURALLY FILTER OUT THE .
OKAY .
ALL SET .
DO YOU WANT TO START .
I CAN GO AHEAD AND START .
SURE GO AHEAD .
UH IN DALLAS THERE S DEFINITELY A CRIME PROBLEM I KNOW IT S YOU KNOW WORSE IN THE LARGER CITIES .
UM IT S KIND OF A CONCERN FOR ME IN FACT AT THE MOMENT .
I M THINKING OF POSSIBLY MOVING TO A NEW APARTMENT AND UH IT S I AM SINGLE AND FEMALE YOU DEFINITELY ARE GOING TO WORRY ABOUT THE LOCATION AND UH YOU KNOW ACCESSIBILITY OF PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO BREAK IN .
I LIVE ON A THIRD FLOOR NOW BUT I YOU KNOW I M REAL CONCERNED THAT I I DO NT WANT TO BE ON A FIRST FLOOR WHERE YOU CAN HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THINGS LIKE THAT AND THE UM .
DO THEY HAVE MANY BUILDINGS .
THAT HAVE SECURITY THERE .
SOME BUILDINGS DO IT DEPENDS ON THE LOCATION .
THE AREA .
I LIVE IN RIGHT NOW IS IS REAL GOOD AS FAR AS CRIME RATE IS CONCERNED AND WE DO NT HAVE ANYTHING AT ALL NO BURGLAR ALARMS NO GUARDS .
SOME SOME PLACES DO HAVE GUARD GATES THAT YOU HAVE TO GET THROUGH OR ELECTRONIC ACCESS GATES AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
YEAH YEAH WELL I I WENT TO DALLAS UH WHEN I WORKED FOR T I IN ABILENE AND UH .
UHHUH .
I M A LITTLE FAMILIAR WITH THE CITY AREA FOREST LANE AND YOU KNOW THROUGH THAT OFF OFF THE FREEWAY .
UHHUH .
AND UH IT DID NT SEEM LIKE IT WAS THAT CONGESTED IN THAT THAT PART .
YOU KNOW BECAUSE TO ME WHERE WE LIVE OUT HERE IN THE NORTH EAST IT IT S THERE ARE A LOT OF BUILDINGS VERY CLOSE TO EACH OTHER .
UHHUH .
AND THE CITIES ARE VERY POPULATED WITH TENEMENT HOUSING .
UHHUH .
WHERE THERE ARE MORE THAN ONE FAMILY IN A HOUSE .
UM .
AND WITH THE UH PEOPLE .
THAT ARE COMING INTO THE COUNTRY FROM OTHER COUNTRIES NOT KNOWING THE LANGUAGE AND UH THEY THEY RE GOING TO THE BIG CITIES .
IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT .
UHHUH .
IT REALLY DOES AND AND I VE SEEN THE SAME THING THAT YOU RE TALKING ABOUT UH MUCH MORE CRIME THAN EVER BEFORE .
UHHUH .
DRUGS OF COURSE UH A BIG PART OF IT .
I THINK .
UHHUH .
AND UH I DO NT KNOW A LOT OF YOUNGER PEOPLE YOU KNOW INTO MORE VIOLENT CRIMES .
OH YEAH YEAH .
THA THAT THAT S REALLY SAD YOU KNOW YOU GOT YOUNG BOYS OR GIRLS THAT AT FOURTEEN OR TWELVE YEARS OLD THAT ARE COMMITTING MURDERS AND NO REMORSE WHAT SO EVER .
UHHUH .
THERE S A LOT OF THAT GOING ON IN DALLAS TOO .
YEAH .
YEAH IT S REALLY SAD .
IT IS AND AND I DO NT KNOW IF IT S UH THE FAMILY YOU KNOW THING WHERE THEY RE NOT BONDING ANYMORE WHERE MOTHERS ARE WORKING ALL THE TIME AND .
UHHUH .
THE KIDS ARE NT GETTING THE ATTENTION THAT THEY NEED OR THE TELEVISION .
UHHUH .
AND I I REALLY THINK THAT WE RE WE RE FALLING BY THE WAYSIDE WITH NOT INCARCERATING THESE PEOPLE .
OH I AGREE .
I THINK THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING OFF TOO EASY .
THEY RE GETTING THEY RE GETTING PAROLED TOO EASILY .
UH UH .
THEY RE JUST GETTING UH PUT ON PROBATION OR SOMETHING BECAUSE THE PRISONS DO NT HAVE ENOUGH ROOM SO THEY GET THEY GET LIGHTER SENTENCES .
YEAH EXACTLY .
AND SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE THEY DO NT DESERVE TO BE LET LOOSE .
AND UH YOU KNOW THEY HAD UH IN FACT ON THE NEWS LAST NIGHT .
WE WERE WATCHING THIS UH MAN .
WHO LOST HIS TEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER .
HE RAN OUT TO THE STORE FOR A FEW MINUTES AND HE HAD LEFT HER HOME ALONE .
SH NOW TEN YEARS OLD SHE S OLD ENOUGH TO BE ALONE FOR A FEW MINUTES YOU KNOW .
OH YEAH .
AND WHILE HE WAS GONE HE HAD LOOKED WENT LOOKING FOR A JOB AND STOPPED AT THE STORE THAT S WHAT .
IT WAS .
AND UH SOMEONE .
WHO WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD CLEANING CARPETS THESE TWO MEN WENT IN RAPED THE GIRL MURDERED HER .
OH MY GOSH .
AND THE WHOLE BIT .
AND ONE OF THE MEN GOT UH I THINK IT WAS SEVENTEEN YEARS AND THE OTHER ONE WAS IN FOR UH LIFE IMPRISONMENT .
UHHUH .
THE ONE .
THAT WAS IN FOR THE SEVENTEEN YEARS ACTUALLY SERVED SEVEN AND HE S OUT .
UH THAT S TERRIBLE .
AND THE MAN SAID THAT YOU KNOW IF IT WERE NT FOR THE FACT THAT HE WOULD GO TO JAIL THAT HE WOULD ELIMINATE THIS PERSON .
HIMSELF .
UHHUH .
AND THEN GO TO MCDONALDS AND HAVE A HAMBURGER AND NOT THING .
A THING THINK A THING ABOUT IT .
AND I MEAN I THINK THAT WHAT .
THIS IS GOING TO LEAD TO IS PEOPLE WILL TAKE THINGS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS .
YEAH .
AND THAT INNOCENT PEOPLE I I SHOULD NT SAY INNOCENT BECAUSE I MEAN AC ACTUALLY IF THEY COMMIT A CRIME THAT THEY RE IN THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES BUT .
UHHUH .
THE REASONS THAT THEY RE DOING IT COMPARED TO THE REASON .
SOMEONE ELSE IS IN JAIL FOR IT YOU KNOW IT .
S LIKE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS .
YEAH .
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU LOSE SOMEONE THAT YOU REALLY LOVE YOU DO SOME CRAZY THINGS YO I DO NT KNOW .
RIGHT IT S A LITTLE MORE UNDERSTANDABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I GUESS .
I I LIKE THE IDEA THAT UH IF SOMEONE IS FROM A FOREIGN COUNTRY .
UHHUH .
AND THEY COME TO THIS COUNTRY AND UH COMMIT A CRIME I THINK THAT IRREGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE ALREADY BECOME A CITIZEN OR ANYTHING THEY SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY DEPORTED .
UHHUH .
ESPECIALLY IF THEY RE FOUND GUILTY OF THE CRIME .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW ONCE THEY THEY HAVE BEEN ARRESTED AND IF THEY KNOW BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT THESE PEOPLE ARE GUILTY .
UHHUH .
THAT S IT WE DO NT TAKE CARE OF THEM WE DO NT SUPPORT THEM .
UHHUH .
NOTHING I MEAN THEY GO RIGHT BACK WHERE THEY CAME FROM .
RIGHT WE HAVE ENOUGH ENOUGH PROBLEMS WITH OVERCROWDING IN THE JAILS AS IT IS .
SO LET LET THEIR COUNTRY TAKE CARE OF IT .
EXACTLY AND .
WE DO NT HAVE I GUESS TOO MUCH TROUBLE IN DALLAS WITH WELL I GUESS I GUESS WE DO HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE COME IN FROM MEXICO THAT CAUSE PROBLEMS BUT UH .
BUT THAT S UH THE THEY RE SO CLOSE I I DO NT CONSIDER MEXICAN PEOPLE IN THE SAME CATEGORY WITH UH .
YEAH .
ESPECIALLY LIKE UH PEOPLE .
WHO COME FROM CULTURES .
THAT DO NT HAVE THE SAME UH KIND OF MORAL UPBRINGING THAT WE HAVE .
UHHUH .
LIKE YOU TAKE ASIAN COUNTRIES OR UH THE EASTERN COUNTRIES WHERE WOMEN ARE LIKE IN THE FOREGROUND .
UHHUH .
UH IN THE BACKGROUND AND THE MEN ARE IN THE FOREGROUND AND IT S LIKE YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
UM THEY LIVE BACK IN WHE WHERE WE CAME FROM TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW WHE WE VE ADVANCED BEYOND THAT AND I THINK THAT THEIR UH MENTALITY AS FAR AS THE WAY .
THEY TREAT THEM AND THAT KIND OF THING YOU KNOW WHAT .
I MEAN .
UHHUH .
IT WAS AMAZING I WENT TO THE FAR EAST UH BACK IN OCTOBER TO DO SOME TRAINING FOR T I AND I .
UHHUH .
UH SOME OF THOSE COUNTRIES WERE SO SAFE IT WAS UNREAL .
SINGAPORE IS VERY SUPPOSED TO BE VERY SAFE AND IN FACT TOKYO AND I THOUGHT TOKYO WOULD BE DANGEROUS BEING SUCH A HUGE LARGE CITY WITH SO MANY PEOPLE .
YEAH .
BUT THEY AT AT THE T I .
THERE I SAID IS THERE .
ANY AREA .
I SHOULD AVOID .
AND THE GUY SAID LET ME ASK ANOTHER GIRL HERE AND HE TURNED AND ASKED THIS GIRL AND SAID CAN YOU THINK OF ANY PLACE WHERE DANA SHOULD NT GO BY HERSELF OR ANYTHING .
AND SHE SHE THOUGHT FOR A FEW MINUTES AND SHE SAID NO .
AND HE SAID IS THERE .
ANY PLACE .
YOU WOULD NT GO BY YOURSELF .
SHE SAID NO .
AND THEY SAID .
WOW .
IT IS SO SAFE THERE THAT YOU CAN LEAVE YOUR PURSE ON THE SUBWAY AND SOMEBODY WILL TURN IT IN AND AND NOTHING WILL BE MISSING .
THEY SAID THEY CAN JUST ABOUT GUARANTEE THAT THERE THAT THAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU DID THAT .
I THOUGHT BOY IN AMERICA .
WOW .
IF YOU LEFT A PURSE ON A SUBWAY YOU WOULD NEVER SEE IT AGAIN .
YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT IF YOU WOULD NT EVEN HAVE TO LEAVE IT I MEAN .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
IT WOULD GET SNATCHED RIGHT OFF YOUR ARM .
THAT S TRUE .
BUT I WAS THINKING BOY IN DALLAS IF SOMEBODY ASKED ME IF THERE WERE PLACES YOU WOULD NT GO BY YOURSELF AT NIGHT I D HAVE TO SET THEM DOWN FOR ABOUT FIVE OR TEN MINUTES TO LIST ALL THE PLACES OUT .
OH SURE .
I MEAN I COULD NT BELIEVE THAT SHE COULD NT THINK OF ANY PLACE .
THEY SAID THE APPARENTLY THE CRIME IS JUST UH .
THAT S AMAZING WELL WH WHAT S THE DIFFERENCE THERE DO YOU KNOW .
I M NOT SURE WHAT .
IT IS THERE .
NOW I KNOW WHAT .
IT IS IN SINGAPORE IS THEY HAVE THE DEATH PENALTY AND THEY REALLY ENFORCE IT .
OH I I BELIEVE IN THE DEATH PENALTY I REALLY DO .
LIKE FOR DRUGS FOR DRUGS THEY THEY ENFORCE THE DEATH PENALTY FOR THAT .
UH THEY RE JUST VERY VERY TOUGH AND I GUESS MAYBE THAT S THE WAY TOKYO IS TOO OR JAPAN IS TOO .
THEY RE JUST VERY TOUGH ON CRIMINALS .
YEAH YEAH I THINK THAT WE RE TOO EASY .
UHHUH .
UH AND WE TAKE THE THE UH CIVIL LIBERTIES UH STUFF TOO FAR .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW LIKE PEOPLE .
THAT ARE IN PRISON I MEAN WE DID NT PUT THEM THERE .
THEY PUT THEMSELVES IN THAT SITUATION .
UHHUH OH YEAH .
AND AS FAR AS LIKE THEM UH ENTERTAINING THE RIGHTS THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE .
UHHUH .
I MEAN WE EDUCATE THEM WE FEED THEM WE TAKE CARE OF THEM AND THEY NO SOONER GET OUT ON THE STREET AND THEY RE BACK IN AGAIN .
UHHUH .
I M NOT SAYING THEY RE ALL BAD BUT I THINK PEOPLE .
WHO ARE GUILTY OF REALLY SERIOUS HEINOUS CRIMES .
UHHUH .
DO NOT DESERVE TO BE CARED FOR FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES .
RIGHT .
I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE PUT AWAY .
RIGHT AND IF THEY RE OVERCROWDED WELL YOU KNOW .
GET RID OF THEM .
THEY SHOULD NT HAVE GOTTEN THEIRSELF THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE .
EXACTLY .
I I REALLY I I THINK THAT THAT S THE WHOLE KEY HERE .
THIS PLEA BARGAINING BALONEY .
UHHUH .
WHERE UH YOU KNOW THEY PLEAD TO A LESSER CRIME OR UH THEY PLEAD GUILTY IN OR YOU KNOW TELL ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE AND THEY THEY GET LESS TIME .
UHHUH .
OR IF THEY RE IN THERE AND THEY VE GOT SEVENTEEN YEARS AND THEY RE ON GOOD BEHAVIOR FOR EVERY YEAR .
THEY RE IN THEY GET SO MANY LESS YOU KNOW THAT THEY DO NT SERVE THE FULL PENALTY .
UHHUH .
I I I REALLY THINK WE RE GOING TO FAR OVERBOARD WITH ALL OF THIS .
OH YEAH I AGREE BECAUSE IT S NOT FAIR TO THOSE OF US THAT THAT DESERVE A SAFE YOU KNOW LIFE TO HAVE TO .
YEAH SAME WITH DRUNK DRIVERS .
RIGHT .
I THINK IT S TOO EASY FOR THEM .
UHHUH .
THAT IF THE THE LAWS AND AND WERE WERE HARSHER AND WERE ENFORCED .
UHHUH .
I MEAN YOU HAVE TO SET AN EXAMPLE .
YOU HAVE TO START SOMEWHERE .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK THAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT THEY RE GOING TO GET A SLAP ON THE WRIST THEY MIGHT SERVE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME AND THAT THEY LL BE OUT ON THE STREET AGAIN .
UHHUH .
AN IT AN .
I FEEL BAD FOR THE POLICEMAN .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE HE S OUT THERE EVERY DAY FACING THESE PEOPLE .
RIGHT .
THIS THIS CRAZINESS YOU KNOW PEOPLE WITH UH AUTOMATIC WEAPONS AND UH ALL THIS OTHER STUFF AND TRYING TO DO A JOB AND LET S FACE IT WHAT DO THEY GET PAID .
RIGHT NOT MUCH .
TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS .
A YEAR IF THEY RE LUCKY .
I WOULD NT DO IT FOR THAT .
YEAH HUHUH AND ESPECIALLY NOT IN SOME OF THESE BIG CITIES LIKE IN DALLAS I MEAN THEY VE HAD THEY RE UP IN THE TOP TOP FIVE .
I THINK OF CITIES .
THAT ARE GETTING POLICEMAN KILLED ON ON IN THE LINE OF DUTY AND THAT S REALLY SAD .
IT IS IT REALLY IS .
AND I MEAN THEY RE THE FIRST ONES .
THAT TAKE THE BRUNT OF EVERYTHING .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND I M NOT SAYING THAT THEY RE ALL GOOD EITHER BECAUSE THERE S GOOD AND BAD IN EVERYTHING .
UHHUH .
BUT THEY THEY RE ALREADY UH HAVE STR THREE STRIKES AGAINST THEM WHEN THEY RE OUT THERE .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE THEY LL ARREST SOMEONE AND YOU KNOW GO THROUGH ALL THAT PAPERWORK AND WRITING A REPORT AND ALL THIS AND HAVING ALL KINDS OF EVIDENCE AND YOU HAVE TO EVEN BE CAREFUL HOW YOU ARREST THEM HOW YOU TALK TO THEM UH YOU KNOW WHAT .
THEY SAY .
THIS IS ARCHIE .
HI ARCHIE .
I M SHARON .
HAVE YOU SEEN DANCING WITH WOLVES .
YEAH .
I VE SEEN THAT THAT S UH THAT WAS A REALLY GOOD MOVIE .
PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST THINGS ABOUT IT WAS THE SCENERY AND UH I THOUGHT THE STORY WAS PRETTY GOOD TOO .
I I THINK KEVIN COSTNER DID A REALLY GOOD JOB WITH IT .
HAVE YOU EVER LIVED IN THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY .
NO .
I HAVE NT .
HAVE YOU EVER VISITED IT .
UM I VE VISITED THE WYOMING AREA .
I M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHERE DANCES WITH WOLVES WAS FILMED .
I THINK IT WAS THE BLACK HILLS OF SOUTH DAKOTA .
COULD BE .
I N I HAVE NT BEEN TO SOUTH DAKOTA .
HAVE HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO THAT .
WELL I LIVED IN OMAHA FOR FIVE .
OH .
WINTERS .
OKAY .
AND THAT ROLLING KIND OF UH .
TERRAIN .
YEAH .
IS IS FAIRLY FAMILI .
THE THING THAT I THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING WAS THAT THE CRITICS APPARENTLY IT S GOING TO WIN EVERYTHING .
REALLY .
UH AND I HAD BEEN TOLD YOU KNOW YOU WOULD NT NOTICE THAT IT WAS THREE HOURS LONG AND ALL THIS .
THAT S TRUE .
KIND OF .
I AGREE WITH THAT .
UM I I NOTICED YESTERDAY IN THE PAPER SOMETHING SAID THAT IT I THINK IT S BEEN NOMINATED FOR TWELVE AWARDS AND AND ALL THE CRITICS INITIALLY SAID THAT YOU KNOW IT WOULD NT GO ANYWHERE THAT IT WAS JUST GOING TO BE A DUD .
SO IT IT HAS SURPRISED EVERYBODY .
WELL THE INTERESTING THING WAS IS I HAD HEARD THAT AND I I I TEND TO I THINK OVERREACT OCCASIONALLY WHEN SOMEBODY TELLS ME .
IT S THAT GREAT .
AND AND .
UHHUH .
IT WAS THE THING IS IT WAS IT WAS A GOOD STORY .
RIGHT .
AND AND AND I GUESS THAT S WHAT .
I REALLY LIKE .
ALTHOUGH I MUST ADMIT I DID LOOK AT MY WATCH AFTER ABOUT AN HOUR .
DID YOU .
YEAH .
HAVE YOU SEEN SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY .
NO .
I VE HEARD I VE HEARD THAT S REALLY GREAT THOUGH .
Y YOU HAVE TO GO SEE THAT ONE .
AND HOW ABOUT SILENCE OF THE LAMB .
NO .
GO .
YOU MUST REALLY KEEP UP .
I DO .
I GO EVERY WEEKEND .
I I UH THOSE ARE TWO DEFINITE MUST SEE MOVIES I THINK .
WELL IS NT IS NT SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY IS NT THAT A I IS IT IS IT .
A TERROR MOVIE OR IS IT JUST SUSPENSEFUL .
IT S SUSPENSEFUL .
I DO NT THINK IT S VERY T I MEAN THERE S NOT REALLY ANY UH BLOOD AND GUTS IN IT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT .
IT S IT S MORE SUSPENSE .
UM THE OTHER ONE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS IS KIND OF A A GORY MOVIE IF IF SOMEBODY S NOT INTO THAT KIND OF STUFF .
IT S IT S PRETTY GRAPHIC AT POINTS .
BUT UH I THINK THEY RE BOTH EXCELLENT MOVIES .
DO YOU DO YOU LISTEN TO GARY COGILL .
NO .
HUHUH .
IS UH DO YOU KNOW WHO .
HE IS .
YEAH .
SOMEBODY IN SOUTH CAROLINA TOLD ME ABOUT HIM .
HE S A THE MOVIE CRITIC .
UM OH YOU VE OH OKAY .
HE S A MOVIE CRITIC ON CHANNEL EIGHT IN DALLAS .
YEAH .
AND HE DOES UH HE HAS A TALK SHOW ON THE K L I F .
ANYWAY IT S ON FROM SEVEN TO NINE OR SOMETHING .
AND AND AND PEOPLE CALL IN AND IT S IF YOU KEEP UP WITH MOVIES IT S KIND OF INTERESTING .
THERE S A CERTAIN A MOUNT OF DRIBBLE THAT THEY DO .
THEY VE GOT UH THEY VE GOT A COUPLE OF KIDS TEN OR TWELVE YEARS OLD AND THEY CALL IN AND THEY REVIEW MOVIES .
BUT IT S UH .
OH .
HE ANYWAY HE IT S INTERESTING .
YOU LISTEN TO HIM AND THEN YOU YOU GO WATCH THE MOVIE .
IN FACT THEY HAD PEOPLE HAD JUST SEEN I WAS LISTENING SUNDAY NIGHT .
A LITTLE BIT WHEN .
UHHUH .
I WAS GOING TO PICK UP MY DAUGHTER .
BUT ANYWAY IT WAS UH THE IT IT S INTERESTING THOUGH THE THE DIFFICULTY WITH WITH DANCING WITH WOLVES IS THAT WHEN YOU MAKE A MOVIE LIKE THAT AND YOU PRODUCE IT AND THEN YOU STAR IN IT UH THE QUESTION IS DID HE DID HE REALLY KNOW IT WAS GOING TO BE GOOD OR DID HE JUST DO IT .
I THINK THAT I THINK HE REALLY HIS HEART WAS IN IT BUT I I DO NT THINK HE REALLY KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE AS BIG AS IT WAS .
I THINK IT WAS SOMETHING THAT HE REALLY WANTED TO DO .
HE WANTED TO DIRECT IT HE WANTED TO TO STAR IN IT .
YOU KNOW HE HE ENJOYED THE STORY LINE AND I THINK HE JUST REALLY W HE REALLY WANTED IT .
AND WHETHER IT WHETHER IT WON ALL KINDS OF AWARDS OR WHETHER IT JUST WAS OKAY AT THE BOX OFFICE I THINK HE WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY .
BECAUSE I THINK THAT I THINK HE DID A GOOD JOB AND AND THE SELFSATISFACTION .
HE GOT OUT OF IT IS MUCH GREATER THAN ANY AWARDS THAT THEY CAN GIVE HIM .
DO YOU KNOW WHO .
THE GUY WAS THAT WAS PLAYING THE UH THE THE WAGON DRIVER .
UM .
A LITTLE PIECE OF TRIVIA .
YOU KNOW THE GUY WHEN HE FIRST HEADED OUT FROM THE ARMY POST .

I DO NT GUESS WE GOT OUR FIRST UH CREDIT CARD OH BACK IN THE SEVENTIES EARLY SEVENTIES WHEN .
UHHUH .
I FIRST GOT MARRIED WAS A VISA CARD .
UH ISSUED OUT OF A LIBERTY BANK IN OKLAHOMA CITY .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE MY SISTER WORKED AT THE UH THE VISA .
SOME BANK AMERICARD CENTER THERE .
UHHUH .
SO WE WERE STILL IN COLLEGE AND HAD SHE NOT WORKED THERE .
I M NOT SURE THAT I WOULD HAVE QUALIFIED .
THEY VE COME IN HANDY OVER THE YEARS .
YEAH .
UH AND THEY HAVE BECOME OR ALSO A A REAL BOTHER SOMETIMES .
OH TELL ME ABOUT IT .
ESPECIALLY YOU KNOW IF YOU CATCH YOURSELF SHORT ON CASH OR IF YOU RE ON VACATION .
UHHUH .
IT S JUST EASIER TO PUT EVERYTHING ON A CARD .
UHHUH .
AND UH I FIND IF YOU RE NOT CAREFUL YOU WIND UP UH A MONTH OR SO STARING THOSE BILLS IN THE FACE AND YOU GO I DO NT REMEMBER DOING ALL THAT STUFF AND IT ADDS UP .
YEAH THEY ADD UP QUICK .
SO SOMETIMES UH ESPECIALLY TRAVELING WITH T I .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING GOES ON AMERICAN EXPRESS .
UHHUH .
AND IT MAKES IT .
A WHOLE LOT EASIER FOR BOOKKEEPING .
YEAH .
BUT UH AS FAR AS PERSONAL LIFE GOES I GUESS I REALLY TRY TO USE THEM AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE UH .
I .
KIND OF LIKE HAVING THEM FOR UH GASOLINE PURCHASES .
YEAH WE LIKE TO KEEP ONE ON HAND JUST FOR EMERGENCIES YOU KNOW .
BUT .
YEAH .
BUT OTHER THAN THAT UH I I GUESS OVER THE YEARS TRIED TO AVOID THE NATIONAL CREDIT CARD SYNDROME .
UHHUH .
OF JUST PUTTING EVERYTHING ON THERE .
DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY AND THEN .
YEAH .
THEN YOU REALLY GET SOCKED TO IT IF YOU DO NT WATCH IT .
HOW HOW DO YOU LOOK AT COUNTING CREDIT CARDS .
WE JUST UH QUIT USING THEM .
WELL THAT S .
AND THEY GOT US IN TROUBLE WE TOOK A LOAN AND PAID THEM .
ALL OFF .
WE KEEP THEM UH WE KEEP UH ONE GAS CARD AND UH AND UH VISA JUST YOU KNOW IN CASE .
THERE S AN EMERGENCY OR .
RIGHT .
SOMETHING BUT OTHER THAN THAT WE DO NT USE THEM ANYMORE .
WELL THAT S KIND OF THE WAY .
WE WERE DOING IT .
S UH .
UHHUH .
I GUESS FOR THAT VERY REASON THAT THAT UH IF YOU RE NOT REAL CONSCIOUS OF WHAT .
YOU RE DOING .
UHHUH .
IT S JUST TOO MUCH BY THE TIME .
YOU GET WELL IF YOU GOT A BUNCH OF CARDS .
UHHUH .
YOU GET A BUNCH OF BILLS .
EVERY MONTH AND FOR SOME STRANGE REASON THOSE PEOPLE THINK THEY NEED TO GET PAID .
I KNOW IS NT THAT FUNNY .
YEAH .
AND I GIVE THEM MAYBE NOT MAYBE THEY RE NOT REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT GETTING PAID BECAUSE THEY RE KNOW IF YOU DO NT .
THEN THEY RE ADDING ON WHAT EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TWENTY PERCENT .
SOMETIMES .
YEAH .
IT .
S TWENTYTWO PERCENT INTEREST .
YEAH AND THEN SOME OF THEM ADD LATE FEES ON IT .
YEAH .
IF THEY DO NT GET PAID AND .
I GUESS THAT S ONE OF THE MOTIVATIONS BEHIND THE .
UHHUH .
THE UH .
HUH .
MUMBLEX THE UH AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD WITH T I THERE S NO .
HUH .
WITH THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD FROM T I .
UHHUH .
THERE S NO UM LATE FEE THERE S NO UH INTEREST RATE .
OH REALLY .
YOU .
EI YOU EITHER PAY THE THING OFF OR THEY COME GET IT .
AND IT S TURNED INTO PERSONNEL AND THEY COME GET YOU .
SO THEY VE GOT QUITE A BIT MORE MOTIVATION .
I THINK TO GET PAID THEN .
OH YEAH .
SOME OF THE OTHERS DO .
YEAH .
BUT THAT S THE ONE THAT YOUR CALL CENTER MANAGER SEES EVERY MONTH .
UHHUH .
SO YOU RE A LITTLE BIT MORE CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT .
YOU PUT ON THAT .
EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN USE IT HOWEVER YOU WANT TO .
CAN YOU USE THAT ONE FOR PERSONAL USE .
OH YEAH .
OH YOU CAN .
YOU CAN USE IT LIKE ANY OTHER CARD .
UHHUH .
AND UH .
OH I SEE HUH .
BUT IT YOU KNOW YOU .
KIND OF YOU KNOW THAT SOMEBODY EVERY MONTH AND WHO KNOWS HOW MANY PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
ARE LOOKING AT THOSE UH BILLS .
THAT COME IN AND THOSE STATEMENTS .
UHHUH .
YOU RE NOT THE ONLY ONE .
YEAH .
SO YO UH YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT UH IS THAT OKAY IS THAT O OKAY THAT THOSE PEOPLE SEE WHAT .
IT IS THAT YOU ARE BUYING .
YEAH .
AND MOST OF THE TIME .
IT IS .
BUT MOST OF THE OTHERS I VE SENT BACK I MEAN ALL .
YOU GET IS CARD OFFERS I VE GOT THREE CARD OFFERS NOW .
UHHUH .
UH FROM GAS COMPANIES AND UH VISA GOLD AND UH SOME OTHER BANK UH CITIBANK I THINK IS ALWAYS SENDING THE VISA STUFF OUT .
AND I USUALLY JUST THROW THEM AWAY BECAUSE I .
OH I DO TOO I DO NT EVEN OPEN THEM MUCH I THROW THEM OUT .
I DO NT WANT ANOTHER .
ONE I DO NT WANT TO HAVE TO MESS WITH IT .
YOU KNOW YOU CARRY AROUND A WALLET FULL OF CREDIT CARDS .
UHHUH .
AND UH ONE OF THESE DAYS .
IT S GOING TO ALL BE FULL .
A GIRLFRIEND OF MINE FOUND A IT WAS A VISA OR MASTERCARD SHE FOUND AN AD FOR ONE IN LIKE A GOOD HOU HOUSEKEEPING MAGAZINE FOR ELEVEN PERCENT .
OH THAT S NOT BAD .
MUMBLEX SHOOT I NEED ONE OF THOSE .
YEAH .
NO IF THEY DO NT SAY NO ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP ON THEM I LL THROW THEM AWAY .
UM .
UHHUH .
YEARS AGO WELL TH I HAD MY VISA CARD THROUGH THIS BANK IN OKLAHOMA CITY FOR .
UHHUH .
OH PROBABLY FIFTEEN YEARS .
UHHUH .
AND THEN THEY STARTED CHARGING UH ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP FEES AND I SAID ADIOS I M YOU KNOW I M NOT PAYING YOU .
WHY DO THEY DO THAT .
IT S JUST ANOTHER WAY TO MAKE MONEY .
I MEAN .
AS FAR AS I CAN TELL .
I MEAN THEY VE BEEN .
I MEAN THEY GET ENOUGH YOU KNOW ON THE INTEREST .
WELL SURE .
AND THEY I GUESS THEY FIGURE THEY VE GOT ENOUGH PEOPLE OUT THERE WITH CARDS THEY RE GOING TO GET CARDS AT THE .
UHHUH .
TWENTY BUCKS .
A POP .
UHHUH .
THERE S GOING TO BE THAT MUCH MORE .
UHHUH .
UH SO THEN A COUPLE YEARS AGO I FOUND UH A BANK HERE IN PLANO THAT IF YOU KEPT A MINIMUM BALANCE IN ANY KIND OF ACCOUNT WHETHER IT WAS A SAVINGS ACCOUNT OR WHAT .
IT WAS YOU CAN GET A VISA CARD THROUGH THEM AND NO ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP .
UHHUH .
SO I WENT OVER AND JUST STUCK THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN MY SON S SAVINGS ACCOUNT IN HIS NAME AND GOT MY VISA CARD SO .
UHHUH .
AS LONG AS THEY HAVE NO ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP FEE .
HUH .
I IT WOULD BE OKAY BUT I CA NT SEE PAYING SOMEONE TO USE THEIR CARD .
NO I CA NT EITHER .
BE CHARGED THEIR EIGHTEEN PERCENT INTEREST SO .
YEAH .
YEAH I THINK YOU RE RIGHT .
THE BEST PHILOSOPHY IS HAVE THEM IF YOU NEED THEM BUT OTHERWISE LEAVE THEM TUCKED AWAY SOMEWHERE .
YEAH REALLY .
YEAH .
GETS A LOT OF PEOPLE IN IN TROUBLE .
YEAH IT SURE DOES .
MAYBE THEY RE COUNTING ON THAT I DO NT KNOW .
WELL I GUESS THAT S IT .
OKAY .
THANKS FOR TALKING .
NICE TALKING TO YOU .
BYE .
BYEBYE .
SO HOW DO WE FIX THE NATIONAL BUDGET .
DAMNED IF I KNOW UM I DO NT KNOW I SUSPECT UH LET S SEE I SUSPECT WE SHOULD DO WHAT EVERYONE SAYS WE SHOULD DO WE SHOULD CUT SPENDING AND MAYBE EVEN RAISE TAXES BUT LORD KNOWS YOU SH ONE SHOULD NT SAY THAT .
WELL .
I I I SUSPECT WE SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE AN INDEPENDENT AUDITING AGENCY GO IN AND LOOK AT HOW THE GOVERNMENT SPENDS MONEY AND WORK FROM THERE .
THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE GOOD BUT .
BECAUSE I BECAUSE I DO NT THINK THEY RE VERY GOOD AT IT .
SOMETHING THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS NT BEEN LOOKING AT IS THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM .
HUH .
THE TRUE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM IS A THAT WE DO SPEND TOO MUCH .
YES .
BUT ALSO B THAT WE DO NT TAKE IN ENOUGH .
YEAH WELL WH WH WH WHY DO YOU SAY THAT ACTUALLY .
UH TOO FEW AMERICANS ARE WORKING .
HUH .
IF MORE AMERICANS WERE WORKING AND MEANINGFUL GOOD PAYING LABOR .
YES .
AND PAYING TAXES .
RATHER THAN USING TAXES .
AND THE TAX STRUCTURE WAS FAIR BETWEEN THE LOWEST AND THE HIGHEST INCOME AMERICANS THEN WE WOULD HAVE MORE MONEY THERE TO PLAY WITH .
OH THAT S INTERESTING YEAH THAT S PROBABLY TRUE I MEAN WELL WE ALSO WE D BE SPENDING LESS BECAUSE ALL THE MONEY THAT THAT NORMALLY GOES TO SUPPORT THOSE PEOPLE ARE NT WORKING IT S BACK IN THE SYSTEM .
RIGHT .
SO YOU RE RIGHT THAT S A REAL NEAT IDEA WELL WHAT BUT I MEAN WHAT CAN YOU KNOW AT AT SOME POINT WHAT CAN YOU DO TO SORT OF RAISE REV I MEAN TO RAISE JOBS I WONDER .
WELL I HESITATE TO SAY WE OUGHT TO SPEND OURSELVES TO AFFLUENCE BUT IN FACT IN SOME CASES THAT S WHAT WE OUGHT TO DO .
OH OKAY SO START MUMBLEX .
NOT REAGANOMICS THANK YOU .
BUT THAT S NOT GOING TO WORK UH .
UH WHAT I WAS THINKING MORE ALONG THE LINES OF IS START GOING TO SPACE .
HUH AND THAT WAY JUST CREATE MORE JOBS OR WHATEVER .
WELL AT SOME POINT THERE THERE WILL BE ENOUGH JOBS FOR MOST OF THE AB ABLEBODIED AMERICANS .
HUH WELL THAT S A NEAT IDEA .
WE ALSO NEED TO UH ASSURE THAT THERE S SOME WORK IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR .
YEAH THAT S WHAT THAT S WHAT YO YOU THINK SPACE WOULD DO THAT MUCH FOR THAT OR .
I THINK IT WOULD DO SOMETHING FOR IT I THINK WE WOULD FILL UP NEW TECHNOLOGIES BUT I THINK WE SHOULD ALSO DO SOMETHING RATHER RADICAL .
LIKE WHAT .
LEGALIZE MARIJUANA .
OH YOU THINK YOU THINK THAT WOULD UH HAVE A MAJOR EFFECT WELL THAT WOULD PUT A LOT OF CRIMINALS OUT OF BUSINESS FOR A WHILE ANYWAY .
WHAT .
TH THAT MIGHT HAVE A UH A GOOD EFFECT ON ON ON CRIME ANYWAY .
YES UH OKAY I THINK IT WOULD TAKE SOME OF THAT MONEY OUT OF THE HANDS OF CRIMINALS I THINK IT WOULD PUT REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF CARRY ON DRUG USE WHERE PEOPLE ADVANCE FROM ONE DRUG TO ANOTHER .
THAT S PROBABLY TRUE .
I THINK THAT I THINK MOST IMPORTANTLY IT WOULD GIVE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SOMETHING NEW THAT THEY COULD TAX .
AND PROBABLY A LOT OF .
AND PROBABLY A LOT OF AND REALLY RECEIVE SOME REVENUES FROM .
YEAH BUT THAT S POTENTIALLY .
UH IF YOU LOOK AT PROHIBITION HISTORICALLY IT S REPEAL HELPED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT A LOT IN TAX REVENUES .
UHHUH HUH NO I HAD NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT .
THEN I THINK ONCE WE PUT MONEY BACK INTO THE COF IN THE COFFERS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT .
UHHUH .
AND GET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO WHERE THERE S MONEY THERE AGAIN WE SHOULD REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY AND THIS WOULD HAVE TO COME RATHER QUICKLY AND WOULD HAVE TO COME ORIGINALLY ALSO WHERE WE RE NOT PAYING IN SOME CASES WE DO PAY MORE FOR WELFARE RECIPIENTS TO LIVE THEN THEY CAN EARN IN THE TRUE MINIMUM WAGE ENVIRONMENT .
THAT S TRUE WE DO OFTEN TIMES THEY ARE PAID MORE YEAH .
AND YOU CA NT DENY PEOPLE THE RIGHT TO SUPPLY THEIR FAMILIES BETTER THROUGH WHATEVER MEANS .
RIGHT .
THAT S JUST SENSIBLE ON THEIR PART .
THAT S JUST WHAT ON THEIR PART I M SORRY I MISSED THAT .
IT S JUST SENSIBLE ON THEIR PARTS .
OH .
TO GO AFTER THE THE THE GREATER AMOUNT OF INCOME .
UHHUH .
SO IF YOU LOWER THE AMOUNT THEY MAKE AND RAISE THE AMOUNT OF TRUE MINIMUM WAGE JOBS NOT THOSE THAT ARE AFFECTED BY THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE THEN MORE PEOPLE WILL GET OFF WELFARE .
THAT THAT MAYBE TRUE THAT S VERY TRUE .
YOU KNOW GIVE THEM A TRUE INCENTIVE TO WANT TO WORK .
RIGHT .
AND THEN DO NT START LETTING MORE OUTSIDERS IN FOR A FEW YEARS UNTIL WE FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHERE WE RE AT WITH UNEMPLOYMENT .
RIGHT THAT S A .
REDUCE IMMIGRATION .
HUH .
OR ELIMINATE IT ENTIRELY FOR A FEW YEARS UNTIL WE GET OUR OWN HOUSE IN ORDER .
YEAH AND MAYBE EVEN REDUCE AL ALONG THE SAME LINES MAYBE REDUCE IMPORTS AS WELL I THINK .
OH ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY .
I MEAN MUMBLEX WE DO NT NEED TO BUY OTHER PEOPLE S STUFF RIGHT NOW MUMBLEX .
THAT S RIGHT WHEN WE RE IN A WORLD OF HURT WELL I DO NT I M NOT GOING TO SAY THAT WE OUGHT TO RE REDUCE THEM THROUGH LEGAL MEANS I THINK WE OUGHT TO JUST TAX THEM SEVERELY .
RIGHT WELL THAT THAT S WHAT HAPPENED IN OTHER COUNTRY THOUGH AND OTHER PLACES THEY TAX US QUITE HA I MEAN THEY TAX AMERICAN IMPORTS QUITE HEAVILY SO WE COULD DO THE SAME THING I MEAN JUST AND YOU KNOW THEY MAY GET .
IT SEEMS ONLY FAIR .
RIGHT IT DOES SEEM ONLY FAIR I MEAN WHY NOT .
AND I THINK REALLY IF WE GOT ALL THOSE THAT ARE ABLEBODIED INTO THE WORK FORCE REDUCED THE AMOUNT GOING OUT FOR THOSE PURPOSES CREATED NEW JOBS FOR THAT WORK FORCE THERE WOULD BE PLENTY OF MONEY .
I THINK SO .
AND THEN AT THAT POINT .
YES .
QUIT SPENDING ON SPACE .
OH REAL .
FORCE IT ALL INTO THE INTO THE PRIVATE SECTOR .
OH REALLY I LOVE THE SWITCH WELL AT THAT POINT YOU MIGHT WE I I IT WOULD NT BE A PROBLEM ANYMORE POSSIBLY YOU KNOW WE WOULD BE .
THAT S RIGHT .
WE WOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP IT WHEREVER WE WANTED TO IN SPACE OR THE OCEAN RESEARCH WHATEVER WE WANTED TO DO BUT I THINK THE .
UH SPACE WAS JUST A CONVENIENT PLACE FOR ME TO GO BECAUSE THAT WOULD PUT A LOT OF .
RIGHT .
A LOT OF MILLSPEC AND NASA WORK OPERATES TO THE SAME DEMANDING SPECIFICATIONS .
UHHUH .
THAT WOULD PUT A BUNCH OF DEFENSE WORKERS BACK TO WORK .
RIGHT COMPARED TO DEFENSE WELL THAT S A GOOD IDEA WELL IT WELL THE OTHER THING AND THE OTHER THING I I I THINK WE SERIOUSLY NEED TO DO IS UM LIKE I SAY HAVE SOMEONE GO IN AND LOOK AND YOU KNOW AND FIND OUT WHERE IT IS WE RE PAYING TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER TOILET SEAT OR SOMETHING .
YOU KNOW WHAT CAUSES THAT .
UM GREED I SUSPECT .
UH NO YOUR YOUR BUYING LARGE MUMBLEX UH THE GOVERNMENT SPECIFICATIONS .
UHHUH .
SHEETS OF PAPER FOR BUILDING A PAIR OF B V D UNDERWEAR FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT .
YEAH .
IS TWENTYTWO FOOT TALL .
REALLY .
IF IT WAS ALL ON NINE BY ELEVENS STACKED ONE ON TOP OF ANOTHER .
FOR MAKING YOU MEAN GOVERNMENT ISSUE UNDERWEAR .
FOR MAKING GOVERNMENT ISSUE UNDERWEAR .
JESUS .
TO JUST UNDERSTAND THOSE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND OPERATE WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT GUIDELINES .
UHHUH .
COSTS THE COMPANY A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY .
WELL THAT S POTENTIALLY A FAULT OF THE GOVERNMENT THEN I MEAN THAT COULD THINGS LIKE THAT SHOULD .
YES A HUGE AMOUNT OF IT IS NOT THE FAULT OF THE CONTRACTOR .
RIGHT WELL THAT S A I HAD NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE .
UH A HUGE AMOUNT OF WHAT YOU HEAR ON ABOUT THE SEVENTYFIVE DOLLAR HAMMERS .
RIGHT .
AND THE NINE HUNDRED DOLLAR TOILET SEATS DOES NT COME FROM PEOPLE IN THE INDUSTRY IT COMES FROM SENATORS THAT DO NT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT .
HUH .
UH MY JOB IS GOVERNMENT TOOLING SPECIALIST .
OH OKAY SO YOU KNOW ABOUT SOME OF THESE THINGS .
YEAH .
SO WELL YOU RE YOU YOU TAKE THIS SUBJECT MUCH MORE PERSONALLY THAN I DO I SUPPOSE .
I SUPPOSE I DO BECAUSE I VE SEEN A LOT OF THOSE CHANGES THE CHANGES THAT WOMEN HAVE HAD IN THE LAST GENERA WELL YOU KNOW NOT EVEN THE LAST GENERATION THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS .
UHHUH .
TWENTY YEARS GOING FROM WELL TAKE IT BACK THIRTY YEARS I M GOING BACK TOO FAR FROM MY PARENTS GENERATION WHEN MOM STAYED HOME PERIOD .
YEAH .
AND THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS A JOB OR ANY HOPE OF A JOB UNTI WELL UNLESS IF YOU WERE EDUCATED YOU GOT YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT TEACH FOR A YEAR OR TWO BEFORE YOU GOT MARRIED .
YEAH .
AND IF YOU REALLY PUSHED IT YOU TAUGHT UNTIL YOU HAD KIDS OR SOMETHING .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW IF YOU HAD IF YOU WERE A TEACHER .
THEN YOU KNOW THAT WAS IT UNTIL THE KIDS WERE LITTLE .
YEAH YOU YOU WERE NT SUPPOSED TO WANT A JOB .
YES .
THERE WAS NOT THERE S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ANY REASON TO USE THIS EDUCATION OR THIS BRAIN THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN YOUR HOUSE AND YOUR CHILDREN AND HOW CLEAN CAN THE BATHROOM FLOORS BE ON ANY GIVEN DAY .
YEAH .
AND THEN AND THEN OF COURSE TODAY .
IT S SUPPOSED TO BE ALL THE OTHER WAY .
YOU RE SUPPOSED TO ONLY WANT THE JOB AND AND UH YOUR KIDS SHOULD BE TOTALLY HAPPY IN DAY CARE BECAUSE EVERYBODY ELSE GOES TO DAY CARE .
YEAH .
AND AND WE HAVE THESE WONDERFUL PEOPLE .
WHO ARE .
UHHUH .
WHO ARE TOTALLY PREPARED TO TEA TO TEACH YOUR CHILD .
EVERYTHING .
THEY NEED TO KNOW IN DAY CARE .
YEAH BUT .
AND WE LL SEE HOW THE GENERATIONS GO .
BUT UH A REALLY GOOD DAY CARE IS PROBABLY GOING TO COST MORE THAN YOU RE GOING TO MAKE AT THE JOB .
YEAH I AT LEAST FOR A LOT OF WOMEN .
YEAH .
DEPENDING ON ON WHAT .
SHE DID .
I VE I WAS AN ENGINEER WITH UH MECHANICAL ENGINEER WITH T I AND UH I DID IT FOR SIX YEARS AND FOR ONE WELL I HAD ONE WHILE I WAS PREGNANT AND THEN ONE WHILE MY OLDEST WAS A YEAR OLD AND AND IT JUST DROVE ME CRAZY .
DID YOU .
I COULD NOT DO EITHER WELL ENOU I COULD NT PUT IN ENOUGH OVERTIME .
THAT WAS NECESS OR THAT YOU KNOW THINGS .
THAT WOULD COME UP AT WORK THAT WOULD REQUIRE ME TO STAY LATE OR TO COME IN EARLY OR TO DO SOMETHING ON SATURDAYS .
UHHUH .
AS IS YOU KNOW AS IS NEEDED BECAUSE MY HUSBAND FOR A LONG TIME WAS OUT OF THE COUNTRY .
OH YEAH .
ALSO WITH UH WITH WORK FOR LIKE THREE MONTHS AND .
SO IT WAS YOU AND THE KID AND YOUR WORK SCHEDULE IS .
YEAH .
WELL THAT S THE THING SEE YOU KNOW MAYBE IF YOU GET ALONG FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU D BEEN A TECHNICIAN INSTEAD OF AN ENGINEER .
YOU KNOW THE TECHNICIANS WORK THE EIGHT TO FIVE JOB .
YEAH MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER .
AND KNOW WHEN THEY RE GOING TO BE THERE .
YEAH .
BUT IF YOU RE GOING TO BE MORE PROFESSIONAL ORIENTED THEN YOU VE GOT TO HAVE THIS TO BE ABLE TO PERFORM WELL ON THE JOB .
YOU VE GOT TO HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY .
THAT DOES NT REALLY GO WITH THE FAMILY .
YEAH AND SO IT WAS IN MY CASE I JUST UH DECIDED THAT AS LONG AS MY KIDS WERE LITTLE I WOULD BE BETTER OFF AT HOME WITH THEM INSTEAD OF DRIVING MYSELF .
CRAZY TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING AT ONCE .
UHHUH .
SO YOU FIGURE ONE OF THESE DAYS YOU RE GOING TO GO BACK TO BEING AN ENGINEER .
IS THAT WHAT .
YOU RE SAYING .
WELL ACTUALLY I VE FOUND OUT THAT I M NOT GOING TO GO BACK TO BEING AN ENGINEER .
WHAT WILL YOU .
I M I M I M A PHOTOGRAPHER NOW .
OH OKAY YOU VE FOUND SOMETHING ELSE .
I HAVE I HAVE BRANCHED OUT .
I WAS A PHOTOGRAPHER BEFORE BUT WHEN I WENT TO COLLEGE .
IT WAS I FELT LIKE I COULD NT SUPPORT MYSELF IF I DECIDED TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER .
YEAH .
THAT IT WOULD JUST HAVE TO BE A HOBBY AND I M VERY MECHANICAL AND MECHANICAL ENGINEERING INTERESTED ME SO I DID THAT .
AND THEN I YOU KNOW I DID THAT FOR SIX YEARS .
AND THEN I STAYED HOME WITH MY SON AND DID NOTHING .
YEAH .
AND FOUND OUT THAT I WAS THAT YOU KNOW IT WAS GREAT BUT I WAS BORED PART OF THE TIME TOO .
AND I WANTED SOMETHING ELSE TO DO .
YEAH I MEAN YOU FIGURE THERE S GOT TO BE MORE TO LIFE THAN SITTING HERE PLAYING WITH THIS CHILD .
YEAH IT S IT S GREAT WHILE THEY RE REALLY LITTLE BUT AS THEY GET OLDER .
UHHUH .
AND THEY RE MORE INDEPENDENT AND THERE .
S THINGS TO DO THEN IT S GOOD FOR THEM TO GO TO DIFFERENT I MEAN IT HE GOES TO A A MOTHER S DAY OUT PROGRAM NOW ONCE A WEEK .
BOTH OF MY KIDS DO AND SO THEY RE GETTING THEY GET THE SOCIALIZATION WITH OTHER KIDS AND YOU KNOW AND NOT REALLY SCHOOL BUT BUT A DIFFERENT AUTHORITY THAN MOM ONCE IN A WHILE YOU KNOW KIND OF LEARNING HOW TO DEAL WITH SOCIETY .
AND AND THEY NEED THAT YOU KNOW TO BE ABLE TO RELATE TO OTHER PEOPLE BESIDES .
YEAH I THINK THEY DO TOO .
THE SAME PERSON .
EVERY DAY .
AND I NEED IT FOR THE BREAK .
YEAH WELL THAT S THE OTHER THING YOU KNOW THEY TALK ABOUT WOMEN LEAVING THE HOME AND GOING OUT TO WORK WELL STILL TAKING CARE OF THE CHILDREN IS A VERY IMPORTANT JOB .
UHHUH .
AND AND SOMEONE .
S GOT TO DO IT AND BE ABLE TO DO IT RIGHT AND .
AND ENJOY IT THAT S THAT S THE WHOLE THING .
AND IF IT S NOT MOM THEN THEN DAD OR SOMEBODY .
S GOT TO MOVE IN THERE .
YEAH .
AND DO THE JOB BECAUSE THE KIDS REALLY NEED IT .
I THINK THAT S THE THING .
THAT WERE GOING TO SEE WELL I THINK THE BIGGEST THING .
WE RE GOING TO SEE COMING UP IN THE NEXT TEN YEAR EVEN IN THE EVEN NOW THEY RE STARTING TO DO IT BUT I THINK IT S GOING TO BE MORE IN THE NEXT TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS IS THAT THERE S GOING TO BE A LOT OF WOMEN AND THEY RE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK IT OUT TO WORKING PART TIME .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE IF IF I HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO WORK YOU KNOW MAYBE THIRTY HOURS .
A WEEK INSTEAD OF FIFTY HOURS .
A WEEK I MIGHT STILL BE WORKING BASICALLY FULL TIME OR PART TIME IF THERE WAS IF THERE HAD BEEN .
YEAH .
SOME WAY TO WORK IT OUT BECAUSE I LIKED MY JOB REALLY WELL .
UHHUH .
BUT I WAS JUST PULLED IN SO MANY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS I WAS IT WAS JUST DRIVING ME CRAZY .
AND NOW WITH THE PHOTOGRAPHY THAT S YOU KNOW IT S WORKING THAT S WHAT .
I M DOING IS WORKING PART TIME BECAUSE I CAN PUT MY KIDS IN A DAY CARE SITUATION FOR A FEW HOURS IN THE UH WEEK .
YEAH .
AND USE THOSE HOURS TO DO .
THE THING THAT I M DOING IS TAKING SCHOOL PICTURES .
YEAH .
IN DAY CARES AND IN MOTHER S DAY OUT PROGRAMS AND .
YEAH .
ALSO SOCCER TEAMS AND YOU KNOW DIFFERENT STUFF LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
SO MY KIDS CAN BE IN DAY CARE FOR A FEW HOURS .
A WEEK OR MY HUSBAND IF IT S YOU KNOW UH WHEN HE S AT HOME CAN TAKE CARE OF THEM .
YEAH SO JOBS HAVE TO I GUESS BECOME MORE FLEXIBLE .
I THINK THEY RE REALLY GOING TO HAVE TO AND NOT AND NOT JUST FOR MOTHERS FOR FATHERS AS WELL .
YEAH .
IT S GOING TO HAVE TO BE BOTH .
WELL SO SO THAT S ANOTHER THING .
THAT HAS TO ADAPT IS YOU KNOW THE THE FATHER S ATTITUDES ABOUT YOU KNOW WHO WHOSE JOB IS THIS .
YEAH .
WELL IT IT S HIS JOB TOO .
AND I TO ME .
THE ONLY IMPORTANT ISSUE IS THE CHILDREN BECAUSE AS FAR AS HOUSEWORK GOES YOU KNOW MEN CAN DO HOUSEWORK JUST AS EASILY AS WOMEN AND THANKS TO A LOT OF NEW INVENTIONS HOUSEWORK DOES NT TAKE AS MUCH TIME AS IT USED TO .
SO UH .
IT S JUST CONVINCING YOUR HUSBAND .
YEAH CONV YEAH JUST YEAH CON .
THAT THAT S IMPORTANT OR THAT IT S IMPORTANT ENOUGH FOR HIM TO DO IT .
YEAH WELL .
BECAUSE IF HE SAW MOM DOING ONLY THAT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW ALL THE TIME .
HE WAS GROWING UP .
YEAH .
THEN IT S HARD TO THINK OF IT .
AND YOU YOU YOU .
IN THAT OTHER UH THAT I SHOULD DO IT .
YEAH YOU TALK YEAH .
OR JUST TO THINK ABOUT DOING IT RATHER THAN HAVING SOMEONE .
YEAH .
TELL HIM TO DO IT .
I KNOW THAT WAS A BIG THING IN OUR HOUSE FOR A .
UHHUH .
LONG TIME WAS THAT IF I WANTED MY HUSBAND TO DO SOMETHING TO HELP AND EVEN THOUGH WE WERE BOTH WORKING THE SAME NUMBER OF HOURS AND AND DOING THINGS I HAD TO COME IN THERE SPECIFICALLY AND SAY .
YEAH .
THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE THIS IS WHAT .
YOU DO IT NOW .
AND A MAN MIGHT SAY OUT LOUD WELL YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THIS AND I AGREE BUT STILL HE WAS RAISED WITH A MOM TAKING CARE OF HIM .
YES AND .
AND THAT S A VERY HARD ATTITUDE TO CHANGE .
YEAH AND WITHOUT AND AND IT S JUST THEY DO NT LOOK AT THINGS .
MOST OF THE MEN DO NT WALK INTO THE KITCHEN AND SEE THAT THE DISHES ARE THERE AND THAT YES YOU PROBABLY OUGHT TO UNLOAD THE DISHWASHER AND LOAD THE NEW ONES IN AND RUN IT .
UHHUH .
THEY JUST YOU KNOW JUST SCOOT IT ON ANOTHER SPOT ON THE SINK AND PUT THE NEXT PLATE DOWN AND IN A WHILE GET AROUND TO IT .
AND I THINK MOST WOMEN WALK IN AND AND AND WITH OH GOT TO CLEAN ALL THIS UP .
GOT TO GET THIS OUT AND THIS IN AND THIS YOU KNOW TAKEN CARE OF INSTEAD OF HAVING SOMEONE SAY .
YEAH UHHUH YEAH .
NOW THIS NEEDS TO BE DO THIS IS THE TIME .
THIS NEEDS .
UHHUH .
TO BE DONE BUT .
AND A LOT OF THAT IS IS HOW IT WAS DRILLED INTO YOU WHEN YOU WERE A KID .
THAT S RIGHT .
WHICH BRINGS US BACK TO THE IDEA YOU KNOW SOMEONE .
S GOT TO BE THERE TAKING CARE OF THE KIDS TO DRILL IN THESE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW DRILL IN THE RIGHT IDEAS .
YEAH .
TO SO THAT THEY KNOW THAT UH YOU KNOW MALE AND FEMALE ARE BOTH RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING THIS .
UHHUH .
AND UH .
AND I THINK THAT S THAT S GOING TO SHOW UP A LOT MORE NOW IN THE IN THE NEXT GENERATION OF OF BOYS AND GIRLS .
IT S NOT THEY RE NOT GOING TO THE BOYS IN THIS NEXT GENERATION ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO BE TOLD AS MUCH .
UHHUH .
THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE BECAUSE MOM WAS THERE SAYING .
YEAH .
THAT DAD IS THERE YOU KNOW YOU .
BOTH GOT TO THEY WERE .
UM .
BOTH WORKING AT WHATEVER THINGS WERE NEEDED TO BE DONE .
UHHUH .
THEY RE GOING TO SAY TO THE KIDS .
UHHUH .
YOU NEED DO THIS BECAUSE IT NEEDS TO BE DONE .
YEAH .
NOT BECAUSE IT S A WOMAN S JOB OR A MAN S JOB BUT BECAUSE IT S DIRTY .
YEAH .
AND IT NEEDS TO BE CLEAN .
BUT I THINK IN BETWEEN WE GOT A GROUP OF KIDS A GENERATION OF KIDS .
WHO DID NT LEARN TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE MOM LEFT TO GO GET A JOB AND DAD DID NT MOVE IN TO FILL THE GAP .
AND SO BASICALLY NO ONE WAS TAKING THE RESPONSIBILITY .
AND IT S GOING TO .
AND I THINK THAT S HAPPENED IN A LOT OF CASES .
IT S GOING TO YEAH SOME KIDS ARE REALLY HAVING IT .
IF THEY D BEEN IN DAY CARE THE ENTIRE TIME AND IT .
WAS NT YEAH THE ONES .
THAT ARE NOW GETTING TO BE TEENAGERS AND IN SOME CASES YOUNG COLLEGE .
UHHUH .
UN YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
SOME TIME DAY CARE IS REALLY GOOD BUT SOMETIMES IT S JUST IT S BABYSITTING .
YEAH .
IT .
S .
SOMEONE YOU KNOW KEEPING AN EYE ON THE KIDS BUT THE KIDS ARE BASICALLY DOING WHAT .
THEY WANT .
YEAH .
AND NOT REALLY HAVING ANY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ADULTS TO SAY YOU KNOW HERE S WHAT S RIGHT AND HERE S WHAT .
WRONG AND HERE S WHAT .
WE EXPECT OF YOU .
YEAH I THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS THAT I QUIT WAS BECAUSE I WANTED MY KIDS TO HAVE MY VALUES AND I FELT LIKE WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG THAT WAS THE TIME TO INSTILL IT .
YEAH .
THAT IT COULD BE IT COULD BE ADDED TO AND STRENGTHENED AS THEY GREW OLDER BUT WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE YOU KNOW THIS IS THE WAY .
I FEEL ABOUT THIS AND THIS IS THE WAY BECAUSE I IT S THAT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WHEN YOU IF YOU IF YOU TEACH THEM WHEN THEY RE LITTLE THE WAY .
YOU WANT THEM TO BE AND THE THINGS .
THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO YOU THEN YOU JUST YOU ADD ONTO IT AS THEY GET OLDER .
UHHUH .
BUT IF NO ONE DOES ANYTHING WHEN THEY RE LITTLE THEN IT S TWICE AS HARD AS I THINK AS THEY GET OLDER .
YES .
I M SAYING THIS AS I M TRYING TO KEEP MY NINE MONTH OLD FROM TRASHING SOMETHING .
YES I UNDERSTAND I WAIT UNTIL I PUT MINE IN BED BEFORE I MAKE MY CALLS .
YEAH WELL SHE S USUALLY IN BED BY THIS TIME BUT SHE S STAYING UP LATE TONIGHT .
BUT YEAH I WANT TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH HER .
YOU KNOW MY DAD WAS A VERY TRADITIONAL DAD AND WHEN I WAS A CHILD .
I DID NT REALLY KNOW MY DAD VERY WELL AND I MISS THAT .
AND I WANT .
THAT S .
THE THING IF WOMAN S ROLE LIKE WE SAID IF WOMEN S ROLES CHANGE DRASTICALLY MEN S ROLES WILL TOO .
YEAH BUT MEN HAVE TO BE CONVINCED OF THAT .
AND A LOT OF IT S FOR THE BETTER .
SOME OF THE SOME OF THE WOMEN S ROLES I THINK ARE ALMOST FOR THE WORSE BECAUSE WE RE LOSING OUT ON SOME THINGS GOING BACK TO WORK BUT I THINK IF WE CAN IF WE CAN EXPAND THE MEN S ROLES AT THE SAME TIME LIKE YOUR TAKING CARE OF YOUR CHILD AND YOUR DAD PROBABLY DID NT VERY OFTEN .
NO .
I KNOW MINE ALMOST NEVER DID .
ARE YOU A T I ER .
UH YEAH I AM .
OH GOOD .
YEAH YEAH I VE .
YEAH UH SHE .
BEEN UH .
HAD A HARD TIME GETTING A FEW FOLKS UH I THOUGHT WELL EVERY ALL THESE T I ERS HAVE GONE HOME UH .

AND I GUESS THAT S DIVERSION UH I I VE I VE TRIED A FEW GROUPS UH YOU KNOW WHERE YOU I CAN RECOMMEND IT FOR PEOPLE TO TAKE THEIR CARS LIKE I THINK SEARS IS PROBABLY THE BEST PLACE .
YEAH .
BECAUSE .
YEAH .
I VE HEARD WHEN I USED TO GO THERE AND WHEN I I JUST OVERHEARD WHAT THEY DID FOR ME VERY LITTLE BECAUSE I DID NT TAKE IT THAT MUCH BUT WHAT I HEARD THEM TELL OTHER PEOPLE WAS ALWAYS RIGHT .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW WHEN I SAT THERE I YOU KNOW I DROPPED MY CAR OFF FOR TIRES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .

OH WELL I WAS IN THAT UH BIG TORNADO WENT THROUGH WICHITA FALLS .

UHHUH .
AND A WHOLE ROOF OF A RESTAURANT CAME OFF AND UH IT WAS A EERIE UH A REAL EERIE BLUEGREEN COLOR .
YEAH .
AND THE LIGHTNING WAS ALMOST CONTINUOUS JUST UH YOU KNOW AS IF YOU PUT YOUR HAND ON ONE OF THOSE ELECTRIC UH THINGS THAT CAUSES LIGHTNING .
UHHUH .
UH I THINK IT WAS CALLED THE STORM .
YEAH THAT S IT .
BUT UM THE S THE WHOLE SKY WAS FULL OF THAT EERIE BLUEGREEN UH LIGHTNING .
WOW AND THAT S ABOUT THAT S WHAT WE GET THIS TIME OF YEAR JUST ALL THE WAY SOMETIMES ALL THE WAY THROUGH JUNE THE LAST ESPECIALLY THE LAST TWO YEARS IT S RAINED UH WHAT I THINK IT RAINED NINE INCHES IN IN ONE ONE OF THE JUNES THE LAST TWO YEARS .

IF THEY GIVE YOU .
CARD .
UHHUH .
AT NO CHARGE FOR A WHOLE YEAR THAT YOU WILL USE IT AND .
THAT S RIGHT .
SEE THEY MAKE MONEY OFF OF IT WHETHER YOU USE IT OR NOT .
ABSOLUTELY .
WELL THE OTHER THING OF COURSE IS THE FACT THAT THEY HOPE .
YOU WILL NOT PAY YOUR BILL AT THE END OF THE MONTH .
THAT S RIGHT .
SO THAT YOU WOULD BE PAYING INTEREST .
UHHUH .
I USE MINE A GREAT DEAL UM FOR GROCERIES FOR EVERYTHING THAT I CAN AND .
UHHUH .
THEN JUST WRITE ONE CHECK AT THE END OF THE MONTH .
THAT S WHAT .
I DO .
FOR THE ENTIRE THING RIGHT .
THAT S WHAT .
I DO .
JUST A SECOND SORRY .
THAT S ALL RIGHT .
SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE A LITTLE ONE THERE .
I HAVE TWO LITTLE ONES .
YES .
OH YOU HAVE .

A T M MACHINES .

MY HUSBAND DOES AT WORK JUST TO GET CASH OUT BUT UH I TAKE THE CHECKBOOK SO I YOU KNOW I JUST IF I NEED CASH I JUST TELL HIM AND HE GETS IT OUT AND I DO NT EVEN THINK I KNOW MY NUMBER .
WELL I FIND IT .
A GREAT USE FROM THE STANDPOINT THAT YOU DO NT HAVE TO CONTINUE TO WRITE CHECKS .
UHHUH .
IN ORDER TO GET CASH .
THAT S RIGHT .
SEE WE HE COULD NT DO WITHOUT IT H BUT YOU KNOW SINCE HE CAN JUST DO IT RIGHT THERE AT WORK .
OH THAT HELPS .
FOR NOTHING .
RIGHT .

WELL THE THE OTHER THING .
SOME PEOPLE ARE NOT AWARE OF IS THEY WILL USE THEIR A THEIR CREDIT CARD LIKE THEIR VISA OR THEIR MASTERCARD FOR CASH .
UHHUH .
AND WHEN THEY DO THAT THEY BEGIN PAYING INTEREST RIGHT FROM THAT VERY DAY ON .
YOU RE RIGHT .
AND THAT S KIND OF SILLY .
YEAH RIGHT .
ABSOLUTELY .
YEAH .
BECAUSE THEY .
YOUR DEFEATING THE PURPOSE .
THEY FIGURE THAT THAT S CORRECT .
THE IDEA IS TO USE THEIR MONEY .
YEAH .
AND UH DURING THAT WHOLE MONTH AND .
YEAH .
THEN PAY IT AT THE END OF THE MONTH .
YEAH I MEAN I GET I GET AT LEAST ONE OR TWO .
A WEEK .
UHHUH .
PEOPLE T YOU KNOW SENDING ME .
A CREDIT CARD OR CALLING ME ON THE PHONE AND I JUST SAY I DO NT WANT IT .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE I .
WELL I THINK THAT S THE ONLY THING .
YOU CAN DO IS JUST SAY NO AND MEAN NO AND .
YEAH .
IT .
S LIKE .
NOT BE TEMPTED .
I D LIKE TO KNOW WHERE THEY DETERMINE THAT I M SUCH A GOOD CREDIT RISK THAT THEY CAN GO AND SAY YOU GET THIS MUCH CREDIT LINE .
YOU KNOW .
WELL I .
YOU VE ALREADY BEEN PREAPPROVED .
OH ABSOLUTELY PREAPPROVED .
THAT S THEIR FAVORITE WORD .
YES .
EVERYBODY IN THE COUNTRY IS PREAPPROVED I THINK .
I THINK SO YOU RE RIGHT .
SO .
WELL IT S INTERESTING UH THAT UH .
YEAH .
PEOPLE HAVE THE GENERALLY THE SAME VIEW .
UHHUH .
OF CREDIT CARDS .
YEAH .
NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO .
AND THEN SOME PEOPLE THEY GET SO WRAPPED UP IN THEM THAT THEY FIND YOU KNOW ONE DAY .
THEY FIND WOW I DID NT REALIZE I HAD THIS MUCH .
THAT MUCH STUFF .
YOU KNOW I D SPENT THIS MUCH MONEY .
RIGHT .
AND THEN THEY CA NT MEET THE MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENTS ON IT .
WELL AND SOME PEOPLE USE ONE CREDIT CARD TO PAY FOR ANOTHER CREDIT CARD .
THEY OWN .
UHHUH .
AND I MEAN THAT DOES NOTHING BUT EXACERBATE THE ENTIRE PROBLEM .
YEAH IT DOES BECAUSE YOU RE YOU KNOW YOU YOU RE YOU KNOW YOU RE JUST CO COSTING YOURSELF MORE MONEY BECAUSE YOU IF YOU CA NT MAKE THE MONTHLY THE MINIMUM PAYMENT YOU RE PAYING INTEREST .
THAT S RIGHT .
AGAIN SO .
THAT S RIGHT .
YEAH SO .
WELL IT S BEEN ENJOYABLE TALKING WITH YOU .
YEAH .
IT .
S ENJOYABLE TALKING WITH SEEING THAT SOMEBODY FEELS THE SAME WAY SO WELL .
RIGHT .
WELL TAKE GOOD CARE .
TAKE CARE OF YOUR LITTLE ONES .
YOU YOU TOO .
GOOD LUCK .
UHHUH .
BYEBYE .
BYEBYE .
THERE YOU GO .
WHAT DO YOU THINK INVADES YOUR PRIVACY .
OH WELL PEOPLE THAT CALL ON THE PHONE ALL THE TIME TO TRY TO SELL YOU SOMETHING YOU KNOW THAT THAT TRY TO SELL YOU THE S NEWSPAPER AND UH WHA CARPET CLEANING AND UH WHAT ELSE ROOF REPAIR AND ENOUGH WELL I THINK IT S A WASTE OF PAPER THE PEOPLE THAT ALWAYS LEAVE UH JUNK MAIL AND BECAUSE UM YOU JUST END UP THROWING IT AWAY MOST OF THE TIME PROBABLY EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE THE JUNK MAIL THAT YOU GET IS IS UM SOMETHING THAT YOU DO NT NEED AND THE SAME WAY WITH THOSE CALLS WHAT IS IT OH M C I M C I REALLY DOES EVEN WHEN YOU TELL THEM NO THEY KEEP CALLING BACK .
M C I WHAT S THAT .
M C I IT S THE LONG DISTANCE TELEPHONE COMPANY .
OH NOW SEE I I REALLY DO NT HAVE MUCH TROUBLE WITH I JUST SAY NO THANK YOU AND HANG UP .
UHHUH WELL THEY WO THEY WO NT TAKE A NO FOR AN ANSWER HERE FOR SOME REASON THEY JUST KEEP CALLING BACK .
I HAD A CARPET SERVICE CALL UP THREE TIMES .
UHHUH .
ALL WITHIN IN AN HOUR BUT I UH I DO TELEMARKETING .
UHHUH .
SO UH I M VERY POLITE AND I JUST SAY NO THANK YOU AND SAY NO THANK YOU VERY POLITELY AND I HANG UP AND .
UH .
DO NT BOTHER ME AFTER THAT .
YEAH .
SO I THINK THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY BOTHERS ME IS IF WHEN SOMEBODY CONTACTS ME AND THEY TRY TO GET INFORMATION OUT OF ME .
UHHUH .
LIKE THE CENSUS BUREAU UNITED STATES CENSUS BUREAU .
OH YEAH .
THAT BOTHERED ME .
UHHUH .
I DID NT FEEL THEY HAD A RIGHT TO KNOW HOW MANY BEDROOMS WERE IN MY HOUSE EVEN .
RIGHT .
THAT I THINK IS MY INVASION PRIVACY BECAUSE IT S THE GOVERNMENT AND I DO NT UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR NEED TO KNOW IS .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK THAT IS MY BIGGEST OBJECTION TO ANYTHING AS FAR AS INVADING MY PRIVACY IF SOMEBODY WANTS PERSONAL INFORMATION OUT OF ME BUT TELEPHONE CALLS I FIGURE THEY DO NT BOTHER ME ONE WAY OR THE OTHER .
UHHUH .
UH I KNOW WHEN I DO TELEMARKETING UM I M A SOFT PERSON IF IF SOMEONE SAYS I AM NOT INTERESTED I LL JUST SAY FINE AND BACK OUT .
UHHUH .
AND I MAKE VERY GOOD SALES BUT I M NOT UH AS I SAID I M NOT HALF AS PUSHY AS THESE PEOPLE BECAUSE I DO NT REALLY CARE I MEAN IF IF THEY RE NOT INTERESTED FINE YOU KNOW THAT S IT .
YOU CA NT FORCE THEM TO BE .
RIGHT .
NO .
AND I M NOT PUSHING SOMETHING DOWN THEIR THROAT THAT UH I DO NT THINK IS A GOOD ITEM ANYWAY .
UHHUH .
THAT I DO NT THINK I COULD DO ANYWAY BUT I FEEL LIKE OH MOVIE STARS OR SURE IT S PART OF THEIR I GUESS THEY RE PORTRAY BEING A MOVIE STAR THEY GET THEMSELVES IN THESE RAG SHEETS BUT UH I THINK THEY GO TOO FAR .
OH YEAH .
I THINK THAT S INVASION OF PRIVACY .
BECAUSE THEY FOLLOW THEM AROUND TWENTYFOUR HOURS A DAY .
YEAH .
AND YOU KNOW THEY DO TED KENNEDY .
OH YEAH .
OF COURSE HE S BREAKING THE LAW ALL THE TIME SO IT S A DIFFERENT STORY THEN YOU KNOW BUT BUT ED MCMAHON I MEAN YOU KNOW WHO CARES ABOUT ED MCMAHON HE S PROBABLY HAS NT DONE ANYTHING INTERESTING IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS THAT THEY VE BEEN ON THE AIR .
YOU KNOW AND HE HAS A CHAUFFEUR MAYBE HE DRINKS BUT HE NEVER DRIVES A CAR EITHER YOU KNOW IT S NOT THE SAME WITH JOHNNY CARSON .
NO I THINK MY SERIOUSLY MY CLASSIFICATION OF OF INVASION OF PRIVACY IS TRYING TO GET PERSONAL INFORMATION .
UHHUH .
AND PUTTING IT FALSELY OUT OR JUST BOMBARDING ME FOR THE ANSWERS .
WITHOUT YOUR AND WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION .
RIGHT .
UHHUH .
THIS TO ME IS IS MY INVASION OF PRIVACY .
RIGHT .
ANYTIME I CAN HONESTLY SAY NO OR THROW THE PAPER AWAY OR BUT YOU CAN ALWAYS WRITE TO UH OH I FORGOT THE NAME OF IT AND STOP THE JUNK MAIL THAT I VE DONE BECAUSE I DO NT WANT JUNK MAIL ANYWAY SO I C WROTE TO THEM WHEN IT CAME ON THE AIR SO I DO NT GET ANY OF THAT BULL THA IT WORKS BY THE WAY .
OH GOOD .
BUT UH THE TELEPHONE DOES NT BOTHER ME BECAUSE I LEAVE IT HALF THE TIME ON UH YOU KNOW ANSWERING SERVICE ANYWAY .
UHHUH .
UNLESS I M HOME SO I FIGURE I CAN TURN IT OFF ONE WAY OR THE OTHER BUT I THINK THAT S THE ONLY BOTTOM LINE THING THAT I DISLIKE BECAUSE IT DOES OTHER THAN THE U S CENSUS UM WHAT WAS IT OH THE THE CARPET PLACE THAT CALLED ME THREE TIMES .
UHHUH .
THAT I FELT WAS INVASION BECAUSE IT WAS THE SAME CARPET PLACE AND CALLED ME THREE TIMES .
I MEAN ONE SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT .
THAT S RIGHT .
BUT IF PEOPLE DO NT USE THE TELEPHONE IT S LIKE I DO NT KNOW WHEN THE POLICE HAS THEIR PROJECT GOING AND I DO NT KNOW WHEN THE OTHER ONES HAVE THEIR PROJECT GOING AND WHEN THEY WANT TO PICK UP DOWN MY STREET FOR THINGS THAT S THE ONLY WAY I KNOW .
UHHUH .
AND UH THAT S I .
WELL YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE TELEPHONE BUT YOU CA NT YOU KNOW AND AND IT S SOMETIMES IT S HARD TO SCREEN OUT ALL THE CALLS THAT YOU DO NT WANT .
WELL SEE THERE S NO WAY OF KNOWING .
UHHUH .
THAT S YOU KNOW THAT S THE PROBLEM LIKE THE PRODUCT I SELL UH I SELL MOSTLY TO OLDER PEOPLE WHICH CA NT GET IT IN A NORMAL PUBLIC SITUATION THE ONLY WAY WE D GET TO THEM IS BY TELEPHONE .
UM .
AND UH MOST OF THEM LIKE IT BECAUSE THE COMPANY I WORK FOR IS NATIONWIDE AND UH REPUTABLE AND THEY KNOW THAT HEY WE RE BACKING IT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT .
YE UHHUH .
BUT IF WE WERE DENIED THE RIGHT TO CALL PEOPLE UP THESE PEOPLE WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO GET IT BECAUSE YOUR NORMAL COMPANIES THAT OFFER IT DO NOT OFFER IT IN THE AMOUNTS THAT WE DO AND THEY D NEVER HAVE IT THEN AT THAT POINT .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE WE OFFER IT IN A VERY LOW YOU KNOW QUANTITY .
SO I MEAN I I DO NT KNOW WHAT TO DO AS FAR AS THAT S CONCERNED BUT IT IS NERVE RACKING I MEAN IT IS NERVE RACKING TO HAVE THE TELEPHONE BUT AT LEAST AS I SAID YOU CAN ALWAYS SAY NO THANK YOU .
RIGHT UHHUH .
I GATHER YOU GET A LOT OF TELEPHONE CALLS .
SOMETIMES YEAH SOME DAYS IT JUST RINGS OFF THE WALL .
YES YES YES IN OTHER WORDS YOU OWN YOUR OWN HOME .
NO NO .
I THINK THAT S WHERE THEY HIT MOST OF US LIKE I OWN MY OWN HOME .
UHHUH .
AND YOU JUST KNOW ABOUT WHAT TIME LIKE SOME DAYS I HATE STAYING HOME BECAUSE THE PHONE RINGS ALL THE TIME BUT UH I DO NT KNOW I HAVE NT BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE THAT OUT SOMETHING ELSE TO DO ABOUT IT WHEN THEY CALL UP AND WANT TO SAY WELL TELL ME THIS THIS THIS THIS AND I LL GIVE YOU A FREE SOMETHING OR OTHER .
UHHUH .
MY ANSWER IS NO THANK YOU I DO NT NEED IT AND THEY SAY WELL DO NT YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT S FREE AND I S NO IF I HAVE TO GIVE THEM SO MUCH TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS TO GET FIFTY ROLLS OF FILM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THEY RE TAKING SOMETHING AWAY FROM ME AND I DO NT LIKE THAT .
RIGHT YEAH EVEN IF I GUESS IT S FOR COUPONS THEY THEY HAVE A SURVEY THEY RUN AND IT I GUESS IT ONE OF THEM IS SUPPOSED TO BE A SMOKERS SURVEY BUT THE QUESTIONS GO A LOT FARTHER THAN HAVING TO DO ANYTHING WITH SMOKING .
UHHUH .
AND THEY ASK THA YOU KNOW THEY START OUT AND THEY ASK YOU EVEN EVEN TO YOUR INCOME LEVEL I THINK THAT S YOU KNOW WHETHER YOU BUY A T V DINNER OR NOT I DO NT THINK IT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH .
WHAT TYPE OF LAWN AND GARDEN WORK DO YOU DO .

I DO NT KNOW UNLESS IT .
LABOR INTENSIVE OR SOMETHING .
I REALLY .
I GUESS .
DO NT KNOW .
BUT WE RE GOING TO TRY THAT .
THAT WILL BE INTERESTING .
AND SEE HOW THAT WORKS .
AN EXPERIMENT .
YEAH .
I D LIKE TO TRY YOU KNOW JUST TRY SOMETHING NEW .
SURE .
EVERY YEAR THAT .
YEAH .
I HAVE NT TRIED BEFORE AND .
THAT S INTERESTING .
WELL .
WELL I LL LET YOU GO IT S .
SO P C S PERSONAL COMPUTERS DO YOU HAVE A PERSONAL COMPUTER .
NO I DO NT NOT AT HOME .
UHHUH .
I WORK WITH THEM QUITE A BIT THOUGH .
UHHUH I I WORK WITH THEM AT KELLY SERVICES DOING UH DATA ENTRY .
OH OKAY .
UHHUH WHAT DO YOU WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THEM .
WELL I THINK THEY RE USEFUL I THINK THEY RE IN SOME INSTANCES THEY RE THEY RE OVER USED WELL THAT S NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO SAY IT .
YOU MEAN INSTEAD OF PEOPLE OR .
WELL I THINK THAT UH SOME SOME WORK PLACES WHERE I VE BEEN THEY THEY SET UP LIKE EVERY BODY HAS THEIR OWN P C .
UHHUH .
WHICH A LOT OF TIMES EVERYBODY DOES NT NEED A P C AND IT REALLY WITHOUT THEM KNOWING HOW TO USE IT PROPERLY IT SLOWS THEM DOWN MORE THAN IT HELPS THEM ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING .
RIGHT .
THEY SPEND MORE TIME MESSING WITH THE P C THAN THEY WOULD ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISHING THE TASKS THAT THEY RE TRYING TO DO IF THEY DID NT HAVE A P C AT ALL .
UHHUH AND YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TYPE PRETTY FAST BEFORE YOU KNOW BEFORE IT REALLY SAVES TIME .
UHHUH THAT S TRUE .
UHHUH .
AND YOU HAVE TO YOU KNOW BE FAMILIAR WITH IT LIKE THERE RE SO MANY DIFFERENT SOFTWARE PACKAGES IT YOU HAVE TO BE FAMILIAR WITH THE ONE THAT YOU RE GOING TO BE USING MOST .
UHHUH .
A LOT OF TIMES UH PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT HALF OF THE CAPABILITIES OF A PACKAGE THAT THEY SHOULD KNOW TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO USE IT PROPERLY AND SO THEY WASTE MORE TIME WITH THEIR TRYING TO UH FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO YOU KNOW OTHER THINGS THAN THEY WOULD IF THEY IF THEY ACTUALLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THEY WERE TRYING TO DO YOU KNOW LIKE UH THEY WANT TO TO FORMAT A REPORT A CERTAIN WAY .
UHHUH .
AND IF THEY REALLY UNDERSTOOD THE CAPABILITIES OF THE PACKAGE THEY COULD THEY COULD DO THAT IN ABOUT YOU KNOW HALF THE TIME THAT THEY SPEND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT WITHOUT SPENDING THE TIME TO LEARN THE PACKAGE PROPERLY .
TO SET UP THE BOUNDARIES CORRECTLY AND .
RIGHT EXACTLY .
HOW MANY LINES YOU RE GOING TO USE IN AN .
UHHUH A LOT OF TIMES THEY THEY THEY DO IT MANUALLY ON THE COMPUTER WHICH JUST REALLY IS A WASTE OF TIME AND THEN IF THEY EVER HAVE TO CHANGE ANYTHING IN THAT IN THAT IN THE DOCUMENT THEY HAVE TO GO BACK AND REDO IT ALL MANUALLY WHEREAS IF THEY HAD LEARNED THE PACKAGE PROPERLY TO START WITH AND HAD SET IT UP CORRECTLY THE PACKAGE WOULD DO THAT FOR THEM .
UHHUH .
WHENEVER THEY WANTED TO MAKE A CHANGE .
CA NT YOU CA NT YOU PUT .
SO I I VE SEEN THAT AS A PROBLEM .
CA NT YOU PUT IT ON A DISK AND THEN JUST EDIT IT IF YOU NEED TO WHEN YOU GO BACK .
RIGHT BUT IN SOME IN SOME CASES THE WITH THE FORMATTING WHAT I M TALKING ABOUT IS THAT THEY WOULD SET UP THEY SET UP A CERTAIN DOCUMENT AND IT MAY BE EIGHT PAGES LONG .
RIGHT .
AND THEY SET IT UP MANUALLY SO THAT THEY HAVE ALL THEIR SPACINGS AND FORMATTINGS AND TABS SET MANUALLY .
UHHUH AND .
AND UM .
AND UM .
THEN WHEN THEY HAVE TO MAKE A CHANGE SAY THEY WANT TO INSERT A PARAGRAPH THEY GOT TO GO THROUGH THE DOCUMENT AND RESET ALL THE PAGE BREAKS MANUALLY .
REWRITE THE WHOLE THING .
AND REWRITE THE WHOLE THING INSTEAD OF HAVING THE IF IF THEY HAD SET UP THE FORMATTING ON THE SYSTEM ITSELF IT WOULD DO THAT FOR THEM AND SAVE THEM A LOT OF TIME BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE DO NT SPEND THE TIME TO LEARN THE PACKAGE .
HOW DOES THE WORD WRAP WORK ON THAT DO YOU END UP WITH VERY DIFFERENT LENGTH LINES .
OH NO NO YOU CAN LEFT AND RIGHT JUSTIFY THE WHOLE THING IT COMES OUT JUST PERFECTLY SPACED LIKE A BLOCK .
UM .
IT LL IT LL AUTOMATICALLY IT S LIKE TYPESETTING IT LL AUTOMATICALLY DO THAT FOR YOU .
AND IT DIVIDES THE WORDS BY ITSELF .
USUALLY IT DOES NT DIVIDE WORDS .
OH OKAY .
THEY USUALLY HAVE IT SPACE THE WORDS IN A LINE RATHER THAN DIVIDE A WORD .
UHHUH .
SO YOU SEE LIKE IN A NEWSPAPER THEY TYPESET THEY DO NT USUALLY BREAK WORDS IN A NEWSPAPER .
RIGHT .
IF THE IF ONE LINE IS GOING TO BE A LOT SHORTER THAN ANOTHER LINE THEY JUST ADD SPACES TO THAT LINE TO MAKE IT LOOK LONG AS THE REST OF THE LINES .
UHHUH THEY SPACE IT OUT IN IN THE LINE ITSELF .
RIGHT .
OH .
AND MOST COMPUTERS DO THAT .
THEY .
MOST PACK MOST SOFTWARE PACKAGES WILL DO THAT FOR YOU .
UHHUH .
I VE I VE KNOWN PEOPLE THAT HAVE USED A PACKAGE FOR FOR FIVE YEARS YOU KNOW AND I WOULD SAY WELL HAVE YOU YOU KNOW YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS PACKAGE THAN I DO HOW DO YOU LEFT JUSTIFY AND THEY WOULD SAY I DO NT KNOW .
UHHUH .
AND IT WOULD TAKE ME MAYBE TWO OR THREE MINUTES LOOKING IN THE MANUAL TO FIGURE OUT WHAT COMMAND IT WAS THAT CAUSED THIS TO HAPPEN AND THEY WOULD SAY HOW DID YOU DO THAT AND I M LIKE WELL IT S REALLY EASY AND THEY WERE LIKE WELL I NEVER KNEW THAT SO OBVIOUSLY THEY D NEVER CONSIDERED LOOKING IT UP YOU KNOW .
UHHUH DO YOU THINK IT S A LACK OF TRAINING OR IT S JUST THAT THEY DO NT USE THE MATERIALS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM .
SOMETIMES IT S SOMETIMES WELL IT S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS SOMETIMES THEY DO NT UH THEY DO NT THINK THAT THEY CAN GET ANY INFORMATION OUT OF THE MANUAL SOME MANUALS ARE NT REALLY DESIGNED VERY WELL .
UHHUH .
BUT SOME OF THEM .
ARE AND MORE AND MORE OF THEM ARE COMING OUT WRITTEN IN A WAY THAT IT THAT JUST A BASIC GENERAL USER CAN UNDERSTAND THEM SO I THINK UM PEOPLE THINK IT S GOING TO TAKE THEM A LOT LONGER TO LEARN IT PROPERLY THAN IT REALLY WOULD AND SO THEY RE REALLY WASTING TIME RATHER THAN SAVING THEMSELVES TIME BECAUSE THEY THINK WELL IT S QUICKER JUST TO DO IT MYSELF .
RIGHT .
WHEN IT S REALLY NOT .
UHHUH IT S BETTER TO LEARN IT DIRECTLY FROM THE MANUAL .
WELL I THINK SO .
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE TO TROUBLE SHOOT SOME THINGS .
UHHUH EXACTLY .
BECAUSE A LOT OF THE TIMES THE COMPUTER THE PROGRAM STILL HAS UH BUGS IN IT AND YOU HAVE TO WORK AROUND IT .
UHHUH .
HAVE YOU WORKED MOSTLY ON I B M .
WITH P C S THEY RE EITHER I B M OR I B M COMPATIBLE MOSTLY .
UHHUH YEAH THAT S A .
THAT IS THE YOU KNOW THE INDUSTRY STANDARD .
THAT S ALL I VE SEEN IN OFFICES IS I B M .
UHHUH THERE S A LOT OF REALLY GOOD I B M COMPATIBLES TOO THEY DO NT HAVE TO NECESSARILY BE THE I B M BRAND BUT THEY HAVE TO ADHERE TO THAT INDUSTRY STANDARD .

RIGHT BYEBYE .
BYEBYE .
WELL THE FIRST THING FOR ME IS I WONDER I SEE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS OF TALKING ABOUT WHAT PRIVACY IS UM IF PRIVACY IS SOMETHING .
THAT DISTURBS YOUR PRIVATE STATE I MEAN AN INVASION OF PRIVACY IS SOMETHING .
THAT DISTURBS YOUR PRIVATE STATE THAT S ONE THING AND IF PRIVACY IS SOMETHING .
THAT COMES INTO YOUR PRIVATE STATE AND EXTRACTS INFORMATION FROM IT IN OTHER WORDS FINDS SOMETHING OUT ABOUT YOU .
THAT S ANOTHER .
AND THE FIRST KIND OF INVASION OF THE FIRST TYPE OF PRIVACY SEEMED INVADED TO ME AND VERY MUCH EVERYDAY IN THIS COUNTRY BUT IN THE SECOND TIME AT LEAST OVERTLY UH WHERE SOMEONE COMES IN AND UH FINDS OUT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU .
THAT SHOULD BE PRIVATE UH DOES NOT SEEM UH UM OBVIOUSLY EVERYDAY .
I I THINK I AGREE WITH THAT .
I THINK IN A GOOD EXAMPLE ON THE TYPICAL THING .
THAT HAPPENS UH WHEN THE PHONE RANG AND IT S T I CALLING MY IMMEDIATE REACTION IS THAT IT S SOME SORT OF STRANGE PHONE MESSAGE AND THEN I REALIZE OH NO THIS IS SOMETHING .
I SOLICITED .
THAT S RIGHT .
SO MY IMMEDIATE REACTION WAS ONE OF THAT SENSE OF INVASION BUT AFTER THAT I REALIZED NO I I REALLY WANTED THIS AND IT WAS SORT OF EXCITING AND SO .
UHHUH .
THAT WAS ALMOST AN EXAMPLE OF S AN INVASION .
THAT TURNS OUT TO BE NOT INVASIVE .
RIGHT IT TURNED OUT TO BE UH UH AN INVITATION .
EXACTLY .
UH AND AT THE SAME TIME .
I THINK THAT I RECEIVE ON ON THE ORDER OF UH PROBABLY SEVEN OR EIGHT .
A WEEK CALLS OF THE NATURE WHERE ONE WISHES THAT THERE WERE A CONVENIENT WAY TO JUST HANG UP ON IT .
FROM FROM PERSONAL PARTIES OR FROM THESE UM PHONE ANSWER PHONE UH .
COMMERCIAL .
COMMERCIAL THINGS .
SOL SOLICITATIONS PRIMARILY .
OH THAT THAT S A REMARKABLE NUMBER .
I GET THEM RARELY AND I M STILL ASTOUNDED THAT THAT ONE THEY LET ANYONE DO THEM AND TWO THAT THEY HAVE ANY EFFECT IN THIS WHATSOEVER .
UM BECAUSE I M USUALLY SO INSULTED BY THEM .
I JUST HANG UP AS SOON AS I RECOGNIZE WHAT .
YEAH .
THEY ARE .
I THINK THEY PREY ON PEOPLE S UM INHERENT POLITENESS ON THE PHONE EVEN WITH THE MACHINE .
I FIND PEOPLE BEING KIND OF POLITE AND WAITING FOR IT TO FINISH WHAT .
IT HAS TO SAY AND THEN THEY FEEL AN OBLIGATION TO RESPOND EVEN THOUGH THERE S NOT EVEN A PERSON THERE .
AND I THINK THAT S WHAT MAKES ONE FEEL INVADED IS THE FACT THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE LITTLE CONTROL AND YOU ONE .
S FEELING OBLIGATED .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE OF SOME SENSE OF OF THE WAY .
THE RITUAL IS PLAYED OUT .
UHHUH .
UHHUH .
AND AND UH THAT THAT THEN ENDS UP BEING THE THE MOST COMMON EXAMPLE FOR ME .
UHHUH .
UHHUH .
UM I GUESS I M NOT TYPICALLY FEELING INVADED IN MY PRIVACY RELATIVE TO THIS SECOND THIS .
ONE THAT YOU RAISED .
YEAH .
AND I DO NT THINK I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT .
I THINK THAT S A GOOD IDEA ON YOUR PART .
I DO NT TYPICALLY FEEL INTRUDED ON ON THE THINGS UH THE SENSE OF FINDING OUT INFORMATION .
WELL PRESUMABLY THOSE .
WHO FIND OUT SUCH INFORMATION IF THEY ARE DOING IT I WOULD PREFER TO NOT TO BE KNOWN AND I MEAN YOU KNOW THE CLASSIC OH I DO NT KNOW C I .
A CONSPIRACY THEORIES OR WHATEVER WOULD HAVE SUCH PARTIES TRYING TO DO IT WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE .
SO THERE S THINGS .
THAT INVADE THAT SECOND TYPE OF PRIVACY WHERE YOU DO KNOW ABOUT THEM AND POSSIBLY THINGS .
THAT INVADE THAT SECOND TYPE OF PRIVACY WITHOUT YOU KNOWING ABOUT IT AND I CA NT TALK ABOUT THE SECOND ONE OTHER THAN TO TO TO GENERATE PARANOIA .
IT S A SURMISE AND .
TO TO SURMISE .
IT IS THERE .
I D LIKE TO THINK THAT IT S QUITE LOW AT LEAST IN THIS COUNTRY .
I DO NT THINK I D LIKE THE K G B IS MONITORING MY PHONE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT .
WELL I GUESS ALTHOUGH I WELL THAT S A GOOD POINT WHERE YOU SAID THAT HOW DOES ONE DEFINE WHAT INVASION OF PRIVACY IS .
UHHUH YEAH .
BECAUSE UH IF THAT S THE CASE OF A TREE FALLING IN THE FOREST AND I M NOT FEELING INVADED THEN MAYBE MY PRIVACY HAS NT BEEN BECAUSE I HAVE NO SENSE OF MY PRIVACY STATE HAVING BEEN INVADED .
UHHUH .
UH .
UHHUH UHHUH .
IF YOUR DEFINING IT IN TERMS OF INFORMATION GONE EVEN IF IT S SOMETHING .
YOU DO NT KNOW ABOUT IT WELL THEN I GUESS ONE COULD ASSUME ONE WAS INVADED BUT I DO NT FEEL INVADED BY IT .
UHHUH .
I DO NT .
UHHUH .
HAVE A SENSE OF THREAT IN GENERAL FROM THOSE SORTS OF THINGS I M NOT SURE WHY .
UH I GUESS IT COMES FROM A SENSE OF FACT OR FACTS AND IF SOMEONE FINDS OUT SOMETHING ABOUT ME .
THAT IS TRUE I I DO NT HAVE A SENSE OF LOSS FROM THAT .
UHHUH .
WELL YOU MUST HAVE A RELATIVELY CLEAN CONSCIENCE THEN .
UM THE THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT MIGHT BE IF IF SOMEONE FOUND OUT SOMETHING OR SURMISED SOMETHING .
THAT WERE NT TRUE THEN I WOULD FEEL PROBABLY MORE INVADED IN THE GOSSIPY SORT OF SENSE .
YES YES EV MORE HARMED OR SOMETHING .
BEC RIGHT BECAUSE .
YEAH .
YOU DO NT HAVE ANYWAY TO TURN IT OFF .
THO DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS LOTUS DATA BASE .
THAT WAS BEING PUT TOGETHER .
YES I DID .
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO WRITE A LETTER WHEN I HEARD THEY CANCELED IT .
THAT WOULD BE AN EXAMPLE WHERE MY SENSE OF THREAT WOULD BE HIGH BECAUSE I WOULD FIND THAT THERE BE COU A GOOD POSSIBLY THAT THEIR FACTS WERE WERE FANTASY .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND THEN I WOULD FEEL NOT ONLY INVADED IN THE SENSE THAT SOMEONE HAD OBTAINED INFORMATION FROM A THAT I WOULD RATHER THEY DID NT AND THAT MIGHT BE THE SENSE OF THE SPENDING PATTERN FOR INSTANCE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
THAT THAT I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT TO BE PRIVATE .
BUT THEN IF IT TURNS OUT TO GENERATE INCORRECT THINGS THAT S EVEN WORSE SO .
UHHUH UHHUH .
OR IF MY CALL RATE OF OF EIGHT T OR SO A WEEK WENT UP EVEN HIGHER BECAUSE .
UH SOMEONE HAD HAD .
THEY HAD YOU PEGGED .
RIGHT .
AND THE PERSON .
WHO HAD TAKES UNSOLICITED PHONES CALLS AND PAYS MONEY AND THEN ALL OF .
YEAH .
A SUDDEN .
YOU GET YOUR THIRTY .
A WEEK BECAUSE NOW .
YEAH .
THEIR ADVERTISING YOU .
RIGHT .
EXACTLY .
YEAH .
AND UM ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE LOTUS DATA BASE WAS UM THAT IT WAS UNCONTROLLED ACCESS TO WHO WOULD HAVE THAT INFORMATION .
I MEAN THEY SAID THEY WOULD GIVE IT OUT TO ONLY SELECT COMPANIES BUT UM YOU KNOW JUST LIKE SOFTWARE IS ONLY GIVEN OUT TO CUSTOMERS I MEAN YOU CA NT BELIEVE THAT .
RIGHT .
RIGHT .
IT WOULD IT WOULD BE PIRATED AND THEY WOULD NT BOTHER TO CHECK THAT CAREFULLY ANYWAY TO SOMEONE .
WHO S OFFERING YOU KNOW FULL CASH PRICE .
RIGHT .
FOR IT .
I MEAN YOU KNOW YOU CA NT TELL IT WHAT .
A COMPANY REALLY HAS TO DO WITH IT AND THERE S SOMETHING RATHER OMINOUS ABOUT HAVING VIRTUALLY ANYONE ANY HACKER BEING ABLE TO KNOW WHAT .
YOUR INCOME IS WHAT .
YOUR SPENDING HABITS ARE AND YOU KNOW AND AND THAT HACKER JUST HAS TO GET IN TO IN TOUCH WITH THE SNEAK THIEF AND SUDDENLY AND THEN WHAT STARTED AS AN INVASION OF PRIVACY CAN BE AN INVASION OF YOUR ACTUAL HOME .
UHHUH .
AND I GUESS THAT TURNS OUT TO BE THE BASIC PROBLEM WITH ANY INVASION OF PRIVACY IS WHETHER OR NOT YOU RE FEELING .
YEAH .
THREATENED AS A RESULT OF OF IT SO .
YES .
EXACTLY .
MAYBE THAT IS A A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT PRIVACY IS .
UHHUH .
I ALSO THOUGHT ABOUT IT WAS OF UH WAITING TO TALK TO YOU THAT ANOTHER THING .
THAT OCCURRED TO ME IS THERE IS NOT SO MUCH INVASION OF MY PRIVACY BECAUSE I KNOW HOW TO BEHAVE SUCH THAT THERE IS NT .
BUT I REALIZED I HAVE TO BEHAVE IN A CERTAIN WAY IN ORDER TO NOT HAVE PEOPLE INVADE MY PRIVACY .
IF I DEVIATE FROM SOCIAL NORMS OF BEHAVIOR IF I RUN UP AND DOWN THE STREET YELLING OR SOMETHING SOMEONE S GOING TO INVADE MY PRIVACY VERY QUICKLY .
UHHUH .
AND I REALIZE THAT THAT I MEAN I CAN TAKE THAT FOR GRANTED BUT I USED TO I USED TO LIVE IN INDIA AND THINGS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT THERE IN TERMS OF THAT .
THERE S LESS OF A SENSE OF PRIVACY .
IN FACT IT S SAID THAT NO INDIAN LANGUAGE HAS A WORD FOR PRIVACY CERTAINLY THE LANGUAGE .
I KNOW DOES NT .
OH THAT S INTERESTING .
BUT JUST SAYS A WORD FOR LONELINESS .
LONELINESS IS THE CLOSEST YOU CAN COME WHICH IS REALLY QUITE DIFFERENT .
BUT BUT NO CONCEPT FOR WANTING TO BE PRIVATE .
YEAH .
IT S IT S GENERALLY BEING ALONE IS NOT A VERY DESIRABLE STATE AT LEAST OFFICIALLY .
OKAY .
UM SO THERE S NOT I MEAN DOORS DO NT HAVE LATCHES ON THEM .
PEOPLE DO NT TEND TO KNOCK YOU JUST IF THERE S A DOOR CLOSED AND YOU OPEN IT BECAUSE IT S IN YOUR WAY .
YOU PEOPLE WALK IN OUT AND AS A AS A WESTERNER IN INDIA AND I WAS OFTEN SURPRISED .
OH .
THAT THAT WOULD BE .
AND FELT MY SENSE OF PRIVACY .
THERE WAS QUITE INVADED .
THAT WOULD BE CULTURALLY SHOCKING .
YOU KNOW IT VERY MUCH IS .
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I REALIZED I COULD GO OUT ON THE STREET AND ACT LIKE A COMPLETE LUNATIC .
UHHUH .
AND PEOPLE WOULD LEAVE .
UHHUH .
ME ALONE .
WHEREAS IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE EVERYONE RESPECTS THE CLOSED DOORS VERY MUCH IF YOU GO OUT AND THEN ACT LIKE THE LUNATIC .
YOU YOU VIOLATE THE UH THE NORMS OF SOCIAL OF UM PUBLIC BEHAVIOR .
UM PEOPLE START PAYING ATTENTION TO YOU VERY MUCH AND THEY START ASKING QUESTIONS AND IN THE SENSE ARE INVITE INVADE INVADING YOUR PRIVACY ALTHOUGH IF YOU KNOW WHAT .
THE SOCIAL NORMS ARE YOU KNOW QUOTE UNQUOTE YOU ASKED FOR IT .
BUT IT DOES MEAN THAT YOU HAVE YET ANOTHER REASON TO FOLLOW A SET OF SOCIAL NORMS .
YES .
AND WHICH IS NT OF ALWAYS THE CASE IN ALL CULTURES AND IT .
WAS NT UNTIL I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT JUST NOW THAT I REALIZED THAT S ACTUALLY SOMETHING .
THAT S CULTURALLY RELATIVE .
THA THAT IS TRUE .
I HAVE NT THOUGHT ABOUT THAT AND AND THAT IT S FASCINATING TO TO THINK A LOT OF SOMEONE .
WHO DOES NT KNOW HOW TO SAY PRIVATE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND THAT S REALLY UM WELL I MEAN I I WONDER HOW PEOPLE HAVE SEX .
AND THINGS LIKE THAT I MEAN THEY A YOU GO TO INDIA AND IT S OBVIOUS YOU KNOW THE RESULTS OF SEX ARE QUITE OBVIOUS AS THE POPULATION GOES UP AN EXTRA HUNDRED MILLION .
EVERY FEW YEARS .
UM BUT I I JUST DO NT QUITE UM THERE S HOPE I ACTUALLY FOR AL OF THE TIME .
I VE SPENT THERE I STILL DO NT QUITE UNDERSTAND HOW CERTAIN THINGS THAT I ASSUME AND REQUIRE PRIVACY AND REQUIRE NOT JUST THAT YOU BE ALONE BUT ACTUALLY THAT YOU HAVE A SENSE OF PRIVACY .
YES .
BECAUSE ANYONE CAN BE ALONE FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME BUT FOR ME .
A LOT OF WHAT .
I DO REQUIRES A SENSE THAT THERE S THIS INVISIBLE BARRIER AROUND ME .
WHICH PEOPLE WIL .
YES .
WILL RESPECT .
AND IF THAT S GONE UM I I REALLY DO NT KNOW HOW TO LIVE VERY WELL AND I WONDER I REALLY DO WONDER HOW PEOPLE DO THAT .
THAT S INTERESTING .
ARE TH ARE THERE ANY OTHER SPECIFIC THINGS THAT THAT YOU FEEL LIKE WHERE WHERE YOU FEEL YOUR PRIVACY TO BE INVADED ON A DAYTODAY BASIS OR EITHER ON A GROWING FREQUENCY .
ALL THE CLASS THE OTHER CLASSIC EXAMPLES THE JEHOVAH S WITNESS OR OR MORMONS OR SOMEONE KNOCKING AT THE FRONT DOOR UM WHICH IS MORE INTRUSIVE BECAUSE I HAVE TO REALLY TELL SOMEONE TO GO AWAY .
AND THERE S THAT SENSE OF I HAVE NOW OPENED MY DOOR .
THEY NOW SEE WHAT .
I LOOK LIKE WHAT .
I LIVE LIKE AND NOR AND THEY RE DOING SOMETHING THAT NORMALLY I REALLY ONLY INVITE .
OKAY .
PEOPLE TO .
BECAUSE I ANY ANYONE ANY FRIEND ANYONE .
I GIVE MY NUMBER TO IS WELCOME TO CALL ME BUT NO ONE IS JUST WELCOME TO COME BY MY HOUSE .
SO THAT IS MORE OF A SENSE OF INVASION .
SO THAT S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE INVASION BECAUSE OF THE NOT SO .
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT UH THE WAY THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM HANDLES TRIALS .
WELL YOU KNOW THEY TELL YOU THAT YOU GET TRIED BY A JURY OF YOUR PEERS .
YEAH .
BUT YOU KNOW IT S PRETTY HARD TO TRY LET S SAY THE MAN DOWN THE STREET THAT S LIVING ON SOCIAL SECURITY OR SOMEBODY THAT S ON A LIMITED INCOME TO BE TRIED BY A JURY OF HIS PEERS IF MOST OF THE PEOPLE LIKE THE JURIES THAT I VE SERVED ON ARE BUSINESSMEN .
UHHUH .
OKAY NOW THEY DO NT UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE HE NEEDED FIFTY DOLLARS SO HE HELD UP THE SEVEN ELEVEN .
YEAH .
OKAY THEY DO NT UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE FIFTY DOLLARS .
ALL THE TIME SO YOU KNOW I THINK THAT IT A TRIAL BY YOUR PEERS SHOULD BE EXACTLY THAT SOMEONE IN YOUR OWN AGE BRACKET SOMEONE THAT YOU KNOW YOU CA NT REALLY DO IT ETHNICALLY YOU KNOW BUT YOU COULD DO IT .
YEAH .
YOU COULD PROBABLY GET IT A LITTLE CLOSER BUT THEN THERE S ANOTHER THING THAT I DISAGREE WITH IN TEXAS IS SOMETIMES YOU HAVE A JURY OF SIX AND SOMETIMES YOU HAVE A JURY OF TWELVE .
YEAH .
AND I DO NT KNOW WHY THEY DO THAT DO YOU HAVE ANY REASON DO YOU KNOW OF ANY REASON WHY THEY DO THAT .
WELL I THINK THE SIX IS CALLED A GRAND JURY AND THAT S MOSTLY TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THE PERSON S ACTUALLY GOING TO STAND TRIAL .
OKAY SEE .
WHETHER THEY RE ACQUITTED OR WHETHER THEY RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE ACCUSED OF YOU KNOW .
OKAY .
AND HELD OVER FOR TRIAL .
I DO NT KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE GRAND JURY HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE IN TEXAS I NOTICED SINCE I VE BEEN HERE IN TWELVE YEARS THAT THEY THEY BREAK UP THE THE TRIAL AND THEN THE SENTENCING PART OF THE TRIAL .
YEAH I DO NT KNOW I I THINK THAT UH I KNOW THAT JUDGES ARE NT SUPPOSED TO BE CROOKED HOWEVER .
WELL WE KNOW THERE S A FEW OUT THERE .
YEAH IT SEEMS LIKE IF YOU BREAK THE SENTENCING AWAY FROM THE JURY AND GIVE IT YOU GIVE IT TO ONE PERSON YOU RE LETTING THERE BE A WHOLE LOT MORE OF AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMETHING TO EITHER GO WRONG OR FOR YOU KNOW IF IF IF THE JUDGE IS NOT OF HIGH MORAL STANDARDS .
UHHUH .
HE COULD BE BOUGHT OFF MUCH EASIER .
YEAH IT S .
THAN TWELVE PEOPLE COULD .
YEAH WOULD BE PRETTY HARD WELL I DO NT THINK YOU KNOW I DO NT THINK THAT IF I WAS THE CRIMINAL THAT I WOULD LIKE THE JUDGE PASSING SENTENCE ON ME IF THE JURY FOUND ME GUILTY THEN THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO DECIDE AT THE SAME TIME WHAT MY PUNISHMENT SHOULD BE AND I THINK IT S NOT ONLY THAT IT S A WASTE OF OUR MONEY WE HAVE TO HAVE A TRIAL FOR THIS PERSON THEN TWO WEEKS DOWN THE ROAD WE HAVE TO SENTE SENT EXCUSE ME SET A SENTENCING DATE .
UHHUH .
SO NOW WE RE BACK IN COURT AGAIN AND THAT S MORE MONEY SPENT .
IT S NOT SO MUCH THAT I THAT I HAVE NT SEEN A LOT OF REALLY BAD SENTENCES PASSED EITHER BY TRIALS OR BY JUDGES .
NO .
WHAT BOTHERS ME IS THAT UH THEY REALLY DO NT MEAN ANYTHING SOMEONE COULD BE SENTENCED TO THIRTYFIVE YEARS AND YET YOU KNOW THE THE PAROLE SYSTEM IT S GOING TO LET THEM OUT IN IN THREE YEARS FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR .
AND IT S NOT WORKING EITHER .
NO IT S NOT .
IT SEEMS THAT WE HAVE MORE AND MORE REPEAT OFFENDERS .
UHHUH .
I KNOW I DO NT KNOW HOW YOU ALL ARE THERE WHERE YOU RE AT BUT WHERE WE RE AT NOW OUR JAILS ARE OVERCROWDED WE JUST BUILT A BRAND NEW ONE TWO YEARS AGO .
OH I THINK THEY RE ALL OVERCROWDED .
AND IT S OVERCROWDED .
THEY VE UH .
SO NOW THEY START TURNING THEM LOOSE .
I THINK I HEARD FORT WORTH THAT UH THEY VE BEEN ORDERED TO DO SOMETHING BECAUSE THEIR JAIL IS SO OVERCROWDED THEY RE NOT ALLOWED TO ACCEPT ANY NEW INMATES NOW WHAT ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO DO .
THEY TURN THEM LOOSE .
WELL NO I MEAN THEY RE NOT ALLOWED TO ACCEPT ANY NEW INMATES .
YEAH .
SO WHAT ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO DO WITH PEOPLE THAT THEY NEED TO PUT IN JAIL YOU KNOW .
WELL THE WAY IT SEEMS THE WAY IT S BEEN WORKING HERE S .
THERE YEAH .
GO AHEAD IT SEEMS THE WAY IT S BEEN WORKING HERE IS THEY LET THOSE OUT THAT HAVE SPENT TWO OR THREE YEARS OUT OF THEIR FIVE TO TWENTY SENTENCE .
UHHUH .
OR FIVE TO LIFE .
SOMETHING THAT IS WORKING AND I I REALLY LIKE THE SYSTEM OF HOUSE ARREST WHERE A A .
YEAH THAT .
SOMEONE S WEAR SOMEONE WEARS A BRACELET .
YEAH AND THEY .
LIKE A ANKLE BRACELET THAT S A MONITOR .
THEY KEEP .
AND THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED I MEAN TH SOME OF THEM ARE EVEN ALLOWED TO WORK THEY CAN GO TO THEIR REGULAR JOB THEY COME HOME THEY HAVE TO BE HOME BY SUCH AND SUCH A TIME THEY RE INSTRUCTED UH SO THAT THIS THIS ELECTRONIC MONITOR .
YEAH .
IS TURNED ON AT AT A CERTAIN TIME AND IT CONNECTS THEM UP TO A SYSTEM WHERE THEY KNOW THEIR WHEREABOUTS .
ALL RIGHT .
AND UH THEY CAN PUT A THEY USUALLY INSTALL A VIDEO MONITOR IN THE HOUSE AND WHEN THE PAROLE OFFICER CALLS TO CHECK ON THEM THEY RE INSTRUCTED TO TURN IT ON AND STAND IN FRONT OF IT .
ALL RIGHT .
SO THAT THEY CAN SEE THAT THIS PERSON IS ACTUALLY AT HOME IN THEIR HOUSE DOING WHAT THEY RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING AND THAT S WORKING RATHER WELL THAT S A GOOD SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE .
YEAH IT WOULD ALLOW .
TO ACTUALLY CONTINUE TO BE PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY WHILE THEY RE YOU KNOW .
YEAH INSTEAD OF BEING COMPLETELY PENNED UP .
PAYING BACK FOR WHATEVER CRIME THEY VE COMMITTED .
AND THAT WAY IT WOULD GIVE YOU KNOW THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT AND PAROLE DEPARTMENT THEY VE GOT TO BE OVERLOADED WITH AS MANY CRIMINALS AS WE HAVE HERE IN IN LUBBOCK .
OH YEAH YEAH .
AND THAT WOULD GIVE YOU KNOW AT LEAST THEY DO NT HAVE TO DRIVE ALL OVER TOWN TRYING TO FIND ONE GUY .
UHHUH I I VE REALLY .
OR TRYING TO SEE SIX OR SEVEN PEOPLE .
I COULD GO ON FOR HOURS ABOUT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND WHAT I THINK WE OUGHT TO DO ABOUT IT BUT .
SOMETIMES IT S PRETTY MESSED UP IS NT IT .
SOMETHING THAT I REALLY DO NT UNDERSTAND IS WHEN SOMEONE GOES TO JAIL .
UHHUH .
AND THEY HAVE A JOB IN JAIL AND THEY WORK THAT THEY SHOULD I AND THIS MAY SOUND CRUEL BUT I DO NOT THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED CIGARETTES I MEAN THEY RE IN JAIL FOR CRYING OUT LOUD .
YEAH .
WHAT DO THEY NEED CIGARETTES FOR .
WELL SEE AND THERE S ANOTHER THING ABOUT THE JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT I DO NT LIKE AND THERE S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT TELL ME THAT THAT MAYBE MY THOUGHTS ARE WRONG I CAME FROM CALIFORNIA .
UHHUH .
AND WHEN YOU RE IN JAIL THEY TAKE YOU OUT JUST LIKE THEY DO IN ALABAMA OR ANYWHERE ELSE WHAT THEY CALL A CHAIN GANG .
UHHUH .
AND THEY CLEAN THE CITY PARKS .
OH I THINK THAT S A WONDERFUL IDEA .
AND THEY CLEAN THE CITY STREETS BUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE CRIMINALS IN JAIL THAT DO NOTHING BUT SIT ON THEIR DUFF ALL DAY AND HERE IT COSTS US SEVENTEEN TO EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO SUPPORT A PRISONER .
MORE THAN THAT .
AND I KNOW YEAH .
MORE THAN THAT .
BUT I KNOW FAMILIES MYSELF THAT HAVE THREE AND FOUR CHILDREN IN LUBBOCK THAT DO NT MAKE THAT MUCH .
I KNOW .
AND THEY RE NOT YOU KNOW THEY RE NOT DOING ANYTHING TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES .
THE THING THAT .
WHILE THEY RE THERE .
THE THING THAT GETS ME IS THAT WHILE WE RE SUPPORTING THEM .
THEY RE WORKING .
YEAH .
WHEN THEY GET OUT OF JAIL THEY GET HANDED ALL THAT MONEY .
YEAH .
THAT REALLY TICKS ME OFF I THINK THAT WHILE THEY ARE IN JAIL AND THEY ARE WORKING THEIR WAGES .
YEAH .
SHOULD GO LIKE I DO NT KNOW THEY COULD SOME PERCENTAGE LIKE EIGHTYFIVE PERCENT OF THEIR WAGES SHOULD GO TOWARD THEIR ROOM AND BOARD .
YEAH WELL .
FIGURED ON A WHATEVER BASIS HOW MUCH IT COSTS TO ACTUALLY SUPPORT THEM FOR A YEAR .
UHHUH SEE NOW MUMBLEX .
AND WHEN THEY GET OUT THEY SHOULD HAVE A I DO NT KNOW YOU KNOW SOME REASONABLE AMOUNT OF MONEY .
YEAH .
TO START LIKE A COUPLE OF THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT THERE SHOULD BE A LIMIT OVER WHICH THEY THAT IT ALL GOES BACK TO THE STATE ANYTHING THAT THEY VE EARNED WHILE THEY RE IN PRISON SHOULD GO BACK TO THE STATE EXCEPT FOR THAT YOU KNOW THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME ALLOWANCE FOR WHEN SOMEONE GETS OUT THAT THEY HAVE SOME MONEY TO START WITH .
YEAH BUT AT LEAST THEY WOULD AT LEAST THAT WAY THEY WOULD BE HELPING PAY FOR THEIR OWN .
EXACTLY ABSOLUTELY .
AND SOMETHING ELSE THAT I WOULD .
THAT S THE PART THAT I REALLY THINK WE NEED TO CHANGE .
AND SOMETHING ELSE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS IS UH VICTIM REIMBURSEMENT YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY YOU KNOW LIKE YOU SAY THESE GUYS ARE IN JAIL AND THEY RE WORKING THEY RE GETTING PAID BUT THE GUY THAT THEY MESSED OVER TO GET THERE OR THEY STOLE SOMETHING FROM OR BEAT TO DEATH OR .
HAS NOTHING RIGHT .
HAS NOTHING YOU KNOW OUR OUR VICTIMS ARE VICTIMIZED PERIOD AND THE LAW HAS NO NO UH REGULATIONS TO DEAL WITH THAT .
ABSOLUTELY .
THEY THEY KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH THE PENAL SYSTEM AND THEY KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH THE CRIMINAL BUT THEY DO NT KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH THE VICTIM BECAUSE WE AS CITIZENS I GUESS HAVE NT LAID ANYTHING UP THERE FOR THEM TO DEAL WITH ON THAT ASPECT .
YEAH .
BUT IT S BUT I SURE DO NT I I STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH ANY JUDGE PASSING SENTENCE ON A PERSON HIMSELF .
UHHUH .
THERE THAT .
I THINK IT WORKS MUCH BETTER IF IT S IF IT S THE ACTUAL JURY .
YEAH BECAUSE WELL TH SEE THE JURY IS DEALING WITH THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE CRIME .
UHHUH .
THE JURY GETS TO SEE THE WHOLE TRIAL AS DOES THE JUDGE BUT YOU KNOW IF IF THEY FIGURE THERE S MAYBE LITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHEREAS MAYBE THE JUDGE DOES JUST DOES NT CARE YOU COMMITTED THIS CRIME SO I M JUST GOING TO THROW THE BOOK AT YOU .
UHHUH .
WHEREAS THE JURY MAY HAVE A LITTLE SHALL WE SAY SYMPATHY YOU KNOW HE DID THIS BUT YOU KNOW WHY DID HE DO THIS .
YEAH IN SOME .
IS THERE IS THERE A BASIS FOR IT .
CASES THA IT WOULD WORK THAT WAY IN SOME CASES IT WOULD WORK THE OTHER WAY .
YEAH IN SOME CASES WHERE THE JUDGE SAYS OKAY I LL GIVE YOU YOU KNOW TWO TO THREE YEARS AND .
THE JURY WOULD WOULD SLAM THEM AND .
YEAH .
AND I THINK THAT THAT THE JURY PROBABLY HAS MORE OF A RIGHT TO SENTENCE THAN THE JUDGE ALL THE TIME .
WELL THEY HAVE A STRONGER DEBATE TOO BECAUSE THERE S TWELVE PEOPLE THERE THEY HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT HE S GUILTY AND THEN THEY CAN SIT IN TH AT THE SAME TIME AND DECIDE WHAT HIS PUNISHMENT WOULD BE .
UHHUH .
AND YOU D HAVE MORE THAN ONE PERSON S INPUT ON IT .
YEAH I THINK THAT S PROBABLY A MUCH FAIRER WAY .
AND YOU KNOW WE RE SUPPOSED TO BE AND I QUOTE IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY .
SO YOU KNOW IF YOU CAN FIND ME GUILTY THEN YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO PASS SENTENCE .
YEAH .
AND A LOT OF JURORS NOT THAT I KNOW OF BUT YOU KNOW A LOT OF JURORS MAY JUST SIT THERE AND SAY YEAH HE S GUILTY BUT I DO NT HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT FROM HERE YOU KNOW SO .
YEAH .
THE JUDGE TAKES CARE OF ALL OF THAT .
IT MIGHT BE MORE IT WOULD BE MORE WORK FOR THE JURY BUT IT WOULD BE A MORE RESPONSIBLE .
YEAH IT WOULD .
WAY TO DEAL WITH IT .
YEAH SERVING ON THE JURY WOULD BE DEFINITELY MORE RESPO YOU D HAVE TO BE A DEFINITELY MORE RESPONSIBLE PERSON .
THE THING THAT I I DO NT REALLY LIKE I I DO NT KNOW IF UH A LOT OF JURY SELECTION PROCESSES THAT I VE SEEN HAVE BEEN A .
OKAY THIS IS REALLY IRONIC THAT THIS WOULD I WOULD GET THIS SUBJECT TODAY BECAUSE JUST YESTERDAY OUR DOG RAN AWAY .
OH NO .
AND IT S JUST BEEN TEARING ME UP ALL DAY .
OH I BET .
BECAUSE WE HAVE JUST BEEN LOOKING ALL OVER FOR HIM .
WE VE BEEN TO THE POUND WE VE BEEN TO THE HUMANE SOCIETY WE VE BEEN TO THE ADOPTION CENTER WE VE JUST BEEN ALL OVER THE NEIGHBORHOOD WE VE BEEN CALLING NEIGHBORS .
SO THIS IS JUST REALLY STRANGE .
OH I GUESS SO .
HAVE YOU LOST HIM BEFORE .

THEY JUST REALLY DO NOT WANT OTHER ANIMALS ON THEIR PROPERTY .
THEY RE VERY VERY HE HE JUST ANY CAT .

WELL UH I DO NT HAVE STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT CHANGES TO BE MADE IN THE UH JURY SYSTEM DO YOU .
UH NOT AT ALL .
IN FACT I M GRADUATING FROM COLLEGE IN ABOUT A WEEK AND THIS PAST SEMESTER .
I VE TAKEN TWO CRIMINAL JUSTICE CLASSES AND HAVE DISCUSSED A LOT ON TRIALS .
UH WELL THEN YOU MUST KNOW A LOT MORE ABOUT THIS THAN I DO .
UH I THINK I THINK UH S THE SYSTEM RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW SHOULD YOU KNOW IS FINE .
I THINK IT SHOULD BE BY A JURY .
I DO NT THINK THE JUDGE SHOULD HAVE I MEAN HE S JUST THERE KIND OF LIKE THE REFEREE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
UH I DO NT I DO NT EVEN THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE UNANIMOUS EITHER .
UH .
WELL WHAT ABOUT THE IDEA THAT ONE IS ONLY GUILTY UH WHEN PROVEN GUILTY BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT .
I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE POINT OF UH A UNANIMOUS JURY WAS THE IDEA THAT IF EVERYONE AGREES .
UHHUH .
THEN THERE SHOULD NT BE ANY REASONABLE DOUBT .
RIGHT .
BUT IF THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE .
WHO DO NT AGREE .
EXACTLY .
UH THEN THERE MUST BE IT SEEMS TO BE THERE MUST BE AT LEAST A REASONABLE DOUBT FOR SOME PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
UH I DO NT KNOW .
I UH YOU YOU RARELY HEAR YOU HEAR OF COURSE .
THERE .
S CASES WHERE SOMEONE HAS BEEN PUT IN IN IN UH PRISON UH FALSELY ACCUSED BUT UH MORE THAN LIKELY THE PEOPLE .
THAT ARE ON THE THE JURY KNOW WHAT .
THEY RE DOING .
UH I MEAN YOU .
REALLY .
HAVE YOU SERVED ON A JURY .
NEVER .
I NEVER HAVE EITHER BUT MY FRIENDS MY FEW FRIENDS .
WHO HAVE UH SAY JUST THE OPPOSITE .
THEY SAY THEY RE UH REMARKABLY INCOMPETENT .
AND UH DO NT KNOW WHAT .
THEY RE DOING AND SAY ONE THING IN THE COURTROOM AND THEN AS SOON AS THEY GET IN THE BACK ROOM .
THEY JUST START LETTING ALL THEIR PREJUDICES HANG OUT AND TO TO AIR AND ALL THAT .
HUH .
WELL YOU WOULD THINK THAT THEY WOULD GET THAT IN THE UH WHEN THE PROSECUTION AND DEFENSE ARE CHOOSING THE JURY .
YOU WOULD THINK THAT THOSE WOULD COME OUT AND I I KNOW THEY AUTOMATICALLY WHEN YOU GO THROUGH UH WHEN YOU RE CHOSEN IS YOU RE AUTOMATICALLY LIKE A A A PROFESSOR IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT YOU RE AUTOMATICALLY NO THEY DO NT WANT YOU ON THE JURY .
RIGHT MUMBLEX THEY DO NT WANT ANYONE WITH EXPER .
EXACTLY .
ANYONE WITH PARTICULAR EXPERIENCE OR KNOWLEDGE OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM .
UHHUH EXACTLY .
UH .
AND THEY TEND AND SINCE ANYONE CAN GET OUT OF IT .
WHO BASICALLY SAYS THEY DO NT WANT TO DO IT I MEAN YOU KNOW IT S IT S ANYONE CAN GET OUT OF JURY JUST ABOUT AND UH SO IT IT S UH IT S NOT REALLY MY PEERS THAT IF I WERE AR LET S SAY I WERE ARRESTED FALSELY OR NOT .
UHHUH .
AND PUT UP FOR A JURY .
I WOULD NT FEEL THAT UH I WOULD BE BEING TRIED BY A JURY OF MY PEERS .
I D BE I MEAN I D BE TRIED BY A JURY OF YOU KNOW PEOPLE .
WHO HAD NOTHING ELSE TO DO AND WERE NT VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT CERTAIN SORTS OF THINGS AND UH .
UHHUH .
I DO NT KNOW I I GET A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS ABOUT IT AND UH .
I VE I VE NEVER I VE NEVER EVEN BEEN CALLED TO JURY DUTY .
YEAH I I WAS CALLED ONCE BUT I WAS OUT OF THE COUNTRY AND APPARENTLY I APPARENTLY THEY THOUGHT I SERVED SO I DID NT I DID NT MAKE ANY NOISE ABOUT IT .
I CAME BACK AND THEY SAID THE RECORD SHOWED I SERVED BUT I WAS OUT OF THE COUNTRY AT THE TIME SO I M PRETTY SURE I DID NT .
UH .
YEAH .
I UH I DO NT KNOW I THINK THE I GUESS THERE S A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THE LEGAL SYSTEM .
YEAH WELL I I I DO NT KNOW I DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO KEEP IT AT LEAST UNANIMOUS BECAUSE UH YOU KNOW THERE S THE CLASSIC SORT OF TO KILL .
A MOCKINGBIRD KIND OF STORY WHERE YOU GET YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
JURY .
WHICH CAN HAVE ALL KINDS OF PREJUDICES AND THINGS .
THAT A JUDGE AT LEAST OFFICIALLY IS NT SUPPOSED TO HAVE .
THOUGH OF COURSE .
THEY CAN TOO .
UHHUH .
AND UH IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF YOU COULD JUST HAVE A SIMPLE MAJORITY OR SOMETHING .
YOU COULD PRETTY MUCH BROW YOU KNOW BROWBEAT THE JURY .
UHHUH .
A MAJORITY IN THE OF THE A MAJORITY OF THE JURY THAT S HARD TO SAY .
UH SO IT S IT S UH YOU KNOW SAYING WELL LOOK WE DO NT LIKE THE WAY .
HE LOOKS AND LET S UH LET S THROW THE RASCAL IN JAIL AND STUFF .
RIGHT .
AND YOU ALSO GET A LOT OF UH JURIES ARE EXTREMELY UH AND FROM WHAT .
I HEAR I I HAVE I HAVE SOME FRIENDS .
WHO DO EXPERT WIS WITNESS TESTIMONY AND THEY SAY THAT UH JURIES ARE EXTREMELY VULNERABLE TO UH SORT OF EMOTIONAL PITCHES YOU KNOW THE PROSECUTOR WILL WANT TO OH I DO NT KNOW SHOW THE SHOW THE MUGGING VICTIM YOU KNOW SHOW WHAT .
THE NICE PERSON .
HE WAS AND WHAT .
A FAMILY LIFE AND BASICALLY GET THE JURY TO BE VERY SYMPATHETIC WITH THE VICTIM AND UH OR OR UH IF IT S A CORPORATION THAT WAS UH YOU KNOW HAR HARMING SOME INDIVIDUAL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THEY GET VERY MUCH WELL YOU KNOW IT S JUST A BIG FACELESS CORP CORPORATION .
LET S LET S MAKE THEM PAY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE .
UHHUH .
THINGS LIKE THAT .
SO NOT I I MEAN I M THE PROBLEM IS I CA NT GUARANTEE THAT A JUDGE WOULD BE NECESSARILY BE MUCH BETTER THAN A JURY BUT I D BE REAL NERVOUS HAVING A JURY NOT AT LEAST FULLY AGREE ON WHAT .
THE SETTLEMENTS WOULD BE .
RI .
THINGS LIKE THAT .
I UH I DO I I DO NT THINK THE JUDGE SHOULD JUST MAKE THE DECISION ALONE .
YEAH .
LEAST WITH THE JURY .
YOU HAVE TWELVE PEOPLE YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
THAT ARE GOING TO DECIDE YOU KNOW YOU RE THE THE PERSON S FATE .
WELL HOW ABOUT HAVING A J JURY AND A JUDGE WORK TOGETHER ON IT SOMEHOW .
I WONDER IF THAT S POSSIBLE .
I GUESS THE JUDGE S TIME IS WORTH TOO MUCH THOUGH .
EXAC MUMBLEX JUDGE .
THEY PAY THAT JUDGE THEY PAY THOSE JURY MEMBERS .
VERY LITTLE MONEY COMPARED TO THAT JUDGE .
RIGHT EXACTLY .
HE MAKES MORE MONEY IN AN HOUR THAN ALL TWELVE OF THEM PUT TOGETHER .
PROBABLY YEAH .
YEAH .
BUT UH NO IT S IT S SAD THOUGH THAT UH THAT THE PEOPLE THOUGH THAT YOU YOU SOMEBODY .
S LIFE IS IN TWELVE PEOPLE S HANDS AND SOMETIMES THOSE TWELVE PEOPLE COULD CARE LESS .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND UH OR THEY FOOL THE THE DEFENSE IN THINKING THAT THEY RE YOU KNOW BECAUSE WHEN THEY GO THROUGH THOSE PROCESSES THEY .
KIND OF PICK OUT WHO .
THEY WANT .
OH OF COURSE .
IT S IT S POLITICAL MANEUVERING .
THE THE ONE SIDE IS LOOKING FOR SOMEONE .
WHOSE FACE .
THEY THINK WILL YOU KNOW WANT TO HANG EVERYONE AND THE OTHER ONE IS GOING TO LOOK FOR SOMEONE VERY SYMPATHETIC .
THEY RE NOT LOOKING FOR SOMEONE .
WHOSE GOING TO BE THE MOST REASONED OR SENSIBLE OR RATIONAL JUROR .
NEITHER SIDE WANTS THAT .
THEY WANT TO FIND A JUROR .
THAT S GOING TO UH BE MOST PERSUADABLE BY THEIR ARGUMENTS YOU KNOW .
EXACTLY .
UH I WISH IT WERE A LITTLE BIT HARDER TO NOT SERVE ON JURIES ACTUALLY .
I MEAN I KNOW IT IT IT S TRICKY BECAUSE I KNOW YOU KNOW AN AWFUL LOT OF INTELLIGENT PEOPLE .
WHO JUST WELL I M TOO BUSY TO SERVE ON A JURY .
UHHUH .
SO I LL TELL THEM THAT AND THEY WO NT OR JUST YOU KNOW JUST ANSWER ONE OF THE QUESTIONS .
THE WRONG WAY BECAUSE YOU CAN DO THAT YOU KNOW .
OH YEAH .
WELL .
THEY JUST SAY DO YOU BELIEVE IN SUCH AND SUCH .
UH .
I GUESS IT S JUST THAT MAYBE PEOPLE ARE YOU KNOW UPSET AT COURT YOU KNOW .
IF IT WAS IF IT WAS A A FAMILY MEMBER OF THEIRS THOUGH THAT WAS INNOCENT AND THEN THEY D WANT TO BE ON THAT JURY .
RIGHT .
COURSE THEY D BE THEY WOULD BE BARRED BUT .
BUT UH IF EVERYONE WOULD TAKE IT I THINK IF EVERYONE TOOK IT SERIOUSLY .
UHHUH .
AND UH I MEAN SOMETHING .
YOU HAVE TO DO .

I USUALLY DO NT INTENTIONALLY ALTHOUGH I SHOULD I DO NT INTENTIONALLY TURN ON THE TELEVISION TO WATCH NEWS .
RIGHT .
OR I DO NT INTENTIONALLY TURN ON THE RADIO TO LISTEN TO THE NEWS IF IT COMES ON I JUST HAPPEN TO HEAR IT NOW I WILL INTENTIONALLY BUY A NEWSPAPER TO WA TO TO LOOK AT THE NEWS BUT OTHER .
YEAH ALL I EVER GET OUT OF THE PAPER IS A SUNDAY PAPER SO .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
I READ THE COMICS .
THAT S ABOUT IT .
THAT S ABOUT IT YEAH .
THE SUNDAY PAPER IT S SO FULL OF STUFF BUT YOU PICK YOUR FAVORITE SECTION AND THE REST .
RIGHT .
YOU THROW AWAY .
RIGHT .
ALTHOUGH YOU PAID WHAT ALMOST TWO DOLLARS NOW TO GET IT BUT .
I LIKE TO LISTEN TO UH NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO ON THE WAY TO WORK BECAUSE IT S I DO NT KNOW IT S VARIETY AND NOW .
UHHUH .
THEY RE THROWING IN A LITTLE NEWS AND A LITTLE BIT OF OTHER STUFF IT .
YEAH .
TENDS TO GET LIKE HEADLINE NEWS IF YOU LISTEN TO IT FOR AN HOUR MUMBLEX .
IS IT IS IT PRETTY GOOD COVERAGE ON THERE .
YEAH IT USUALLY IS THEY THROW IN A LOT OF YOU KNOW A LOT OF INTERVIEWS AND COMMENTARIES IT S KIND OF LIKE GETTING A NEWSPAPER THERE S A LOT OF .
YEAH YEAH .
SECTIONS TO IT AND .
UM .
THEY THEY PRESENT DIFFERENT SIDES OF THINGS .
BECAUSE I FIND LIKE ON K R L D I LIKE TO LISTEN TO THAT BUT EACH STORY IS LIKE NO MORE THAN TWO OR THREE LINES YOU KNOW .
OH WELL THEY SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME YOU KNOW THEY COVER THE HEADLINES .
YEAH .
AND THEN THEY GO INTO A LOT OF THE ISSUES AND .
UHHUH .
THINGS WHERE THEY THEY SPEND FIVE OR TEN MINUTES DISCUSSING SOMETHING AND .
YEAH THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE BETTER .
INTERVIEWING PEOPLE AND IT S .
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU LOOK FOR THE LIKE POPULAR RADIO STATIONS LIKE MOSTLY THE MUSIC STATIONS NEWS IS IS PRETTY MUCH NONEXISTENT .
YEAH .
THEY HAVE LITTLE LITTLE TEENYWEENY NEWS .
BREAKS YOU KNOW .
YEAH AND ONLY IN THE MORNING I GUESS THERE S A LITTLE BIT .
YEAH YEAH BASICALLY .
I HAVE NT LISTENED TO A TOP FORTY RADIO STATION IN SO LONG I WOULD NT KNOW .
YEAH .
SO .
SO LET S SEE UM .
AND I GUESS I GET SOME KINDS OF OTHER YOU KNOW BUSINESS RELATED NEWS THROUGH TRADE JOURNALS AND THINGS BUT .
UHHUH .
UH .
THE ONLY REASON I GET TRADE JOURNALS IS LIKE IF I M LOOKING FOR A JOB OR SOMETHING .
RIGHT .
WHICH IS WHAT I M DOING NOW .
YEAH .
BUT UM .
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE .
YEAH TRYING TO GET OUT OF WHEREVER THEY ARE BUT UM I THINK I THINK NEWS IS I M WONDERING WHERE IT S GOING YOU KNOW HOW I THINK IT WILL BE NONEX PRETTY MUCH NONEXISTENT EXCEPT MAYBE THROUGH THE PAPER I KNOW THE NEWSPAPER USED TO BE KIND OF THE ONLY SOURCE FOR NEWS AND NOW IT S IT S KIND OF YOUR FINAL CHOICE YOU WATCH FIRST YOU GO TO C N N THEN YOU GO TO RADIO OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
YEAH WHERE NOBODY WANTS .
AND I THINK IT .
TO SIT DOWN AND READ .
YEAH YEAH .
IT S IT TAKES A LOT MORE TIME TO READ SOMETHING .
YEAH .
AND YOU VE GOT NEWS .
SO MUCH MORE EFFORT .
BOMBARDING YOU FROM EVERYWHERE NOW .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW YOU .
YEAH .
TURN ON THE T V TURN ON THE RADIO .
BUT I THINK THAT SOON THE PAPER MAY BE KIND OF THE ONLY SOURCE AGAIN .
WHY IS THAT .
I DO NT WELL JUST BECAUSE I M I M THINKING THAT IT IT S GETTING SO SHORT ON RADIO YOU STILL YOU HAVE TWO OR THREE I KNOW IN DALLAS YOU CAN PROBABLY GET TWO TWO ALL NEWS RADIO STATIONS OUT OF I DO NT HOW MANY POPULAR RADIO STATIONS AND THEN ON TELEVISION YOU HAVE JUST THE NEWS AT SIX AND TEN .
YEAH I JUST .
AND I JUST I JUST SEE THAT DWINDLING IN IN .
I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE WILL GO BACK TO READING OVER TELEVISION I MEAN JUST GIVEN THE WAY SOCIETY IS AND I ENJOY READING BUT MOST .
TRUE YEAH .
PEOPLE WOULD RATHER TURN ON THE TUBE AND AND AND .
TRUE THAT S TRUE TOO YEAH .
FLIP THROUGH THE CHANNELS YOU KNOW AND GET THE HEADLINE NEWS AT THIRTY MINUTES OF .
THAN SIT DOWN AND TAKE THE EFFORT TO READ .
RIGHT .
THE PAPER .
AND THEY DO NT HAVE TO GO GET ONE YOU KNOW .
ONE THING I LIKE ABOUT THE PAPER UM AS OPPOSED TO TELEVISION IS THAT UH WHEN I LIKE WHEN I REPORT BECAUSE I M IN TELEVISION I HAVE TO GET THE BASIC THE MAIN FACTS AND THAT S IT THAT S ALL YOU HAVE TIME FOR .
RIGHT RIGHT .
WHEREAS IN THE PAPER I LIKE TO READ THE ARTICLES BECAUSE THEY GET EVERY SIDE EVERY SINGLE SIDE AND AND EVERY POINT THEY MAKE YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
AND AND IT S ALL THERE .
WELL THAT S WHY I LIKE UH NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE THEY GET ON ONE OF THESE LITTLE THINGS THEY GIVE YOU HEADLINES THAT ARE BRIEF JUST THEY TOUCH ON WHAT S GOING ON AND THEN THEY LL GET INTO SOMETHING AND REALLY EXPLORE IT .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND IT S IT S INFORMATIVE IT S A LOT MORE INFORMATIVE THAN YOU KNOW QUICK HALF HOUR NEWS SHOWS THAT .
YEAH .
THEY TELL YOU WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO HEAR .
YEAH BECAUSE THAT S WHAT WE DO I MEAN IT S LIKE EACH STORY IS THIRTY SECONDS YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
SO IT S LIKE YOU REALLY HAVE TO TELL AS MUCH AS YOU CAN WHICH IS NOT MUCH IN THAT AMOUNT OF TIME SO AND IT WILL PROBABLY GET SHORTER AND SHORTER AS THE YEARS GO BY I THINK I DO NT KNOW .
YEAH THERE S SO MUCH GOING ON IN THE WORLD .
UHHUH .
COMMUNICATION YOU KNOW EXPANDS THE WORLD NOW .
OH YEAH .
THERE S TOO MUCH GOING ON YOU CA NT AFFORD TO GIVE MORE THAN A COUPLE OF SECONDS HERE AND THERE .
I THINK THAT IS ONE GOOD THING ONE GREAT THING ABOUT NEWS AND WE SAW IT DURING THE WAR JUST NOW IS THAT WE GOT ALL THE INFORMATION WITHIN MINUTES YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
WHATEVER HAPPENED WE KNEW ABOUT IT ABOUT THE SAME TIME THAT THEY KNEW ABOUT IT .
AND THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH OF IT OR HOW SOME OF IT I GUESS THERE S A LOT OF DEBATE ABOUT CENSORSHIP AND .
YEAH YEAH .
AND WHAT WE RE REALLY SEEING .
UHHUH .
IS IT IS IT THE TRUE STORY OR IS IT A .
YEAH .
LITTLE BIT BIASED .
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH WE DO GET THE STORY RIGHT AWAY THEY WERE CENSORED AS TO WHAT THEY .
RIGHT .
COULD TELL US SO ALL WE HAD TO SIT HERE AND AND ASK IS WELL WHAT ARE NT THEY TELLING US YOU KNOW SO THAT THAT WAS PRETTY SCARY BUT WE I TALKED TO ONE WOMAN AND SHE SAID THAT SHE DID NT WANT TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON BECAUSE IF SHE HAD A SON OVER IN SAUDI ARABIA SHE WOULD NT WANT TO KNOW YOU KNOW THAT THEY RE BOMBING OR OR THIS AND THAT S GOING ON AND AT THE SAME TIME I TALKED TO ANOTHER WOMAN AND SHE WAS SO HAPPY TO KNOW BECAUSE SHE LIVED THROUGH VIETNAM AND SHE DID NT KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING AT THAT TIME .
RIGHT .
AND SHE WAS SO HAPPY TO GET THE INFORMATION YOU KNOW SO THERE S JUST A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON THAT BUT .
I I YOU KNOW I LIKE TO TO KNOW WHAT S GOING ON SOMETIMES I THINK THERE S JUST A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW YOU GET IN THE HABIT OF LIKE I SAY TURN ON HEADLINE NEWS AND IT WILL PLAY OVER AND OVER .
AND YOU JUST TUNE IT OUT BECAUSE IT S THE SAME THING BUT .
AND THEN TOO A LOT OF TIMES I THINK UH ESPECIALLY ON TELEVISION THEY BLOW THINGS COMPLETELY OUT OF PROPORTION .
YEAH THEY TEND TO .
LIKE .
DRAMATIZE THINGS .
YOU KNOW LIKE THIS KENNEDY THING .
YEAH .
IT S JUST I MEAN EVERYWHERE YOU TURN KENNEDY KENNEDY KENNEDY YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF SHOES DID HE WEAR ON THE NIGHT AND YOU KNOW IT S JUST LIKE OKAY THIS IS RIDICULOUS .

THINKING ABOUT .
THEY ACTUALLY SHOULD DO SOME READING .
THAT S RIGHT AND IT .

I I I I THINK I THINK THERE S A LOT TO BE SAID FOR KIDS WORKING .
UHHUH SURE .
AFTER SCHOOL .
I MEAN THEY THEY FIND OUT WHETHER JUST HOW MUCH OF A PEOPLE PERSON .
THEY ARE .
THAT S TRUE I FOUND THAT OUT WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL .
I WORKED AT MCDONALD S .

WHAT I WORKED AT MCDONALD S AS WELL AND I I CAN TELL YOU .
ONE THING THERE ARE JUST SOME PEOPLE THAT I YOU KNOW YOU JUST CAME TO THE POINT WHERE I MEAN AND OH I EVENTUALLY WORKED IN A LAB IN A LA AS A LAB TECHNICIAN AND I WORKED FRONT DESK .
AND I MEAN SOMEBODY COULD WALK IN THE DOOR AND I KNEW EXACTLY WHAT .

OKAY WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE SOME CURRENT TRENDS IN UH THE WAY FAMILIES SPEND TIME TOGETHER BASED ON WHAT .
YOU VE SEEN .

UM I THINK UH LIKE IN MY SITUATION TODAY ON A WEEKEND WHEN COUPLES ARE SUPPOSED TO SPEND TIME TOGETHER MY HUSBAND S BEEN OFF DOING HIS THING .
ALL DAY TODAY AND I VE BEEN OFF DOING MY THING .
ALL DAY AND I HAVE NT SEEN HIM SINCE EIGHT OCLOCK THIS MORNING .
REALLY .

SAME SAME SITUATION HERE I VE BEEN MARRIED ABOUT TEN MONTHS SO .
YEAH I CAN I CAN I KNOW WHAT .
YOU MEAN .
IT S IT S REALLY HARD HARD TO FIND TIME TO SPEND TOGETHER WHEN YOU .
BOTH WORK FULL TIME AND UH YOU .
BOTH HAVE HOBBIES .
THAT ARE DIFFERENT .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE HOBBIES .
THAT ARE THE SAME THEN YOU KNOW YOU CAN ENJOY YOUR HOBBY TOGETHER BUT MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE DIFFERENT HOBBIES .

YEAH .
YOU KNOW LAUNDRY AND UM DID SOME SHOPPING AND STUFF .
UM FROM THE PEOPLE I VE TALKED TO I DO NT KNOW IF I SHOULD BRING THIS INTO IT BUT UM A LOT OF THE DADS SAID THAT THEY WOULD PROBABLY CHOOSE CAREERS .
THAT ARE MORE UM WHERE THEY COULD MANAGE THEIR OWN SCHEDULE AND .
UHHUH .
UH THEY COULD SPEND MORE TIME WITH THEIR KIDS BECAUSE THEY LOOK BACK AND YOU KNOW THEY RE ALL LIKE UM KIND OF REGRETFUL I THINK .
YEAH I I THINK I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE IDEAL SITUATION .
I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE IDEAL SITUATION .
I THINK THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE IN MY CASE .
I I DO SHIFT WORK .
UHHUH .
I DO NT I DO NT HAVE THAT CHOICE .
YEAH SAME HERE .
UM I HAVE TO BE AT WORK AT AT X HOUR YOU KNOW AT JUST AT AT A CERTAIN HOUR AND I CA NT IT S NOT FLEXIBLE .
YEAH .
UM IT IT WOULD BE NICE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE FLEXIBLE HOURS AND AND MAYBE AFTER WE DECIDE TO HAVE KIDS I I MIGHT FIND A JOB .
THAT HAS FLEXIBLE HOURS .
I WOUL I HOPE SO ANYWAY .
UM BUT I WOULD I DO NT KNOW .
AT T I IS THAT WHERE YOU WORK .
UHHUH .
IT S REALLY KIND OF SAD SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT I WORK WITH THEY LIKE WHEN I WORKED ON SECOND SHIFT UM THEIR PAREN THEIR KIDS GO TO SCHOOL DURING THE DAY AND THEN THEY WOULD NT SEE THEM AT NIGHT .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE IN YOU KNOW AT WORK AND THE KIDS ARE ALL READY IN BED .
AND SO IT WAS KIND OF LIKE THEY SEE THEIR KIDS FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES AND THE SAME WITH THEIR SPOUSES .
THIS RELATIVE MAY WORK EVEN A WEIRDER SHIFT LIKE WEEKENDS OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
SO IT WAS REALLY SAD JUS YOU KNOW THAT A LOT OF FAMILIES UM HAVE TO WELL YOU KNOW HAVE TO HAVE DUAL INCOME .
A LOT OF PEOPLE CHOOSE TO WHICH IS FINE .
YEAH .
BUT UH YOU KNOW THEN THE KIDS KIND OF SUFFER .
YEAH I IDEALLY IT .
WO IT WOULD BE NICE TO BE ABLE TO JUST HAVE LIKE BACK IN THE OLD DAYS .
UHHUH HUH .

YOU KNOW THE THE MOM STAYED HOME YOU KNOW AND RAISED THE KIDS .
MY MOM DID NT GO BACK TO WORK UNTIL I WAS IN JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL .
YEAH .
UM SO SHE WAS THERE PRETTY MUCH ALL MY YOU KNOW FORMATIVE YEARS .
YEAH .
AND THAT WAS NICE AND I LIKED THAT AND I WOULD HOPE THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO GIVE THAT TO MY KIDS .
UH .
BUT I THINK WITH THE WAY .
THE FUTURE IS UM ECONOMY WISE I DO NT THINK IT S GOING TO BE REALISTIC .
I KNOW .
UNFORTUNATELY THAT S PROBABLY TRUE .
UM DO YOU THINK S THE THE PARENTS SPEND QUALITY TIME WITH THEIR KIDS ARE DO YOU THINK IT S MORE LIKE WATCHING T V AND STUFF LIKE THAT NOT REALLY UH .
I YEAH I I THINK THAT I THINK VERY FEW SPEND QUALITY TIME .
I THINK MOST OF THE TIME .
THE KIDS ARE USUALLY OFF WATCHING CARTOONS OR PLAYING VIDEO GAMES OR STUFF STUFF LIKE THAT .
YEAH .
I THINK THAT UM UH MOST MOST KIDS THAT I SEE DO NT REALLY THEY DO NT REALLY VALUE QUALITY TIME .
YEAH IT S ALWAYS THAT WAY UNTI UNTIL IT S TOO LATE .
UNTIL UNTIL THEY RE OLDER AND THEN THEY LOOK BACK .
YEAH IT S TRUE UM .
WHAT S WHAT ARE SOME OTHER QUESTIONS THEY HAVE MUMBLEX I M NOT SURE .
I KNOW MY PARENTS ARE GROWING UP I GUESS THEY NEVER SPENT MUCH TIME WATCHING T V .
IN FACT I VE NEVER SEEN MY MOM TURN ON THE T V WE DID NT REALLY HAVE ONE MUMBLEX .
OH REALLY .
YEAH AND AND THEY SPENT A LOT OF TIME LIKE OUTSIDE WITH US AND STUFF BUT YOU KNOW MY DAD HAD HIS OWN BUSINESS AND IT WAS EASIER FOR THEM TO DO THAT BUT I I DO NT KNOW IT WAS I GUESS I DID NT REALIZE WHAT .
A LUXURY .
IT WAS AT THE TIME .
I I THINK KIDS NOW A DAYS ARE RAISED ON T V .
I MEAN THAT S THAT S ALMOST LIKE A SUROG .
YEAH .
T V S A SURROGATE PARENT .
YEAH THAT S A GOOD WAY TO PUT IT .
AND NOT A AND NOT A VERY GOOD .
ONE AT THAT .
YEAH THAT S A PRETTY GOOD WAY TO PUT IT .
IF I HAD KIDS WELL IF YOU HAD KIDS WHAT KIND OF THINGS DO YOU HOPE TO DO .
UM I I HOPE TO OF COURSE BE ABLE TO TEACH THEM RIGHT FROM WRONG .

YEAH .
UM AND BEING ABLE TO DO I I I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WH WHO UM UM I WORK PARTTIME ALSO AND I .
A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT I WORK FOR ARE MOTHERS .

UHHUH .
UM AND THEY THEY DO A LOT OF VOLUNTEER WORK AND THEY RE REAL ACTIVE IN THE COMMUNITY AND UM THEY DO A LOT OF THINGS WITH THEIR KIDS THAT THEY WOULD NT ORDINARILY BE ABLE TO DO IF THEY WERE WORKING .
UHHUH .
AND I D I D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT .

DO VOLUNTEER WORK AND .
YEAH .
BE IN CLUBS AND STUFF YEAH I AGREE .

OF THE UM PARENTS OUT THERE ARE ARE PROBABLY WORKING PARENTS .
YEAH .
HUH .
AND I I DO NT I DO NT REALLY SEE THAT THAT TREND CHANGING MUCH IF ANYTHING I THINK .
I KNOW .
THERE S GOING TO BE FEWER AND FEWER UH SINGLE INCOME FAMILIES .

THE WAR .

YOU MEAN IN TERMS OF THE ECONOMY OR .
UH THE ECONOMY THE OUR SOLDIERS GOING OVER UH .
OH .
JUST EVERYTHING .
I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOCIAL CHANGES IS THAT IS THAT WHAT YOU RE KIND .
YEAH .
OF DIRECTING IT .
YEAH .
OH OKAY .
YEAH .
OKAY WELL .
THAT S THE FIRST THING I THOUGHT OF I DO NT KNOW .
UM WELL I THINK IT S CAUSED A LOT OF YOU KNOW BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHEN PEOPLE HAD GONE TO WAR BEFORE .
RIGHT .
LIKE COMPARED TO VIETNAM BECAUSE .
RIGHT .
I MEAN I KNOW THAT THERE WAS SO MUCH MORE SUPPORT FOR THE SOLDIERS GOING OVER AND EVEN PEOPLE THAT DID NT AGREE WITH THE WAR STILL SEEM TO BE ABLE TO SEPARATE THAT .
RIGHT AND .
YOU KNOW AND SUPPORT THE SOLDIERS SO .
I KNOW THAT UH I VE HEARD PEOPLE SAY THAT YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE THAT WENT TO WORLD WAR TWO YOU COULD NT BECOME A POLITICAL FIGURE OR PRESIDENT UNLESS YOU HAD SERVED IN THE WAR .
YEAH .
BUT THEN IN VIETNAM THAT WAS TOTALLY DIFFERENT YOU KNOW YOU COULD NT BE A POLITICAL FIGURE IF YOU WERE IN VIETNAM PROBABLY .
YEAH .
AND NOW .
YEAH .
IF YOU VE SERVED IN DESERT STORM YOU PROBABLY WOULD BE A A GOOD CANDIDATE .
YES IT WOULD BE LIKE A BONUS FOR YOUR .
E .
IMAGE OR SOMETHING .
EXACTLY EXACTLY .
YEAH IT I M SURE IT CAUSED A LOT OF CHANGES IN TERMS OF HOW MANY FAMILIES HAD TO HAVE THEIR INCOME .
OH TORN APART OH YEA .
JUST DRASTICALLY ALTERED WE HAD PEOPLE DOWN THE STREET THAT THE GUY WAS IN THE RESERVES AND HE WAS JUST ABOUT READY TO GO AND THEY HAVE A JUST HAD A NEW BABY .
UHHUH .
AND UH THEY WOULD HAVE SHE WOULD HAVE HAD TO GO BACK TO WORK AND .
RIGHT .
I THINK SHE SAID THEIR INCOME WOULD HAVE DROPPED BY LIKE TWO THIRDS .
SO IT THAT S ALSO A GOOD REASON WHY IT IT OR GOOD THAT IT ENDED AS SOON AS IT DID .
YEAH YEAH I THINK THE BIGGEST CHANGE THAT WE VE SEEN UM IN IN MY LIFE OR WHATEVER LATELY IS THE ECONOMY .
UHHUH .
AND THINGS ARE SO TIGHT AND LIKE MY HUSBAND HAS NT GOTTEN A RAISE IN TWO YEARS AND .
EXACTLY .
YOU KNOW .
AND IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYTHING IS RAISING EVERY EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE CIGARETTES .
YEAH .
NOT THAT I SMOKE BUT CIGARETTES UM UH STAMPS I MEAN IT SEEMS LIKE EVER .
EVEN DOG LICENSES I MEAN .
EXACTLY EVERYTHING SINGLE THING THAT WE DO .
YEAH .
IS HIGHER .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW AND THEY JUST RAISED THE MINIMUM WAGE TODAY BUT THAT S NOT LIKE YOU KNOW .
GOING TO EFFECT TOO MANY .
AS MUCH AS THEY SHOULD HAVE RAISED IT I M SURE .
YEAH YEAH .
BUT UH .
SO THAT S THE HARDEST THING FOR US AND UM WE VE BEEN TRYING TO KIND OF MAINTAIN TRADITIONAL LIFESTYLE IN THE SENSE OF MEANING HOME WE HAVE A THREE YEAR OLD AND A TWO YEAR OLD AND I M TRYING TO STAY HOME AS LONG AS I CAN .
RIGHT .
BUT YOU KNOW EVERY WEEK IT GETS HARDER BECAUSE I COULD GO OUT AND BE MAKING MONEY .
RIGHT RIGHT .
YOU KNOW SO THAT S A BIG UH STRESS I THINK .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW FOR THE SOCIAL CHANGES IN OUR FAMILY .
I DO NT I DO NT HAVE ANY CHILDREN OR ANYTHING RIGHT NOW I M UH I WORK AS A NEWS REPORTER IN WACO .
OH .
AND SO .
I SEE .
I GET TO SEE I GOT TO SEE A LOT OF NOT FIRSTHAND BUT UH PROBABLY A GOOD PART OF THE WAR UM AS FAR AS WHAT PEOPLE THOUGHT ABOUT IT .
UHHUH .
AND A LOT OF THINGS LIKE THAT SO .
YEAH YEAH WELL I .
IT WAS KIND OF AMAZING PEOPLE WERE COMING TO ME TO ASK ME YOU KNOW WHAT S GOING ON YOU KNOW LIKE I KNEW .
OR LIKE I SAT IN ON THE MEETINGS OR SOMETHING .
YEAH YOU HAVE AN INSIDE TRACK OR SOMETHING .
YEAH YEAH SO I GOT TO HEAR A LOT OF WHAT THE PEOPLE THOUGHT ABOUT YOU KNOW CHANGES IN IN THE WAR AND EVERYTHING SO THAT WAS PRETTY INTERESTING .
YEAH YEAH LET S SEE WHAT OTHER SOCIAL CHANGES IN THE PAST TEN YEARS OH I GUESS BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN I VE SEEN A LOT OF CHANGES .
YEAH .
IN TERMS OF WOMEN FEELING LIKE THEY HAVE TO HAVE A CAREER BE MOM BE .
EXACTLY BE EVERYTHING BE SUPERMOM .
EVERYTHING SUPERPERSON .
EXACTLY .
YEAH BECAUSE I KNOW YOU KNOW I I REALLY GET PRESSURE FROM BECAUSE I HAVE A CAREER ALSO .
UHHUH .
AND I GET A LOT OF PRESSURE FROM PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW MY COLLEAGUES THAT WHY AM I STAYING HOME YOU KNOW .
RIGHT AND .
WHEREAS BEFORE THAT NEVER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED .
WHEREAS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN .
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE SAID WHY ARE YOU GOING TO WORK .
EXACTLY UM .
SO THAT S KIND OF A DIFFERENCE FOR US I THINK THERE S MORE PRESSURE TO UM NOT NECESSARILY A NEGATIVE THING BUT ON MY HUSBAND TO BE MORE INVOLVED WITH THE FAMILY .
RIGHT .
SO HE S .
THE ROLES ARE CHANGING A LOT .
YEAH HE S GOTTEN A LOT UH YOU KNOW YOU SEE ALL KINDS OF MEN BEING INVOLVED IN THE HOUSEWORK AND TAKING CARE OF THE KIDS AND ALL BUT IN TERMS OF HIS AMOUNT OF HOURS AT WORK NOTHING ON THAT HAS LIGHTENED UP .
RIGHT .
SO IT S NOW HE HAS THE PRESSURE TOO OF BEING SUPERDAD AND SUPERCAREER AND .
AND EVEN YOU KNOW I THINK A LOT OF THE MOVIES WE SEE NOW KIND OF KIND OF PLAY A GOOD PART IN OUR CHANGES BECAUSE YOU SEE THAT THEY HAVE THE THREE MEN AND A BABY TYPE MOVIES .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
AND I THINK YOU KNOW THAT .
MISTER MOM AND .
YEAH AND THEN YOU HAVE THE WOMEN UH DETECTIVES NOW AND YOU KNOW DIFFERENT ROLES .
UHHUH .
JUST IN WHAT WE SEE AND SO WE PROBABLY WANT TO DO THAT EVEN MORE NOW .
YEAH YEAH .
YOU KNOW SINCE THE WOMEN S MOVEMENT IN THE WH SEVENTIES .
THAT S TRUE .
AND YOU KNOW WE VE COME A LONG WAY BUT I THINK IT S STILL A STILL HAVE A GOOD WAYS TO GO .
YEAH YEAH .
SO .
I THINK THERE S STILL I I KNOW THAT UM I GREW UP IN CHICAGO IN THE SIXTIES .
UHHUH .
AND WAS PART MY FAMILY WAS REAL LIBERAL AND I THINK THERE S A LOT OF UM KIND OF MYTHS THAT WE VE COME A LONG WAY JUST IN TERMS OF OUR SOCIETY .
RIGHT .
AND RACE RELATIONS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND YOU KNOW I THINK THERE S SO MUCH PREJUDICE STILL THERE .
YEAH .
AND IT S KIND OF MORE COVERT NOW PEOPLE USED TO BE MORE CLEAR AND SAY .
EXACTLY .
YOU KNOW WELL I BELIEVE IN THIS OR I BELIEVE IN THAT .
EXACTLY .
AND NOW YOU KNOW I THINK THERE S STILL TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PREJUDICE .
IT S JUST NOT AS .
BUT PEOPLE THINK OH WE RE IN THE NINETIES WE RE BEYOND ALL THAT YOU KNOW .
EXACTLY BUT IT S I MEAN LIKE I SAY WE VE COME A LONG WAY BUT WE HAVE I MEAN TWICE AS FAR TO GO .
YEAH .
STILL .
YEAH .
AND I DO NT THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE YOU KNOW REALIZE A LOT THE PLIGHT OF A LOT OF PEOPLE .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW AND YOU MAY BE IN GOOD STANDING AND EVERYTHING MAY LOOK HUNKYDORY TO YOU .
BUT THERE S SO MANY MORE PEOPLE .
BUT THERE S SO MANY MORE PEOPLE .
THAT ARE HOMELESS AND .
EXACTLY THAT YOU DO NT EVEN .
YEAH .
AND THAT YOU DO NT EVEN SEE OR KNOW ABOUT .
YEAH IT S REAL EASY TO GET ISOLATED IN YOUR OWN LITTLE COMMUNITY .

HE DID NT LOOK LIKE A COP WHEN HE DID IT .
AND I WAS SO .
THAT S NEAT .
IMPRESSED WITH THAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW USUALLY .

YEAH .
WE JUST KEEP BREEDING THEM .

NORMALLY I M ONE OF THESE PEOPLE THAT I DO NT LIKE ONE ONE MOVIE TAKING ALL THE HONORS .
EVERYTHIN YEAH YEAH .
I WANTED HIM TO WIN BEST ACTOR ON TOP OF IT HE WAS .

LIKE I SAID I WOULD NT GIVEN THE SUPPORTING ACTRESSES EITHER ONE .
YEAH .
BUT EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE OKAY THE GIRL IN IT THEY SOMEBODY MADE AN INTERESTING OBSERVATION NOW THAT I THINK BACK ON IT I D SAY YEAH I CA NT BELIEVE THAT EITHER .
SHE WAS THE ONLY INDIAN TO HAVE HER HAIR DONE AT ALL TIMES .
YOU KNOW WHAT .
I MEAN YOU KNOW .
IT WAS JUST TOO PERFECT AT ALL TIMES .
YEAH .
THAT WAS A MISTAKE THAT THEY MADE .
THEY SHOULD NT HAVE DONE IT .
YEAH .
NOW THE BEST THE SUPPORTING ACTOR HE WAS GOOD BUT FROM WHAT .
I HEARD THE GUY .
WHO GOT IT WAS BETTER SO I YOU KNOW I CAN SEE THAT .
YEAH .
BUT OH .
YOU THINK MY DAUGHTER WOULD LIKE IT .
OH WELL THERE ARE THERE IS ONE .
SPOT .
THAT WAS JUST A LITTLE BIT ON THE GORY SIDE .
OH OKAY .
BUT UM IT S IT .
S .
SHE DOES NT MIND WHEN WE COVER UP HER EYES .
OKAY NO PROBLEMS .
IT IT S JUST THE IDEA THAT THERE IS THIS ONE SPOT WHERE THE WHITE MAN HAS COME BY AND KILLED A BUNCH .
A BUFFALO AND JUST STRIPPED ITS HIDE THE HIDES .
SO THERE S .
SEE THAT S THE ONE THAT IS THE HONEST TO GOD .
THE ONE REASON .
I DO NT WANT TO SEE THE MOVIE .
YEAH BUT WELL .
IS BECAUSE I LOVE BUFFALOS FOR SOME WEIRD REASON AND I KNOW THEY RE FAKE .
AND AND OF COURSE AND WELL YEAH THAT AND PLUS I MEAN PART OF IT IS THE IDEA THAT HE GOES WITH THEM ON A BUFFALO HUNT .
SO I MEAN THEY ARE KILLING BUFFALOS IN IT .
BUT THEY DO NT STRESS THAT VERY MUCH THEY REALLY DO NT .
OKAY OKAY .
AND I THINK IT S AN EXCELLENT MOVIE FOR IF IF SHE ENJOYS MOVIES I THINK IT LL WORK PRETTY GOOD .
OH THAT LL BE GOOD .
WE REALLY NEED SOME MY HUSBAND KEEPS WANTING TO .

UHHUH .
AND THAT THEY WANTED IN SO THEY RE GOING TO PUT IT IN THE VIDEO .
YEAH .
AND THAT WAY .
YOU CAN WATCH IT AT YOUR LEISURE .
WELL YEAH I .
KIND OF LIKE IT WHEN THEY DO THAT BECAUSE THE VIDEO LIKE I SAID THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS YOU CA NT DO WITH A VIDEO .
YEAH .
AND THE IDEA THAT THEY MAY PUT A LITTLE EXTRA IN IT .
I THINK IS A GOOD IDEA .
YEAH YEAH .
BECAUSE I MEAN WHEN YOU RENT A VIDEO VIDEOS OF COURSE ARE NOT CHEAP EITHER .
TRUE .
AND SO THE IDEA OF GETTING A LITTLE EXTRA WITH IT .
I THINK IS A GOOD IDEA .
BECAUSE THEY THEY MAKE BUNDLES OF MONEY OFF THOSE THINGS .
I KNOW IT .
IS NT THAT RIDICULOUS .
WE HAVE CABLE WHICH .
OH I DO TOO .
HELPS A LOT .
YEAH BUT NOT ENOUGH .
YEAH WE KEEP HOLDING OUT YOU KNOW .
YEAH I M GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE YOU KNOW I WATCH WELL I WATCH NICK AT NIGHT .
HI HOW ARE YOU .

WELL AS A MATTER OF FACT .
I M BEFORE WE STARTED THIS CONVERSATION .
I WAS WORKING ON MY P C AT HOME .
YEAH .
DO YOU HAVE ONE .
NO I DO NT HAVE ONE AT HOME .
I WORK WITH ONE ON AT WORK .
YEAH .
CONTINUALLY YOU KNOW BUT I DO NOT HAVE ONE OF MY OWN AT HOME .
DO YOU HAVE .
WHAT DO YOU HAVE AT HOME .

COMPUTER BUT IT IS THE .
I B M .
UHHUH .
UM CLONE .
IT S NOT THE T I P C .
RIGHT .
FROM BACK WHEN .
FROM THE OLDIES BUT THE GOODIES .
RIGHT .
IT S PROBABLY PRETTY CLOSE TO WHAT .
I HAVE BECAUSE I HAVE THE SAME KIND OF THING AT WORK .
I HAVE A THREE EIGHTYSIX S X .
WHICH IS T I .
COMPUTER BUT EVERYTHING IN IS IN I B M MODE .
SO .
YEAH THAT S WHAT .
WE HAVE .
UM .
DO YOU USE IT .
A LOT AT HOME .
WELL I REALLY DO .
I UM AM AN ACCOUNTANT AND .
UHHUH .
BUT I WORK AT HOME .
UHHUH .
SO YOU RE ON IT .
A LOT .
SO I USE IT FOR THAT QUITE OFTEN .
UHHUH .
WE HAVE YOU KNOW USED SOME OF IT FOR SOME PERSONAL THINGS .
WE KEEP TRACK OF PERSONAL BUDGETS AND THINGS LIKE THAT ON IT .
I SINCE IT S TAX SEASON I M DOING A LOT OF TAXES SO I DO A LOT OF UM A LOT OF THAT WORK ON IT AS WELL .
I WAS AMAZED WHEN I TOOK OUR TAXES TO OUR TAX PERSON AND SHE WORKS OUT OF HER HOME ALSO .
UHHUH .
AND THE UH SOFTWARE .
THAT DOES THE TAXES IS JUST INCREDIBLE .
OH IT IS .
YOU KNOW I MEAN SHE JUST YOU KNOW I EXPECTED TO GO AND YOU KNOW DROP THE STUFF OFF AND GO BACK TWO WEEKS LATER .
AND YOU KNOW SHE HAD IT DONE AND OUT IN TWENTY MINUTES ON HER LITTLE P C .
YEAH YOU CAN .
IT WAS GREAT .
YES YOU CAN THAT S RIGHT .
THAT S WONDERFUL .
I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT THAT THAT HAVING ONE AT HOME WOULD BE NEAT .
I JUST DO NT KNOW IF WE WOULD REALLY USE IT THAT MUCH .
YOU KNOW .
WE REALLY WE .
DECI WE DID NT DECIDE TO GET ONE UNTIL I STARTED WORKING AT HOME .
UHHUH .
THEN YOU KNOW THEN WE THOUGHT WELL WE CAN USE IT FOR YOU KNOW SOME PERSONAL THINGS .
WE DI FOR US .
IT REALLY TOOK YOU KNOW A BUSINESS APPLICATION .
UHHUH .
TO JUSTIFY THE EXPENSE OF IT .
OH DEFINITELY DEFINITELY .
I KNOW MY STEPFATHER BOUGHT MY MOTHER .
A LITTLE PERSONAL COMPUTER OH I GUESS PROBABLY THREE YEARS AGO FOR CHRISTMAS AND YOU KNOW IT S GOT SOME STUFF ON IT .
IT .
S GOT A NICE LITTLE WORD PROCESSING SOFTWARE ON IT YOU KNOW AND SOME .
BUDGETING TYPE THINGS AND STUFF .
AND I DO NT THINK SHE S EVER TOUCHED IT .
REALLY .
YOU KNOW .
IT JUST IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF TROUBLE FOR SOMETHING AT HOME .
YOU KNOW SHE ALWAYS SEEMS TO HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO THAN TO TRY TO SIT DOWN AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE HER COMPUTER .
YOU KNOW .
SO .
RIGHT .
SHE COULD JUST AS EASILY DO THOSE THINGS BY HAND .
YEAH JUST AS QUICKLY .
YEAH .
NOW I KNOW MY BOSS HAS BOUGHT THE SOFTWARE UM THAT HE CAN THAT HIS CHECKBOOK IS ON ON .
UHHUH .
ON A DISK AND HE GOES IN AND PRIN AND TYPES HIS CHECKS ON THE SCREEN AND THEN HITS PRINT AND THEY PRINT OUT ON THE CHECKS AND HE S ORDERED ENVELOPES WITH THE WINDOWS IN THE RIGHT PLACES .
OH MY GOSH .
YOU KNOW AND HE JUST WHIPS OUT YOU KNOW I SAW HIM YESTERDAY MORNING OVER THERE AND AND HE PAID HIS MONTHLY BILLS AND HE JUST YOU KNOW WROTE ALL THE CHECKS ON THE SCREEN AND HIT PRINT AND IT PRINTED OUT LIKE TEN CHECKS AND HE JUST YOU KNOW THEY RE PERFORATED AND HE JUST RIPPED THEM OFF .
THEY GO THROUGH JUST A CONTINUOUS THING ON THE PRINTER .
RIGHT .
AND HE RIPPED THEM OFF AND STUCK THEM IN THE ENVELOPES AND THERE THEY WENT .
YOU KNOW AND HE SAID YOU KNOW I CAN BALANCE MY CHECKBOOK IN SECONDS YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE IT S ALL IN THE COMPUTER YOU KNOW .
SO .
AND YOU KNOW THERE S NOT GOING TO BE THOSE ADDING MISTAKES THAT WE .
ALL MAKE .
THAT S EXACTLY WHY .
HE SAID YOU KNOW HE SAID USED TO BE I ALWAYS SAT LOOKING FOR THOSE YOU KNOW .
HE SAID THIS WAY .
THERE IS NT ANY .
YOU KNOW IT DOES IT FOR YOU .
SO .
THIS YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME DEFINITELY SOME SOME ADVANTAGES TO IT .
IT S JUST A MATTER OF LIKE YOU SAY ARE THE ADVANTAGES DOES IT JUSTIFY THE COST IF YOU RE USING IT STRICTLY FOR PERSONAL BUSINESS .
SO .
RIGHT .
I I THINK IN MOST CASES I D HAVE TO SAY NO .
NOT UNLESS SOMEBODY REALLY ENJOYS IT .
RIGHT .
OR PERHAPS IS USING IT FOR EDUCATION .
I HAVE A FOUR YEAR OLD SON AND WE HAVE SOME EDUCATION PROGRAMS THAT HE LIKES .
A LITTLE SESAME STREET ONE .
YEAH YEAH .
AND WE HAVE ANOTHER .
ONE .
THAT PLAYS MUSIC AND HE REALLY LIKES THAT ONE .
AS HE GROWS UP HE LL BE EVEN MORE AND MORE TOO .
THAT S RIGHT .
THAT LL BE GREAT .
AND YEAH ON NOW I THINK ABOUT IT I GUESS FOR FOR KIDS LIKE AS THEY GET OLDER ESPECIALLY NOW .
UHHUH .
WHEN THEY GET TO JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL HIGH SCHOOL AND EVEN COLLEGE .
I MEAN MY SISTER WENT TO COLLEGE STARTED ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO AND SHE HAD TO HAVE A A COMPUTER .
REALLY .
I MEAN IT WAS LIKE A NECESSITY .
WELL YEAH I .
SHE COULD NT IMAGINE GOING THROUGH COLLEGE WITHOUT A COMPUTER .
WELL I M GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW .
I M YOU KNOW GOING PART TIME IN THE EVENINGS AND YOU KNOW I DO YEAH EVERYTHING HAS TO BE TYPED .
I MEAN THEY REQUIRE IT .
YOU HAVE TO TYPE IT .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW AND AND SO I M UP HERE YOU KNOW NIGHTS AND WEEKENDS YOU KNOW WORKING ON THE LITTLE P ON THE P C UP HERE YOU KNOW TYPING STUFF .
SO I CAN SEE WHERE IT WOULD BE A GREAT ADVANTAGE TO HAVE ONE AT HOME YOU KNOW IF YOU WERE GOING TO SCHOOL .
YEAH ANY .
MORE .
I DO NT EVEN KNOW IF THEY HAVE IF A COLLEGE KID WOULD HAVE A TYPEWRITER .
WELL YOU I DO NT KNOW .
PROBABLY NOT EVEN NO .
NO NO AND THEY PROBABLY USED TO HAVE IT .
I JUST FINISHED A A MAJOR RESEARCH PAPER .
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AND I COULD NT IMAGINE NOT HAVING THAT THING ON A DISK .
UHHUH .
WHERE I COULD GO BACK IN AND MOVE STUFF AROUND AND CHANGE IT .
I I DO NT KNOW WHAT .
THEY USED TO DO BEFORE THEY .
WELL UNFORTUNATELY IN OUR FAMILY MY HUSBAND AND I WENT THROUGH COLLEGE TOGETHER AND THEN HE WENT ON AND GOT HIS MASTER S DEGREE WHILE I WAS WORKING .
UHHUH .
AND I M THE BETTER TYPIST .
UHHUH .
OF US AND WE JUST HAD A REGULAR OLD TYPEWRITER NOT EVEN A CORRECTING ONE BACK THEN .
OH .
IT .
WAS NT THAT LONG AGO BUT .
AND YOU HAD TO TYPE ALL OF HIS PAPERS .
I TYPED HIS MASTER S PAPERS AND THINGS ON A TYPEWRITER .
OH GOSH .
OH BOY TO HAVE A COMPUTER BACK THEN .
OH CUT YOUR TIME IN HALF AT LEAST .
AT LEAST .
AT LEAST .
I MEAN AND THEN OF COURSE .
YOU HAVE SOME CHANGES TO MAKE AND DO THE WHOLE THING OVER .
YOU TAKE OUT A SENTENCE ON A COMPUTER .
YOU TAKE IT OUT BLEEP PRINT IT OUT FINE .
UHHUH .
TAKE OUT A SENTENCE ON A PIECE OF PAPER .
YOU DO THE WHOLE THING OVER .
RIGHT .
THAT S RIGHT .
YOU KNOW I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS WORKING IN HIGH SCHOOL YOU KNOW I WAS WORKING IN AN OFFICE RIGHT AFTER I GOT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL .
I CONTINUED WORKING THERE FOR PROBABLY ANOTHER YEAR .
AND WE DID EVERYTHING ON A TYPEWRITER .
OH YEAH .
EVERYTHING .
BUT IT S AMAZING YOU KNOW THEN WHEN WHERE YOU KNOW SOMEONE WOULD HAVE YOU TYPE A LETTER THEY DID IT RIGHT THEY DID IT RIGHT .
I MEAN THEY WERE .
THE FIRST TIME .
YEAH THEY SIT THERE AND THEY GO IS THIS REALLY WHAT .
I WANT TO SAY AND YOU TYPED IT AND THAT WAS IT AND NOW YOU KNOW PEOPLE JUST SEND IT BACK OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER .
THAT S PROBABLY ONE OF THE PROBLEMS AND FRUSTRATIONS THAT IT S BROUGHT ABOUT BECAUSE PEOPLE DO FEEL LIKE OH WELL WE CAN JUST CHANGE IT .
WELL WE LL TRY THIS OUT AND SEE WHAT .
IT LOOKS LIKE .
YEAH .
YEAH USE IT AS A JUST A .
YEAH INSTEAD OF KNOWING WHAT .
THEY WANT TO SAY .
RIGHT .
BEFORE THEY .
EVE THEY JUST YOU KNOW PLAY WITH IT AND WHICH IN A WAY IS NICE TO BE ABLE TO DO BUT YOU KNOW IT IT GETS A LITTLE OUT OF HAND SOMETIMES .
I VE SEEN IT GET OUT OF HAND UP HERE YOU KNOW .
OH YEAH .
WHERE WE VE GOT A SECRETARY .
THAT SITS OVER HERE THAT S KEEPING METRICS RIGHT NOW AND KEEPING UP YOU KNOW OF ALL THE LETTERS I TYPE HOW MANY CHA HOW MANY OF THEM DO I MAKE CHANGES ON .
AND ON EACH LETTER WHAT TYPES OF CHANGES .
ARE THEY .
TYPOS .
ARE THEY BECAUSE I COULD NT READ IT OR PEOPLE JUST CHANGE A LIKE ONE WORD BECAUSE THEY THINK IT SOUNDS BETTER OR WHATEVER .
AND YOU KNOW SHE S ALSO KEEPING A PERCENTAGE YOU KNOW WHAT PERCENTAGE OF LETTERS .
AM .
I RETYPING FOR WHATEVER REASON .
UHHUH .
AND THERE S LIKE ONE WEEK SHE DID RETYPES ON NINETY PERCENT OF WHAT .
SHE TYPED .
I BELIEVE IT .
YOU KNOW AND IT S LIKE YOU KNOW IT S RIDICULOUS AND THAT WAS THAT WAS THE HIGH WEEK BUT IT S RUNNING ABOUT SEVENTY .
UHHUH .
WHICH IS STILL RIDICULOUS TO HAVE TO MAKE CHANGES TO SEVENTY PERCENT OF EVERYTHING THAT SHE TYPES .
WELL IT S GOOD THAT SHE DOES THAT I MEAN BRING IT TO PEOPLE S ATTENTION .
WELL THAT S EXACTLY RIGHT .
YOU KNOW SHE KEEPS YOU KNOW KEEPS SEVERAL WEEKS WORTH OF DATA AND THEN IN ADDITION IS KEEPING COPIES OF ALL THE CHANGES TO SHOW YOU KNOW LOOK THIS DID NT REALLY NEED TO BE CHANGED .
YOU KNOW THIS IS RIDICULOUS AND YOU KNOW CHANGING ADD THIS TIME TO NOW .
YOU KNOW I MEAN THAT S THE KIND OF THINGS YOU KNOW THAT SHE S KEEPING AND SHOWING THAT THIS WAS A BIG WASTE OF TIME IT WAS A WASTE OF PAPER IT WAS A WASTE YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
TO CHANGE SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
SO .
ANYWAY MAYBE YOU KNOW MAYBE IT LL IT LL HELP IN SOME WAY BUT I DO NT KNOW .
THERE THERE DEFINITELY EVEN WITH THE FEW DISADVANTAGES LIKE THAT ARE FAR BETTER THAN THE ALTERNATIVE .
OH I HAVE TO .
WITHOUT A DOUBT .
WITHOUT A DOUBT .
WELL I WOULD LIKE TO GET ONE AT HOME .
SOME DAY .
WE VE GOT A TWO YEAR OLD SON AND SO YOU KNOW SOME DAY .
I WOULD LIKE TO GET EVEN JUST LIKE THE VIDEO TELL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW JUST TO TO BE ABLE TO PULL IN SOURCES FROM OUTSIDE WOULD BE WONDERFUL .

UHHUH .
SO I WAS GOING TO GO OUT AND SEE WHAT THEY WERE DOING .
WELL OKAY .
OKAY HEY THANKS SO MUCH .
YEAH THANK YOU IT WAS NICE TALKING WITH YOU .
UHHUH AND YOU SAID THIS WAS YOUR FI WELL YOU LL YOU LL GET A COUPLE MORE PROBABLY .
YEAH .
I UH I CALLED YESTERDAY I OR FRIDAY MAYBE I TALKED TO SOMEBODY THAT UH I GOT THEM ON UH DURING THE DAY IT WAS A HOUSEWIFE AND SHE WAS HOME WITH TWO KIDS .
UGH .
AND WHILE WE RE TALKING THE KIDS ARE SCREAMING IN THE BACKGROUND YOU KNOW THAT THEY WANTED SOMETHING AND THEY WERE ARGUING BACK AND FORTH AND SHE JUST KEPT TALKING THE WHOLE TIME IT WAS PRETTY FUNNY .
YEAH KIND OF HARD THAT WAY .
OKAY .
OKAY .
HEY THANKS A LOT I LL TALK TO YOU LATER .
ALL RIGHT THANK YOU BYEBYE .
BYE .
OKAY .
OKAY .
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT SHOULD .
UM I LIKE THE IDEA OF NURSING HOMES AS A AS A GROWING CHOI THE CHOICES YOU HAVE IN NURSING HOMES NOW WHEREAS USED TO YOU USED TO HAVE ONLY YOU PUT YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN PEOPLE GOT TO THE POINT WHERE THEY WERE DEBILITATED AND COULD NT TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES .
UHHUH .
AND THERE WAS NO OTHER CHOICE YOU COULD NT TAKE THEM IN YOUR OWN HOME THEN THEY WENT INTO A NURSING HOME YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU LIVED TOO FAR AWAY TO CARE FOR THEM .
RIGHT .
OR YOUR DAILY JOB OR WHATEVER PREVENTED IT BUT UM I LIKE THE CHOICES YOU HAVE NOW WHERE THEY CAN GO INTO AN APARTMENT TYPE SETTING AND HAVE SOME BASICALLY HAVE A INDEPENDENT LIFESTYLE BUT ASSISTED CARE .
YEAH .
AND THEN IF THINGS DETERIORATE THEY CAN GO TO A SECOND LEVEL WHICH IS YOU KNOW LIKE WHERE THEY PREPARE THEIR MEALS FOR THEM .
UHHUH .
AND AND THEY STILL LIVE SOMEWHAT INDEPENDENTLY BUT THEY HAVE PEOPLE CHECKING ON THEM AND MAKING SURE THEY HAVE HOT MEALS .
UHHUH .
AND THEN WHERE THE SAME COMMUNITY A LOT OF TIMES WILL ALSO HAVE THE THIRD LEVEL WHICH IS FULL CARE YOU KNOW WHERE SOME PEOPLE CA NT WHERE THEY RE IN A WHEELCHAIR OR WHERE THEY RE IN A BED .
UHHUH .
AND THEY CA NT GET AROUND BUT THEN THEY HAVE FULL CARE BUT I REALLY LIKE THOSE THOSE OPTIONS NOW AND AND I THINK ABOUT IT MORE OFTEN BECAUSE MY HUSBAND S PARENTS ARE THEY RE VERY ACTIVE RIGHT NOW BUT THEY RE SEVENTYFIVE AND AND SEVENTYTWO SO THAT COMES UP SOMEWHAT MORE OFTEN IN MY THOUGHTS AS I SEE THESE THINGS .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE OF THEIR AGE .
YES UM IT S IT S FUNNY BECAUSE UM I KNOW PEOPLE AT THAT ARE IN ALL THREE AND PEOPLE THAT WORK YOU KNOW I KNOW SOMEONE THAT W WORKS IN ALL THREE DIFFERENT STAGES LIKE YOU SAID .
UHHUH .
AND I HAVE KNOWN YOU KNOW PEOPLE CLOSE TO ME THAT HAVE BEEN IN ALL THREE AND I HAVE SEEN THEM LIKE GO FROM WHERE THEY RE IN AN APARTMENT BUILDING THEY WE CALL IT UM WELL WE HAVE HIGH RISES AND IT S JUST FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE YOU KNOW OR MOST OF MOST OF ONE OF THEIR SPOUSES HAS ALREADY PASSED AWAY .
UHHUH .
AND IT S REALLY NICE FOR THEM BECAUSE THEN THEY RE WITH PEOPLE THEIR OWN AGE AND PEOPLE THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH THINGS EXACTLY WHAT THEY HAVE GONE THROUGH .
UHHUH .
AND IT S IT S REALLY NICE TO GO AND SEE THEM YOU KNOW WHERE THEY CAN STILL GET AROUND AND EVERYTHING AND THEY STILL YOU KNOW DO THEIR OWN THING BUT IT S IT S REALLY NICE TO SEE THEM BECAUSE I MEAN SOMETIMES LIKE I HAD A GREAT AUNT SHE LIVED WITH US FOR UM THREE MONTHS AND BECAUSE SHE S STARTING TO GET ALZHEIMER S DISEASE AND I KNOW I HAVE A BUNCH OF YOUNGER BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND I KNOW IT WAS HARD FOR ME AS WELL AS IT WAS FOR THEM TO TO ACTUALLY SIT DOWN BECAUSE SHE DOES NT LIKE DOING THINGS THAT THE YOUNGER KIDS LIKE DOING .
RIGHT .
AND TO ACTUALLY SIT SO IT S REALLY NICE TO SEE THAT .
YEAH THAT S SOME OF THE THINGS I WOULD FIND IMPORTANT BEFORE I I WOULD LOOK INTO THAT FOR A PERSON IS IS IS LIKE YOU RE SAYING A GOOD MIX OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE SAME INTERESTS .
UHHUH .
AND UH AND THE PROGRAMS HERE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT UH BESIDES JUST DIFFERENT LEVELS WITHIN THE SAME PROGRAM THEY HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROGRAMS THEY HAVE SEVERAL AREAS THEY HAVE ONE AREA IN TOWN WHERE THE PEOPLE I GUESS A LOT OF IT COMES WITH MONEY I THIS THIS ONE AREA IS A BIT MORE EXPENSIVE AND THE PEOPLE WHO PROBABLY ARE LIVING THERE HAVE HAD MORE MONEY IN THEIR LIFE BUT BUT THINGS THAT PEOPLE WHERE THEY HAVE SIMILAR INTERESTS .
UHHUH .
LIKE YOU RE SAYING AND THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY HAVE WHERE WHERE SOME OF THEM WILL HAVE DANCES ONCE A WEEK .
YEAH .
AND SOME OF THEM SPONSOR DIFFERENT CRAFTS AND THEY GO TO THE ARBORETUM TO SEE THINGS AND THEY MAKE SURE THAT IF THEY WANT TO GO TO CHURCH THERE S A BUS THERE .
UHHUH .
AND IT LL OR YOU KNOW OR SOMEONE WILL TRANSPORT THEM TO A SPECIFIC CHURCH EVEN THOUGH IT S YOU KNOW MAYBE IT S THIRTY MINUTES AWAY BECAUSE IT S A BIG YOU KNOW DALLAS AREA IS A BIG METROPOLITAN AREA .
YEAH .
BUT A LOT OF THESE PLACES HAVE HAVE CHURCHES OR HAVE HAVE INDIVIDUAL TRANSPORTATION THAT S THAT S SOMETHING I D LOOK FOR SOMETHING THAT WOULD MAKE ME HAPPY PERSONALLY IF I HAD TO LIVE THERE .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE I DO NT THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE REALLY EVEN IN THE NICE ONES AND EVEN IN THE ONES WHERE THEY CAN LIVE FAIRLY INDEPENDENTLY THEY REALLY DO NT NECESSARILY LIKE IT .
YEAH .
BECAUSE THEY RE NOT IN THEIR OWN HOME .
UHHUH .
SO I THINK THOSE KINDS OF THINGS TO MAKE IT MORE HOMELIKE AND TO MAKE IT MORE UM ENJOYABLE FOR THEM THAT D THAT D BE ONE THING I D LOOK FOR ALONG WITH THE UH HEALTH CARE ASPECTS .
UHHUH .
TO MAKE SURE THEY HAD YOU KNOW THAT IT WAS CLEAN AND THAT THEY HAD GOOD DOCTORS AND NURSES .
YEAH UM I M IN COLLEGE AND I M I M ONLY TWENTYONE BUT WE HAD A SPEE I HAD A SPEECH CLASS LAST SEMESTER AND THERE WAS A GIRL IN MY CLASS WHO DID A SPEECH ON HOME CARE OF THE ELDERLY .
UHHUH .
AND I WAS SO SURPRISED TO HEAR HOW MANY PEOPLE LIKE WHENEVER THEY RE IN YOU KNOW THE OLDER PEOPLE THEY RE LIKE UM FASTENED TO THEIR BEDS SO THEY CA NT GET OUT JUST BECAUSE THEY YOU KNOW THEY WANDER THE HALLS .
UHHUH .
AND THEY GET THE WRONG MEDICINE JUST BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE THE AIDES OR WHOEVER JUST GIVE THEM THE WRONG MEDICINE .
YEAH .
AND SO MANY OF THEM YOU KNOW ARE .
ARE OVERMEDICATED TOO .
YES AND IT WAS IT WAS AWFUL TO HEAR WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT SOME OF THESE PEOPLE REALLY WENT THROUGH AND I FORGET THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW THAT SHE HAD SAID AND THIS WAS I MEAN SHE DID RESEARCH ON IT AND EVERYTHING .
UHHUH YEAH THAT S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT WE DO NT THINK ABOUT AS WE GET OLDER AND THE THE MONEY THAT IT NOW REQUIRES TO UH BE IN ONE OF THESE PLACES BECAUSE SOME OF THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE JUST ON SOCIAL SECURITY AND IF THEY DO NT HAVE ANY LIVING RELATIVES PERHAPS THEY NEVER HAD CHILDREN OR IF THEIR CHILDREN YOU KNOW PASSED AWAY BEFORE THEY DID .
UHHUH .
THEY CAN BE IN SOME PLACES THAT ARE YOU KNOW THAT THAT ARE NOT GOOD .
YEAH .
OR THEY THEY HAVE VERY MINIMUM MINIMAL CARE AND THE THE CARE THAT THEY ARE GETTING THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GIVING IT ARE PRO ARE PAID AT A MINIMUM WAGE AND THEY JUST DO THEY DO NT CARE AS MUCH .
YEAH .
AND AND LIKE YOU SAID THEY RE TRYING TO MAKE IT THE CARETAKERS IN SOME CASES ARE TRYING TO MAKE EASY ON THEMSELVES TO THE POINT WHERE THEY RE PUTTING PEOPLE IN BED OR OVERMEDICATING THEM SO THEY LL STAY IN ONE SPOT AND NOT DO ANYTHING .
UHHUH .
THAT CERTAINLY WOULD BE SOMETHING TO TO WATCH FOR BECAUSE YOU VE GOT WITH SOME OF THEM BEING SOME OF THESE PLACES CAN EVEN BE TWO AND THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH TO STAY IN MUMBLEX .
I KNOW AND SOME AND SOMETIMES THEY SHARE A ROOM AND IT S JUST A LITTLE CUBBYHOLE .
YEAH .
AND THEY SHARE IT WITH ANOTHER PERSON AND THEY RE STILL PAYING THAT MUCH .
OH YEAH SO YOU VE .
IT IT IT JUST SOMETIMES IT JUST SEEMS RIDICULOUS .
YEAH YOU VE GOT TO REALLY STRIKE A BALANCE IN WHAT KIND OF CARE WHAT KIND OF LEVEL OF CARE YOU NEED AND THEN WHAT YOU CAN UNFORTUNATELY WHAT YOU CAN AFFORD AT THE SAME TIME .
UHHUH UHHUH YEAH UM I VE BEEN LUCKY WELL MY MOM S UM PARENTS THEY RE BOTH IN THEIR IN THEIR UH EIGHTIES AND I WAS JUST HOME FOR SPRING BREAK AND MY GRANDMA SAID SOMETHING TO ME ABOUT SHE GOES WELL MAYBE WE LL JUST SELL THE HOUSE SHE SAID IT S GETTING TOO BIG FOR US TO TAKE CARE OF AND I WAS LIKE NO NO NO .
STAY IN THE HOUSE AS LONG AS YOU CAN .
WELL LIKE THERE ARE OTHER COMMUNITIES TOO THAT ARE NT NECESSARILY A NURSING HOME I HAD AN AUNT WHO LIVED IN A SMALL TOWN IN TEXAS THAT UM WAS IN A IT WAS A IT WAS A HOUSING DIVISION EACH PERSON HAD THEIR OWN LITTLE BITTY HOUSE .
UHHUH .
THAT THEY HAD BUILT AND IT WAS UM SUPPLEMENTED THEIR THEY WERE MOST OF THEM WERE ON SOCIAL SECURITY AND THEY GOT SOME KIND OF SUPPLEMENTAL AID BESIDES FROM THE STATE GOVERNMENT BUT IT WAS THIS LITTLE BITTY ONE BEDROOM HOUSE BUT IT WAS A SEPARATE HOUSE AND THEY HAD A LIVING ROOM AND A BEDROOM AND A KITCHEN .
OH .
AND A BATHROOM SO THEY STILL HAD THEY HAD AND THEY HAD PEOPLE WHO CAME IN WHO UM SUPERVISED TH ALL THESE HOUSES WERE LIKE FIFTEEN OR TWENTY OF THEM ALL RIGHT TOGETHER KIND OF LIKE ON ONE BLOCK .
UHHUH .
AND THEY HAD A A SUPERVISORY UM WAS NT A HOUSE REALLY IT WAS IT WAS MORE LIKE UM A HEADQUARTERS .
IT SOUNDS LIKE UH AN APARTMENT OR SOM .
OR SOMETHING ANYWAY WHERE THEY THEY STAFFED IT THREE SHIFTS A DAY SO THAT SOMEONE IF THEY NEEDED SOMEONE THEY COULD RING AND AND SOMEONE .
OH .
COULD COME TO THEIR HOUSE .
YEAH .
AND THAT AND THEY ALWAYS COOKED THEN THEY HAD THEY HAD THE CHOICE YOU KNOW THEY LIVED IN THEIR OWN LITTLE HOUSE .
UHHUH .
THEY HAD THEIR OWN POSSESSIONS STILL IN THERE TO SOME EX YOU KNOW SOME OF THEM .
UHHUH .
AND THEY COULD MAKE THEIR OWN BREAKFAST IF THEY WANTED TO AND THEIR OWN DINNER AND THEY ALWAYS HAD SOMEBODY COME IN FOR LUNCH BUT THEY HAD PEOPLE WHO DID YOU KNOW THEY DID NT HAVE TO MESS WITH THE YARD .
UHHUH .
THEY HAD PEOPLE WHO DID THE YARD AND THEY HAD A MAID THAT UH UH SERVICE THAT CAME IN AND CLEANED EVERYBODY S HOUSE SO THEY DID NT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT .
OH YEAH .
AND IT WAS REALLY A NICE IT WAS REALLY A NICE COMPROMISE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE SHE FELT LIKE SHE WAS STILL LIVING IN HER OWN HOUSE .
UHHUH .
AND SHE STILL HAD HER OWN COUCH AND HER OWN BED AND IT IT REALLY HELPED A LOT AND SHE WAS A LOT MORE COMFORTABLE AND SHE DID NT RESENT MUMBLEX LIKE HAVING TO BE IN A SITUATION BECAUSE SHE STILL HAD A LOT OF HER OWN POSSESSIONS .
OH REALLY .
YEAH .
SEE NOW WE VE RUN INTO A LOT OF PROBLEMS WHERE OUR RELATIVES WERE WELL I VE LIVED HERE FOR THIRTY YEARS .
YEAH .
AND WE VE BUILT THIS AND THIS IS OUR HOME AND WE HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SHOW FOR OUR LIVES AND WE DO NT WANT TO LEAVE .
OH YEAH .
UH WE VE RUN INTO A LOT OF THAT .
YEAH IT WOULD BE HARD TO .
UHHUH .
THAT S THAT S WHY THIS SHE WAS SHE FELT THAT WAY TOO BUT WHEN IT HELPED THAT SHE GOT TO STILL BE IN A HOUSE AND STILL HAVE SOME OF HER OWN STUFF .
YEAH .
AND I GUESS THAT THAT IT WAS A PILOT PROGRAM I THINK WHERE SHE LIVED SO IT S PROBABLY NOT WIDELY AVAILABLE .
UHHUH YEAH THAT S WHAT LIKE WELL UM NOW I KNOW WE HAVE AN OL WE CALL IT AN OLD FOLKS HOME BUT IT S BASICALLY A NURSING HOME TOO BUT EVERYONE HAS BASICALLY THEIR OWN ROOM .
YEAH .
AND THEY RE ALLOW YOU KNOW TH NONE OF THEM HAVE CARS BECAUSE THEY CA NT DRIVE .
UHHUH .
BUT IF SOMEONE WOULD COME TO GET THEM YOU KNOW THEY RE ALLOWED TO LEAVE WITH THEM AND THERE S A STAFF THERE THAT MAKES SUPPER FOR THEM AND EACH PERSON HAS A CHORE LIKE MAYBE WEDNESDAY NIGHT IT S GEORGE S TURN TO SET ALL THE TABLES .
UH .
AND IT S REALLY NICE BECAUSE THAT KEEPS THEM GOING TOO RATHER THAN JUST SITTING AROUND .
YEAH .
AND I KNOW UM OUR YOUTH GROUP GOES OVER AND WE PLAY BINGO WITH THEM AND YOU KNOW LIKE .
THAT S GOOD .
STUFF LIKE THAT .
EVERYBODY NEEDS SOME SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY .
UHHUH .
AN EVEN EVEN IF IT S JUST A LITTLE BIT .
YEAH JUST TO KEEP THEM GOING .
YEAH .
UHHUH .
SO IT S IT S MORE LIKE LIVING WITH A BIG IN A BIG HOUSE WHERE IT S YOUR TURN TO TO SET THE TABLE LIKE YOU RE SAYING OR WHATEVER .
YEAH .
INSTEAD OF BEING WAITED ON HAND AND FOOT ALL THE TIME .
UHHUH .
YEAH THAT WOULD BE NICE .
BUT I THINK BEFORE I LIKE YOU I DO NT THINK Y I DO NT THINK IT S RIGHT TO JUST PUT SOMEONE IN IT I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE TO AGREE TO GO IN IT .
YES UNLESS THEY RE AT A POINT WHERE THEY RE MENTALLY .
WELL YEAH .
INCAPACITATED LIKE YOU RE SAYING WITH ALZHEIMER S AND STUFF THEY RE GOING TO BE SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO BE THERE .
UHHUH .
WHETHER THEY WANT TO OR NOT AND THAT S WHEN IT S IMPORTANT TO REALLY CHECK OUT THE MEDICAL ASPECTS OF IT WHEN YOU RE WHEN YOU RE IN SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
THAT THEY LL GET THE KIND OF MEDICAL CARE THEY WANT WITHOUT OR THEY NEED WITHOUT OVERDOING IT .

UM I THINK I LIKE I I M REALLY PARTICULAR ABOUT THE TYPE OF MUSIC THAT I LISTEN TO .
UHHUH .
BUT THE UH THERE S SUCH A WIDE SELECTION I THINK I LIKE A LOT I LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF MUSIC .
YOU KNOW I I I LIKE MUSIC .
THAT IS THAT I FEEL IF IT IS PERFORMED CORRECTLY OR IF IT S DONE RIGHT OR IF THE VERSION IS DONE RIGHT I LIKE IT .
YEAH .
BUT IF IF IT S NOT THEN I WO NT .
I I REALLY DO NT .
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT RAP MUSIC .
RAP .
IT SEEMS TO BE SO POPULAR THESE DAYS .
YEAH .
WELL I I DO NT REALLY HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST RAP MUSIC .
I THE ONE THING .
I DO OBJECT TO ABOUT RAP MUSIC IS IS WHEN IT BECOMES MILITANT .
UHHUH .
OR IF IT S UH VIOLENCE ORIENTED .
RIGHT .
I I HAVE STRONG OBJECTIONS TO THAT .
UM ACTUALLY I LISTEN TO ONE TIME .
I REMEMBER THIS WAS BACK WHEN EVEN UH I WOULD SAY ABOUT TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS AGO I .
WHEN IT WAS REALLY JUST STARTING .
YEAH RIGHT WHEN IT WAS JUST STARTING .
YEAH .
I HEARD WHAT WAS CALLED TALKING BLUES .
UHHUH .
WHICH ACTUALLY IS RAP .
UHHUH .
AND UH IT WAS ABOUT THE THE PIECE OF MUSIC THE PIECE OF MUSIC WAS ABOUT I THINK ABOUT FORTY OR FIFTY YEARS OLD .
AND IT WAS INCREDIBLE I MEAN THE PARALLEL YOU KNOW BETWEEN IT AND RAP .
RIGHT .
AND UM YOU YOU LISTEN A LOT IF YOU IF YOU HEAR A LOT OF OLD GOSPEL UH UH ESPECIALLY WELL THE BLACK GOSPEL .
YOU KNOW YOU WILL YOU KNOW YOU CAN REALLY PICK IT UP .
I MEAN .
YEAH YOU REALLY .
IT SEEMED TO BE INFLUENCED BY A LOT OF DIFFERENT MUSIC .
A LOT OF TIMES YOU LL HEAR SONGS THAT YOU KNOW THEY RE NOT ORIGINAL .
YEAH .
BUT HAVE BEEN PUT TO A RAP KIND OF A RHYTHM .
AND UH SOUNDS IT SOUNDS SO MUCH DIFFERENT AND YET I I HAVE A MUCH YOUNGER SISTER .
WHO LISTENS TO A LOT OF RAP MUSIC AND UH SHE THINKS ITS PRETTY FUNNY HOW OFTEN I KNOW ALL OF THE WORDS TO SONGS THAT SHE S LISTENING TO AND YET .
YEAH .
SHE THOUGHT THEY WERE BRAND NEW .
YEAH .
ORIGINAL PIECES .
THEY THEY DO THEY DO COPY VERSIONS THEY DO COVER VERSIONS OF OF YOU KNOW LIKE STANDARDS I GUESS YOU COULD CALL IT .
THAT S RIGHT .
I THINK IT S KIND OF ABSURD YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW THEY DO NT REALLY THEY DO NT REALLY GIVE YOU KNOW THE ORIGINAL ARTIST OR THE ORIGINAL COMPOSER .
NO .
THE CREDIT .
THAT IS REALLY DUE TO THEM .
YEAH I GUESS THERE WAS EVEN A A BIT OF RUCKUS CAUSED BY THE M C HAMMER WHO S REALLY YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
SEEMS TO BE THE HOT ONE OF OF TODAY .
HE USED UM WILD THING .
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT THAT SONG .
YEAH .
HE USED UM I CA NT REMEMBER WHO .
THE ARTIST WAS ON THAT .
JIMI HENDRIX WAS THE ORIGINAL .
WHO .
JIMI HENDRIX WAS THE ORIGINAL .
HE WROTE .
WAS IT WELL MA MAYBE IT WAS NT THAT ONE .
BECAUSE IT WAS A LIVING IT WAS A LIVING PERSON THAT I M I M THINKING OF THAT .
OKAY .
UM THAT SAID YOU KNOW HEY THAT THOSE ARE MY WORDS .
AND UH I GUESS THAT THEY BECAUSE THEY HAD NT ORIGINALLY GOTTEN UM PERMISSION .
UHHUH .
FROM HIM TO USE IT .
AND HE HE SINCE THEN HAS HAS AMENDED THAT AND PAID THEM HIS ROYALTIES .
EVERY TIME .
THE THE SONG GOES ON BUT .
YEAH .
I DO NT KNOW IT MAY HAVE IT MAY HAVE BEEN SOMEBODY ELSE BECAUSE I THINK I THINK THAT EVEN JIMI HENDRIX DID IT I THINK THAT WAS A COV YOU KNOW COME TO THINK OF IT I THINK THAT WAS A COVER VERSION OF LIKE A JOHN LEE HOOKER SONG OR SOMETHING .
MAYBE SO .
I .
I MEAN IT WAS JUST LIKE IT WAS REALLY OLD .
I CA NT THINK .
I MEAN I I THERE ARE A LOT THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT SONGS I MEAN LIKE THE WHOLE THING ABOUT COVER VERSIONS A LOT OF TIMES .
I MEAN I VE HEARD SOME SONGS .
THAT THAT I JUST THOUGHT WERE HORRENDOUS COVER VERSIONS OF I M LIKE YOU KNOW I I DO NT WANT TO LISTEN TO THIS .
YEAH .
BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU THINK OF THE ORIGINAL IS LIKE YOU KNOW OH THAT WAS REALLY GREAT .
THAT WAS A YOU KNOW A REALLY GOOD PIECE OF WORK AND THEN WHEN YOU HEAR THE COVER .
IT S LIKE YOU KNOW GOD WHAT ARE THEY DOING .
RIGHT .
THEY DESTROYED IT .
I I THINK A GOOD ONE WAS UM THERE WAS A PETER FRAMPTON SONG .
OH YEAH .
AND THEN THE COVER VERSION I THINK I MEAN I THOUGHT WAS ABSOLUTELY IT WAS PITIFUL .
I I REMEMBER SEEING THE VIDEO OF IT ON M T V AND I THOUGHT IT WAS HIDEOUS .
YEAH .
I DID TOO .
IT WAS UGH I DID NT LIKE THAT EITHER .
YEAH BUT YOU KNOW WHATEVER BECAME OF PETER FRAMPTON .
I MEAN THERE WAS NOTHING HE WAS A PHENOMENON I ME THERE WAS NO REASON FOR HIM TO REALLY COME INTO YOU KNOW GREAT STARDOM OR ANYTHING .
I REMEMBER I SAW HIM IN A CONCERT WHEN I WAS .
YEAH .
YEAH I THINK I THINK IT .
I THINK IT WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL .
YEAH I THINK THAT PROBABLY WHAT DID IT FOR HIM WAS THE FACT THAT HE WAS A GOOD STAGE PERFORMER .
UHHUH .
HE WAS VERY GOOD .
I REMEMBER I SAW HIM IN A HUGE STADIUM IN UH PHILADELPHIA .
IT WAS IN J F K STADIUM IF I CAN REMEMBER .
OH MAN .
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IS WHAT .
IT SEEMED LIKE .
YEAH .
I VE I GRADUATED BACK IN SEVENTYNINE SO .
UM UM .
UHHUH .
BUT BUT I VE REALLY I I LOVED I MEAN I WAS I WAS REALLY INTO THE ALBUM ORIENTED MUSIC EVEN THEN .
UHHUH .
SO I WAS REALLY FAMILIAR WITH A LOT WITH A LOT OF OF THE .
A O R TYPE MUSIC .
UM THE ALBUM ORIENTED LIKE THE UH JAMES TAYLOR .
OH YEAH .
AND THE UH THE BEATLES AND YOU KNOW I MEAN A LOT OF PEOPLE THEY GO THEY RE BETTER THAN THE BEATLES AND I M LIKE YOU KNOW .
YOU DO NT KNOW WHAT .
YOU RE TALKING ABOUT .
NO .
I MEAN THE COMPARISON MADE BETWEEN NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK WITH THE BEATLES .
IT WAS JUST .
YOU CAN ONLY LAUGH .
YEAH YOU JUST SORT OF YOU KNOW WELL I GUESS I CAN JUST HUMOR THEM YOU KNOW .
AT THIS POINT .
RIGHT WELL THEY I GUESS OUR AGE IS SHOWING WHEN WE WE THINK THAT .
YEAH BUT WELL YOU KNOW I I I VE LIKED A LOT OF THE NEW MUSIC .
I THINK UM .
UHHUH .
UM WHEN I SAW SOME PROMISE YOU KNOW WITH WITH A LOT OF THE NEW WAVE WHEN IT WHEN IT CAME OUT UH .
YEAH .
BACK IN THE MID AND EARLY EIGHTIES .
AND THEN UM I DO NT KNOW MUSIC IS KIND OF IN A WEIRD IT S IN A VERY WEIRD POSITION RIGHT NOW .
I THINK THAT I MEAN I LIKE YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE TO HEAR YOU KNOW WHAT .
THEY CALL WORLD MUSIC .
WHICH IS YOU KNOW USING ALL THESE NATURAL FORMS OF MUSIC AND .
LIKE PAUL SIMON .
LIKE .
YEAH YEAH PAUL SIMON .
YEAH .
WELL YOU KNOW REALLY THAT S NOT WORLD MUSIC .
BUT WHAT WHAT .
PAUL SIMON S DOING I THINK IS IS IS GREAT BECAUSE HE S YOU KNOW I THINK I THINK THAT USING I GUESS WHAT .
THEY CALL IT IS ECLECTIC YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
DRAWING FROM A LOT OF DIFFERENT SOURCES AND MAKING YOU KNOW A SYNTHESIS OF A NEW TYPE OF MUSIC .
UM .
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY WORLD MUSIC .
WELL WORLD MUSIC IS UM A LOT OF THE A LOT OF WHERE THEY WHERE THEY MAKE MUSIC THAT THEY ADAPT TO A TO ANOTHER KIND OF TO ANOTHER TYPE OF LISTENER .
UHHUH .
UH FOR EXAMPLE LET S SAY YOU RE TAKING LIKE AN ORIGINAL BRAZILIAN FORM OF MUSIC AND WITH A CERTAIN STYLE AND THEN YOU TRY TO MAKE IT .
A LITTLE BIT MORE LISTENABLE FOR LET S SAY ANOTHER AUDIENCE LET S SAY A NORTH AMERICAN .
UHHUH .
AND THEN WHEN THEY HEAR IT IT IT S A REALLY IT S ANOTHER FORM OF MUSIC AND .
UM .
YOU KNOW SORT OF UM TRYING TO DRAW OUT THE BEST SOURCES .
THE THE BEST OF EVERY TYPE OF MUSIC .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE I MEAN THERE ARE SOME I MEAN I I LI THERE ARE SOME YOU KNOW TYPES OF HEAVY METAL THAT I REALLY LIKE BUT BUT I WOULD NT I WOULD NT SAY THAT I I COMPLETELY LIKE HEAVY METAL .
NO .
I I THINK YOU KNOW AND IT S THE SAME WAY WITH YOU KNOW WORLD MUSIC TAKES THE FORMS .
THAT HAVE REALLY BEEN UM I GUESS I .
YOU KNOW THE BEST EXAMPLE OR YOU KNOW THE CREAM OF THE CROP I GUESS YOU COULD SAY AND THEN AND THEN TAKING THOSE THOSE QUALITIES AND THEN APPLYING IN THE STYLES THAT ARE REALLY UM THAT ARE EXTREMELY ENJOYABLE AND THEN TAKING .
SO THEN IT BECOMES A KIND OF MUSIC OF OF IT S OWN SO TO SPEAK OR UH .
YEAH YEAH IT BECOMES A KIND OF MUSIC OF IT S OWN .
I MEAN WHEN YOU LISTEN TO IT IT S UM UH I THINK THAT THEY DO NT USE ELEC SOME OF IT IT S THEY USE ELECTRONIC AND ACOUSTIC INTERCHANGEABLY .
UHHUH .
SO YOU KNOW WELL A LOT OF THE STUFF .
YOU HEAR COMING FROM SOUTH AFRICA NOW AND FROM WEST AFRICA THAT S CONSIDERED WORLD MUSIC BECAUSE IT S NOT PARTICULARLY USING CERTAIN TYPES OF FOLK STYLES .
RIGHT .
BUT THEY RE THEY RE TRYING TO MAKE IT .
SOMEWHAT MORE MODERN .
I I I A GOOD ANOTHER GOOD EXAMPLE WAS I HEARD MILES DAVIS AND MILES DAVIS WORKED WITH ROBBIE SHONCAR .
UHHUH .
IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT I MEAN .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW HE S A JAZZ PERFORMER AND THEN HE S PLAYING WITH ROBBIE SHONCAR WHO S A VERY GOOD HE S A VERY GOOD ARRANGER .
UH ARRANGEMENT TO UH WE RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET OFF .
THE ARE THEY TRYING TO MUMBLEX .
I DO NT KNOW .
BUT UH .
MUMBLEX WE VE TALKED OUR FIVE MINUTES THOUGH .
YEAH OKAY BUT I MEAN WHEN I HEARD HIS ALBUM I HEARD IT AND IT WAS JUST INCREDIBLE .
I VE BEEN LISTENING TO THAT A LOT LATELY .
YEAH I I LISTENED AND I HEARD YOU KNOW YOU HEAR THIS GUITAR AND THEN YOU HEAR THE MUTED TRUMPET .
I .
ME AND YOU NEVER WOULD THINK THAT THEY THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY PLAY TOGETHER BUT .
OH YEAH .
WHAT S THE UH IN TEXAS LAW HAS A UH WHAT DOES IT HAVE IT HAS A DEATH PENALTY DOES NT IT .
OH YES YEAH .
THEY JUST UH STARTED IT AGAIN TOO JUST LATE OR WITHIN THE PAST FEW YEARS .
YOU KNOW FOR QUITE SOME TIME JUST ABOUT EVERY ONE OF THE STATES HAD GIVEN UP THE DEATH PENALTY .
BUT NOW IT S COMING BACK INTO FAVOR .
UH YES .
WELL THEY FIND IT IS MORE DETERRENT .
WELL MY SOCIOLOGY CLASS AT S M U S TAUGHT US THAT IT WAS NOT A DETERRENT .
UH BUT NOW THAT S JUST WHAT .
THEY SAID .
UH I DO NT KNOW MAYBE MAYBE IF I WENT BACK AND TOOK A SOCIOLOGY CLASS NOW THEY D SAY IT IS A DETERRENT .
WELL UH IF YOU .
MAYBE THEY VE CHANGED THEIR MINDS .
YOU KNOW COMPARE THE FIGURES I THINK THAT S WHERE THEY RE UH THEY RE COMING FROM .
THE UH .
MAYBE THAT S IT .
MAYBE THAT S IT BECAUSE THAT WAS BACK IN THE SEVENTIES .
OH THERE YES .
THEY ARE .
THAT WAS BEFORE THE UH UH THEY ADOPTED THE DEATH LAW AGAIN .
BUT UH I I .
MYSELF AM IN FAVOR OF IT UH PARTICULARLY FOR UH WELL I THINK TEXAS HAS A GOOD GOOD LAW .
UH CRIMES MURDERS RELATED WITH UH DRUGS OR KILLING A POLICEMEN .
I THINK I AGREE .
BUT I THINK IT OUGHT TO BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE CHILDREN .
I I THINK THEY RE THEY HAVE THEY RE WORKING ON UH SOMETHING IN AUSTIN NOW .
UHHUH .
AND I M NOT SURE WHAT .
IT IS I JUST REMEMBER SEEING A UH KIND OF A SYNOPSIS OF IT .
UHHUH .
WELL WHY STOP AT CHILDREN .
WHY NOT GO TO ADULTS TOO .
WELL UH I M I M PERSONALLY VERY IN FAVOR OF IT .
UHHUH .
UH WHY SHOULD WE LET THEM SET IN PRISON AND WORK ON THEIR COLLEGE DEGREES AFTER THEY VE MOWED DOWN A CLASS YARD FULL OF KIDS OR T OR TRIED TO OR DONE THEIR VERY YOU KNOW GIVEN THEIR BEST EFFORT AT DOING THAT .
UHHUH .
YEP .
I I DO NT CARE TO SUPPORT THEM .
WELL I DO NT EITHER BUT UH UH BUT THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID ABOUT OR UH UH J JUST FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT I M TAKING THE .
SURE .
A CON I M I M AGAINST IT .
UH YOU KNOW YOURSELF HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU HEARD WHERE UH UH A CITIZEN WAS WRONGFULLY ARRESTED .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND SERVED TIME AT A PENITENTIARY UH JUST RECENTLY THIS UH BLACK MAN SERVED NINE YEARS WAS IT .
AND THEN .
FOR ROBBERY .
THERE WAS THE BLACK WOMAN THAT UH ROBBED AND SHOT THE FURRIER .
AND SHE WAS SET FREE TOO JUST IN TWO EXAMPLES IN TEXAS RECENTLY .
UHHUH .
BUT SHE ACTUALLY KILLED THE FURRIER .
OR SOMEONE SHE WAS CHARGED WITH MURDER AND THEN THEN THEY DECIDED IT WAS A CASE OF MISTAKEN IDENTITY OR SOMETHING .
I DID NT I DO NT I DID NT RETAIN ALL THOSE FACTS VERY WELL .
BUT I KNOW WHAT .
YOU RE WHAT IF WE MAKE A MISTAKE .
THAT S IT .
AND THAT S NOT ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT YOU CAN TURN THE WHEEL BACK AND REVERSE EVERYTHING .
UHHUH .
WELL RIGHT NOW OUR LAWS ARE SO LIBERAL THAT UH EVEN WITH THE DEATH PENALTY IN EFFECT I DO NT THINK THAT UH THEY RE GOING TO USE IT UH TOO FREQUENTLY UH UNFORTUNATELY .
I LIKE YOU SAY YES LET S HAVE IT .
WELL .
PUT THEM .
ALL GIVE THEM .
ALL A SHOT GET RID OF THEM .
WHY SHOULD THEY BE SIT SITTING IN UH PRISON GETTING THEIR COLLEGE DEGREE .
WELL I GUESS THOUGH WHERE I WOULD HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT IF I WERE ON THE JURY THAT THAT PUT THAT HANDED DOWN THE DEATH SENTENCE BECAUSE IT WAS MY JUDGEMENT .
THE PERSON S GUILTY .
UHHUH .
NOW THAT S TOUGHER .
IT S EASIER TO SAY IT ON THE TELEPHONE AND EVERYONE AGREE THAT YEAH THE DEATH PENALTY S THE WAY TO GO IT S A DETERRENT TO CRIME THEY SHOULD NT CATCH THEMSELVES IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE ANYWAY .
BUT TO BE THE ACTUAL ONE OF THE ONES .
THAT DECIDE THAT WOULD BE TOUGHER FOR ME .
YES VERY TRUE .
I UH I AGREE WITH YOU THERE .
UH .
I THINK I D PROBABLY DO IT BUT WE COULD NEVER SAY WHAT .
WE WOULD DO IF WE RE NOT IN THE CIRCUMSTANCE .
IT THAT S THAT S THAT S A REAL EASY THING TO SAY THAT OH SURE I WOULD BUT I DO NT KNOW .
UHHUH .
WELL I .
MYSELF WOULD NT WANT TO BE ON THE JURY LIKE THAT .
UH I IT IT S UH THAT S AN AWFUL LOT TO UH TO EXPECT OF A PERSON TO UH TO KILL SOMEBODY IS WHAT .
IT AMOUNTS TO .
WELL YES BUT YOU KNOW THAT S WHAT .
THEY DID .
IT TRUE .
VERY TRUE .
BUT THEY THEY DID IT BECAUSE THEY HAVE A WARPED MIND FOR SOME REASON .
OR RATHER THAN HAVE A WARPED MIND .
IT WAS JUST THE ONLY WAY TO GET WHATEVER .
THEY WANTED .
YEAH WELL UH .
AND THEY THEY WANTED SOMETHING WORSE THAN THEY MORE THAN THEY RESPECT THE HUMAN LIFE .
UHHUH .
YEAH EXACTLY .
WELL ANYHOW I GUESS WE .
BOTH AGREE THAT .
THAT IT IS .
HANG THEM .
IT SHOULD BE IN EFFECT .
YEAH I AGREE IT SHOULD BE IN EFFECT .
ALSO I AGREE THERE SHOULD BE A LOT OF CARE IN THE ENFORCEMENT UH SO I GUESS I WOULD SAY I WANT IT TO BE IN EFFECT BUT I WANT MAYBE WELL I D I NOW I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS TOO .
I THINK OUR COURTS HAVE TOO MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM TO GO BACK AND GET ONE MORE CHANCE .
OH THAT S TRUE .
WELL NOW ANY UH JUST BELIEVE IN JUST ABOUT ANY STATE IN THE UNION UH UH A DEATH UH OR UH YEAH DEATH VERDICT IS AN AUTOMATIC UH APPEAL .
THAT S CORRECT .
IT IS IT IS .
AND UH UH YES I M INCLINED TO AGREE WITH YOU .
I THINK SO THERE SHOULD BE A LIMIT AS TO THE NUMBER OF APPEALS .
NOW THERE S SOME AND MAYBE NOW I DO NT REMEMBER IF THIS IS TEXAS OR NOT THAT HAS SOMETHING ABOUT ALL DRUG DEALERS CAN BE SENTENCED TO THE DEATH SENTENCE .
UM UM WELL N .
CONVICTED DRUG DEALERS .
NOT JUST FOR DEALING IN DRUGS .
IT UH .
IS IT WHAT IS WHAT S THE RU .
THERE ARE CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AND I DO NT REMEMBER WHAT .
THEY ARE .
IT .
S .
SOMETHING OF THE DIS THEY RE ON THE DISTRIBUTION END .
UH YES .
THEY RE NOT SELLING THEM THEY RE DISTRIBUTING THEM .
IT S FOR THE LARGE DEALERS IS WHAT .
UHHUH .
IT S RESERVED FOR .
AND THEY THEY ARE IN EFFECT KILLING PEOPLE .
OH OH YES YES .
I I BELIEVE IT S ANY CAPITAL CRIME RELATED TO DRUGS .
OH OKAY .
I THINK THAT S THE WAY .
IT S WORDED .
IS THAT HOW IT S WORDED .
I KNEW IT WAS THERE BUT I I OR P OR IS IT PROPOSED OR IS IT PASSED .
I DO BELIEVE THAT S IN .
UH I WOULD NT SWEAR TO IT .
MYSELF .
I BELIEVE IT IS .
BUT I THOUGHT IT I THOUGHT IT WAS IN EFFECT .
I BELIEVE YOU RE RIGHT THOUGH .
I THINK IT IS .
AND I HAVE TO AGREE WITH THAT .
UHHUH .
I I THINK IT CERTAINLY SHOULD BE ONE OF THE OPTIONS .
UH I VE BEEN FORTUNATE WITH MY CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN SO FAR THAT I KNOW .
I QUALIFY THAT HEAVILY .
BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW BUT TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE .
WE HAVE NT HAD A MAJOR PROBLEM YET .

AND THERE S FOUR TWO GIRLS AND TWO BOYS .
AND I THINK ONE OF EACH EXPERIMENTED VERY SLIGHTLY WITH POT .
UHHUH .

YEAH .
THAT S USUALLY THE WAY .
IT IS .
IT IT S JUST UH TRY IT OUT WITH THEIR PEERS .
AND NONE OF THEM EVEN SMOKE .
THEY DO NT UH THEY NEVER STRANGELY ENOUGH UH THEIR MOTHER AND I .
BOTH SMOKED WHEN THEY WERE GROWING UP .
NOW MY MY MY WIFE MY EXWIFE SHE QUIT UH WELL WHEN SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH THE LAST ONE AND SHE NEVER STARTED UP AGAIN .

HAS NT QUITE MADE IT YET .
WELL WHEN I WAS STILL SMOKING I I FELT THAT WAY .
IF I WAS IN A PUBLIC RESTAURANT SEATED AT TABLE WITH UH NON SMOKERS I WOULD TRY TO PICK A S A A MY SEAT WHERE THE SMOKE WOULD BLOW AWAY FROM THEM .
OR I D HOLD THE CIGARETTE UNDER THE TABLE .
YEAH I VE SEEN ALL OF THIS YEAH .
AND UH BUT UH NOW I M ON THE SHOE S ON THE OTHER FOOT .
UH I M AWARE OF OTHER PEOPLE SMOKING NOW .
WELL CHARLES WILL ACTUALLY CHARLES WILL NOT SMOKE IN ANYONE ELSE S HOUSE EXCEPT OUR OWN .
UM .
HE WILL GET UP AND HE LL GO OUTSIDE YOU KNOW AND HE HE S SO WHEN WE RE INVITED TO PEOPLE S HOUSE HE WILL NOT SMOKE IN THEIR HOUSE .
WHICH .
I THINK IS GOOD BECAUSE THERE S A LOT OF PEOPLE .
THAT ARE VERY .
YES .
PARTICULARLY IF THEY HAVE CHILDREN .
UHHUH .
BUT UH AND HE S YOU KNOW HE TRIES HIS BEST BUT THE ACTUAL QUITTING HE .
HAS NT DONE .
HE CHANGED BRANDS TO A BRAND .
HE DOES NT LIKE .
HE PUT UP ALL OF HIS ASH TRAYS .
HE WILL NOT SMOKE IN A COMFORTABLE POSITION YOU KNOW BUT .
UH UHHUH .
STILL HE S DONE EVERYTHING THE SMOKERS ANONYMOUS TELL YOU TO DO EXCEPT QUIT SMOKING .
IT S A .
WELL THE .
LONG PROCESS .
THERE S A TRICK .
I USE .
THEY USED TO LEAVE MY CIGARETTES IN THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT .
OH HOW NEAT .
AND EVERY TIME .
I WANTED ONE .
I HAVE TO GO OUTSIDE AND JUST TAKE ONE .
ONE AT A TIME .
AND UH THAT THAT S GETS TO BE UH A DETERRENT .
HE HAS HIS IN THE KITCHEN .
ALL RIGHT .
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN DRUG TESTED .
UM THAT S A GOOD QUESTION .
UM .
I HAD A JOB .
I HAD TO GO GET A BLOOD TEST FOR .
UHHUH .
UM .
AND AND THEY DID A FULL BLOOD SCREEN ON ME BUT THEY DID NT CALL THAT A DRUG TEST .
SO THA I THINK THEY CHECKED FOR DRUGS .
THEY JUST DO NT TELL YOU .
THEY DID .
YEAH .
I HAD I VE HAD UH TWO OR THREE DRUG TESTS THAT I HAD TO GET BEFORE I COULD START WORKING AT A JOB .
UHHUH .
UH DIFFERENT JOBS .
I HAD ONE AT T I AND THEN ONE AT ANOTHER ENGINEERING COMPANY .
AND REALLY I MEAN I DO NT MIND THEM .
I DO NT DO DRUGS ANYWAY .
I GUESS IF I DID MAYBE I WOULD BUT UM I DO NT KNOW .
I KNOW A GIRL THAT SHE S A NURSE AND THEY GET DRUG TESTED RANDOMLY .
I VE .
UHHUH .
NEVER BEEN RANDOMLY DRUG TESTED .
BUT THAT WOULD PROBABLY BOTHER ME TO WAKE UP ONE DAY AND FIND OUT HALFWAY THROUGH THE DAY THAT YOU RE GOING TO BE DRUG TESTED AND YOU DID NT KNOW ABOUT IT .
YEAH .
WELL I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON IF YOU GOT SOMETHING TO WORRY ABOUT .
YEAH .
I GUESS SO .
I GUESS SO .
DO YOU THINK THAT IT S RIGHT .
WELL I I I COME FROM KIND OF A BIASED OPINION BECAUSE I M A A THERAPIST AND A DRUG AND ALCOHOL COUNSELOR .
UHHUH .
AND I VE DONE EMPLOYEE ASSISTANT WORK AND I I KNOW THE KIND OF COST BUSINESSES GO THROUGH IN TERMS OF ACCIDENTS .
RIGHT .
ON THE JOB .
THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY DRUG AND ALCOHOL RELATED .
RIGHT .
AND IT S LIKE IN THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS .
EVERY YEAR .
UM AND TH THE ONLY WAY THAT THEY CAN PREVENT THAT IS IS YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT THE EMPLOYEES ARE DRUG AND ALCOHOL FREE .
THAT S TRUE .
AND YOU KNOW THE THE PROBLEM IN THE WORK PLACE IS THAT THAT PEOPLE ARE LIKE IF YOUR BOSS IS YOUR DRINKING BUDDY OR WHATEVER I MEAN YOU CAN COME TO COME TO WORK DRUNK AND GET IN AN ACCIDENT AND HE LL COVER UP FOR YOU AND .
RIGHT .
NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT IT BUT C YOU KNOW ENDS UP COSTING THE COMPANY LOTS AND LOTS OF MONEY .
THAT S TRUE .
SO .
I BELIEVE .
YOU KNOW .
IT S RIGHT .
ESPECIALLY FOR CERTAIN JOBS .
I THINK ANYONE IN A IN A PUBLIC JOB LIKE BUS DRIVERS AND CAB DRIVERS AND .
UHHUH .
POLICE OFFICERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT I THINK THEY SHOULD BE .
YEAH .
RANDOMLY DRUG TESTED .
I BELIEVE .
YEAH .
FULL FORCE IN THAT .
I DO NT KNOW THAT I BELIEVE EVERY SECRETARY IN EVERY COMPANY NEEDS TO BE .
TRUE .
YOU KNOW SECRETARIES ARE NT ARE NT REALLY GOING TO COST THE COMPANY THAT MUCH MONEY IF THEY FALL FACE FORWARD IN THEIR TYPEWRITER OR SOMETHING .
SO I DO NT KNOW .
I I M KIND OF BIASED TOO BECAUSE I DO NT DO DRUGS AND .
UHHUH .
SO I REALLY DO NT CARE ONE .
WAY OR ANOTHER IF ANYBODY WANTS TO PULL ME UP TOMORROW AND TEST ME .
YEAH .
BECAUSE I HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT .
SO I GUESS THAT S KIND OF BIASED .
YEAH .
WELL THERE IT S I I THINK ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH IT IS IT AFFECTS A LOT OF OTHER FOLKS ON THE JOB .
YEAH .
IT DOES .
IF SOMEBODY ELSE IS IMPAIRED .
BECAUSE MUMBLEX GENERALLY YOU KNOW IT .
UH YOU FIND OUT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER IF SOMEBODY .
S GOT A PROBLEM ON THE JOB .
YEAH .
THAT S TRUE .
AND IF E EVEN IF LIKE YOU SAY EVEN IF IT S JUST THE SECRETARY IF HER WORK OR ABILITIES START AFFECTING HER COWORKERS .
YEAH .
THEN IT IT S STILL A PROBLEM .
THAT S TRUE .
SO .
BUT WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT .
THE OCCASIONAL USER .
THAT MAY HAVE GONE TO A PARTY THREE DAYS BEFORE AND YOU KNOW IT S IT S BEEN THE WHOLE WEEKEND SINCE THEY VE DONE ANYTHING AND THEY HAPPEN TO BE TESTED MONDAY MORNING AND THEY COULD BE FIRED FOR THAT .
YOU KNOW THAT THAT S KIND OF UNFAIR ALSO .
WELL YEAH .
I GUESS IT COMES WITH THE TURF .
YEAH .
I GUESS SO .
I GUESS IF YOU RE GOING TO DO IT .
YOU NEED TO SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES .
YEAH .
MAN .
AND IN TERMS OF DRUGS THEY RE ILLEGAL .
SO YOU RE .
THAT S TRUE .
YOU RE BREAKING THE LAW ANYWAY .
THAT S TRUE .
PROBABLY THE THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THOSE IS THEY DO NT DO A REAL GOOD JOB OF OF ASSESSING FOR ALCOHOL .
THAT S TRUE .
AND THAT S PROBABLY THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THERE IS .
YEAH .
I THINK SO MORE THAN DRUGS .
AND I KNOW A LOT OF COMPANIES .
THAT WILL PUT YOU IN AN ALCOHOL REHABILITATION BEFORE THEY WOULD PUT YOU IN A DRUG REHAB .
YEAH .
THEY WOULD PAY FOR AN ALCOHOL .
UHHUH .
BUT THEY DO NT ALWAYS PAY FOR DRUG REHABILITATION .
WELL I GUESS THAT S ONE OF THE POSITIVE THINGS .
THAT HA HAVE COME OUT OF IT SOME OF THE EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM .
IF YOU DO TEST POSITIVE FOR SOMETHING .
YEAH .
THEY WILL GIVE YOU .
AN OP O OPPORTUNITY TO GO GET YOUR LIFE STRAIGHT RATHER THAN TO LOSE YOU RE JOB .
THAT S TRUE .
AND I .
I .
TH .
THINK THAT S FAIR .
YEAH I THINK THE BENEF THE COMPANY BENEFITS IN THE LONG RUN .
YEAH .
THAT S TRUE .
THAT S ABOUT ALL .
I HAVE .
TO SAY ON IT .
WHAT WHAT KIND OF TESTING DO THEY DO WHEN YOU WENT .
UH IT S A URINE TEST .
URINE SCREEN .
AND .
YEAH .
THEY UH IT WAS REALLY VERY OFFICIAL .
YOU HAVE TO GO IN A ROOM SOLELY BY YOURSELF SIGN PAPERS .
THAT SAY YOU WERE TOTALLY ALONE SIGN PAPERS .
THAT SAY THIS IS YOURS .
AND AND YOU HAVE TO SEAL THE BOTTLE .
YOURSELF AND LABEL IT .
YOURSELF AND .
UHHUH .
ALL OF THAT .
SO THAT THEY RE SURE THAT YOU HAVE NT BORROWED ANYBODY S I GUESS OR SOMETHING .
WELL THAT HAPPENS .
YEAH .
I KNOW .
I CA IT S HARD TO BELIEVE .
IT HAPPENS A LOT .
BUT I GUESS IT DOES .
THERE THERE ARE PEOPLE .
THAT N PAY OTHER PEOPLE TO .
I KNOW .
I M AMAZED .
TO HELP THEM OUT .
AT THE THINGS PEOPLE .
WILL DO .
YEAH .
IT IS AMAZING .
I GUESS THERE ARE PEOPLE .
THAT DO THAT .
AND THEY ARE THOSE ARE EXPENSIVE TESTS .
I M .
YEAH .
GLAD I NEVER HAD TO PAY FOR ONE .
YEAH .
IT DEPENDS R R REALLY ON HOW HOW STRONG A TEST .
IT IS .
THEY VE GOT DIFFERENT DEGREES .
YEAH .
I GUESS SO .
AS FAR AS AS HOW FAR BACK THEY CAN CHECK .
THEY GOT SOME UNUSUAL THINGS BESIDES BLOOD AND URINE TESTS .
THEY VE MUMBLEX SOME COMPANIES .
THAT ARE DOING UH HAIR TESTS .
OH REALLY .
YEAH .
WELL THAT THEY LL PULL OUT ONE OF YOUR HAIRS AND THEY CAN APPARENTLY TEST UM BACK A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME .
HOW WEIRD .
I DID NT KNOW THAT .
BECAUSE MUMBLEX .
SOME OF THE THE RESIDUE ENDS UP IN YOUR HAIR FOLLICLES YOU KNOW IT S KIND OF .
OH THAT S WEIRD .
HAIR FOLLICLES I GUESS ARE JUST DEAD PROTEIN AND THEY .
YEAH .
AND IT IT S APPARENTLY AL ALMOST LIKE A A CALENDAR .
THEY THEY VE GOT IT PRETTY PRECISE NOW .
THEY CAN GO BACK AND LOOK AT IN TERMS OF GROWTH IN A IN A HAIR WHEN YOU USED AND AND THAT TYPE OF THING .
THAT S WILD .
SO .
IT S AMAZING THE THINGS THEY CAN FIND OUT FROM DIFFERENT THINGS ON YOUR BODY .
YEAH .
SO I GUESS IF THEY PERFECT THAT MUMBLEX IS NOT QUITE AS CUMBERSOME AS HAVING TO GO FILL A BOTTLE OR .
YEAH .
THAT S TRUE .
GIVE BLOOD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
THAT S TRUE .
I M GLAD I NEVER HAD TO DO IT BY GIVING BLOOD .
I CA NT STAND THE THOUGHT OF GIVING BLOOD .
UHHUH .
I CA NT EVEN DO IT FOR WADLEY EVEN THOUGH IT S A GOOD CAUSE .
YEAH .
WELL I ENJOYED TALKING TO YOU .
WELL I DID TOO .
THANK YOU .
UHHUH .
BYEBYE .
BYEBYE .
OKAY I GUESS WE RE ON .
YEAH .
CENTRAL AMERICA HAVE YOU EVER LIVED IN CENTRAL AMERICA .
I WAS NT IN CENTRAL AMERICA BUT UH TALKING ABOUT LATIN AMERICA I KIND OF I CONSIDER LATIN AMERICA TO INCLUDE CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA AND I DID LIVE IN UH SAN POLO BRAZIL FOR FOUR YEARS .
DO YOU DO YOU THINK THAT THAT WE SHOULD HAVE GIVEN UP THE PANAMA CANAL .
UH REALISTICALLY I YES I DO NT SEE THE THE PANAMA CANAL THAT HAS NT HAD A WHOLE LOT OF USEFULNESS TO US RECENTLY SINCE IT S NOT NOT REALLY BIG ENOUGH TO UH ACCOMMODATE THE THE SHIPPING THAT IT ONCE DID AND UH MAYBE IT WOULD BE BETTER THAT WE LET THE PANAMANIANS RUN IT HOWEVER I THINK WE RE CERTAINLY JUSTIFIED IN UH OUR ACTIONS DEALING WITH UH NORIEGA IN THIS .
WELL THERE ARE THOSE THAT THAT THAT THINK THAT THAT THAT THE PANAMA CANAL HAS SOME CONSIDERABLE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE PARTICULARLY FOR THE MILITARY INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH MY FATHER WAS WHO WAS IN WORLD WAR ONE AND AS UH AS A CIVIL ENGINEER THEY THEY THEY OFFERED HIM A COMMISSION AS A CAPTAIN IF HE WOULD UH GO IN AND AND UH HELP WITH THE DEFENSES OF THE PANAMA CANAL HE HAD WORKED FOR UNITED FRUIT COMPANY THERE .
UHHUH .
AND THEY UH THEY IN FACT THEY HAD THIS WAS IN THE THE LATE TWENTIES AND THEY IN FACT USED SOME OF THE EQUIPMENT THAT HAD BEEN LEFT OVER AND UH HE TURNED THEM DOWN IT IT S INTERESTING THAT THAT MOST PEOPLE DO NT REALIZE HOW SMALL THE CANAL IS HAVE YOU EVER BEEN THERE .
NO I HAVE NT .
IT S IT S REALLY I I HAVE NT BEEN THERE I VE BEEN TO BEEN TO SALVADOR AND AND UH IN FACT WE WENT BACK TO VISIT SOME FRIENDS OF OF MY FATHERS THAT WE WENT IN FIFTYSEVEN I GUESS AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH THE CANAL IS QUITE SMALL AND AND REALISTICALLY COULD BE SABOTAGED QUITE QUITE EASILY THE THING I FIND INTERESTING THOUGH IS THAT UH IS THE WHOLE COLONIAL APPROACH AND AND AND DO WE DO WE SUPPORT THE SANDINISTAS OR OR DO WE SUPPORT UH YOU KNOW WHEN THEY THOUGHT UH THEY THOUGHT THAT NICARAGUA IF YOU GAVE THEM A FREE ELECTION THEY WOULD VOTE FOR THE WILL YOU UH DID YOU EVER STUDIED THE THE POLITICAL MAKEUP THERE IN IN IN NICARAGUA .
I HAVE A A LITTLE BIT I CA NT SAY THAT I M I WOULD BE AN AN EXPERT ON ON THE REGION BUT UH CERTAINLY UH I IT IT GETS IT GE THERE YOUR YOU VE GOT THIS THIS TOSS UP BETW OR NOT NOT SO MUCH A TOSS UP BUT A A DILEMMA WHEN WHEN YOU WANT A COUNTRY TO HAVE ITS ITS UM OWN UH DOMINION OR ITS FREE REIN OVER ITS ITS OWN PEOPLE AND THEN ON THE OTHER HAND UH THE UH THE GOVERNMENT IN POWER THAT UNDER WHAT SEEM WHAT SEEMS TO BE POPULAR SUPPORT UH THE SANDINISTAS HAD TO A GIVEN EXTENT POPULAR UH SUPPORT UM STARTS MAKING OVERTURES TO THE SOVIET UNION AND AND INTO WHAT WE CONSIDER OUR SPHERE OF INFLUENCE AND NOW WE RE WE RE IN THIS DILEMMA OVER UH UNITED STATES IS BELIEVES IN DEMOCRACY AND AND SELF DETERMINATION WHERE A BUT THAT ON THE OTHER HAND WE BELIEVE IN SELF PRESERVATION AND UH AGREE WITH THE OR NOT SO MUCH AGREE WITH BUT ARE TERRIBLY CONCERNED ABOUT UH INFL SOVIET INFLUENCE IN IN WHAT S CONSIDERED TO BE THE UNITED STATES SPHERE OF THE WORLD WHICH IS NOT ONLY YOU WE USED TO SEE SPHERES BUT NOW WE RE IN A SITUATION WHERE THE UNITED STATES IS LOOKS LIKE WE RE IT NOW .
WELL THE INTERESTING PART ABOUT IT IS THAT IF REALISTICALLY IT WAS ECONOMIC I DO NT KNOW IF YOU READ ANY OF THE HISTORY ON WHERE THE PANAMA CANAL BUT THERE WAS AN OPTION TO BUILD IT ACROSS NICARAGUA UH AND UH THERE WERE UH THERE S A BIG THERE S A BIG LAKE .
UHHUH .
AND UM FROM A TECHNICAL STANDPOINT IT WOULD NT HAVE BEEN A LOT MORE DIFFICULT TO HAVE BUILT IT IN NICARAGUA BUT THE THE UNITED STATES UH HAD SOME AND I VE FORGOTTEN WHAT THE POLITICAL INFLUENCE WAS BUT THERE WERE ECONOMIC TIES THEN THE ISSUE OF OF IF IF IT S IN THE ECONOMIC INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES UH DO WE GO IN AND AND PREVAIL AND AND UH IN OTHER WORDS DO WE MAKE THE WORLD SAFE FOR DEMOCRACY .
RIGHT .
BUT IF THERE S NO ECONOMIC BENEFIT AND I THINK PARTICULARLY IF YOU RE IF YOU RE LOOKING AT THE AT THE AT THE PEASANT UH WHETHER HE S IN CENTRAL AMERICA REGARDLESS OF WHERE HE IS IS HIS LIFE IS HIS LIFE BETTER OFF UNDER COMMUNISM OR OR UH OR DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT YOU LOOK AT SALVADOR WHERE THE .
WELL HE DOES NT CARE AS LONG AS HE S FEEDING HIS UH HIS FAMILY .
YEAH AND AND THE QUESTION IS DOES THE GOVERNMENT MAKE A DIFFERENCE IF THEY LL MOSTLY LEAVE HIM ALONE UH AND I THINK THAT S THE DIFFICULTY THEY THAT THAT WE HAVE THAT UH IT IT REALITY DOES NT MAKE UH DOES NT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE IF HE HAS NO INCOME AND APPARENTLY EVEN SOME OF OUR ALLEGED UH CENTRAL AMERICAN LEADERS THAT UH ARE MOSTLY DEMOCRATIC HAVE DONE SOME PRETTY TERRIBLE THINGS SO IT S UH .
YEAH WELL YO IN LOOKING BU IF YOU LOOK AT THE REGION IN IN UH TO THEIR DETRIMENT THEY CAME FROM UH THIS UH HUNDREDS OF YEARS OF SPANISH CONTROL AND THE AND THE SPANIARDS HAVE UH HORRIBLE HISTORY OF CORRUPT UH GOVERNMENT GREEDY UH RULERS WHO HAVE BEEN UH MANIPULATING MANIPULATING THEIR PUBLIC FOR THEIR OWN THEIR OWN GOOD I MEAN IF YOU GO BACK TO THE KINGS AND AND THE THE CONQUISTADORS COMING IN AND AND THE HOR INCREDIBLY HORRIBLE THINGS THEY DID TO THE UH THE NATIVE TRIBES I MEAN THEY MAKE UH THEY MAKE THE THINGS THAT CUSTER DID LOOK LIKE UH LIKE TRIVIAL AND UH YOU GET .
IT IS IT IS INTERESTING THAT THAT YOU KNOW WE WE LOOK AT THE EXPLOITATION AND AND AND THEN WE ACCUSE SOME OTHER PEOPLE OF EXPLOITING THEM AND AND AMERICANS HAVE UH HAVE A PRETTY GOOD REPUTATION OF EXPLOITING YOU KNOW WE BASICALLY THE PANAMA CANAL WE WENT IN AND AND TOOK IT .
OH ABSOLUTELY AND YOU KNOW WE SET UP .
AND WE STOLE IT FAIR AND SQUARE I THINK IS UH .
AN I MEAN TED TEDDY ROOSEVELT DID NT HAVE THE REPUTATION SPEAK SOFTLY AND CARRY A BIG STICK FOR UH FOR NOTHING AND UH .
WELL WHAT S GOING TO BE INTERESTING IS TO THE SEE WHAT THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF OF UH OF THE THE REGION UH YOU KNOW AT THE MOMENT IT THE TREMENDOUS DRUG TRAFFIC THROUGH THERE BUT UH .
RIGHT .
THE IDEA OF OF UH WHAT S THE WHAT S AMERICA S ROLE THERE AND IT IT UH WITH WITH OTHER THINGS GOING ON IT IT SEEMS TO HAVE LESSENED BUT YOU VE STILL GOT UH CUBA THAT ACCEPTS EXERTS SOME INFLUENCE .
THE ONLY THE ONLY THING I SEE ABOUT CUBA THOUGH IS UH AFTER FIDEL CASTRO DIES I DO NT THINK THEY LL BE A COMMUNIST POWER ANYMORE I I CA NT SEE COMMUNISM IN THAT COUNTRY CARRYING ON PAST HIM .
WELL WHEN YOU TAKE A A SITUATION WHERE I THINK IN PARTICULAR IN SALVADOR WHERE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT UNDER CLASS EXCUSE ME AND THAT UH YOU KNOW HAVING A A LOT OF DIFFICULTY UH SURVIVING UH THE QUESTION IS WOULD THEY YOU KNOW WOULD THEY BE BETTER OFF UNDER COMMUNISM .
YEAH .
AND I WOULD NT DO NT KNOW THAT I WOULD ADVOCATE COMMUNISM BUT UH THE QUESTION IS CAN UH CAN YOU CAN UH CAN A DEMOCRACY UH AFFORD THE IT S LIKE THE STREET PEOPLE THAT ARE STARTING TO SHOW UP ALL OTHER THE U S IS THAT .
RIGHT .
THAT S ESSENTIALLY AN UNDERCLASS AND WHEN YOU GET ENOUGH OF THEM UH YOU KNOW COMMUNISM WOULD FEED THEM ALL .
YE WELL I I DO NT KNOW IF MAYBE COMMUNISM IS THE RIGHT THE RIGHT WORD FOR IT BUT WHAT WE WOULD THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE SOME KIND OF THERE THERE MAY BE A POINT AT WHICH AT WHICH YOU VE UH YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER SOME KIND OF SOCIALISTIC UH ORGANIZATION OR SOCIALISTIC SET UP TO TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM AND THEN BE ABLE TO GRADUALLY TRANSFORM BACK TO A DEMOCRACY .
WELL THAT YEAH IF THE GUYS GOT SOME INCENTIVE IF HE S GOT UH YOU KNOW IF HE IF HE CAN RAISE ENOUGH UH COFFEE AND BANANAS TO UH WHERE HE S GOT SOMETHING TO PROTECT OTHER YOU KNOW .
RIGHT RIGHT .
WHETHER HE CAN EXPORT OR AT LEAST UH SET UP TRADE AND ALL THEN DEMOCRACY OF A CONSIDERABLE INTEREST .
BUT COCOA LEAVES SELL REAL WELL RIGHT NOW IT SEEMS YEAH .
YEAH AS WELL AS SOME OTHER VARIOUS THINGS THAT ARE GROWING IN TROPICAL ENVIRONMENTS .
ABSOLUTELY I DO NT IT S GOING TO BE HARD TO UM WE IF YOU YOU THAT THAT S WHERE YOUR ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IS WE VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING IN THAT REGION TO ENCOURAGE UH OR TO MAKE TO MAKE HIM GROWING BANANAS PROFITABLE AGAIN I MEAN .
YES BUT THE BUT THE QUESTION IS YOU KNOW IF SOMEBODY OFFERED YOU YOU KNOW A THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY TO TO GROW SOMETHING IN YOUR BACKYARD WOULD YOU DO IT .
RIGHT .
WELL NOT THAT WE COULD BE BOUGHT BUT UH .
I VE GOT TO WATCH WHAT I SAY HERE I NEVER KNOW WHEN THE D I A MAY BE UH LISTENING ON MY PHONE .
WELL OF COURSE EVERYTHING WE RE SAYING IS BEING RECORDED AND .
RIGHT .
OF COURSE OF COURSE .
YEAH IT S TEMPTING IT S GOT TO BE IT S GOT TO BE HORRIBLY TEMPTING FOR THOSE THOSE PEASANTS .
PARTICULARLY IF YOU RE HUNGRY .
YEAH YEAH YOU IT S NOT IT S NOT JUST A MATTER OF UH OF HAVING AN EXTRA CAR OR HAVING A BETTER CAR THIS IS A MATTER FOR THEM OF OF FEEDING THEMSELVES THEIR WIFE AND THEIR FAMILY AND AND YOU THERE S A CERTAIN DEGREE OF HONOR IN BEING ABLE TO FEED YOUR FAMILY AND THERE S DISHONOR IN NOT BEING ABLE TO DO IT AND .
UH STARVING TO DEATH IS NOT A NOT A WHOLE LOT OF FUN EITHER AND THAT UH AND AND YOU KNOW .
NO NO .
WHEN SOMEBODY COMES IN AN OFFERS I THINK THAT S ONE OF THE REAL PROBLEMS PARTICULARLY WHEN WHEN THE UH RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS YOU KNOW THE CATHOLIC CHURCH HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF A LOT OF THINGS .
UHHUH .
IN REALITY I THINK WHAT THEY WERE DOING IS BASICALLY GOING IN AND TRYING TO FEED SOME PEOPLE AND HELP THEM PROTECT THEMSELVES NOT THAT THEY I M I M NOT SURE THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS IS IS PARTICULARLY POLITICAL BUT YOU KNOW IF .
RIGHT .
NOW I M SORRY .
READY TO GO OKAY .
EXCUSE ME AND UH I DO THAT WE RECYCLE UH NEWSPAPERS WE TAKE YOU KNOW THE DALLAS MORNING NEWS DAILY .
RIGHT .
AND THE PLANO PAPER DAILY AND YOU KNOW AFTER A MONTH OF THAT YOU GOT A TON .
OH .
OF NEWSPAPERS .
I KNOW IT BUILDS UP REALLY FAST .
IT REALLY DOES .
YEAH .
I DO RECYCLE .
YEAH .
NEWSPAPERS AND UH GLASS .
UHHUH .
WE DO NT REALLY HAVE ENOUGH PLASTIC TO MESS WITH WE DO NT YOU KNOW LIKE WE DO NT DRINK MILK AND WE DO NT HAVE CHILDREN SO WE DO NT HAVE YOU KNOW SIX THOUSAND PLASTIC MILK JUGS .
YEAH WE DO .
A MONTH YOU KNOW .
WITH TWO A TWO YEAR OLD AND A .
YEAH .
THREE YEAR OLD AND .
RIGHT .
SO IT REALLY BUILDS UP WITH US .
BUT THERE IS YOU KNOW THERE IS A PLACE YOU CAN TAKE THOSE ALSO YOU KNOW AT THE SAME PLACE JUST PUT THEM IN A DIFFERENT UH CONTAINER .
YEAH .
AND UH PLANO HAS PLANS I BELIEVE IT S TENTATIVELY SCHEDULED FOR SOMETIME IN MAY OF THIS YEAR THE CITY IS GOING TO LEAVE UH RECEPTACLES AT PEOPLE S HOME .
OH YEAH .
AND THEY CA .
THAT WOULD BE MUCH MORE CONVENIENT .
IT .
YEAH .
CERTAINLY WOULD AND THEY CAN SEPARATE IT AND THEN THE YOU KNOW TRASH GUYS WILL PICK IT UP .
YEAH .
WHICH WOULD REALLY BE HANDY YOU KNOW FOR PEOPLE LIKE SHUT INS OR .
YEAH .
PEOPLE WHO CA NT OR DO NT DRIVE YOU KNOW .
OR IT JUST BUILDS UP SO OFTEN .
THEY CA NT GET TO THE THESE CENTERS .
YEAH .
AND I M SURE RATHER THAN TRY TO UH ASK SOMEONE TO TAKE THEM FOR THEM THEY PROBABLY JUST PITCH THEM YOU KNOW .
YEAH YEAH .
BUT I THINK THAT S PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA .
THEY USED TO HAVE SEVERAL PLACES UM THAT WERE A LITTLE WAYS OUT IN THE COMMUNITY THAT DID THE PAPER AND ALL .
UHHUH .
AND THEY STOPPED DOING IT BECAUSE THEY SAID IT WAS NT PROFITABLE .
RIGHT .
SO FINALLY UM THEY THE PEOPLE PUT SO MUCH PRESSURE ON THE CITY .
UHHUH .
THEY DID A SURVEY OF EVERYBODY .
UHHUH .
AND THEY TOOK A BIG HUGE BIN THAT HAS PAPER AND PLASTIC UM .
AND PUT IT IN FRONT OF THE WALMART STORE IN TOWN .
UHHUH .
AND TH THEY IT JUST REALLY E E EVERY TIME YOU WENT BY THERE IT WAS JUST OVER FLOWING .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND SO WALMART COMPLAINED .
UHHUH YES .
SO THEY MOVED IT BEHIND THE STORE AND NOBODY KNEW WHERE IT WAS .
YEAH .
AND SO PEOPLE KEPT PILING STUFF IN THE SAME PLACE .
UHHUH .
WHERE IT USED TO BE .
GREAT .
OH IT WAS JUST LIKE A DUMP THERE .
I BET IT WAS .
AND SO FINALLY YOU KNOW I CALLED AND THE THEY SAID YOU KNOW IT WAS BEHIND THERE AND I STARTED TAKING MY THINGS BEHIND THERE .
UHHUH .
SO WE DO THAT WITH BECAUSE WE HAVE MILK CARTONS YOU KNOW CONSTANTLY .
UHHUH .
WITH TWO LITTLE KIDS .
SURE .
AND THE PAPER BUT IT JUST BUILDS UP .
UHHUH .
IT WOULD BE SO NICE IF THEY HAD IT YOU KNOW AT YOUR HOME .
UHHUH .
WHERE YOU COULD JUST TURN IT IN SO THEY THEY FINAL HAD ENOUGH OF A RESPONSE THAT THEY DECIDED TO TRY A SMALL TARGET AREA .
UHHUH .
IN ONE NEIGHBORHOOD .
RIGHT .
AND THEY HAVE PICKUP THERE IT S UH I THINK ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK .
UHHUH .
AND THE FIRST COUPLE WEEKS THEY DID IT NOBODY GOT THEIR STUFF OUT SO THEY HAD NOT MUCH PARTICIPATION AND THEY WERE GOING TO CANCEL IT .
UHHUH .
BUT THEN FINALLY PEOPLE STARTED GETTING THE MESSAGE .
YEAH IT S JUST A MATTER OF EDUCATION I THINK .
YEAH AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW IF THEY CAN GET ENOUGH GOING .
UHHUH .
THEY LL CONTINUE IT YOU KNOW THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE CITY BUT IT S NOT I THINK ORIGINALLY PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE PROFITABLE FOR CITIES TO DO THIS .
UHHUH .
AND IT S NOT GOING TO BE .
YEAH .
I DO NT THINK .
YEAH THAT S RIGHT .
YEAH .
I THINK BASICALLY IT S A GOOD IDEA YOU KNOW I HOPE IT WORKS .
YEAH I DO TO BECAUSE IT S AMAZING HOW MUCH YOU KNOW TRASH .
ABSOLUTELY .
WE CAN GENERATE .
ABSOLUTELY .
I KNOW THIS YEAR WE TOOK OUR CHRISTMAS TREE THEY HAD A PLACE .
RIGHT .
IN THE PARK WHERE YOU COULD GO HAVE YOUR TREE SHREDDED AND THEY GAVE YOU A LITTLE UM SEEDLING TO PLANT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
YOU COULD TAKE THE THE MULCH HOME WITH YOU YOU KNOW AND TAKE BUCKETS OF THAT HOME .
UHHUH .
SO THAT WAS REALLY GOOD IDEA .
SURE .
I THOUGHT .
ABSOLUTELY AND THERE S JUST YOU KNOW THE TWO OF US MY WIFE AND I AND IT S AMAZING HOW MUCH STUFF J JUST THE TWO OF US GENERATE .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW I CAN IMAGINE A FAMILY OF YOU KNOW FOUR OR FIVE .
OH YEAH IT S REALLY IT ADDS UP SO FAST .
IT REALLY DOES .
YEAH .
AS FAR AS NEW STUFF TO RECYCLE YOU KNOW I DO NT REALLY I DO NT REALLY KNOW I REALLY HAD NT THOUGHT ABOUT IT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH .
YEAH WELL THEY RE WORKING ON DIAPERS .
THAT S RIGHT I WAS .
WHICH WOULD BE GREAT .
UHHUH .
I VE READ SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS ABOUT DIAPERS AND NOW THEIR SAYING THAT E ORIGINALLY THEY THOUGHT THE DISPOSABLES WERE JUST AWFUL .
UHHUH .
BUT NOW THEIR SAYING THAT THEY RE THER REALLY NOT THAT MUCH IN COMPARISON TO THE OTHERS BECAUSE YOU DO NT HAVE TO USE THE WATER TO WASH THEM .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND YOU KNOW ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS TOO SO TH THE DIAPER SERVICE TRUCKS APPARENTLY THE FUEL THAT THEY USE AND THE FUMES THAT THEY PRODUCE TO DELIVER .
UHHUH .
AND DROP THOSE OFF .
YEAH .
SO I DO NT KNOW WHAT S THE YOU KNOW RIGHT THING TO DO BUT I REALLY WOULD HOPE THAT THEY WOULD COME UP I KNOW THERE WAS A BRAND JUST BRIEFLY ON THE MARKET THAT WAS RECYCLABLE .
UHHUH .
BUT THE LANDFILL HAVE TO DO SOMETHING SPECIAL YOU KNOW FOR THOSE .
I SEE .
BUT THAT JUST GENERATES A TREMENDOUS OF VOLUME OF TRASH TOO SO .
OH I M SURE IT MUST YES YOU KNOW I M NOT PERSONALLY INVOLVED BECAUSE I DO NT YOU KNOW I DO NT HAVE ANY S CHILDREN THAT WEAR DIAPERS .
YEAH .
BUT I M SURE IT CREATES A LARGE AMOUNT OF YOU KNOW .
IT DOES .
UH REFUSE .
AND YOU JUST FEEL GUILTY IF YOU DO NT DO .
THAT S RIGHT .
SOMETHING WITH THEM YOU KNOW .
THAT S RIGHT .
BECAUSE YOU HATE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROBLEM .
ABSOLUTELY .
BUT ON THE ON THE OTHER HAND THE ALTERNATIVES ARE NT TO GREAT EITHER .
THAT S RIGHT ABSOLUTELY .
ABSOLUTELY .
YEAH I DO NT KNOW WHAT ELSE THEY COULD RECYCLE MORE OF I GUESS WE DO NT REALLY USE THAT MANY TIN CANS I GUESS THERE S SOME PLACES WHERE YOU CAN RECYCLE ALUMINUM BUT I DO NT KNOW ABOUT LIKE CANS THAT YOU KEEP VEGETABLES AND STUFF .

I THINK THEY RE MADE OUT OF ALUMINUM .
UM .

YEAH .
BUT AGAIN WE DO NT WE DO NT GENERATE THAT MUCH SO .
YEAH .
WE DO NT .
WE DO NT EITHER .

THAT S RIGHT .
MUCH OF THAT .
THAT NINETYNINE PERCENT OF OURS IS NEWSPAPER AND UH YOU KNOW UH GLASS .

I GUESS IT S ALWAYS NOT NOT BEING ABLE TO PICTURE ONE MORE BUT IN ESSENCE .

BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE TWO OR THREE KIDS BY THE E WAY .
THE INFLATION S GOING I THINK A WOMAN S ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE TO WORK AND IT S JUST GOING TO BE AN ACCEPTED THING .
THERE IS NT GOING TO BE ANY OF THIS YOU KNOW VERY FEW PEOPLE WILL EVER STAY HOME .

ALL DAY LONG .
WELL YOU KNOW I CA NT IMAGINE HOW I DID BECAUSE NOW I WORK ALL THE TIME .
YEAH .
AND UM WELL I WORK ALL WEEK AND UM I CA NT IMAGINE HOW I STAYED HOME .

YOU KNOW I THINK TO MYSELF WHAT DID I DO .
AND I THINK IT JUST IT REVOLUTIONIZED AN WHERE A WOMAN THINKS THAT A WAY YOU KNOW JUST LIKE NOW MY DAUGHTER THERE S NO WAY THAT SHE CAN IMAGINE HERSELF MARRIED AT THE AGE THAT SHE S AT NOW .
TO HER .
EVERYTHING IS YOU VE GOT TO GO THROUGH COLLEGE YOU VE GOT TO GET A JOB YOU KNOW .
AND THEN WHEN EVERYTHING S SET UP THEN YOU LOOK FOR SOMEBODY THAT YOU WANT TO SPEND THE REST OF YOUR LIFE WITH BUT .
RIGHT .
I MEAN IT IS SO FAR DOWN THE ROAD WHERE NOW WHEN I GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL .
THAT S YOU DID THAT S WHAT .
YOU DID .
THE THING UHHUH AND THEN YOU GOT MARRIED AND THEN YOU HAD A FAMILY .
UH .
I MEAN THAT S JUST THE WAY .
IT WAS YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
AND UH THAT S LIKE WHEN MY MO I KNOW WHEN MY MOTHER S AGE .
IT WAS ALWAYS THE KIDS AND THE FAMILY AND EVERYTHING HAD TO COME FIRST AND THE WOMAN STAYED HOME AND TOOK CARE OF THEM AN .
I UH I I LIKE THE WAY .
IT IS .
YEAH .
IT .
S UH BEING SEE WE RE FROM HOUSTON AND SO IT S NOT SO HARD FOR PEOPLE YOU KNOW YOU VE BEEN MARRIED THREE OR SO YEARS AND YOU DO NT HAVE KIDS WELL IT S OKAY NO NOBODY DOES .
BUT YOU COME TO A PLACE LIKE BELTON AND TH A LOT OF THE KIDS HERE GET MARRIED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
IT S REAL SMALL TOWN AND I AND A LOT OF PEOPLE IN OUR SU WE RE THE ONLY COUPLE IN OUR SUNDAY SCHOOL CLASS EXCEPT FOR ONE OTHER COUPLE WHO ARE IN THEIR FORTIES AND THEY CA NT HAVE CHILDREN WHO DO NT HAVE CHILDREN .
AND THEY CA NT IMAGINE WHY WE WOULD WANT TO HAVE CHILDREN .
AND I M GOING WELL YOU KNOW THERE S MORE TO LIFE YOU KNOW THERE S LIFE IN THERE .
THAT S .
YOU KNOW NOT EVERYBODY HAS TO HAVE KIDS AND I D RATHER SPEND THE TIME WITH MY HUSBAND THAN YOU KNOW SPENDING TIME HERE IT S YOUR TURN YOU KNOW .
YEAH BUT YOU KNOW THAT NOW EVEN WHENEVER I WAS COMING UP AND EVERYTHING AND WE GOT MARRIED RIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL WELL A YEAR AFTER I GOT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
AND UH I DID NT HAVE KIDS FOR FOUR AND A HALF YEARS BUT THAT WAS BECAUSE I WANTED TO WORK AND I WAS NT READY FOR KIDS .
YEAH I THINK THAT S WHAT .
IT IS I M NOT EITHER .
AND EVERYBODY THOUGHT OH MY GOSH WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH HER YOU KNOW .
THEY RE PROBABLY GOING OH I BET SHE CA NT GET PREGNANT .
RIGHT I MEAN THEY THOUGHT THAT IT WAS TERRIBLE YOU KNOW AND THEN WHEN I D TELL THEM YOU KNOW WELL I M JUST NOT READY FOR CHILDREN YET OH BUT THAT YOU KNOW YOU BETTER YOU BETTER JUST GET READY NOW .
YEAH .
WELL YOU DO NT JUST GET READY .
BUT I WAS KIND OF ODD BECAUSE AS A GENERAL RULE .
THE PEOPLE .
THAT MARRIED DURING MY TIME THEY HAD KIDS WITHIN A YEAR .
YEAH .
AND I JUST WAS NOT READY FOR KIDS .
I WANTED TO GET OUT AND WORK A LITTLE BIT AND I WANTED TO TRAVEL AND STUFF LIKE THAT WHICH .
WE DID .
AND UH KIDS DID NT FIT IN RIGHT THEN BUT IT S GETTING MORE AND MORE LIKE THAT WHERE THERE S MORE AND MORE COUPLES AND REALLY IF YOU DO NT WANT THE KIDS THEN IT S NOT THE TIME TO HAVE I DO NT CARE WHAT .
ANYBODY TELLS YOU .
RIGHT .
AND I THINK THAT MORE AND MORE THE ATTITUDE S GETTING THAT A WAY .
BECAUSE THAT S LIKE MY DAUGHTER NOW SHE SAYS THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE WHEN SHE S THIRTY SHE MIGHT WANT A CHILD THEN .
YEAH .
AND UH EVEN THOUGH I D LIKE TO HAVE GRANDCHILDREN I CAN SEE HER POINT .
YEAH STEVE S MOM FINALLY UH FINALLY S YOU KNOW SAID THAT THAT GOD WILL TAKE CARE OF US WHEN IT S OUR TIME .
RIGHT .
SHE FINALLY ADMITTED YOU KNOW SHE FINALLY TOLD ME .
IT S OKAY IF YOU DO NT BUT IT TOOK EVERY NERVE IN HER BODY TO SAY THAT BECAUSE SHE S FROM A VERY VERY OLD FASHIONED FAMILY .
UHHUH .
AND SHE STAYED HOME AND RAISED HER KIDS AND AND SHE EXPECTED ALL OF HER KIDS TO DO THAT TOO AND THEIR WIVES AND TO BE THE THE HOUSEWIFE AND HAVE DINNER READY BY FIVE AND AND YOU KNOW BE THERE AT EVERY BECK AND CALL AND I WAS RAISED TOTALLY OPPOSITE .
HOW WE GOT TOGETHER I DO NT KNOW BUT .
BECAUSE MY MOTHER HAD SIX GIRLS AND YOU KNOW SHE WORKED TOO .
YEAH .
AND I GUESS I JUST AND I SAW HOW LIFE WAS WHEN SHE STAYED HOME AND IT WAS ROUGH IT WAS HARD AND UH .
YEAH AND IT REALLY IS I KNOW JUST LIKE NOW YOU KNOW THERE S THERE S SO MUCH MORE NOW .
ALL MY INCOME GOES FOR THINGS LIKE LUXURIES I MEAN IT REALLY DOES .
UHHUH .
ACCEPT FOR WHAT .
WE GIVE TO MY DAUGHTER TO YOU KNOW PUT HER THROUGH COLLEGE AND STUFF .
BUT THE REST OF IT .
WE JUST BUY THINGS LIKE BOATS OR WE GO ON TRIPS OR YOU KNOW JUST .
RIGHT .
THE MORE OR LESS LIKE ENTERTAINMENT STUFF BUT .
YEAH I THINK YOU VE YOU VE EARNED THAT THOUGH .
YEAH I FEEL LIKE I HAVE YOU KNOW BECAUSE WELL WE RE JUST A AGE NOW I M NOT OLD BUT I M OLDER .
UHHUH .
AND UH I GOT TO STAY HOME WITH MY KIDS WHICH .
I REALLY WANTED TO DO BUT NOW I COULD NOT GO BACK AND DO IT .
YEAH .
I REALLY COULD NT I DO NT THINK I COULD STAY HOME .
ALL THE TIME AND DO NOTHING .
AND I MEAN I DID STUFF BUT .
RIGHT .
TO ME .
IT FEELS LIKE I MUST HAVE DONE NOTHING .
AND I THINK IT S JUST THE NEW WAY THAT PEOPLE ARE THINKING .
YEAH I THINK SO .
BUT UH .
I THINK IT WOULD BE NEAT IF IF THEY COULD INCORPORATE INTO SMALL AND LARGE BUSINESSES .
BOTH .
A BUILT IN DAY CARES WHERE THE CHILDREN WERE THERE IN THE FACILITY BUT NOT NECESSARILY RIGHT THERE WITH YOU .
WELL YOU KNOW MORE AND MORE OF THEM ARE I DO NT KNOW IF IT IS UP THERE WHERE YOU ARE BUT WHERE I AM THE JUST LIKE ALL THE HOSPITALS .
UHHUH .
THEY RE GETTING DAY CARE .
ARE THEY .
BUT THE REASON .
THEY HAD TO DO THIS WAS BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE YOU KNOW SO MANY WOMEN COULD NOT AFFORD LIKE YOU SAID IF YOU HAD FOUR KIDS OR EVEN IF YOU HAD TWO KIDS YOU WOULD BE PAYING ALL YOUR SALARY TO PAY FOR THOSE TWO KIDS TO GO .
RIGHT .
SO UH MORE AND MORE OF OUR HOSPITALS ESPECIALLY OVER HERE ARE GETTING THEM AND THEN SOME OF THE BIGGER COMPANIES BUT IT S MAINLY THE HOSPITALS .
YEAH I DO NT KNOW IF THE T I IN DALLAS DOES OR NOT .
I KNOW I KNOW NOBODY AROUND HERE DOES IT WE RE IT S TOO SMALL AROUND HERE .
OH REALLY .
YEAH .
OKAY WELL PERSONALLY I DO NT HAVE ANY CHILDREN .

SO I TRY TO I TRY TO CATCH THAT IF NOTHING ELSE .
THAT S TRUE AND AND HOW DO YOU RATE THE UH H ARE YOU PLEASED WITH THE NEWS COVERAGE THAT YOU RE RECEIVING .
FOR FOR LOCAL NEWS .
I THINK WE DO REAL WELL WHERE IT S WE LIVE IN A KIND OF SMALL TOWN BUT I THINK WE GET EXCELLENT LOCAL COVERAGE UM AND I LIKE THE NATIONAL NEWS THAT WE SEE WE WE WATCH N B C AND I THINK THEY DO A REAL GOOD JOB .
SO I M I VE BEEN REAL PLEASED WITH THE QUALITY OF THE NEWS .
WE GET HOW ABOUT YOU .
ON THE WHOLE I M PLEASED WHEN I HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR JUST THE FACTS .
I WOULD MUCH PREFER THAT THEY KEEP THEIR ANALYSIS TO THEMSELVES .
UM SINCE I DO NT NECESSARILY AGREE WITH IT OR IT TENDS TO BE EXTRAORDINARILY TRITE .
RIGHT .
UH I THINK I M FED UP WITH TRITE .
THERE SEEMS TO BE MORE AND MORE OF IT AND I UNDERSTAND THE VOID THAT UH COMES NATURALLY WITH BOTH RADIO PRESENTATIONS AND TELEVISION PRESENTATIONS AND A .
UHHUH .
AS EXPENSIVE AS THEY ARE TO PRODUCE THEY CERTAINLY DO NT WANT ANY DEAD AIRSPACE .
YEAH BUT I THINK THERE .
S ENOUGH NEWS OUT THERE THAT THEY COULD PASS ON MORE FACTUAL INFORMATION TO US AND LIKE YOU SAID SAVE THE COMMENTARIES BECAUSE I M GOING TO LISTEN TO THE THE NEWS AND DRAW MY OWN OPINIONS .
I DO NT REALLY NEED THEIR HELP TO DO THAT .
I WO I WE RE CERTAINLY IN AGREEMENT THERE .
I DO NT THINK RADIO IS AS BAD TO DO THAT AS T V IS .
RADIO SEEMS TO HAVE A FULL PLATTER OR FULL PLATE OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO GET DONE .
THEY RE MAYBE THEY RE A LITTLE .
MORE EFFICIENT .
UHHUH .
OR HAVE MORE TO DO OVER THAT SAME TIME FRAME .
RIGHT .
I DO NT KNOW WHICH .
THAT ANSWER IS .
UH I THINK THE MY GREATEST COMPLAINT ABOUT NEWS PROGRAMS IS PROGRAMS LIKE SIXTY MINUTES .
DO YOU WATCH THAT .
I USED TO BUT I DO NT ANYMORE MAYBE ONCE OR TWICE A YEAR .
WELL I USED TO WATCH SIXTY MINUTES UNTIL THEY DID TWO PROGRAMS UH THAT I KNEW BOTH .
THE PEOPLE AND THE INC INCIDENCES .
UHHUH .
AND I KNEW THAT THEY HAD PRESENTED AN EXTREMELY SLANTED VIEWPOINT .
REALLY .
THAT WAS IN MY ESTIMATE NOWHERE NEAR TRUTH BUT WAS MUCH BETTER FOR RATINGS .
YES .
AND IT EVER SINCE THAT TIME .
I JUST DO NT WATCH .
UH SO I GUESS WE HAVE THE THE SAME REACTION WHETHER WE CAME ABOUT IT FROM THE SAME PLACE OR NOT .
YEAH .
WELL I HAD HEARD A COUPLE OF PEOPLE YOU KNOW THAT I HAD TALKED TO ABOUT CERTAIN PROGRAMS SAY THAT YOU KNOW THEY HAD READ OTHER THINGS BESIDES WHAT .
SIXTY MINUTES PRESENTED AND THAT THEY DID NT PRESENT IT NEARLY THE SAME WAY AS THE YOU KNOW NEWS ARTICLES OR WHATEVER .
THEY HAD THEY HAD ALREADY BEEN FAMILIAR WITH .
SO I STARTED QUESTIONING JUST HOW HOW BIAS THEY REALLY WERE SO .
I DO NT KNOW DI I DO NT KNOW HOW OLD YOU ARE BUT IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE THE LAST UH NEWSCASTER .
THAT PRESENTED NEWS IN JUST THE NICE SIMPLE FACTUAL WAY THAT I WANTED TO HEAR WAS WALTER CRONKITE .
HUH .
SO I DO NT I DO NT KNOW IF YOU RE FAMILIAR WITH HIM OR NOT .
NO NOT REALLY YOU KNOW IN THE LAST FEW YEARS .
JUST HIS KIND OF INFORMAL SEGMENTS I VE SEEN BUT I NEVER GOT TO SEE HIS ACTUAL NIGHTLY NEWS .
I LIKED I I DID GROW UP WITH DAVID BRINKLEY .
UH .
WELL BRINKLEY WAS SORT OF TRYING TO BE IN THE MOLD .
UHHUH .
OF CRONKITE AND HE DID A A PRETTY GOOD JOB .
THE HUNTLEY BRINKLEY REPORT WAS QUITE EXCELLENT .
YEAH WE .
OVER THE YEARS .
WE USED TO WATCH UM HIM AND I GUESS JOHN CHANCELLOR .
AND I ALWAYS LIKED DAVID BRINKLEY AND I AND I USED TO ENJOY JOHN CHANCELLOR S STYLE OF REPORTING BUT ON THE NIGHTLY NEWS NOW HE GOES INTO HIS COMMENTARY AND THAT S WHERE I GET GET INTO THE PROBLEM WITH WITH HIM .
I FREQUENTLY DISAGREE WITH HIS COMMENTARIES SO .
WELL ONCE THEY VE REPORTED THE FACTS ALL .
THEY CAN OFFER IS AN OPINION ANYMORE .
RIGHT .
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE NEWS COVERAGE OF THE WAR .
WELL I ALMOST FELT LIKE IT WAS TOO MUCH .
INDEED I FOUND MYSELF RESTRICTING MY VIEWING TO A COUPLE OF HOURS .
A DAY ONE IN THE MORNING AND ONE IN THE EVENING .
UHHUH .
UH I I SPENT A NUMBER OF YEARS IN THE SERVICE AS AN INTELLIGENCE ANALYST .
REALLY .
AND I DO NT NEED THEIR FILLINS YOU KNOW .
DID THAT HELP YOU UNDERSTAND A LOT .
WHAT WAS GOING ON YOUR YOUR PRIOR EXPERIENCE WITH THE MILITARY DID .
YES BUT I I THINK IT HELPS ME EVERYDAY IN TRYING TO REVIEW WH THE STATE THAT THE WORLD IS IN AND TRY TO GUESS WHERE WE RE GOING .
I WONDERED IF IT WOULD HELP YOU SOMETIMES FILLIN .
THE GAPS OR RECOGNIZE DISCREPANCIES THAT OTHER PEOPLE PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF MIGHT NOT PICK UP ON .
WELL I I THINK UH MY BACKGROUND IS PROBABLY WHAT ABSOLUTELY TURNED ME OFF WITH SIXTY MINUTES .
OKAY .
WHAT .
WEEKLY UM MAGAZINE DO YOU LOOK AT IS IT .
I LIKE U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT .
AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER I VE TAKEN THEM .
ALL FOR A YEAR .
UHHUH .
I BELIEVE IN GIVING ANYTHING A CHANCE .
SURE .
UH BUT I KEEP COMING BACK TO THAT .
ONE SO I THAT S KIND OF MY FAVORITE .
DOES THAT GIVE A PRETTY GOOD OVERVIEW OF EVERYTHING OR LIKE DOES IT GIVE UM I GUESS LITTLE ENCAPSULATED REPORTS AND AND THEN A FEW BIG STORIES .
IT S PRIMARILY UM A FEW BIG STORIES AND THEN LOTS OF HIGHLEVEL REPORTS .
YEAH .
UH HERE S WHAT WENT ON IN ASIA OVER THE PAST WEEK AND THERE S MAYBE A PAGE OF THAT LITTLE BRIEF PARAGRAPHS UNLESS THAT WAS ONE OF THEIR THE FOCUS OF THEIR MAIN STORIES .
THAT SOUNDS GOOD IF YOU WERE SHORT ON TIME YOU COULD GET A SUMMARY REAL QUICK .
UH IT TOO IS ONE .
THOSE MUMBLEX IN THE INTEREST OF EFFICIENCY .
WE .
ALL HAVE TO FIND WAYS AND I DO MOST OF MY READING IN THE BATHROOM .
RIGHT .
UM AND IT S ONE OF THOSE THAT I CAN EI READ EITHER AN ARTICLE OR A COUPLE OF PAGES OF THOSE BRIEF EXCERPTS IN THE TIME FRAME THAT I M GOING TO SPEND IN THERE .
RIGHT .
AND IT JUST SEEMS TO FIT NICELY SO THAT I CAN GET IT READ IN ABOUT THREE DAYS .
WELL WE RE WORKING ON A NEWSWEEK UH FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS WE GOT YOU KNOW AN INTRODUCTORY SUBSCRIPTION SO WE DECIDED TO TRY IT BECAUSE PRIOR TO THAT .
ALL .
WE GOT WERE THINGS LIKE GLAMOUR OR SPORTS ILLUSTRATED .
SO WE DECIDED TO TRY TO BRING ONE IN THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT BETTER FOR US SO TO SPEAK .
WELL TO BROADEN YOUR HORIZONS MAKE YOU THINK ABOUT DIFFERENT THINGS ANYWAY .
IT CA NT HURT .
WELL ANYTIME THAT WE STOP AND THINK IT CA NT HURT .
NO .
I I EVEN I ENJOY READING T NEWS I TRY TO CATCH IT BECAUSE IT S ANOTHER EXAMPLE THEY JUST THEY JUST SHOW YOU .
THE WORDS AND THE FACTS AND THEY THEY DO NT OFFER ANY COMMENTARY AND IT GIVES ME .
A QUICK CHANCE TO TO BE CAUGHT UP DURING THE DAY .
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE DO NT LISTEN TO THE RADIO AT WORK AT ALL .
SO I DO NT LIKE TO GO THE WHOLE DAY WITHOUT HEARING ANYTHING .
OH I M WITH YOU I HAVE TO CHECK T NEWS .
EVERY EVERY DAY .
IT .
S MY NOONTIME DOSE OF FACTS .
YEAH AND THE OTHER THING .
WE HAVE THAT I LIKE TO CHECK SOMETIMES IS UM TALKING FINGERS DO YOU HAVE THAT .
NO .
YOU HAVE DIFFERENT TELEPHONE NUMBERS THAT YOU CAN DIAL AND THEN YOU DIAL IN AN ACCESS CODE AND IT WILL DEPENDING ON WHAT TOPIC .
YOU CALLED IN TO HEAR ABOUT WHETHER IT WAS THE NEWS OR THE WEATHER OR A SOAP OPERA UPDATE IT WILL GIVE YOU UM UPDATED INFORMATION .
SO THAT CAN GIVE YOU YOU KNOW CURRENT NEWS UPDATES CURRENT WEATHER UPDATES THINGS LIKE THAT AND IT S IT S OFFERED THROUGH THE LOCAL PHONE COMPANY FREE OF CHARGE .
SO THAT S .
HUH .
AN INTERESTING ALTERNATIVE OCCASIONALLY THAT I LIKE TO USE .
WELL IT DOES SOUND VERY INTERESTING .
IT .
MAYBE OUR PHONE COMPANY OUT HERE WILL GET AROUND TO .
IT REALLY IS .
OFFERING SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
YEAH IT REALLY IS NICE I MEAN BECAUSE IT GIVES YOU .
A WIDE VARIETY OF THINGS YOU CAN CALL AND TALK AND FIND OUT ABOUT .
SO THAT IS SOMETHING .
YOU MIGHT KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN FOR I THINK IT S IT S CATCHING ON THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY .
OKAY UM I HAVE TWO CHILDREN AND THEY RE OLDER NOW BUT UM I FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND GOOD CHILD CARE WHEN I WAS LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO FOR STAY WHILE I THOUGHT SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
AND UM I WANTED WHEN THEY WERE VERY YOUNG WHEN THEY WERE BABIES SAY TILL THEY WERE ABOUT TWO YEARS OLD I PREFERRED THAT THEY HAD AN INDIVIDUAL TAKE CARE OF THEM IN A HOME AND THAT S WHAT I LOOKED FOR AND I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO FIND ONE RIGHT ACROSS FROM MY SCHOOL AND THAT WORKED .
WELL THAT S GOOD .
YEAH THAT WORKED OUT REAL WELL BUT WHEN THEY GOT OLDER I WANTED THEM TO BE IN A SCHOOL TYPE SITUATION THREE I THINK THEY WERE BOTH THREE WHEN THEY STARTED WHERE THEY COULD LEARN TO INTERACT WITH KIDS AND .
UHHUH .
AND BE AROUND KIDS THEIR OWN AGE BECAUSE I THINK THAT S THAT THAT WOULD PREPARE THEM FOR SCHOOL ALSO IT S REAL IMPORTANT .
YES YEAH .
THAT THEY DO THAT UM THAT THEY GET THAT PREPARATION FOR SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
SO BUT I HAD I HAVE SWITCHED SCHOOLS SEVERAL TIMES BECAUSE I DI I REALLY DID NT CARE FOR WHAT WAS GOING ON AT THAT THE SCHOOL I WANTED THEM TO LEARN TO PLAY I DID NT ACADEMICS FORCED ON THEM AT AN EARLY AGE .
YEAH I UM THAT THAT S OH OH YOU MEAN YOU SWITCHED SCHOOLS FOR THE KIDS .
YEAH FOR THE SCH FOR THE KIDS .
UHHUH .
YES .
WE WELL I M JUST RECENTLY MARRIED .
UHHUH .
SO I DO NT HAVE ANY CHILDREN .
OKAY .
THOUGH WE PLAN ON HAVING THEM SOON BUT I THINK UM THAT I THAT THAT S PROBABLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST DIFFICULTIES UH I THINK UM I M LUCKY THOUGH THAT UM MY WIFE WILL PROBABLY NOT HAVE TO WORK WHILE OUR CHILDREN .
OH .
ARE UNDER FOUR .
WONDERFUL .
OR FIVE YEAH MUMBLEX I M A COLLEGE PROFESSOR .
OH .
SO .
GREAT .
AND THAT S ALSO AND IT S NICE FOR ME BECAUSE UM MOST OF THE TIME YOU HAVE SO SO MUCH FLEXIBLE HOURS SO THAT I COULD PROBABLY WORK TWO OR THREE DAYS A WEEK .
UM .
AND THEN ONE OR TWO EVENINGS .
GREAT .
SO THAT IF MY WIFE DOES UM DOES GO BACK TO WORK PART TIME UM THERE PROBABLY WILL BE A POSSIBILITY THAT I COULD STAY HOME TWO DAYS THAT SHE WOULD GO TO WORK AND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO TEACH AT NIGHT .
OH THAT S WONDERFUL .
YEAH SO IT WILL PROBABLY WORKOUT REAL NICE FOR US UH .
YEAH .
I THINK WE RE VERY LUCKY BECAUSE JUST MY JOB SORT OF BUILDS IN FLEXIBLE SCHEDULES .
THAT S WONDERFUL .
I CAN EVEN TEACH ON SATURDAYS AND .
OH .
AND THINGS .
GREAT .
LIKE THAT YEAH UM I DO KNOW THAT MY BROTHER AND HIS WIFE HAVE A TERRIBLE TIME FINDING UH CHILD CARE .
RIGHT .
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THEY MADE IN UM UH REAL THEY RE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY WAS THAT UM THEY RE CHILDREN DID NT HAVE TO LEAVE THEIR HOME .
OH THAT S .
SO .
WONDERFUL TOO .
THEY UM UM MY SISTERINLAW IS A UH UM A CLINICAL SPEECH PATHOLOGIST .
UHHUH .
SO SHE IS ALS I GUESS HER MOST RECENT POSITION AFTER SHE RETURNED BACK TO WORK SHE APPLIED FOR A DIRECTOR S POSITION AN AND GOT IT SO I GUESS SHE S VERY WELL QUALIFIED FOR HER FIELD I GUESS AND EVEN THOUGH SHE TOOK OFF TWO YEARS FOR UM I GUESS FOUR YEARS ALL TOGETHER .
UHHUH .
IT WOULD BE THREE YEARS HOW OLD S KAYLA THREE YEAH I GUESS SHE TOOK OFF THREE YEARS ALL TOGETHER UM FOR CAUSE I GUESS THEY HAVE A FOUR YEAR OLD AND YEAH AND MY NEPHEW IS TWO ALMOST TWO .
UHHUH .
SO I GUESS SHE TOOK OFF THREE ALL TOGETHER AND THEN WHEN SHE DECIDED TO GO BACK TO WORK UM SHE WAS ABLE TO FIND GOOD POSITION AND PAY FOR SOMEBODY TO COME INTO THEIR HOME .

SOMETHING LIKE .
I THINK THEY THEY RE BOTH THEY WERE BOTH PROFESSIONALS UNLIKE ME THEY RE UM THEY WERE MARRIED MY BROTHER S FIVE YEARS YOUNGER THEN SHE IS .

PROFES IN A PRACTICE ALMOST .
UHHUH .
UM WHERE YOU KNOW HE THEN THEY WAITED A COUPLE YEARS AND AND HE GOT HIMSELF PRETTY FAR ALONG I GUESS THEY DID NT HAVE KIDS UNTIL HE WAS ABOUT TWENTY SEV TWENTYSIX SO BY THAT TIME SHE WAS SO WELL ESTABLISHED YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
I GUESS IT MADE IT A LOT EASIER .
SURE .
BUT UH I THINK THE LONGER YOU WAIT THE EASIER THE EASIER IT IS .
OH I DO TO .
IF YOU HAVE THAT THAT PROFESSIONAL OCCUPATION WHERE YOU CAN CHANGE .
OH YEAH .
YEAH .
BUT THEY RE THEY RE ARE JUST SO MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT ARE NT THAT UH .

LUCKY UH .
THAT S RIGHT THAT S TRUE YEAH .
UH BECAUSE I M A SINGLE PARENT .
UHHUH .
AND I UH YOU KNOW MY HUSBAND AND I EXHUSBAND AND I GOT A DIVORCE UM WHEN THE CHILDREN WERE SMALL AND SO I UH WAS A TEACHER I UH STILL AM TEACHER .
UHHUH .
AND IT WAS REALLY DIFFICULT TO FIND AFFORDABLE CHILD CARE THAT WAS THAT WAS WHAT I WANTED .

HAVE PIECE OF MIND AND WHEN I TAUGHT SCHOOL AND I KNEW MY KIDS WERE BEING TAKEN .
WERE SAFE .
CARE OF .

UHHUH .
I JUST DID NT WANT IT TO BE A DAY WHERE THEY WENT AND SLEPT AND ATE COOKIES AND .

THAT S IT .
YEAH THAT S YOU KNOW THAT S SO IMPORTANT I UM I I GUESS IT S SO FUNNY NOW WITH SCHOOLS YOU KNOW THEY DO NT TAKE KID INTO KINDERGARTEN AND WHEN I GUESS WHEN THEY RE FIVE .
UHHUH .
AND SOMETIMES THEY FLUNK KINDERGARTEN NOW .
RIGHT .
THEY DO NT LET THEM INTO KINDERGARTEN UNLESS THEY CAN COUNT TO TEN AND KNOW THEIR A B C S AND I THINK THAT S SO FUNNY BECAUSE UM I DO NT I DO NT KNOW IF I WANT SCHOOL S VERY IMPORTANT I M AN EDUCATOR MYSELF AND MY WIFE TEACHES .

I TEACH THIS GRADE AND I I CAN SEE VERY READILY THE KIDS THAT DID NT NEVER LEARN SOCIALLY HOW TO GET ALONG WITH OTHER .
UHHUH .
CHILDREN AND THEY RE THE ONES THAT ARE HAVING PROBLEMS NOT ONLY GETTING ALONG WITH THE OTHER KIDS BUT ACADEMICALLY .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT THEY RE SHOULD BE THERE S TO MANY THINGS IN THEIR WAY .
YEP UHHUH .
AND SO I WANT MY I WANTED MY CHILDREN AND THEY DID LEARN TO GET TO GET ALONG WITH OTHER PEOPLE .
UHHUH THAT S A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT .
YEAH AND I MEAN I FEEL A LOT OF MALADJUSTED ADULTS AND I BET IF WE TRACE BACK TO THEIR .
EARLY CHILDHOOD WE COULD SEE SOME YOU KNOW TIMES THEY DID NT GET TO PLAY OR BE WITH OTHER KIDS THEIR OWN AGE REALLY LEARN HOW DO GET ALONG WITH .
YEP .

UHHUH .
AND NEVER ALWAYS BEING A BIT SNIPPY AND SPITEFUL I BET YOU COULD TRACE ALL THE WAY BACK .
I BET YOU COULD TOO .

THAT S RIGHT .
SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
YEP AND JUST TO SAVE YOU TRIPS TO AND FROM .
RIGHT EXACTLY .
YOU KNOW UH BALL GAMES AND ATHLETIC EVENTS .
RIGHT .
AND ACTIVITIES AT THE SCHOOL .
THAT S RIGHT .
YEAH IS NT THAT SOMETHING HOW YOU KNOW YOU THINK ABOUT CHILD CARE AND IT LASTS ALONG TIME .
IT DOES FOR EVER .
IT IT LASTS A LONG TIME .
AND THEN WHEN YOU GET THROUGH WITH YOUR OWN YOU VE GOT GRANDCHILDREN SO .
IT S NOT ENDING IS IT YOU THINK WE VE TALKED A LONG A LONG ENOUGH TIME .
WELL NORMALLY THEY COME IN UH .
OH THEY COME IN SEE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I VE DONE THIS .
OH OH CAUSE THEY LL COME IN IN TEN MINUTES NORMALLY AND STOP US .
OH IN TEN MINUTES YOU HAVE TO TALK THAT LONG .
WELL YOU DO NT HAVE TO BUT THEY .
UHHUH .
THEY UM YOU GO THE LENGTH AND SOMETIMES IF IT S A VERY BUSY TIME PERIOD YOU LL GO ABOUT SEVEN MINUTES .
OH .
DEPENDS ON HOW OLD THE TAPES ARE AT THAT TIME .
I SEE .
UHHUH .
I SEE .
YEAH .
ARE YOU FROM THE WHERE ARE YOU FROM .
THIS IS BALTIMORE MARYLAND .
OH MY GOSH I M FROM UH PLANO TEXAS WHICH IS WHICH IS OUTSIDE OF DALLAS .
YEAH WELL MOST OF MOST OF THE PEOPLE I TALK TO ARE FROM TEXAS .
YEAH BECAUSE THAT S WHERE T I IS .
UHHUH YEAH AND I VE DISCUSSED .
THAT MAKES SENSE .
I VE DISCUSSED UM .
OKAY .
ALL RIGHT .
UH DO YOU HAVE ANY FRIENDS .
THAT HAVE CHILDREN .
I DO HAVE FRIENDS .
THAT HAVE CHILDREN YES .
AND WHAT DO THEY SAY ABOUT FINDING ADEQUATE CHILD CARE .
THEY .
I THINK THAT MAY BE THE KEY WORD .
I THINK THAT S CORRECT .
THERE UH RELATIVELY NONEXISTENT FROM UH FROM WHAT .
I HEAR FROM MY FRIENDS .
IT SEEMS LIKE UH EVEN WHEN THEY HAVE CONSULTED DAY CARE CENTERS .
THAT ARE QUOTE UNQUOTE REPUTABLE THAT ARE SORT OF LIKE A CHAIN IF I CAN USE THAT WORD .
RIGHT .
UH STILL YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE PEOPLE .
THAT YOU KNOW HAPPEN TO BE OPERATING IT LOCALLY AND UH IT S JUST A MATTER OF OF TRUST YOU KNOW I THINK THEY FEEL THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE UM UNDER QUALIFIED BASICALLY AND UNDERPAID AND I THINK THAT SORT OF GOES HAND IN HAND SO IT S IT S DIFFICULT FOR THEM .
WELL WE CERTAINLY FOUND THAT TO BE TRUE .
HUHUH .
UH INDEED WE VE OUR CHILDREN ARE NOW ELEVEN AND NINE .
HUHUH .
AND WE MOVED AWAY FROM INSTITUTIONALIZED CHILD CARE .
HUHUH .
IF WE CAN CALL THOSE CHAIN KIND OF THINGS .
RIGHT .
LIKE THAT .
UH BY THAT NAME .
RIGHT .
AND FOUND THAT UH MORE CREATIVE AVENUES WERE THE RIGHT ANSWER FOR US .
HUHUH .
HUHUH .
UH AT ONE POINT IN TIME .
WE VE HAD AU PAIRS .
HUHUH .
BY TRADING SERVICES WITH THEM .
HUHUH .
AND THAT WORKED FOR A WHILE BUT THEY WERE REALLY ADEQUATE ONES WERE REALLY TOUGH TO FIND .
I M SURE THAT S TRUE .
IT TAKES THAT MIXTURE OF A VERY MATURE COLLEGE STUDENT .
HUHUH .
WHO WANTS TO DO SOMETHING AND YET IS WILLING TO GIVE THE TIME .
RIGHT .
AND THE INTEREST TO THE CHILDREN .
RIGHT .
I DO HAVE A FRIEND THAT UH UH SHE AND HER ROOMMATE BECAME LIVEIN CARE GIVERS AND THEY LOVED IT .
THEY HAD STAYED WITH THIS FAMILY FROM THE TIME THESE CHILDREN WERE SMALL YOU KNOW FOUR OR FIVE YEARS OLD UP UNTIL THEY WERE WELL INTO GRADE SCHOOL .
AND UH SHE WAS PAID VERY WELL BECAUSE THEY THE PARENTS TRUSTED THEM AND THEY YOU KNOW HAD DONE SUCH A GOOD JOB .
SO UM I CAN SEE WHERE SOMEONE YOU KNOW IN A POSITION LIKE THAT IN A LIVEIN CAPACITY WOULD DEFINITELY BE THE WAY TO GO IF YOU RE YOU RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE THE FINANCIAL MUMBLEX TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT .
WELL THAT S TRUE .
YEAH .
AND THAT S SOMETHING THAT WE RE STRUGGLING WITH NOW .
YEAH .
I THINK IT S JUST A MATTER OF PRIORITIES .
IT .
S UH YOU KNOW IT S A TERRIBLE THING TO SAY WHEN YOUR SPEAKING OF CHILDREN IN THAT WAY BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO BE REALISTIC AS WELL I THINK .
OH YEAH .
YEAH .
MUMBLEX .
YEAH .
MUCH AS OTHER CULTURES DISAGREE OUR LIVES DO NT REVOLVE AROUND OUR CHILDREN .
YEAH .
YEAH .
AND THAT S THAT S THAT S BAD TO HAVE TO ADMIT TOO BUT UH YOU KNOW IT S JUST THERE S SO MUCH PRESSURE WHEN YOU RE TALKING ABOUT TWO PEOPLE .
THAT WORK OUTSIDE THE HOME AND AND I THINK THAT IS ONE REASON WHY I CONTINUE TO BE WITHOUT CHILDREN .
I IT S JUST SUCH A RESPONSIBILITY AND AND WHEN I VE HAD FRIENDS .
THAT HAVE SAID WHEN YOU HEAR PEOPLE SAY IT IT ALTERS YOUR LIFE FOREVER PLEASE TAKE HEED WELL I REALIZE THAT S TRUE SO IT S UH SUCH A RESPONSIBILITY .
WELL IT CERTAINLY IS .
UH IF I CAN MUMBLEX THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN FOR A MOMENT .
HUHUH .
IT IS SUCH AN HONOR AND A THRILL .
OH YEAH .
TO BE A PARENT .
HUHUH .
THAT MOST OF THE TIME IT S WORTH IT .
YEAH .
MOST OF THE TIME .
WELL I JUST HAVE TO BE HONEST ABOUT IT .
IT S NOT ALWAYS .
YEAH .
OH SURE .
WORTH .
IT .
SURE .
SURE .
SURE .
THERE ARE THOSE TIMES WHEN I THINK GEE IF I DID NT HAVE CHILDREN I COULD BE OUT PLAYING BRIDGE OR GOLF .
RIGHT .
RIGHT .
RIGHT .
RIGHT .
BUT YOU KNOW IT S FUNNY .
I DID I HAD A FRIEND .
THAT SAID YOU KNOW BEFORE WE ALWAYS SAID WE DO NT WANT CHILDREN BECAUSE WE CA NT GO OFF ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT OR THIS OR THAT AND THE OTHER AND SHE GOT OLDER AND SHE SAID BUT YOU KNOW WE NEVER DO THOSE THINGS ANYWAY .
SO WHY WHY AM .
I WAITING YOU KNOW IT S IT S JUST THE WAY YOUR ATTITUDE CHANGES AND YOU MATURE I SUPPOSE .
BUT THE THING ABOUT THE CHILD CARE I YOU KNOW I HAVE FRIENDS .
THAT STRUGGLE FINANCIALLY AND AND THEY .
BOTH DO HAVE TO WORK .
IT S A MATTER NOT NECESSARILY UH THAT SHE MIGHT WANT TO STAY HOME OR HE AS WELL BUT YOU KNOW THEY NEED THE MONEY .
AND UH WHEN I SEEN SOME OF MY FRIENDS .
THAT HAVE TAKEN THAT SIX WEEK OLD BABY YOU KNOW TO SOMEONE ELSE IT S JUST I CAN IMAGINE HOW EMOTIONAL .
IT MUST BE .
AND AND YOU KNOW MULTIPLIED BY THE FACT THAT YOU DO NT REALLY TRUST THE PERSON OR YOU RE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE SITUATION MUMBLEX AS FAR AS CHILD CARE UM IT S JUST A SCARY THING .
WELL WE WERE LUCKY WHEN OUR CHILDREN WERE THAT AGE AND HAVING LIVED IN A COMMUNITY FOR A WHILE AND WE KNEW THE PERSON TO WHOM .
WE WERE ENTRUSTING OUR CHILDREN .
HUHUH .
THAT S A BIG PLUS .
AND FELT THAT THAT MUMBLEX .
RIGHT .
AND FEELING OF SAFETY .
RIGHT .
AND WERE LEAVING THEM MUMBLEX SMALL CHILDREN .
HUHUH .
BUT WE ALSO LEARNED SOMETHING FROM THAT EXPERIENCE AS OUR CHILDREN GOT OLDER .
YEAH .
IT .
S THAT CARE GIVERS ARE NOT OMNISCIENT .
HUHUH .
THEY ARE NOT ALL THINGS TO ALL PEOPLE .
RIGHT .
OR ALL CHILDREN .
RIGHT .
RIGHT .
YEAH .
THE ONES .
THAT ARE GOOD WITH BABIES TEND NOT TO BE GOOD WITH TODDLERS .
HUHUH .
HUHUH .
I THINK IT TAKES A I DO NT KNOW I THINK YOUR PATIENT LEVEL MUST NEEDS TO INCREASE AS THE CHILD GETS OLDER .
I THINK THAT MIGHT BE PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH SOME PEOPLE .
YOU KNOW TAKING CARE OF A BABY I KNOW IS NOT AN EASY THING BUT WHEN YOU HAVE THEM IN THEIR THEIR LITTLE FEET ARE MOVING AND YOU HAVE TO CHASE THEM DOWN CONSTANTLY .
I M SURE THAT S A WHOLE NEW BALL GAME .
OH YEAH .
YEAH I HAVE A NINE YEAR OLD THAT I WOULD TRADE HAPPILY FOR A BABY MUMBLEX .
OH REALLY .
WELL YOU SOUND LIKE YOUR PRETTY WELL PASSED THE WORST OF IT AS FAR AS WORRYING ABOUT SINCE THEY RE BOTH IN SCHOOL YOU DO NT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT A FULLTIME PERSON TO TAKE CARE OF THEM .
OH YOU DO NT KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THEY GET IN SCHOOL .
THAT S SOMETHING ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT UH .
OH YES .
NOW WE HAVE UH ONE TAKES PIANO LESSONS .

HUHUH YEAH .
AND UH .
AND IT S IT S THE ONE .
THAT S GOING DOWNHILL IS IT IS IT .
THE ONE .
THAT NEEDS NEEDS MORE SUPERVISION .

HOW UNFORTUNATE .
YOU DO NT THINK YOU DO NT THINK THAT GOOD PREVAILS .
WELL I I I M LIVING IN A DREAM WORLD WHAT DO I KNOW .

SHE NEVER HAD TO WORRY ABOUT TAKING ANYBODY TO CHILD CARE BECAUSE THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMEBODY THERE OLDER TO DEAL WITH THEM SO I GUESS THAT S AN ALTERNATIVE .
IF YOU COULD JUST UM .
HAVE ENOUGH .
HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH .
BY THE TIME .
THE YOUNGEST ONES ARE THERE YOU LL HAVE OLDER ONE TO TAKE CARE OF THEM .
THAT S TRUE .
I DO NT KNOW .
WHEN YOU SEE ALL THESE HORROR STORIES ON TELEVISION ABOUT CHILD CARE AND GOSH I JUST I WAS SEEING SOMETHING ON THE TELEVISION EARLIER ABOUT A LITTLE GIRL .
THAT S BEEN TELLING HER MOTHER THESE TERRIBLE STORIES AND OF COURSE PEOPLE ARE DENYING IT .
AND UH IT S JUST FRIGHTENING .
IT REALLY IS .
WELL WHAT WHAT S FRIGHTENING IS A PARENT TO SEE THINGS .
THAT THAT YOU DO NT REALLY DO NT UNDERSTAND .
HUHUH .
HUHUH .
AND THEN YOU DO NT REALLY KNOW WHAT HAPPENED .
YEAH .
WE GAVE UP ON ONE BABY SITTER BECAUSE WE CAME HOME ONE NIGHT AND FOUND PIECES OF UM RIBBON .
HUHUH .

TIED IN A CHAIR .
WHERE OBVIOUSLY SHE HAD HAD .
OKAY IS UH THAT A SPORT YOU LIKE TO PARTICIPATE IN .
NO ACTUALLY I M A SPECTATOR AND I M A SECOND HAND SPECTATOR AS A RESULT OF MY FIRST HUSBAND S OR MY LATE HUSBAND S INTEREST IN GOLF .
UHHUH MY HUSBAND LIKES GOLF ALSO HE S UH I GUESS HE D BE A FANATIC IF HE THOUGHT HE COULD GET AWAY WITH IT .
BUT HE HE LIMITS IT PRETTY GOOD I UM HAVE TRIED TO GO OUT AND PLAY GOLF HE WOULD LOVE IT IF I WOULD GO OUT AND PLAY WITH HIM BUT .

OH SO HE S REALLY INTO IT .
OH YEAH HE WAS A GOOD GOLFER .
WOW .
AND AS AND DID SOME YOU KNOW INSTRUCTIONS AT THE COUNTRY CLUB FOR A WHILE .
OH .
BUT UH GOLF TENDED TO BE SO I AM NOT REALLY DEEPLY INVOLVED IN ANY FOLLOWING ANY OF THE SPORTS .
YEAH .
BUT GOLF WAS ONE THAT I DEVELOPED A WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF A LOT OF THE GOLFERS AND THEREFORE I ENJOYED FOLLOWING THOSE PARTICULAR PLAYERS .
RIGHT MORE BECAUSE OF THEIR PERSONALITIES .
UHHUH .
THAN THEIR SPORTSMAN .
WELL PART OF IT WAS THE PERSONALITY AND THEIR SPORTSMANSHIP ANOTHER PART OF IT WAS I D PICK ONE OUT THAT WAS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT MY HUSBAND WAS ROOTING FOR SO .
YOU KNOW THE COMPETITOR AND I BECAME INVOLVED IN FOLLOWING HIS CAREER .
RIGHT .
AND UH I KNOW THAT THAT MY HUSBAND TOM KITE WAS HIS FAIR HAIRED BOY .
OH .
AND HE THOUGHT HE WAS SPECTACULAR I SAID WHOA I M NOT GOING TO I M NOT GOING TO STAY INTERESTED IN HIM SO I DECIDED ANDY BEAN WAS GOOD COMPETITION .
UHHUH .
ANY TIME THEY BOTH PLAYED WHY HE WAS JUST REAL EXCITED WHEN TOM WAS YOU KNOW SHOWN ON THE TELEVISION .
AND I FOLLOWED ANDY BEAN .
UHHUH .
WE BOTH FOLLOWED LEE TREVINO INTO THE SENIORS .
OH HE S INTERESTING .
HE IS .
I LIKE TO WATCH HIM .
HE IS A CHARACTER .
YEAH .
NOT JUST A GOLFER BUT HE S QUITE A CHARACTER .
YEAH .
AND THERE ARE SOME REALLY REALLY WONDERFUL PEOPLE IN THE GAME OF GOLF WHO DO GIVE WONDERFUL ROLE MODELS .
YEAH YEAH I THINK YOU RE RIGHT .
AND I THINK IT S CRITICAL IT S CRITICAL TO HAVE A GOOD ROLE MODEL .
YEAH .
IN ANY FIELD ANY SPORTS .
I LIKE TO WATCH THOSE SKINS GAMES .
UHHUH .
DO YOU EVER WATCH THOSE WHERE THEY JUST PLAY FOR A CERTAIN AMOU YOU KNOW FOR EACH HOLE THEY WIN THEY GET THE MONEY .
UHHUH .
FOR IT I THINK THOSE ARE PRETTY EXCITING .
WELL I MYSELF REALLY HAVE NOT SEEN A WHOLE LOT OF POINT TO THE GAME OF GOLF YOU HIT A LITTLE BALL .
YOU CHASE IT YOU GO FIND IT AND THEN YOU HIT IT AGAIN AND LOSE IT AGAIN .
UHHUH YEAH .
AND I KNOW THE WHOLE POINT IS TO GET IT IN THAT LITTLE BITTY HOLE .
BUT SEEMS TO ME LIKE IF THEY MADE THE HOLE BIGGER IT D BE EASIER .
OH REALLY .
I SOMETIMES WONDER WHY MEN LIKE IT SO MUCH BECAUSE THEY GET SO FRUSTRATED .
OH I KNOW .
AND MAD AT THEMSELVES .
OH YEAH .
WHEN THEY DO NT DO WELL MY HUSBAND AND HIS BUDDIES ARE NOT VERY GOOD THEY PLAY LIKE MAYBE ONCE A MONTH OR LESS .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND SO THEY ALL HIT LIKE IN THE LOW NINETIES AND THEY THINK THEY RE HAVING A REALLY GOOD GAME .
OH YEAH .
SO .
WELL MY HUSBAND S AVERAGE RAN IN THE MID SEVENTIES .
WOW .
SO HE WAS NT BAD .
YEAH THAT IS GOOD .
HE WAS PRETTY GOOD BUT AS FAR AS INFLUENCING YOUNG PEOPLE I THINK THAT THAT IS UH THAT IS ONE OF THE SPORTS THAT YOU CAN CARRY INTO OLD AGE YOU CA NT PLAY FOOTBALL AT FIFTYFIVE .
RIGHT .
BUT IT IS A GOOD HEALTHY WHOLESOME LIFESTYLE UH ANYTHING CAN BE WARPED .
YEAH .
BUT I THINK THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE SPORTS THAT S A GOOD HEALTHY WAY TO TO MOVE INTO MATURITY .
UHHUH .
SAFELY .
SOMETHING TO STAY ACTIVE AT .
UHHUH UHHUH .
FOR A LONG TIME .
THAT S RIGHT THAT S RIGHT .
YEAH YEAH .
AND A LOT OF SENIORS A LOT OF ELDERLY PEOPLE DO NT EVEN TAKE UP GOLF UNTIL THEY RE YOU KNOW IN THEIR LATER YEARS .
YEAH AND THEY CAN STILL GET GOOD AT IT .
THAT S RIGHT THAT S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND IT S SOMETHING THAT .
WELL MAYBE THAT S WHAT I LL DO WHEN I HAVE TIME LATER ON .
YEAH WHEN YOU RE TOO OLD TO DO ANYTHING ELSE .
YEAH .
GO PLAY GOLF YEAH BUT IT S IT S ALSO SOMETHING THAT HUSBAND AND WIFE CAN PARTICIPATE IN .
UHHUH .
OR YOU CAN BOTH ENJOY THE SAME SPORT AND PARTICIPATE IN SEPARATE CIRCLES .
TRUE .
YOU KNOW YOU CAN GO TO THE COUNTRY CLUB TOGETHER YOU CAN PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS HE CAN PLAY WITH HIS FRIENDS BUT YOU VE BOTH BEEN OUT AND EXERCISED AND YOU HAVE ENJOYED THE DAY .
RIGHT YEAH OR MY FAVORITE JUST RIDE AROUND IN THE CART WITH HIM .
YOU BET YOU GET A LOT OF EXERCISE THAT WAY .
GO SOMEWHERE REALLY NICE LIKE HAWAII AND JUST .
UHHUH WELL I LL TELL YOU WHAT IF .
LOOK AT THE GOLF COURSE .
IF THEY RE NOT REAL GOOD GOLFERS SOMETIMES IT IS NOT FUN TO RIDE AROUND AND LISTEN TO THEIR EXCLAMATIONS ALL DAY LONG .
OH YEAH BUT MY HUSBAND S PRETTY TOLERANT SO HE S NOT TOO BAD .
UHHUH .
TO WATCH .
OH MINE HAD A VERY SHORT FUSE IF HE DID SOMETHING BAD HE S LIABLE TO TAKE THAT CLUB AND THROW IT AS FAR AS HE CAN THROW IT .
OH NO YEAH .
HE S REPLACED ALMOST AS MANY CLUBS AS HE HAS BALLS I MEAN JUST GET SO MAD HE D JUST WHAM THAT CLUB UP AGAINST A TREE AND BREAK THAT RASCAL .
GOSH NOW MY HUSBAND HAS A TEMPER BUT HE DOES NT SEEM TO SHOW IT ON THE GOLF COURSE HE S BECAUSE HE LL TALK ABOUT THE OTHER GUYS HE PLAYS WITH DOING THAT .

UHHUH WELL I SHOT IN THE HUNDREDS BUT I MADE THIS ONE GOOD ONE .
YEAH THIS ONE ON THIS ONE HOLE .
DID YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO LONG STORIES ABOUT NOW ON THE SEVENTEENTH HOLE I HIT IT AND WENT THIS WAY .
UHHUH .
THOSE ARE IT S HARD FOR ME TO .
ACT NICE ABOUT THAT WHEN IT GOES ON AND ON .
WELL ONE THING THAT IS A IS A DRAWBACK ABOUT IT I THINK IS THE COST .
YES .
MEMBERSHIP IN THE CLUBS IS EXPENSIVE THE EQUIPMENT IS VERY EXPENSIVE REQUIRES SPECIAL SHOES REQUIRES SPECIAL YOU KNOW SPECIAL EQUIPMENT THERE S SO MANY .
RIGHT AND THEN THEY WANT TO PLAY ANOTHER COURSE THAT S NOT THEY RE NOT A MEMBER OF .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND OTHER FEES .
THAT S RIGHT THAT S RIGHT .
IT REALLY IS HIGH .
IT CAN GET VERY EXPENSIVE AND I CAN IMAGINE WHAT KIND OF COSTS ARE INVOLVED IF YOU RE GOING TO TRY TO GO PRO BECAUSE YOU SPEND HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS .
OH YEAH .
PRACTICING .
YEAH .
AND THEY DO NT GIVE THOSE SESSIONS AWAY .
AND NOR DO THEY GIVE UH INSTRUCTIONS AWAY .
RIGHT .
AS A MATTER OF FACT A FRIEND OF MINE ASKED ME IF I THOUGHT I D BE INTERESTED IN GOLF I SAID I DO NT KNOW I LL HAVE TO TRY IT AND SEE I VE ALWAYS WATCHED IT .
UHHUH .
AND HE SAID WELL FINE HE SAID WE LL JUST TAKE YOU OVER TO THE COURSE HE LIVES NEAR BROOKHAVEN .

I VE BECOME KIND OF THE P C GURU IN OUR AUDIT DEPARTMENT BECAUSE IT S MOSTLY FINANCIAL AUDITORS WITH AN ACCOUNTING BACK GROUND .
HUHUH .
AND THERE S THREE OF US .
E D P AUDITORS AND ONE OF THE THREE OF US HAS AN ACCOUNTING BACKGROUND AND SO SHE S NOT REAL PROFICIENT IN P C S AND THE OTHER JUST HAS .

EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT .
THEY RE DOING AND I M THE ADMINISTRATOR FOR OUR LOCAL AREA NETWORK .
AND I NEED TO KEEP THAT GOING AND .
HUHUH .
SO I I M I COULD NT LIVE MY LIFE WITHOUT A P C .
I DO NT HAVE ONE AT HOME .
WE HAVE ONE AT HOME BUT I JUST DO NT FIND THE TIME THAT I CAN USE IT .
YEAH .
RIGHT NOW I WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE ONE AT HOME BECAUSE I WOULD WORK AT HOME .
YES .
UM WE VE GOT A COUPLE OF PORTABLE LAP TOP P C S AT THE OFFICE THAT I END UP BRINGING ONE OF THEM .
HOME .
A LOT .
HUHUH .
TO DO WORK .
IF I HAD A MACHINE ALREADY INSTALLED AT HOME .
I WOULD PROBABLY WORK JUST ABOUT EVERY NIGHT .
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I GOT MINE WAS BEFORE I WENT ON MATERNITY LEAVE THEY DID NT KNOW HOW THEY WERE GOING TO DO WITHOUT ME AT WORK BECAUSE I AM PRETTY MUCH THE LIKE YOU SAID THE GURU .
YEAH .
IN THE OFFICE WITH THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND MUMBLEX ANY TROUBLE SHOOTING THAT THERE IS .
HUHUH .
AND UM SO THEY DID NT KNOW HOW IT WAS GOING TO WORK THEY KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE TO GET A MODEM SO THAT WE COULD MUMBLEX IN THE DECKS MACHINE SO THAT WE COULD IN MY HOME SO THAT WE COULD MAKE IT THROUGH THIS EIGHT WEEKS OR SO .
YEAH .
BUT UH YOU KNOW IT S UH IT S ALMOST LIKE WE COULD BECOME TOO DEPENDENT ON THEM .
YEAH .
AND OH I WE USE A LOT OF FREE LANCE .
HUHUH .
AND UH THAT S UH PRETTY MUCH TAKES UP A LOT OF OUR DAY SO FOR AS PRODUCING TRANSPARENCIES AND THINGS .
YEAH .
AND UM IT UH COMPARED TO THE WAY .
THE THINGS HAVE UPGRADED .
RIGHT .
HAVE UH REALLY WHAT S THE WORD .
I M LOOKING FOR I M JUST TOTALLY DRAWING A BLANK .
BUT UH THE WAY THINGS HAVE CHANGED OVER THE YEARS WITH THE P C AND THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS IS JUST GREAT .
IT S REMARKABLE THE THINGS WE CAN DO NOW AND COMPARED TO YOU KNOW A FEW YEARS .
YEAH .
JUST THE POWER I M I M TRYING TO UH GET AN UPDATED MACHINE .
MINE UH IS JUST PUTTING ALONG .
AND IT S NOT FAST ENOUGH FOR A NEW FOUR EIGHTY SIX CHIP BUT UH .
YEAH .
I DO NT KNOW IF MY BOSS WILL SPRING FOR IT .
BUT I M DETERMINED TO BRAKE MINE SO HE HAS TO GET ME .
ANOTHER ONE .
WE THINK ABOUT THAT A LOT .
YEAH .
WELL THAT S WHAT .
I DO .
WE HAD A PRINTER A HEWLETT PACKARD READY WRITER .
HUHUH .
AND WE HAD ABOUT TEN PEOPLE SHARING THIS PRINTER BY IT WAS ATTACHED TO LIKE A CENTRAL P C AND YOU HAD TO TAKE YOUR DISKETTE TO THE P C TO PRINT SOMETHING .
UM NOW THAT S AWFUL .
SO THE FIRST THING WHEN I STARTED WORKING AT THIS BANK IS I SAID WELL NOW FIRST OF ALL .
WE NEED TO ALL BE ABLE TO SHARE THIS P C WITHOUT GETTING UP .
SO I TALKED MY BOSS INTO INVESTING IN A IT S NOT A UH A UH REAL ELABORATE LOCAL AREA NETWORK .
HUHUH .
BUT WE CAN SHARE THE PRINTER AND WE CAN UH SEND FILES TO EACH OTHER .
OKAY .
AND WE CAN MAIL SEND MAIL MESSAGES TO EACH OTHER .
OH OKAY .
WHICH IS GOOD ENOUGH IT S WHAT .
WE NEED .
RIGHT .
AND THEN I TALKED THEM INTO BUYING A H P LASER JET .
OH YES .
AND THAT WAS A MAJOR ORDEAL TO GET HIM TO BUY IT .
BUT ONCE HE BOUGHT IT HE HAS BEEN SO PLEASED .
IT S IT S FAST IT S QUITE OH IT HAS GOOD COPY .
RIGHT .
THE COPY THAT YOU CAN MUMBLEX WITH ONE OF THOSE AS COMPARED TO ONE OF THOSE DOT MATRIX PRINTERS .
YEAH .
I VE GOT A LITTLE LITTLE UH I B M PRO PRINTER ON MY DESK .
YEAH .
BUT AND I CAN USE EITHER .
THE PRO PRINTER OR I VE GOT MY P C CONFIGURED TO WHERE I CAN USE EITHER PRINTER .
THE ONE .
THAT S ON THE NETWORK OR MY OWN .
HUHUH .
SO IF I JUST NEED SOMETHING REAL QUICK AND I DO NT FEEL LIKE GETTING UP AND GOING AND GETTING WHAT .
I PRINTED I CAN JUST PRINT IT IN MY OFFICE .
UM WE RE JUST TRYING TO TALK OURS INTO GETTING A LASER PRINTER .
YEAH .
AND UH IT S JUST SO THE BUDGET RESTRAINTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT IT S MAKES IT DIFFICULT AND UH .
THEY HAVE GOTTEN REALLY CHEAP .
HEWLETT PACKARD MAKES IT S ACTUALLY A DOT MATRIX PRINTER .
HUHUH .
BUT THE QUALITY IS ALMOST LASER QUALITY .
OH HUHUH .
AND I THINK IT S CALLED THE DESK JET AND THEY RE YOU UNDERSTAND I THINK THEY RE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS NOW .
AND WE UH GOT A QUOTE ON SOME LASER PRINTERS .
THE OTHER DAY AT SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS .
OH REALLY .
YEAH I DO NT REMEMBER WHAT KIND .
THEY WERE BUT UH WE DO A LOT OF TRANSPARENCIES .
HUHUH .
SOMETIMES THE COLOR WOULD TAKE TOO LONG TO PLOT OUT .
YEAH .
SO THEY JUST WANT BLACK AND WHITE WHICH MUMBLEX SEE WE CAN JUST RUN THEM THROUGH THE LASER PRINTER REAL QUICK .
YEAH .
BECAUSE IT WILL ONLY TAKE A MINUTE TO PRINT ONE OF THOSE OUT AND THEN RUN A THERMAL COPY OF IT .
YEAH .
BUT UH IT UH .
SO THAT S ALL .
YOU NEED FOR LIKE MUMBLEX CHARTS AND STUFF .
YOU DO NT NEED THEM IN FOUR COLORS .
NO HUHUH .
IF IT WAS A CUSTOMER PRESENTATION THEN THAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT .
YEAH .
WE WOULD WANT TO RAZZLEDAZZLE A BIT .
BUT UH IT S UH YEAH .
WE HAVE ONE IN THE OFFICE AND IF WE WANT WELL IN OUR AREA IF WE WANT TO USE IT WE HAVE TO YOU KNOW LIKE YOU SAID YOU HAD TO CHANGE IT PUT IT ON A DISC .
AND CARRY IT OVER TO THERE AND SEE IF THEY RE NOT USING THE PRINTER .
YOU USE THE SNEAK SYSTEM .
RIGHT .
YEAH .
AND UH WAIT FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO USE IT .
YEAH WE .
YOU D HAVE TO JUST SIT AND WAIT WHILE SOMEONE ELSE WAS USING THE PRINTER .
HUHUH .
UNTIL THEY GOT OFF THE MACHINE .
I KNOW I KNOW I UNDERSTAND .
THAT WAS I WAS AMAZED WHEN I CAME TO WORK I WORKED AT THE UH WELL IT USED TO BE THE LARGEST BANK IN SAN ANTONIO UNTIL N C N B CAME UP AND BOUGHT THE RIVAL AND NOW N C N B .
HUHUH .
AND NOW N C N B S GOT A LITTLE LARGER MARKET SHARE BUT IT S THE ONLY UH WELL IT S PART OF THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY AND THAT BANK HOLDING COMPANY OF THE TEN LARGEST BANKING HOLDING COMPANIES IN TEXAS .
IT S THE ONLY ONE .
THAT S STILL ALIVE .
OH HUHUH .
ANY WAY I WORK IN A BIG PRESTIGIOUS PLACE .
RIGHT .
AND I COULD NT BELIEVE WHEN I WALKED IN THE DOOR ON MY FIRST DAY AND HERE S THE AUDIT DEPARTMENT OF THIS THIS HUGE HOLDING COMPANY SHARING A H P RUGGED WRITER .
I WAS GOING OH WAIT A MINUTE .
COME ON GUYS THIS IS CRUMMY .
SO HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO EXPECT TO STAY NUMBER ONE WHEN YOU RE BEHIND THE TIMES IN TECHNOLOGY .
YEAH YEAH .
WE RE PUSHING REAL HARD THOUGH .
WE RE WE RE TRYING WELL SEE THE ENTIRE BANK IS NOT LIKE THAT .
WE THE THE BANK PHILOSOPHY IS ONE OF INNOVATION AND .
HUHUH .
LEAD THE MARKET .
IT S JUST THE AUDIT DEPARTMENT HAPPENED TO BE JUST A LITTLE BEHIND THE TIMES BECAUSE THE UH THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OVER AUDITS IS CHEAP .
HUHUH .
AND IT S REAL HARD TO PRY MONEY OUT OF HIM TO TO DO THESE THINGS BUT I WAS I WAS ABLE TO CONVINCE HIM THAT IT WOULD BE COST EFFECTIVE AND THAT OUR BOARD PRESENTATIONS WOULD BE MUCH BETTER AND .
RIGHT .
UM .
WE FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE SOMETIMES OR HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHEN UH WE WORK FOR A COMPUTER COMPANY AND UH HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO PRESENT THE IMAGINE THAT WE RE SUPPOSED TO PRESENT WITH EQUIPMENT .
THAT S OUTDATED .
YEAH .
THAT S OBSOLETE AND THE GUYS THAT SOME OF THE GUYS .
THAT RUN THIS PLACE ARE VERY TIGHT AND IT S LIKE WELL WHY DO WE NEED THIS CA NT YOU DO THAT WITH YOU KNOW WHAT .
WE HAVE AND WHEN WE TRY AND THEN THEY COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS DOES NT LOOK GOOD .
YEAH .
UNFORTUNATELY THE THE UH COMPUTER EQUIPMENT AND AND RELATED PERIPHERALS ARE CHANGING AND IMPROVING SO RAPIDLY LIKE FOR INSTANCE WE BOUGHT A .
OKAY WELL HO HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT UH DRUG TESTING .
UM PERSONALLY I DO NT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT UH I THINK UH AS FAR AS UH PROTECTING FELLOW EMPLOYEES PROTECTING THEIR REPUTATION OF THE COMPANY AND THE QUALITY OF WORK THAT THE PEOPLE DO UM IT S JUSTIFIED ON THE OTHER HAND UM I DO AGREE THAT IT S IT S A IT S AN INVASION OF PRIVACY AS FAR AS A PERSON S INVOLVEMENT OUTSIDE OF WORK .
YEAH .
UM I WOULD NEVER I WOULD NEVER HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ANYONE TESTING ME BUT I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE WOULD OBJECT SO I GUESS UH I GUESS UH I M KIND OF MIXED ON IT .
YEAH .
STILL AT THIS POINT .
I AM TOO A LITTLE BIT I MEAN I I DO NT WANT TO BE AROUND PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY ON DRUGS AND THAT SORT OF THING .
UHHUH .
AND AND YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THEY RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE DOING A GOOD JOB AND SO FORTH BUT I DO NT REALLY LIKE HAVING TO DO IT IT .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND I DO NT LIKE THE IDEA OF IT IT S IT S MAKES TOO MUCH OF A BIG BROTHER TYPE OF THING .
THAT S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IT IT UH I GUESS IT ALL COMES DOWN TO UH YOU KNOW A A DEFINITION OF UH HOW MUCH OUT OUTSIDE ACTIVITIES AFFECT YOUR WORK AND UH UH GRANTED YOU KNOW THAT ANY ANY KIND OF DRUG USE ON ON COMPANY PROPERTY AND WHATNOT .
YEAH .
IS IS DEFINITELY NOT ACCEPTABLE UH UH I DO NT THINK ANYBODY WOULD EVER ARGUE THAT .
HUHUH .
OR UH ANY ANY AFTER AFFECTS CARRYING OVER INTO THE WORKDAY BUT UM YOU KNOW I DO NT I M NOT PARTICULARLY CONCERNED WITH WHAT PEOPLE DO UM AFTER THEY LEAVE FOR THE DAY ESPECIALLY IF I DO NT IF I DO NT UH SEE ANY RESULTS OF IT THE NEXT DAY .
YEAH YEAH I THINK SO TOO BUT YOU KNOW IT S ONE OF THOSE THINGS .
WELL IT IT IS IT YOU KNOW ON THE OTHER HAND YOU YOU VE GOT UH YOU VE GOT THE UH THE POSSIBILITY OF PEOPLE OH YOU VE GOT SOME PEOPLE COULD BE ARRESTED FOR UH DRUG USE DRUG DEALINGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND UH IF THEIR IF THEIR EMPLOYERS NAME HITS THE PAPERS AND THAT IT S IT S .
YEAH .
IT S A MARK AGAINST THEM THE COMPANY AND UH YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE WORK THERE WHAT UH .
PLUS I GUESS IF THEY ARE IN PROBLEM ENOUGH TO BE JAILED OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME THEN THE COMPANY HAS LOST WHAT THEY VE PUT INTO THAT EMPLOYEE .
THAT S RIGHT THAT S RIGHT .
AND THEIR EXPERTISE OR WHATEVER .
RIGHT E EVEN IF IT IS YOU KNOW A COMPANY POLICY OF UH IMMEDIATE TERMINATION OR WHATEVER THEY STILL HAVE TO REPLACE THEM .
YEAH .
AND UH THERE S THERE S A LOT INVOLVED THERE .
WELL DO YOU THINK THAT UM IT SHOULD BE LIKE WE HAVE THIS SORT OF RANDOM SPOT TESTING TYPE OF THING OR DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE MORE PALATABLE IF WE HAD SOME SORT OF REGULAR SCHEDULE OR WOULD THAT JUST ALLOW EVERYBODY A CHANCE TO GET OUT OF IT .
I THINK I THINK THE REGULAR SCHEDULE STUFF UM THAT WHEN YOU SAY EVERYBODY GET OUT OF IT THAT S A GOOD POINT I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT OF IT THAT WAY .
WELL YOU KNOW IF IF THEY HAVE TIME ENOUGH THEY CAN .
YEAH IF THEY REALLY CAN .
STAY OFF OF IT .
UM I THINK THE BIG THE BIGGEST PROBLEM I VE GOT IS IS FORCING IT ON SOMEONE AFTER THEY VE ALREADY AGREED TO THE TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT .
YEAH .
UM AS FAR AS THE NEW HIRES I I HIRED ON JUST EARLY ENOUGH THAT I I MISSED IT UM WHERE THE NEW HIRES WERE CONCERNED BUT UH NOT NOBODY NO I DO NT THINK ANYBODY QUESTIONS THAT UM TESTING SOMEONE AS A AS A PRECONDITION TO BEING HIRED BUT UM FOR THE CONDITIONS THAT FOR OUR EMPLOYMENT TO CHANGE WHILE YOU RE ON THE JOB THAT S I I DO NT KNOW THAT THAT S WHERE I THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE GET UPSET IT S UH YOU KNOW IT IT S CHANGING THE RULES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME BASICALLY AND UH .
YEAH .
IT S JUST IT IT S A REALLY TOUGH QUESTION AND IT YOU KNOW IT PEOPLE HAVE HAVE REALLY QUIETED DOWN AFTER EVERYTHING STARTED BUT I STILL THINK THERE S A LOT OF THERE S A LOT OF RESENTMENT .
I THINK SO TOO UH I KNOW THE THE GROUP I WAS IN AT THE TIME THIS ALL CAME UP THEY UH WERE QUITE VOCAL ABOUT IT THROUGH ELECTRONIC MAIL BOY THEY JUST REALLY .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW LET THEM HAVE IT FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER .
YOU BET .
VEHEMENTLY BUT UH IT HAS QUIETED DOWN BUT I DO NT THINK THEY PROBABLY FEEL ANY DIFFERENTLY .
NO THAT S RIGHT .
AND SOME SOME OF THEM DID QUIT THE COMPANY .
YEAH I I KNOW OF SOME PEOPLE WHO DID UH IT WAS IT WAS INDIRECTLY RELATED YOU KNOW THEY COULD ALWAYS COME UP WITH OTHER REASONS BUT IT IT HAD A LOT TO DO WITH IT JUST THE THE WHOLE ATTITUDE BECAUSE IT S REALLY UH IT S JUST REALLY IT IT SEEMS SO UN T I YOU KNOW WITH THE THE WHOLE RELAXED ATMOSPHERE THAT WE HAVE .
TRUE .
UM TO ALL OF A SUDDEN UH SEARCH FOR MUMBLEX ATTITUDES AND WHATNOT YOU KNOW THERE S NOT A LOT OF PRESSURE TO TO VOTE THE RIGHT WAY OR ANYTHING ELSE AROUND T I LIKE THERE LIKE THERE IS IN SOME COMPANIES OR AT LEAST YOU KNOW FROM WHAT I VE HEARD .
UHHUH .
BUT UH YEAH .
YEAH I WOULD NT LIKE ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE YOU KNOW .
UHHUH NO I .
DO NT TELL ME WHAT TO DO YOU KNOW .
ABSOLUTELY NOT YOU KNOW IT S IT S IT S YOU KNOW IF YOU HIRED ME I LL BE YOU KNOW SUPPOSEDLY YOUR GRADE WAS A LITTLE MAJORITY OF MY VIEWS AND MY QUALIFICATIONS TO BEGIN WITH SO UH YOU KNOW LET S LET S STICK WITH THAT ORIGINAL TRUST I GUESS .
YEAH .
BUT UH IT S IT S STILL IT IT STILL REMAINS A TOUGH QUESTION AND IT S THERE S A LOT OF YOU KNOW THE WHOLE THE WHOLE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE UH REASONING BEHIND THE ORIGINAL PLAN AND WHATNOT THERE S A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT UH COME INTO PLAY BUT THAT WAS I THINK EVERYBODY EVERYBODY PRETTY MUCH KNOWS THAT THAT WAS KIND OF A SMOKE SCREEN TO IMPLEMENT IT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE COMPANY .
YEAH WELL I GUESS TOO IF I THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD HELP REALLY AND TRULY DO AWAY WITH THE DRUG PROBLEM THEN THAT WOULD BE ONE THING .
UHHUH .
BUT I THINK IT S TOO MINOR AND TOO YOU KNOW IN IN THE WHOLE SCOPE OF THINGS THIS IS NT GOING TO TO HAVE ANY REAL AFFECT ON .
I REALLY DO NT THINK SO .
WHAT S GOING ON IN THE STREET .
YEAH I REALLY DO NT BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING TO ARE ARE GOING TO RISK IT UM IT MAY PREVENT E I I GUESS I GUESS WHAT I M TRYING TO GET AT IS IF IT IF IT IF IT DOES HELP A FEW INDIVIDUALS MAYBE MAYBE IT S WORTH IT .
YEAH .
UM YOU KNOW IT MAY PREVENT SOMEBODY WHO WAS WAS TEETERING ON THE EDGE OF EXPERIMENTING OR WHATNOT BUT UH I DO NT KNOW IF YOU KNOW THE IT S IT S A NEEDS OF THE FEW AND THE NEEDS OF THE MANY TYPE SITUATION I DO NT KNOW IF EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE TO SACRIFICE QUITE AS MUCH THERE THERE S STILL A BIG QUESTION IN MY MIND THAT THE THE ABSOLUTE REFUSAL TO ACCEPT THE POSSIBILITY OF OF MISTAKES ON THE TESTING .
WELL YES .
IS SOMETHING THAT STILL BOTHERS ME IT IT S .
THAT YES I I THINK THAT COULD BE A BIG PROBLEM YOU KNOW I WOULD JUST BE IRATE IF THEY SAID IT WAS POSITIVE AND I KNEW IT WAS NT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THAT JUST REALLY RUBBED ME THE WRONG WAY .
UHHUH ABSOLUTELY AND THAT I I DO NT KNOW IF UH I DO NT KNOW IF EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS ALL THE IMPLICATIONS ON THAT TOO E EVEN IF YOU YOU KNOW IF YOU TAKE UH A A DRUG THAT WAS PRESC PRESCRIBED FOR YOU BUT THE THE PRESCRIPTION HAS RUN OUT YOU STILL HAD SOME LEFT AND YOU HAPPEN TO TAKE AN EXTRA PENICILLIN WELL PENICILLIN S NOT ON THE LIST BUT YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
YEAH I I THINK YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I M GETTING AT .
YEAH .
IT IT CAN STILL SHOW UP AND IT CAN STILL FLAG AS A POSITIVE AND .
RIGHT .
AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS OBVIOUSLY THAT S NOT THE INTENT .
NO .
AND UH THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT STILL CAN SHOW UP .
I GUESS THE ONE THAT REALLY GOT ME TOO WAS THAT UH LET S SAY YOUR SPOUSE IS ON A PARTICULAR DRUG AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS .
UHHUH .
AND THEN YOU END UP WITH THE SAME PROBLEM AND YOU TAKE THEIR LEFTOVER MEDICINE THAT S NOT ALLOWED .
THAT S RIGHT .
YOU KNOW THAT S THAT S TOTALLY OUT .
THAT S RIGHT I EVEN HAD FRIENDS WHEN I WAS GOING TO COLLEGE WHO WERE IN UH MUMBLEX PHARMACY SCHOOL AND THEY COULD LEGALLY UM PROVIDE MEDICINE TO THEIR FAMILY MENS FRIE FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS CERTAIN MEDICINES WERE WERE LEGAL NOW I I I BELIEVE YOU KNOW ANY OF THE ANY OF THE ONES WE WOULD WE WOULD BE TESTED FOR WOULD NT BE ON THOSE LISTS .
UHHUH .
BUT UH UM THERE WERE CERTAIN THINGS THAT THEY COULD PROVIDE WITHOUT A DOCTORS PRESCRIPTION BASED ON THEIR QUALIFICATIONS AND .
OH THAT S INTERESTING .
THAT CAN HAPPEN BUT UH .
WELL I GUESS WE VE EXHAUSTED THAT ONE .

YEAH BECAUSE IT S MUMBLEX AT SOME POINT IT GOES UP TO THIRTYTHREE PERCENT AND THEN THE PEOPLE THAT MAKE YOU KNOW FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND AND AND HIGHER THAN THAT THEY DO NT HAVE TO PAY AND SOMETIMES THEY HAVE TO PAY EVEN LESS TAXES .

I KNOW AND JUST SOMEHOW IT DOES NT SEEM YOU KNOW AND THEN I YOU MEAN YOU LOOK AT LIKE UH THAT COUNTRY SINGER UH WHAT S HIS NAME WILLIE NELSON .
UHHUH .
I WAS READING ABOUT HIM IN THE PAPER AND I SAID WELL YOU KNOW HE KNEW HE WAS MAKING MONEY SOME HE DID NT LOOK THAT STUPID WHY DID NT HE PAY HIS TAXES YOU KNOW .
RIGHT UHHUH .
IN A WAY IT S ALMOST LIKE HE HAD SO MUCH DEBT THAT UH FILING BANKRUPTCY WAS A WAY TO GET OUT OF ALL OF IT .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW SO DO YOU FILE FEDERAL OR JOINT INCOME TAX OR DO YOU .
I JUST FILE FEDERAL INCOME TAX EVERY YEAR .
AND DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU GET HIT BY YOU KNOW TOO MUCH .
YEAH I JUST GOT DIVORCED SO I M SINGLE AGAIN SO AND YOU KNOW IT S IT S A LOT WORSE FOR SINGLE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY PAY THE SAME AMOUNT AS AS THE PEOPLE THAT MAKE THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY AND THEY RE MARRIED .
UHHUH AND WE RIGHT NOW WE DO NT OWN ANY PROPERTY WE LEASE SO WE RE IN THE SAME WE DO NT HAVE CHILDREN SO WE RE IN THE SAME KIND OF .
UHHUH .
IT S NOT AS BAD AS BEING SINGLE AND DIVORCED BUT IT S SORT OF LIKE IF YOU HAVE LIKE X POINT FIVE CHILDREN AND EARN YOU KNOW YOU KIND OF GET HIT WITH YOU KNOW I I MEAN IT DOES NT EVEN PAY FOR ME TO EARN A GOOD WAGE BECAUSE DOES NT THAT SOUND STUPID .
UHHUH .
BUT I MEAN THERE S ACTUALLY LESS TAX IMPLICATION IF I DO NT WORK FULL TIME COMPARED TO WHAT MY HUSBAND DOES YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
SO IT S KIND OF HARD .
WHOEVER WORKS LESS THEY CAN GET A TAX CREDIT FOR THAT .
EXCUSE ME .
IF BOTH OF THE BOTH OF THE SPOUSES .
UHHUH .
WORK THEN YOU GET A TAX CREDIT FOR THAT .
RIGHT YEAH .
UHHUH .
OTHERWISE YOU RE JUST YOU KNOW AND IF YOU HAVE KIDS YOU GET LIKE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS OR SOMETHING .
WELL IT S TWO THOUSAND NOW .
OH IT IS .
YEAH FOR EVERYBODY .
OH MY .
UHHUH .
WELL THAT S NOT TOO BAD .
THEN YOU GET A YOU GET A CHILD CARE EXEMPTION BUT IT S NOT ENOUGH YOU KNOW I MEAN YOU PAY FROM FIFTY TO A HUNDRED DOLLARS A WEEK IN CHILD CARE .
UHHUH .
AND AND THEY ONLY GIVE YOU LIKE I THINK IT S ABOUT FIVE OR TEN PERCENT OF THAT .
OH MY GOODNESS .
YOU KNOW IT DOES NT EVEN IT S NOT EVEN .
YEAH I GUESS THAT S MY CALL I GUESS I BETTER GO .
OH OKAY .
OKAY WELL IT WAS NICE TALKING TO YOU .
NICE TALKING TO YOU .
UHHUH BYEBYE .
HI WHAT DO YOU DO WITH YOUR CREDIT CARDS .
OH .
WELL MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE GOTTEN INTO SOME SOME PROBLEMS WITH CREDIT CARDS WE DO NT HANDLE THEM VERY WELL .
WE WE TEND TO RUN THEM UP TO THE MAXIMUM AND THEN ASK FOR MORE .
OH JEEZ .
THEY THEY RE THEY RE REALLY BAD FOR US UM MATTER OF FACT WE VE GOTTEN RID OF ALL OF OUR CREDIT CARDS EXCEPT FOR A MASTERCARD AND A VISA .
AND WE PRETTY MUCH KEEP THOSE MAXED OUT .
OH I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT THAT SOUNDS LIKE LIKE PRETTY MANY BUT I SEE WHAT YOU MEANT YOU HAD THEM FOR EACH OF THE INDIVIDUAL STORES .
YEAH WE HAD CRE I HAD PROBABLY TWENTY CREDIT CARDS .
UHHUH UHHUH .
FOR I HAD I HAD AN AMERICAN EXPRESS AMERICAN EXPRESS GOLD AN OPTIMA ALL THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT STORES UM TWO VISAS TWO MASTERCARDS .
OH GEE .
I MEAN I HAD ANY TIME ANYBODY WOULD YOU KNOW SEND ME AN APPLICATION YOU KNOW PREAPPROVED OR WHATEVER I WENT I TOOK IT AND IT REALLY ENDED UP GETTING US IN SOME REAL SERIOUS TROUBLE .
OH SURE .
UM BECAUSE SEE THE MORE CREDIT CARDS YOU HAVE THE MORE PEOPLE OFFER THEM TO YOU .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND THE MORE YOU USE THEM THE MORE THEY SEND THEM TO YOU .
BUT EACH OF THESE HAD AN ANNUAL FEE ALSO RIGHT .
EXACTLY THE AMERICAN EXPRESS WAS PROBABLY THE WORST UM BECAUSE WITH THE GOLD CARD I CA NT REMEMBER HOW MUCH IT WAS BECAUSE I DID NT EVEN HAVE IT VERY LONG BEFORE I GAVE IT UP .
UHHUH .
BUT I KNOW THE GREEN CARD WAS LIKE THIRTYFIVE FORTY FIVE DOLLARS A YEAR .
YEAH FORTY FIVE RIGHT UH I .
WHICH WAS A LOT BECAUSE I MEAN YOU HAD TO PAY IT IN FULL EVERY MONTH .
EXACTLY YOU KNOW I THAT S IT I REALLY RESENTED THE FACT THAT THEY WERE CHARGING ME FOR CARDS SO I SENT BACK ALL OF MINE EXCEPT THE ONES THAT WERE FREE .
UHHUH .
AND UM THEN THEN I ALSO LIMITED IT TO ONE OF EACH ONE MASTERCARD AND ONE VISA AND HERE MOST OF THE STORES WILL ACCEPT THOSE AND ACTUALLY I THEN GOT A DISCOVER CARD SINCE THEY PAY YOU BACK .
UHHUH YEAH I HAD A DISCOVER AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE ONES IN THE GROUP THAT I ENDED UP UM CLOSING UM IT REALLY WAS NT MY CHOICE THOUGH I MEAN I ENDED UP HAVING I ENDED UP ACTUALLY LOSING MY CREDIT CARDS .
OH .
UM I ENDED UP GOING THROUGH A CREDIT COUNSELING SERVICE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
UM BECAUSE MY HUSBAND AND I JUST DO NT HANDLE CREDIT VERY WELL .
UHHUH YEAH .
AND UM WHEN WHEN YOU DO THAT THEY AUTOMATICALLY ONCE YOU START WITH THEIR SERVICE THEY CLOSE YOUR ACCOUNTS OUT .
OH I SEE .
SO I M STILL PAYING ON ALL THESE ACCOUNTS BUT MY ACCOUNTS ARE CLOSED .
YEAH .
SO AND I WOULD PREFER TO KEEP IT THAT WAY ONCE WE ONCE WE RE PAID OFF .
UHHUH .
UM I WOULD PREFER JUST TO HAVE ONE MASTERCARD AND ONE VISA AND THAT S IT .
YEAH YEAH ACTUALLY I PAY OFF MY CARDS EVERY MONTH ONLY ONCE IN MY LIFE HAVE I NOT PAID .
I THINK THAT S A REALLY GOOD WAY TO HANDLE IT BECAUSE THAT WAY IF YOU IF YOU PAID OFF EVERY MONTH YOU NEVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WELL HOW MUCH DO I HAVE TO PAY THESE GUYS YOU KNOW THIS MONTH YOU KNOW THIS YOU BUY WHAT YOU CAN AFFORD I MEAN .
RIGHT .
IF YOU HANDLE IT JUST LIKE YOU WOULD LIKE A CHECK OR CASH .
UHHUH UHHUH .
IT S A LOT EASIER TO KEEP IT IN CHECK .
WELL AND ALSO IN A SENSE THEY RE GIVING YOU A LOAN FOR A MONTH SO THAT .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW IF I WERE SMARTER I WOULD HAVE THAT SAME AMOUNT IN SAVINGS AND GET THE INTEREST WHICH I DO NT .
UHHUH .
DO BUT BUT YEAH THE THE THOUGHT OF ADDING YOU KNOW X PERCENT TO TO THE PRICE OF WHAT I BUY .
YEAH AND I .
I JUST I CA NT ACCEPT .
AND I THINK AT THIS AT THIS POINT IN TIME WITH THE ECONOMY THE WAY IT IS I THINK THAT UM IT S GOING TO GET EVEN WORSE UM I M I M GLAD THAT WE RE STARTING TO PAY OUR DEBTS OFF NOW UM YOU KNOW WE ONLY WE STARTED THIS LAST YEAR .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND WE PROBABLY STILL HAVE ABOUT ANOTHER YEAR TO GO .
UHHUH .
BEFORE WE RE COMPLETELY OUT OF THE HOLE BUT I THINK THIS THEY WAY THE WHOLE ECONOMY IS GOING RIGHT NOW IT S JUST NOT GOOD TO BE IN DEBT .
THAT S RIGHT THAT S RIGHT YEAH YEAH THAT I WOULD THAT WOULD BE A VERY SCARY FEELING FOR ME TO KNOW THAT I WAS YOU KNOW JUGGLING PAYMENTS TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
I GUESS BECAUSE I NEVER EXPERIENCED IT AND IT S NOT BECAUSE YOU KNOW I M RICH OR ANYTHING IT S JUST A MENTAL CONCEPT THAT I HAVE .
YEAH .
YEAH THAT I JUST .
WELL WHEN YOU WHEN YOU RE GETTING RID OF THE WHOLE CREDIT CARD CYCLE AND IF YOU REALLY GET INTO THE MIND SET I GOT REALLY GOOD AT JUGGLING MONEY AND BASICALLY ROBBING PETER TO PAY PAUL AND IT WAS SCARY BECAUSE I WAS SO GOOD AT IT .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND I THOUGHT THIS IS NOT RIGHT I MEAN THIS HAS GOT TO STOP BECAUSE EVENTUALLY IT D END UP CATCHING UP AT CATCHING UP WITH ME AND IT HIT ME IN THE FACE .
RIGHT RIGHT .
UM .
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU KNOW YOU YOU LEARNED FROM IT AND YOU RE COMING OUT OF IT ALL RIGHT .
I YEAH I HAVE I VE LEARNED A LOT FROM IT .
UHHUH .
I VE LEARNED THAT CREDIT CARDS ARE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS IN MY HAND .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND MY HUSBAND S TOO BECAUSE HE S HE S THE SAME WAY I AM .
UHHUH .
I DO NT I DO NT THINK THAT WELL WHEN WE BUY ON CREDIT WE JUST DO NT HAVE A CONCEPT OF HOW MUCH MONEY WE RE SPENDING .
UHHUH .
UNTIL THE BILL COMES IN .
UHHUH .
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU LOOK AT THE BILL AND YOU GO OH MY GOSH I SPENT THIS MUCH .
BUT NOW THE FACT THAT YOU STILL HAVE TWO CARDS ARE YOU DO YOU USE THEM MORE JUDICIOUSLY .
YEAH WE PRETTY MUCH USE THEM FOR EMERGENCY TYPE THINGS LIKE TRANSMISSION FELL OUT ON OUR CAR .
YEAH .
AND THAT PAID FOR A NEW TRANSMISSION .
UHHUH .
UM AND AND THINGS LIKE THAT UM AND WE TRY NOT TO USE THEM FOR .
PURCHASES .
INCIDENTAL TYPE THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW GAS AND STUFF LIKE THAT .
UHHUH UHHUH CLOTHING SALES .
YEAH .
SALES I FIND ARE A PAIN .
YEAH I VE I VE GOTTEN I VE GOTTEN A LOT MORE AWAY FROM FROM CREDIT CARDS AND I PAY BY CHECK A LOT MORE NOW .
UHHUH UHHUH WELL IT SOUNDS GOOD YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU RE YOU VE REALLY GOT IT UNDER CONTROL .
I I ADMIRE YOU FOR HAVING HAVING THAT MIND SET FOR NOT NOT EVEN GETTING YOU KNOW PAST THE THIRTY DAYS I WOULD THAT S IDEALLY THE WHERE WHERE I WOULD LIKE TO BE .
UHHUH UHHUH YEAH AND LIKE I SAID ONCE ONCE IT IT HAPPENED I COULD NT BECAUSE MY SON S TUITION CAME DUE AND I GUESS I HAD YOU KNOW NOT REALLY COUNTED ON IT QUITE AT THAT POINT .
UHHUH .
BUT UM YEAH I DID NT LIKE IT AT ALL I WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE SO .
I CAN IMAGINE .
YOU KNOW AND AND I MEAN IT WAS I THOUGHT A LOT SIXTY DOLLARS INTEREST OR SOMETHING FOR FOR JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS AND I M GOING .
YEAH .
JEEZ THAT S OUTRAGEOUS BUT IN IN YOU KNOW RETROSPECT IT WAS NT ALL THAT MUCH I MEAN A LOT OF PEOPLE PAY A LOT MORE AND .
OH YEAH .
AND YOU KNOW BUT STILL I MEAN I FIGURED I DID NT NEED THOSE ITEMS IF IT COST ME SIXTY DOLLARS MORE TO HAVE THEM .
UHHUH THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN BUY FOR SIXTY DOLLARS .
EXACTLY GROCERIES FOR A WEEK .
YEAH YEAH .
YEAH .
I I THINK ABOUT ALL ALL THE MONEY THAT THAT WE VE SPENT ON INTEREST .
UHHUH .
ON ALL OF OUR CREDIT CARDS AND IT S JUST INCREDIBLE .
BUT NOW DID YOU USE TO NOT FEEL SO BADLY BECAUSE YOU COULD TAKE IT OFF YOUR INCOME TAX .
WE VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO TAKE IT OFF OUR INCOME TAX I M I M FAIRLY NEWLY MARRIED I VE ONLY BEEN MARRIED LESS THAN TWO YEARS .
UHHUH .
AND BEFORE THAT I NEVER OWNED A HOME OR ANYTHING SO I NEVER HAD ANY DEDUCTIONS .
RIGHT RIGHT .
SO REALLY IT WAS ALWAYS JUST MONEY .
THROWN AWAY .

YEAH JEEZ .
AND I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT BECAUSE .
YOU WERE GOOD AT IT .
YEAH I WAS SO GOOD AT IT THAT IT JUST KIND OF GOT STUCK IN THE BACK OF MY MIND AND JUST NEVER .
UHHUH .
UM BECAME A REAL PROBLEM UNTIL ALL OF A SUDDEN IT CAME AN INSURMOUNTABLE PROBLEM .
YEAH I SUSPECT THAT YOU KNOW THINKING ABOUT IT AND LOOKING AT MY FRIENDS AND THE NUMBER OF CREDIT CARDS THAT THEY USE AND YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT THAT I KNOW THEY BUY I GUESS PROBABLY A LOT OF THEM ARE IN A SIMILAR SITUATION AND YOU KNOW JUST DO NT TALK ABOUT IT .
YEAH MOST MOST PEOPLE DO NT LIKE TO TALK ABOUT MONEY THEY FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE I THINK .
UHHUH UHHUH .
YOU KNOW .
VERY PERSONAL .
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IT IS VERY PERSONAL .
UHHUH YEAH AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU IF YOU DO NT FEEL YOU RE HANDLING IT QUITE RIGHT .
YEAH .
OR THAT SOMEBODY MIGHT MAKE FUN OF YOU OR THAT IT WOULD BE .
BUT I THINK THE THE AVERAGE AMERICAN IS PROBABLY PRETTY HEAVILY IN DEBT NOT NOT INCLUDING LIKE A MORTGAGE A MORTGAGE IS AN UNDERSTANDABLE DEBT .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE THAT S YOU HAVE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD .
RIGHT .

RIGHT .
AND THE CONDOMINIUM WE MOVED IN BEFORE MY HUSBAND WENT OVER AND PAINTED BUT I THE EXPERIENCE THAT I VE HAD IS THAT UM WHATEVER TIME HE GAVE SAID OH IT WOULD TAKE ME ABOUT JUST ABOUT FOUR HOURS .
BECAUSE IT WAS ONLY ABOUT LIKE ELEVEN OR TWELVE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET OVER THERE AND HE SAID OH IT S GOING TO BE JUST ABOUT FOUR HOURS WELL HE WAS GONE THE WHOLE DAY AND HE SAID WELL ALL I GOT DONE WAS THE TAPING AROUND .
IS NT THAT AMAZING .
IT IT LOOKS SO EASY JUST SLAPPING PAINT ON I HAD AN ADDITION PUT ON .

SO IT S JUST BEEN PAINTING YEAH I MEAN HIRE A PROFESSIONAL BUT THAT DOES NT GUARANTEE ANYTHING .
NO AND IT REALLY LIKE YOU SAID ALWAYS TAKES WAY LONGER THAN ANYONE UM IS ABLE TO GUESS BECAUSE I KNOW MY HUSBAND HE HE PAINTED WHEN HE IT WAS JUST THE PREPARATION TIME WAS SO LONG .

THIS WAS A AND IT WAS A MAJOR PROJECT GETTING THE MONEY TOGETHER TO DO IT TOO BY THE END .
RIGHT .
OF THE WHOLE PROJECT BUT YOU KNOW WE WORKED SOMETHING OUT BECAUSE HE WAS KIND OF APOLOGETIC THAT IT TOOK SO LONG HE REALLY CAME OVER HERE TO PAINT I THINK BECAUSE HE KEPT OFFERING TO PAINT THE OUTSIDE OF MY HOUSE .
I DO NT THINK HE DID THE INTERIORS VERY WELL .

GO AHEAD YOU CAN TALK I I DO NT WANT TO I WANT TO CHEW UP THE WHOLE LINE HERE .
OH WELL YOU RE DOING YOU RE DOING JUST FINE AND AND UH ACTUALLY I WHEN I TALK I USUALLY LIKE TO ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS I WAS WONDERING WHAT YOU DO AT T I .
OH I M AN ENGINEER I M UH IN FACT I M WORKING THE NIGHT BECAUSE OF THE CUTBACKS AND EVERYTHING UH MY JOB THERE WERE THREE MANAGERS JOBS THAT WERE JUST DISSOLVED AND SO THEY PUT ME ON NIGHTS I I CALL THIS MY RECESSION JOB .
OH GOODNESS .
AND I M WORKING NIGHTS JUST KIND OF COVERING UH SHUTDOWN EQUIPMENT AND EVERYTHING .
UHHUH .
AND JUST BEING AVAILABLE .
UHHUH .
HERE I DO NT MIND UH IT BEATS BEING LAID OFF AND EVERYTHING AND UH YOU .
OH ABSOLUTELY .
YOU GOT TO BE A LITTLE FLEXIBLE .
YEAH .
UH IN MY OLD AGE I M TRYING TO JUST HANG IN THERE UNTIL I GET MY KIDS THROUGH SCHOOL AND THEN I D LIKE TO TEACH MAYBE MATHEMATICS OR SOMETHING I M TRYING TO STUDY FOR THAT NOW .
OH I HOPE YOU CAN DO THAT .
RIGHT UH .
WHAT WHAT I DID IS I WAS APPROACHED AND AND I VE I WENT TO T I JUST RIGHT AT THE TIME THAT UH MY MARRIAGE WAS ENDING I HAD BEEN A A STAY AT HOME MOM AND .
UHHUH .
AND I I MO WAS VERY FORTUNATE IN STARTING AND I REALLY ENJOYED IT WHILE I WAS AT T I BUT YOU KNOW THE CUTBACKS WERE REALLY GETTING TO BE RATHER FRIGHTENING AND I HAD LESS THAN FIVE YEARS AND ALSO I WANTED TO MAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY SO I DECIDED I D LIKE TO GO OUT AND TRY SALES .
OH YEAH .
AND UH I M I M OUT TRYING TO SELL TELEPHONE SYSTEMS TO BUSINESSES .
RIGHT .
AND THE POTENTIAL THERE IS FANTASTIC .
OH SURE .
THE REALITY OF IT IS IT S TOUGH .
WELL IT S TOUGH RIGHT NOW FOR EVERYBODY .
EXACTLY .
UP HERE IN THE DALLAS METROPLEX IT S AWFUL HEY I VE GOT ANOTHER CLUE FOR YOU FOR COLLEGE .
UHHUH .
ANOTHER CLUE FOR YOU FOR COLLEGE MONEY .
OKAY .
GO TO WORK FOR U T UH WE HAVE A FRIEND WHO WORKS WHO IS A SECRETARY FOR T C U YOU KNOW UP HERE .
YES .
THEY GIVE YOU SCHOLARSHIP A HUNDRED PERCENT IF YOU RE IF YOU WORK FOR T C U .
THEY DO .
YES SO .
I M GOING TO CHECK THAT I VE GOT .
CHECK THAT ONE OUT YOU KNOW .
I VE GOT TWO FRIENDS THAT WORK AT AT U T I DID NT KNOW THAT ALL .
ASK THEM ABOUT IT CALL THEM .
DEFINITELY I WILL .
AND BECAUSE IT S FULL FULL SCHOLARSHIP NOW IT S UH NOT ROOM AND BOARD .
UHHUH .
BUT IT S TUITION FULL TUITION PAID IF YOUR PARENT WORKS AT T C U .
WELL THAT SOUNDS FANTASTIC .
AND HER HER MOTHER WENT OVER THERE JUST FOR THAT .
ALL RIGHT AMY HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY .
FINE FINE .
ALL RIGHT I THINK WE KNOW WHAT WE RE GOING TO SPEAK ABOUT .
YEAH .
UH I TELL YOU WHAT I LL START OFF HOW S THAT .
OKAY YOU GO AHEAD .
UM I PERSONALLY THINK TO SET A MARK WITH THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND WE RE TALKING ABOUT CRIMINALS .
UHHUH .
CRIMINAL CASES THAT THEY SHOULD BRING BACK HANGINGS ON WEEKENDS .
IN PUBLIC PLACES .
IN PUBLIC PLACES THERE IS ONE STATE THAT DOES THAT BY THE WAY .
REALLY WHAT IS THAT .
I WANT TO SAY OKLAHOMA I SAW SOMETHING THE OTHER NIGHT ABOUT IT .
UM .
THEY DO NT DO THEM REAL OFTEN .
YEAH .
WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY THE DEATH PENALTY .
YEAH .
UM BUT I THINK IF WE QUIT UH BUILDING THESE TAJ MAHALS WITH THE COLOR T V S AND SIXTY DOL SIXTY THOUSAND A YEAR TO KEEP AN INMATE IN THERE ON A ON A ON A LIFE SENTENCE WE SHOULD START HANGING THEM AND GET IT OVER WITH AND LET S JUST SCREWING UP THE SYSTEM .
YEAH WELL THE SENTENCES ARE SO UNBELIEVABLE I JUST SAW ON THE NEWS LAST NIGHT THAT THEY SAID THE AVERAGE TIME A SENTENCED MURDERER YOU KNOW IS IN JAIL IS TWO YEARS BEFORE HE S PAROLED AND A RAPISTS IS LIKE SIX MONTHS .
THAT S PATHETIC .
AND A BURGLAR IS LIKE TWO MONTHS .
THAT S PATHETIC .
BECAUSE THEY JUST SAY THERE S EITHER NO ROOM IN THE SYSTEM YOU KNOW IN THE JAILS FOR THEM OR YOU KNOW IT S JUST THAT IT SEEMS LIKE THE AUTOMATIC SENTENCES IF IF A JUDGE HAS LEEWAY ON WHAT HE S GOING TO YOU KNOW SENTENCE SOMEONE FOR BETWEEN YOU KNOW TWO MONTHS AND FIFTY YEARS AND YOU KNOW WHAT S HIS WHIM TO DECIDE IT SHOULD BE TWO MONTHS .
THIS IS TRUE .
YOU KNOW IT S CRAZY .
AN AND THE WAY THE LAW READS UH IF THEY SENTENCE YOU TO LIFE IN PRISON THEN HE S AVAILABLE FOR PAROLE IF IT S LIFE AND A DAY THEN HE S NOT ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE .
YEAH .
SO WHAT YOU KNOW LET S QUIT B S ING WITH THE SYSTEM .
WELL EVEN IF IT S LIFE LIKE YOU SAY WE END UP SPENDING SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO KEEP SOME YOU KNOW JOKER IN THERE FOR LIFE WE COULD SPEND THAT MONEY YOU KNOW FOR CHILDREN THAT ARE STARVING OR TWELVE MILLION OTHER THINGS WOULD BE MORE USEFUL THAN THAT .
EXACTLY .
SO TO ME IF SOMEBODY HAS LIFE YOU KNOW BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT THEY SHOULD THAT SHOULD BE IT .
A LIFE FOR A LIFE .
YOU KNOW PARTICULARLY FOR SOME OF THESE REALLY I MEAN THERE ARE SO MANY JUST MAJOR MAJOR SERIAL MURDERS IT S NOT JUST LIKE ONE INSTANCE OR SOMETHING IT S JUST UH HORRIFYING SOME OF THE MURDERS THAT GO ON .
THE OLD CHARLES MANSON CASE I MEAN THE GUY IS REALLY .
YEAH AN YEAH THERE S JUST EVERYDAY YOU HEAR ON THE NEWS OF ANOTHER ONE LIKE THAT .
JUST SHOULD NT BE ALLOWED TO TO EVEN EVEN LIVE .
YEAH .
UH ABOUT THE ISSUE ABOUT SENTENCING BY THE JUDGE .
UHHUH .
THE THE JUDGE PRESENTLY HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO INTERVENE UH WHEN THERE S A MY UNDERSTANDING WHEN THERE S UH A VERDICT AND IT FOR EXAMPLE THERE S A HUNG JURY HERE IN FORT WORTH TODAY IN EIGHT TO FOUR AND BAM BAM THE GUY GOT OFF UH HE WAS HE WAS A VETERINARIAN AND KILLED TWO A FATHER AND A SON OKAY .
RIGHT YEAH I HEARD ABOUT THAT ON THE NEWS .
UH IT KIND OF GETS BACK TO THE SECOND REQUEST WE VE BEEN ASKED TO LOOK AT IS MOST CRIMINAL CASES REQUIRING AN UNANIMOUS VERDICT IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT I D SAY NO LET S JUST GO LIKE A REGULAR VOTE EIGHT TO FOUR TELLS ME THAT THERE WERE EIGHT THERE S A CERTAIN PERC PERCENTAGE OF THE PEOPLE THERE WITH SIXTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE UH SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE SAID HEY .
RIGHT .
THEY GUYS GUILTY .
RATHER THAN HAVE TO RETRIAL THE WHOLE WHOLE THING AND SPEND ALL THE MONEY FOR PEOPLE TO UH YOU KNOW GO BACK TO COURT AND ALL THE LAWYERS AND I MEAN IT JUST WINDS UP COSTING THE TAXPAYERS A YOU KNOW A FORTUNE TO KEEP DOING THAT .
EXACTLY .
AND THE VICTIMS YOU KNOW THE FAMILY OF THESE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN MURDERED THEY JUST HAVE TO HAVE IT DRAGGED ON FOR YEARS AND YEARS BEFORE THEY EVER GET ANY RESOLUTION .
EXACTLY BECAUSE IT S NOT NEXT DAY THEY HAVE THE START THE TRIAL IT S X NUMBER OF MONTHS AND JUST PROLONGS THE SITUATION THAT MUCH MORE .
RIGHT YEAH YEAH .
I THINK THAT THAT IF IT S IF IT S NOT A SPLIT DECISION GO WITH THE HIGHEST NUMBER AND LET S JUST GET ON WITH THE PROGRAM .
YEAH YEAH .
BUT AS FAR AS THE SENTENCING BY THE JUDGE I WOULD HAVE TO VOTE AGAINST THAT SINCE THERE IS A JURY BECAUSE THAT S WHAT THE JURIES ARE FOR IS TO MAKE THE DECISION .
YEAH YEAH .
UH WHAT ARE YOUR FEELINGS .
WELL IF I I SAW ON ONE OF THE TALK SHOWS THIS WOMAN JUDGE I BELIEVE FROM FLORIDA AND SHE JUST HAS JUST REALLY STIFF PENALTIES AND I SAW THAT IN IN THE HANDS OF A JUDGE THAT REALLY WAS CONSCIENTIOUS AND REALLY YOU KNOW TOOK THE PAINS TO GIVE A SENTENCE FOR WHAT WAS DESERVED IT COULD YOU COULD HAVE A A JUDGE THAT WOULD REALLY MAKE A GOOD IMPACT BUT LIKEWISE YOU COULD HAVE THE FLIP SIDE AND HAVE SOME JUDGE THAT WAS PAID OFF OR YOU KNOW HAD GO A GOOD OLD BOY NETWORK OR FOR WHATEVER REASONS YOU KNOW POLITICS JUST LET ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE THROUGH SO HE HE WOULD HAVE A HECK OR SHE WOULD HAVE A HECK OF A LOT OF POWER YOU KNOW IF USED WRONGLY SO AT LEAST THE JURY SYSTEM DOES SOMETHING TO PREVENT THAT YOU KNOW OR HELP IT WITH IT ANYWAY I DO NT KNOW IF IT PREVENTS IT BUT SEEMS LIKE THE JURY SYSTEM DOES HAVE IT S ADVANTAGES BUT I ALSO I VE ALSO HEARD ON TRIALS THAT SOMETIMES THEY GO THROUGH LIKE THREE HUNDRED JURORS BEFORE THEY HAND PICK THESE JURORS THAT THEY THINK ARE GOING TO BE THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO BE THE MOST LENIENT YOU KNOW AND I DO NT KNOW HOW MUCH THEY RE GETTING JUST A JURY OF THEIR PEERS AT THAT POINT THEY RE REALLY GETTING A SELECT GROUP IT S NOT JUST RANDOM PEOPLE .
UM .
IT ALMOST SHOULD BE THE FIRST TWELVE PEOPLE THAT THEY YOU KNOW HAVE ON A LIST ARE THE ONES THAT ARE ON THE JURY AND THAT S IT .
YEAH I GET BACK TO PRICE S COMMENT WHEN HE UH WAS FOUND GUILTY HE SAID WELL HE DID NT HAVE ANY BLACKS UH YOU KNOW FROM HIS NECK OF THE WOODS .
WELL GIVE ME A BREAK YOU KNOW .
HE D HAVE TO HAVE HIS WHOLE FAMILY UP THERE FOR HIM TO FEEL LIKE HE S GOT HIS PEERS OR SOMETHING YEAH .
EXACTLY YEAH YEAH I MEAN YOU RE YOU RE IN DALLAS SO EVERYBODY I CA NT BELIEVE THEY CAN UH LIKE IN A MURDER SITUATIONS THEY LOOK FOR JURIES WHO DO NT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE SYSTEM WELL OR KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE THE OCCURRENCE YOU D HAVE TO BE PRETTY DENSE .
YEAH .
YOU D BE YOU D EITHER HAVE TO BE IN A CAVE NOT TO KNOW WHAT S GOING ON OR MOVING IT TO LUBBOCK .
YEAH .
OR SOMEWHERE POSSIBLY IS NOT THE ANSWER .
OH THEY D HAVE TO MOVE IT TO TAIWAN FOR PEOPLE NOT TO KNOW ABOUT IT PRACTICALLY .
THIS IS TRUE SO TRUE .
YEAH YEAH .
WELL THIS HAS BEEN AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION .
WELL REALLY THIS IS BREAKS UP MY AFTERNOON FROM CHANGING DIAPERS AND MOPPING FLOORS I MEAN WHAT CAN I SAY .
SO YOU RE AT THE HOUSE YOU RE NOT AT THE PLANT .
NO I M AT HOME WITH TWO LITTLE KI PRESCHOOLERS MY HUSBAND WORKS FOR T I .
OH THAT S GOOD THAT S GOOD I THOUGHT I HEARD A HOLLER THERE IN THE BACKGROUND BUT I WAS NT SURE .
OH YEAH I VE GOT THE DOG AND TWO KIDS WAITING HERE I M JUST LOCKED UP IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM .
OH GOODNESS WELL I LL LET YOU GET .
OKAY THANKS A LOT BYEBYE .
I ENJOYED IT BYE .
WELL WAYNE I VE NEVER DONE ANY UH AUTO REPAIRS MYSELF AT ALL .
UHHUH .
I MEAN I MAY HAVE SCREWED IN A LITTLE SCREW THAT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS FALLING OUT ON THE DOOR OR SOMETHING BUT UH I PERSONALLY HAVE NT DONE ANYTHING MAYBE I VE UH CHANGED WIN WIPER BLADES OR SOMETHING BUT I HAVE NOTICED SINCE UH I GOT MARRIED THAT MY HUSBAND HE HATES TO DO AUTO REPAIRS BUT HE WOULD RATHER DO THEM HIMSELF THAN THAN TO PAY SOMEONE ELSE I GUESS HE CA NT MAKE HIMSELF PAY SOMEONE TO DO THE REPAIRS WHEN HE KNOWS HE KNOWS HOW TO DO IT AND HE LL DO IT SO HE HE HATES THE TIME THAT HE TAKES BUT HE HAS CHANGED UM THE BRAKES AND HE HAS DONE ALL OF THE TUNEUPS AND THE MUMBLEX LIKE THAT AND RECENTLY HE CHANGED THE STEERING MECHANISM IN THE CAR I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED WITH THAT WE HAD TO HAVE IT TO GET THE CAR INSPECTED IT WOULD NT PASS INSPECTION AND AND SO HE PRICED AROUND AND EVERYONE WANTED SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR IT SO HE THOUGHT WELL I CAN GET ONE IN A JUNKYARD FOR LIKE FIFTY DOLLARS WHICH HE DID AND THEN HE DID IT AND SO I GUESS UH HE S BEEN PRETTY GOOD ABOUT KEEPING OUR CARS UP WHAT UH WHAT S YOUR EXPERIENCE BEEN LIKE .
WELL I UH I HAVE A LONG EXPERIENCE WITH CARS I UH WHEN I WAS YOUNGER UH MY BROTHER HAD A CORVETTE AND I BOUGHT A CORVETTE AND WHEN YOU HAVE A CORVETTE YOU MORE OR LESS DO ALL THE WORK AND I VE DONE EVERYTHING FROM BUILD THE MOTOR FROM THE UH YOU KNOW THE BARE BLOCK ON UP AND I I M THE SAME WAY AS YOUR HUSBAND IS WHEN IT COMES TO MY CAR I HATE TO GO PAY SOMEBODY GOOD MONEY YOU KNOW I HATE TO PAY SOMEBODY TWENTYFIVE DOLLARS ON HOUR FOR SOMETHING I CAN DO MYSELF .
UHHUH .
IT JUST TO ME IT MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO ECONOMIC SENSE TO DO THAT .
RIGHT .
IN FACT I UM JUST THIS PAST WEEKEND PUT NEW PLUGS IN BOTH UH MY CAR AN MY WIFE S CAR .
UHHUH .
AND SO I UH I PRETTY MUCH TRY TO TROUBLESHOOT AND DO EVERYTHING I CAN DO MYSELF BUT I VE I VE GOTTEN TO THE POINT IN MY LIFE UM YOU KNOW I JUST CREPT OVER FORTY YEARS OLD WHERE I DO NT WANT TO CRAWL UNDERNEATH THE CAR ANYMORE .
THAT MAKES SENSE .
I MEAN IT S UM I DO NT KNOW WHETHER I VE I VE JUST REACHED A POINT YOU KNOW IT S IT S REAL ROUGH IN THE WINTER TIME .
HUH YES .
AND UH SO I TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT UH BY THE TIME FALL RUNS AROUND BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY HAVE WINTERS HERE ON THE EAST COAST UM .
RIGHT .
THAT UH I HAVE YOU KNOW THE CAR S IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE ENOUGH TO LAST THROUGH THE WINTER AND UH THEN SPRINGTIME I USUALLY END UP GIVING THEM THE UH A TUNEUP AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY RE RUNNING WELL AND UH YOU KNOW IT S LIKE I HAD THE MUFFLER GO OUT ON MY ON MY CAR SHORTLY BEFORE IT WAS REQUIRED TO GO IN MARYLAND THEY HAVE UH EMISSION TESTS .
UHHUH .
AND YOU RE REQUIRED TO GET YOUR CAR AND GO THROUGH THE EMISSION TEST WELL MY MUFFLER OF COURSE STARTING GOING BAD RIGHT BEFORE I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO TO THE EMISSION TEST SO YOU KNOW I HAD TO DO THAT JOB AND OF COURSE THAT WAS BACK IN DECEMBER WHEN IT S NICE AND COLD OUTSIDE .
YES I M SURE IT WAS .
BUT THE THING WAS THAT I COULD DO THE JOB MYSELF I MEAN THE PARTS COST ME OH ROUGHLY A HUNDRED DOLLARS .
UHHUH .
UM IF I D TAKEN IT SOMEPLACE AND HAVE IT DONE IT WAS GOING TO BE THREE HUNDRED TWENTYFIVE .
RIGHT .
NOW LIKE WHO S GOT THAT EXTRA TWO AND A QUARTER I KNOW I DO NT .
YEAH WELL THAT S EXACTLY THE WAY HE FEELS IS THAT HE REALLY HATES TO SPEND THE TIME IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME IF HE IF HE THINKS IT S GOING TO BE TWO HOURS IT S FOUR IF YOU KNOW WHATEVER IT ALWAYS TAKES HIM TWICE AS LONG BUT THEN WHEN HE S FINISHED HE S HE ALWAYS SAYS WELL NOW YOU OWE ME THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND THEN HE THINKS THAT HE HAS THE MONEY THAT THAT HE CAN SPEND ON SOMETHING AND HE HAS NT GIVEN IT TO SOMEONE ELSE .
YEAH .
SO HE GETS SOME SATISFACTION OUT OF THAT ALTHOUGH GENERALLY I THINK HE HE DOES NOT LOOK FORWARD TO OR ANTICIPATE THERE S SOME PEOPLE THAT ENJOY TINKERING AROUND ON CARS THERE S A LOT OF PEOPLE AND HE JUST IS NT ONE OF THEM .
YEAH I UH I DO NT MIND IT UM THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I HAD MY CORVETTE I MEAN OF COURSE I LOVED IT UM BUT IF YOU KNOW I VE GOT OTHER INTERESTS NOW AND THERE S A LOT LO OTHER MORE IMPORTANT THINGS I THINK I SHOULD BE DOING WITH MY TIME AND I HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM I MEAN YOU CAN TELL HIM FROM ME BUT IT DOES NT MATTER I MEAN I VE I VE HAD GREASY FINGERNAILS FOR YEARS AND IT STILL TAKES ME TWICE AS LONG AS I THINK IT S GOING TO TAKE TO DO THE JOB .
YEAH .
SO BUT TH I THINK THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT UH WHEN YOU OWN THE CAR YOU TAKE MORE CARE IN WHAT YOU RE DOING .
UHHUH .
AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT S DONE RIGHT AND PUT BACK TOGETHER RIGHT AND YOU KNOW I VE I VE IN THE PAST I VE HAD BRAKE JOBS DONE BY SOMEONE THAT WHEN I WENT BACK AND LOOKED AT IT SOME MONTHS LATER I D FIND SOMETHING DRASTICALLY WRONG WITH IT .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW LIKE A SPRING THAT WAS PUT IN INCORRECTLY WHICH COULD HAVE RESULTED IN BRAKES FAILING AND ME HAVING AN ACCIDENT .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW THOSE KIND OF THINGS AND WHEN YOU HAVE A VEHICLE THAT S BEING USED BY YOU KNOW OTHER MEMBERS OF YOUR FAMILY YOU KNOW YOU DO NT WANT THAT KIND OF A SITUATION TO COME UP .
NO .
AND IT S VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND A MECHANIC THESE DAYS THAT YOU CAN TRUST I ONLY HAVE ONE GUY THAT I KNOW THAT I TRUST TO WORK ON MY CAR .
UHHUH .
AND UH HE S ABOUT SIXTY MILES FROM HERE AND SO IT AND IF I HAVE SOMETHING THAT S REALLY MAJOR THAT I CA NT HANDLE OR FEEL I DO NT HAVE THE TIME TO HANDLE I LL TAKE IT TO HIM TO DO IT .
RIGHT YOU KNOW THAT IT S UH REALLY HAS A BAD REPUTATION IS TO FEEL THAT THAT PEOPLE IN GENERAL FEEL AND HAVE HAVE RIGHTLY SO I THINK BEEN CHEATED MANY TIMES .
UHHUH YES .
AND UM AND WELL I KNOW ONCE WHEN WE HAD A WE USUALLY MUMBLEX INSPECTION TIME WE FIND OUT THERE S SOMETHING WRONG WITH OUR CAR BUT UM ONCE THE MUFFLER NEEDED TO BE CHANGED AND UH HE HAD LOOKED AT HIM HIMSELF AND BUT WE SAW A COMMERCIAL FOR LIKE FOURTEEN OR TWENTY DOLLARS OR SOMETHING FOR A CHANGE HE SAID THAT S REALLY REALLY GOOD SO HE WENT IN AND UH BUT WHEN THEY QUOTED HIM A PRICE THEY REALLY WANTED FIFTY OR SOMETHING ANYWAY BUT THE CAR THAT THE MUFFLER PEOPLE HAD UM MY AT LEAST MY HUSBAND FELT THAT THEY HAD DAMAGED THE MUFFLER FURTHER YOU KNOW THEY HAD PUNCTURED A BIG HOLE IN IT WHEN IT REALLY COULD HAVE JUST BEEN PATCHED OR WHATEVER .
UHHUH .
AND SO SINCE THEN I DO NT THINK HE S EVER EVEN SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED A YOU KNOW ANY KIND OF JOB HE THOUGHT HE COULD DO HIMSELF BUT I KNOW FROM HIS CHILDHOOD HE SAYS THAT HIS FATHER ALWAYS BUYS AND RESTORES CARS JUST AS ENTERTAINMENT I GUESS AND UM SO KELLY GROWING UP HE HE FELT LIKE THAT THAT WAS A GOOD WAY ON SATURDAY S THAT HE DEVELOPED A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS FATHER .
UHHUH .
AND SO HE USED THEY USED CAR REPAIRS KIND OF AS A WAY TO HAVE A YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT THEY DID TOGETHER .
UHHUH YEAH .
AND HE THOUGHT THAT TURNED OUT PRETTY GOOD BECAUSE IT YOU KNOW IT HELPED HIM TO UNDERSTAND AND BE FUNCTIONAL NOW AND IT HELPED HIM TO HAVE A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP SO THAT S ONE ONE WAY HE LOOKED AT IT .
YEAH THAT S PROBABLY UH UH SOMETHING THAT UH IS IS YOU KNOW IS GOOD FOR BOTH OF THEM I KNOW THAT UH MY OLDER SON I COULD NEVER GET HIM INTERESTED IN CARS AND I COULD NT YOU KNOW I JUST LIKE YOU KNOW YOU SURE YOU RE A BOY I MEAN YOUR NOT INTERESTED IN CARS .
UHHUH .
I MEAN HE HE JUST WOULD NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THEM AND UH LATER ON AND LIKE WHEN HE YOU KNOW GREW UP GOT OUT OF THE HOUSE GOT HIS OWN CAR UM HE DID NT KNOW HOW TO DO ANYTHING TO IT I MEAN ABSOLUTELY NOTHING I MEAN HE COULD NT EVEN CHECK THE OIL I MEAN THAT S THAT S HOW UNINFORMED HE WAS AND DISINTERESTED .
UHHUH .
AND I GUESS THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE LIKE THAT UM YOU KNOW I ALWAYS THOUGHT MAYBE YOU KNOW IF HE TOOK MORE OF AN INTEREST AND YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING AND MAYBE WE COULD HAVE COMMUNICATED BETTER .
UHHUH .
BUT UH YEAH I I THINK THAT S GREAT .
YEAH IT DID NT ALWAYS WORK WELL I FELT UM I FEEL LIKE I COULD MYSELF DO SOME THINGS BUT THAT I HAVE ENOUGH RESPONSIBILITY THAT IF I HAVE SOMEONE LIKE MY FATHER WHEN I WAS LIVING AT HOME AND MY HUSBAND THAT S WILLING TO DO IT I GO AHEAD AND LET THEM DO IT I DO NT FEEL THE NEED TO UM YOU KNOW BE A FEMINIST ON THAT ISSUE AND SAY I CAN TAKE CARE OF MY OWN THINGS I M I M HAPPY TO LET THEM RU RUN THE CARS BECAUSE I HAVE SO MANY OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES THAT UM SO I HAVE NT TRIED TO DO A LOT MYSELF .
UH I TRAINED MY UH MY WIFE IN THE HOU IN IN DOING THINGS IN FACT UH WHEN I UH FIRST TRANSFERRED DOWN TO UH TEXAS INSTRUMENTS BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTYSEVEN .
UHHUH .
UM UH WHEN I LEFT HERE UH SHE HAD TO CHANGE A SET OF PLUGS ON THE CAR .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE SHE WAS UP HERE FOR A MONTH OR SO AFTER I WAS AND UH IT WAS AN INTERESTING EXPERIENCE FOR HER I MEAN SHE D ALWAYS ASSISTED ME AND DONE SOME OTHER THINGS BUT FOR HER TO ACTUALLY GET IN THERE AND DO IT HERSELF IT WAS UH IT WAS SOMETHING T A LITTLE DIFFERENT .
IT S A GOOD EXPERIENCE IT HELPS YOU FEEL I THINK COMFORTABLE WITH YOUR CAR AND FEEL LIKE IT S NOT SO SCARY IF UM YOUR DRIVING IT AND YOU MIGHT GET STRANDED SOMEWHERE THAT YOU MIGHT YOU THINK WELL I VE I VE BEEN UNDER THAT HOOD AND I KNOW WHAT S GOING ON BUT .
YEAH YEAH I THINK IT S IMPORTANT THAT EVERYONE KNOW YOU KNOW BASICALLY HOW HOW THE DARN ENGINE WORKS .
UHHUH .
IT HELPS YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT S WRONG WITH IT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW I VE I VE BEEN OUT WITH MY SISTER BEFORE WHEN YOU KNOW HER CAR DIED ON THE HIGHWAY AND I HAPPENED TO BE WITH HER AND MANAGED TO GET HER TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD BECAUSE IT WAS DARK AND ALL .
READY TO TALK .

SO TELL ME ABOUT DO YOU .
ALL UH HAVE A BUDGET .
WELL WE VE BEEN MARRIED FOR FIVE AND A HALF YEARS AND WE STARTED OUT WITHOUT KIDS OF COURSE AND FOUND IT MUCH EASIER TO SAVE AND USED TO DO A LOT MORE FUN KINDS OF OF THINGS AND UH DID REALLY UM YOU KNOW HAVE A REAL STRICT BUDG BUT BUDGET BUT UH THE ABOUT AND TO OUR WH WH WH WH WHEN WE FIRST GOT MARRIED WE WERE IN GRADUATE SCHOOL AND WE WERE JUST YOU KNOW DIRT POOR .
THEN WHEN WE GOT OUR FIRST JOBS AFTER ABOUT A YEAR OF MARRIAGE .
WE DECIDED WE D BANK MY SALARY SO WE COULD BUY A HOUSE .
SO WE VIRTUALLY DID THAT FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS .
WONDERFUL .
WHICH WORKED REAL WELL AND THEN MOVED FROM CALIFORNIA WHERE WE REALIZED WE COULD NEVER BUY A HOUSE ANYWAY NO MATTER HOW MUCH WE SAVED .
YES .
AND MOVED TO TEXAS BOUGHT A HOUSE IMMEDIATELY YOU KNOW WHICH OF COURSE IS NOW DEVALUED WITH THE HOUSING MARKET SO I DO NT KNOW IF WE WE DID A GOOD THING TO BUY A HOUSE OR NOT BUT AT LEAST WE VE GOT A PLACE TO LIVE .
UM SO NOW SINCE UH WE HAVE A THREE YEAR OLD AND A TWO YEAR OLD NOW UM .
THREE AND A TWO YEAR OLD .
UHHUH .
BANG BANG .
THAT S THAT S THAT THREW OUR BUDGET REALLY OUT OF WHACK TOO .
AN .
WE UM HAVE BEEN JUST FORCED TO BUDGET MUCH MORE BECAUSE I QUIT WORKING TO BE HOME WITH THE KIDS .
AND UM WE JUST REALLY HAVE UH I DO NT KNOW WE WE VE TRIED DIFFERENT TIMES WE VE DONE LIKE A SURVEY OF LIKE TAKING YOU KNOW THE PAST THREE MONTHS OF WHERE ALL THE MONEY WENT .
UHHUH .
AND WE REALLY DO NT SPEND ON ANYTHING MUCH OF A LUXURY OR ANYTHING AT ALL BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THERE S UM TIMES WHEN WE JUST HAVE TO GET OUT WHERE WE LL GO AND LIKE GET A BABYSITTER AND WE LL GO AND WE LL BLOW YOU KNOW FIFTY SIXTY DOLLARS IN ONE NIGHT GOING OUT TO EAT GOING TO A SHOW OR DOING SOMETHING YOU KNOW .
WELL I THINK THAT S IMPORTANT FOR YOUR BUDGET TO BE REALIS FOR IT TO WORK THOUGH YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING .
YEAH THAT S THE HARD PART BECAUSE WHEN WE SIT DOWN TO MAKE IT WE TRY TO MAKE IT REAL SPARTAN AND REAL NARROW SO WE CAN PUT A CERTAIN AMOUNT IN SAVINGS .
EVERY WEEK AND THEN IT S NOT REALLY THAT REALISTIC BECAUSE WE DO FIND THAT WE WANT TO GO AND DO SOMETHING OR SPLURGE FOR YOU KNOW BIRTHDAY FOR SOMEBODY OR YOU KNOW EVEN WE WE EVEN DO THINGS REAL FRUGALLY FOR THE KIDS WE GET A LOT OF TOYS AND CLOTHES AND STUFF AT GARAGE SALES OR FROM FRIENDS BECAUSE THEY DO NT KNOW THE DIFFERENCE AT THIS AGE YOU KNOW WHETHER THEY RE JORDACHE NEW OR WHETHER THEY RE .
OF COURSE NOT .
YOU KNOW SOMETHING AND THEY RE BOTH .
BOYS SO THEY JUST MUMBLEX ONE YEAR AFTER THE OTHER IN EACH OTHER .
S CLOTHES SO .
BUT UM THAT S THE HARDEST PART FOR US IS THAT IT S REALLY UM YOU KNOW BUDGETING AND SOME EXTRA THINGS YOU KNOW FOR THAT ARE MORE YOU KNOW NONESSENTIAL ITEMS .
WELL I FOUND UH THAT IN THE PLACE THAT IT WAS HARDER FOR ME TO STICK TO A BUDGET WAS NOT WHERE WE WERE CONCERNED .
UHHUH .
BUT WHERE MAYBE OUR FRIENDS WERE CONCERNED AND OUR RELATIVES AND PARENTS .
UH WE WE TENDED TO WANT TO KEEP ON GIVING LAVISH .
YEAH .
GIFTS AS .
YEAH .
WE HAD DONE BEFORE .
UHHUH .
AND I REALLY BELIEVE THAT IF YOU RE GOING TO CUT DOWN ON YOURSELF YOU NEED TO CUT DOWN SOMEWHAT ON YOUR FRIENDS .
ON YOUR FRIENDS THAT S TRUE THAT S TRUE .
WELL WE HAVE SO MANY UNEXPECTED THINGS COME UP SO OFTEN IT SEEMS WITH WE .
BOTH HAVE OLDER CARS AND SOMETHING WILL COME UP AND WIND UP HAVING TO SPEND A THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU KNOW ON THE CAR IN TWO MONTHS OR SOMETHING .
YES .
AND YOU KNOW A LOT OF THINGS LIKE THAT THAT REALLY AR ARE HARD TO PLAN FOR .
AND UH .
WELL I REALLY DO I THINK YOU HAVE TO BUDGET THOSE THINGS THOUGH .
YEAH KIND OF PUT IN A CERTAIN AMOUNT PER YEAR .
YES .
YOU RE GOING TO HAVE ON EXTRA EXPENSES FOR CAR .
EXACTLY ALTHOUGH SO MUCH PER MONTH ANYWAY .
YEAH YEAH .
AND UH THAT REALLY SHOULD BE IN YOUR BU BUT IF YOU DO NT SPEND IT IT SHOULD BE IN YOUR BANK ACCOUNT AT THE END OF THE MONTH .
YEAH OUR BIGGEST WAY OF SAVING MONEY IS THEN TO STOP ALL THESE DEDUCTIONS UM YOU KNOW IS TO LET S SEE NOW I FORGET WHICH WAY .
WE DO IT .
WE DO NT LIST ALL THE DEDUCTIONS AND THEN WE GET MORE MONEY BACK YOU KNOW AT THE END OF THE YEAR .
OH NO NO NO NO .
SO THAT S NOT A GOOD WAY TO .
YOU DO NT WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO SPEND YOUR MONEY .
YOU WANT TO BE ABLE .
THAT S WHAT .
MY HUSBAND SAID SO THIS LAST YEAR .
HE CHANGED IT OF COURSE WE DID NT GET HARDLY AND THEN NEARLY AS MUCH BACK AND IT WAS LIKE OH NO .
BETTER FIND ANOTHER WAY OF SAVING MONEY .
WELL UH BUT I DO REALIZE THAT THAT IS REALISTIC FOR SOME PEOPLE .
YEAH .
AND IT WAS FOR US MANY YEARS .
YEAH .
FOR MANY YEARS .
YEAH .
UH AND IF AND IF THAT S THE ONLY WAY .
THAT WILL IT WILL MAKE YOU SAVE AND HAVE A LITTLE NEST EGG AT THE END OF THE THE YEAR THEN DOGGONE IT .
THAT S WHAT .
YOU SHOULD DO .
YEAH BECAUSE WE DO NT MISS IT WE REALLY DO NT WHEN IT S JUST TAKING OUT OF THE PAYCHECK AND STUFF SO .
UHHUH UHHUH .
BUT WE RE TRYING TO PUT A LITTLE MONEY AWAY FOR THE KIDS BECAUSE WE CAN EN ENVISION THE UH EXPENSES FOR COLLEGE ALREADY YOU KNOW EIGHTEEN YEARS AWAY OR WHATEVER .

THAT S OR TREES .
THAT ARE ALREADY LEAFED OUT .
OH THAT S GOOD .
I GUESS THEY THEY SAY YOU CAN PLANT THEM IN THE SPRING OR THE FALL ALL .
YEAH .
MOSTLY I THINK IN A PLACE WHERE IT S REALLY COLD THEY DO IT IN THE FALL LET THEM .
WINTER .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW THROUGH THE FALL BUT UH DOWN HERE WELL IT S DONE BOTH .
WAYS .
IT IT JUST KIND OF DEPENDS ON WHAT .
YOU RE WHAT .
YOU RE PLANTING BUT UH .
YEAH AND UH .
ALL THE SHRUBS AND .
WHEN YOU HAVE TIME TO DO IT .
YEAH .
MY SISTER DOES UH FLOWER GARDENS .
SHE GETS RIGHT INTO IT .
UHHUH .
SHE SPENDS LOTS OF MONEY ON THEM .
AND I GUESS A LOT OF PEOPLE DO DO DO THAT .
THEY LANDSCAPE THEIR WHOLE HOUSE WITH FLOWER GARDENS .
YEAH .
SHE .
S GOT LIKE JUST A SMALL PATCH OF LAWN AND JUST FLOWERS AND MULCH BA TREE BARK .
ALL OVER HER LAWN .
YEAH .
FLOWERS DURING THE SUMMER DOWN HERE THE THE NORMAL KIND OF FLOWERS THERE S VERY FEW OF THEM .
THAT WILL REALLY DO WELL .
EVERYTHING DOES REAL WELL HERE IN THE SPRING UNTIL ABOUT OH FIRST PART OF JUNE AND THEN THE RE THE HEAT SETS IN .
IT GETS YA .
AND JUNE JULY AUGUST ARE YOU KNOW MOST OF THE THOSE KIND OF PLANTS JUST ARE JUST BARELY STAYING ALIVE LET ALONE MAKE FLOWERS .
DO YOU HAVE A LOT OF SHADE TREES AROUND YOUR HOUSE OR IS IT .
UH WE RE IN A RELATIVELY NEW AREA .
WE RE KIND OF OUT OF UH THE NATURAL TREE AREA .
WE RE KIND OF UP ON A ON A HIGHER .
SO YOU DO NT HAVE A LOT OF TREE COVERAGE .
ON A SLOPE .
SO WE DO NT HAVE WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW THERE ARE VERY FEW TREES .
BECAUSE GOI GOING TO MAKE .
THIS WAS THIS WAS THIS WAS PASTURE LAND BUT DOWN THE DOWN THE HILL HERE A LITTLE WAYS .
THERE ARE PARKS .
THAT ARE LOOK LIKE JUNGLES YOU KNOW .
THEY RE REALLY .
YEAH .
SEE UM UH WHERE MY UH WELL MY GRANDMOTHER PASSED AWAY BUT WHERE AUNTS ARE THEY HAVE THESE HUGE PECAN TREES .
UHHUH .
AND THEY JUST SHADE EVERYTHING .
NOW WHERE IS THIS .
UH IT S IN GEORGIA .
IN GEORGIA YEAH YEAH .
IT S YEAH IT S RIGHT OUTSIDE OF MACON AND AND IT S JUST A I LIKE THE WAY THAT I LIKE THE WAY .
THAT IDEA OF THE SOUTH IS BUT WHEN I THINK OF TEXAS I THINK OF NOTHING BUT NO TREES AND JUST GRASS .
WELL I TELL YOU WHAT NOW SEE EAST TEXAS THERE S TWO PARTS OF TEXAS EAST TEXAS AND NORTH TEXAS .
ATLANTA AND DALLAS ARE ALMOST IDENTICAL IN EVERY WAY WEATHER AND EVERYTHING .
YEAH .
THE TWO CITIES ARE VERY VERY IDENTICAL SO IF YOU WERE FAMILIAR WITH ATLANTA UH .
SO IT S THAT DRY HEAT .
UH WELL NO IT S IT S UH NOT DRY AT ALL .
IT IT S HUMID .
WELL WHERE IS IT IS IT HOUS WAS NT IT .
HOUSTON S HUMID .
HU HOUSTON IS AWFUL .
YEAH .
HOUSTON IS REALLY HUMID .
NO .
IT S HUMID .
OKAY I GUESS I LL START UM ONE UH BIG THING THAT THE ADVISE THAT I WOULD GIVE TO A PARENT TO GIVE TO HIS OR HER CHILD IS TO LET THEIR LET THEIR CHILD EXPERIENCE COLLEGE IN A KIND OF GENERAL SENSE I LIKE LARGE COLLEGES BECAUSE I WENT TO UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN THEY HAVE FIFTY THOUSAND STUDENTS THERE AND I FEEL LIKE THAT NOW IF I WENT IF I HAD GONE TO A SMALL COLLEGE THAT ONLY HAD A COUPLE OF THOUSAND THAT I WOULD NT HAVE HAVE GOTTEN AS MUCH EXPOSURE TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND DIFFERENT UH I DO NT KNOW DIFFERENT LANGUAGES DIFFERENT CULTURES AND THINGS LIKE THAT JUST BY BEING AROUND THOSE FIFTY THOUSAND STUDENTS .
THAT S INTERESTING I WENT TO A SMALLER SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
OF PROBABLY THREE THOUSAND THIRTYFIVE HUNDRED .
UHHUH .
AND I I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE BEST EXPERIENCE IN THAT WE HAD MORE ONEONONE SINCE WE SEEMED TO KNOW EVERYONE ON CAMPUS .
HUH .
AND WE HAD A BROAD SPECTRUM OF LANGUAGES AND CULTURES AND BACKGROUNDS .
HUH .
AND SO FORTH SO I THOUGHT IT WAS WONDERFUL TO BE A BIGGER FISH AND NOT SO MUCH A NUMBER .
UHHUH .
UM ONE OF FIFTY THOUSAND I WAS ONE OF THREE THOUSAND .
RIGHT .
AND AND YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES .
YEAH .
I UH BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE WE WERE BOTH KIND OF LOOKING AT THE SAME SORT OF SORT OF THING .
YEAH I I COULD SEE I COULD SEE THAT POINT I COULD SEE HOW IT WOULD BE I M SURE YOUR CLASSES WERE A LOT SMALLER UM BECAUSE LIKE WE WOULD HAVE BIOLOGY CLASSES THAT DID MAIN COURSES THAT EVERYONE HAS TO TAKE I MEAN HUNDREDS OF STUDENTS IN THIS CLASS SO .
YEAH .
ACTUALLY YES YOU WERE A NUMBER BUT UM I I JUST I DO NT KNOW I M THINKING IN A SENSE OF UH JUST BEING EXPOSED TO MORE IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IN A LARGER COLLEGE YOU I DO NT KNOW YOUR EXPOSED TO SO MANY MORE PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD AND I M SURE A LOT OF PEOPLE COME TO YOU KNOW SMALL COLLEGES ALSO BUT JUST THAT THEY RE MORE OF OF THE DIFFERENT CULTURES THERE .
UHHUH YEAH .
NOT THAT IT S NOT THAT IT S BETTER BUT I M JUST SAYING THAT I THINK THAT BIG .
THAT S ONE THING TO DEFINITELY CONSIDER .
UHHUH UHHUH I THINK UH A LOT OF A LOT OF STUDENTS NOW WOULD PROBABLY BE AFRAID OF A SMALLER COLLEGE A LOT OF THE STUDENTS THAT I TALKED TO EVEN HERE IN WACO THEY GO TO BAYLOR UM THEY OR THEY RE CONSIDERING GOING TO BAYLOR THEY RE ALSO CONSIDERING GOING TO U T AUSTIN BUT ONE OF THE BIG NONOS IS BECAUSE OF THE FIFTY THOUSAND STUDENTS AND I HAVE TO TELL THEM THAT JUST LIKE JUST LIKE I LIVE IN WACO IT S A LARGE CITY I CAN STILL FUNCTION IN MY OWN KIND OF AREA IN MY OWN GROUP I HAVE A JOB I HAVE MY FRIENDS .
UHHUH .
AND I M REALLY NOT AS AS CONCERNED ABOUT THE ENTIRE CITY SO WHEN YOU GO TO A BIG A BIG UNIVERSITY YOU RE NOT AS CONCERNED ABOUT THE ENTIRE UNIVERSITY .
YEAH .
BUT YOUR GROUP OF FRIENDS YOUR CLASSES YOUR INTERESTS YOUR CLUBS AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
I THINK THAT S PROBABLY KEYED TO ME IS NOT SO MUCH THE SIZE THE SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
BUT WHAT WHAT IS THE PARTICULAR NEEDS OF THE STUDENTS AND WHEREAS SOME WOULD IMMEDIATELY FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE IN THIS UM LARGER UNIVERSITY SETTING .
UHHUH .
SOME OF THE STUDENTS UM WHEN I WAS WHEN I WAS TEACHING SCHOOL WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN COMFORTABLE WITH THAT .
UHHUH .
THEY NEEDED UH AT LEAST AT FIRST .
UHHUH RIGHT .
THEY NEEDED A SMALLER SETTING THAT THAT WAS MORE LIKE FAMILY WHERE THEY COULD GET ONEONONE .
RIGHT .
FROM FROM TEACHERS PROFESSORS AND SO FORTH AND THEN AFTER A YEAR OR TWO MOVE ON TO A LITTLE BIT BIGGER POND WHERE WHERE WHEN THEY HAD A LITTLE MORE SELFCONFIDENCE BUILT UP OH YES I CAN DO THIS OH I VE DONE THIS BEFORE IT S JUST IN A BIGGER SETTING .
RIGHT .
AND SO MAYBE TO ME THE KEY WOULD BE WH WHAT IS A CHI THE THE STUDENTS NEEDS .
UHHUH .
AND WHAT WHAT SCHOOL OR SCHOOLS CAN BEST MEET THOSE THOSE NEEDS BESIDES EDUCATION YO YO YOU CAN EXPECT ALL OF THEM WITH UH A A ACCREDITAT ACCREDITATION TO GIVE THE EDUCATION BUT IT S THESE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU AND I ARE ARE KEYING OFF ON .
UHHUH .
THAT THAT ARE REALLY MORE OF AN EDUCATION THAT BUT THEY RE THE THINGS THAT DO NT SHOW UP IN .
ON PAPER .
THAT S RIGHT THAT S RIGHT .
UHHUH EXACTLY THAT S THAT S ONE IMPORTANT THING THAT I THINK ABOUT SCHOOL I M I M NOT A KIND A PERSON THAT I DID NT I I WAS KIND OF A B STUDENT I GUESS YOU D SAY AND I DID NT REALLY I WAS TUR I STRIVED TO BE AN A STUDENT BUT IT WAS NT LIKE A REAL PRIORITY .
RIGHT .
TO MY MY PRIORITY WAS JUST BEING AS WORLDLY AS I COULD POSSIBLY BE GETTING INTO AS MANY ORGANIZATIONS AS I POSSIBLY COULD AND AND ONE OTHER POINT I WAS GOING TO MAKE WAS THAT I CAN UN I CAN SEE THAT PROBABLY IF I HAD GONE TO A SMALLER SCHOOL I WOULD PROBABLY HAVE MORE FRIENDS .
HUH .
BECAUSE YOU LIKE YOU SAID YOU KNOW YOU KNOW EVERYBODY KNOWS EVERYBODY .
YEAH .
AND SO YOU PROBABLY COME OUT OF IT KNOWING AND BY FRIENDS I MEAN LIKE CONTACTS FOR WHEN YOU GET OUT OF SCHOOL UM YOU KNOW YOU JUST YOU MAY WALK INTO A COMPANY AND SEE SOMEONE YOU WENT TO SCHOOL WITH .
UHHUH .
MORE SO AT A SMALL COLLEGE THEN A LARGE COLLEGE .
YEAH .
YOU MAY HAVE GONE TO SCHOOL WITH THEM BUT YOU WOULD NT YOU WOULD NT KNOW THEM UH I GUESS LET ME THINK OF ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING TO LOOK AT WHEN YOU LOOK INTO COLLEGE UM .
I GUESS I GUESS NOW I VE BEEN OUT FOR I I M OLDER THAN YOU I VE BEEN OUT FOR TWENTYONE YEARS .
UHHUH .
AND I WAS LOOKING AT AN ANNUAL LAST NIGHT SOMETHING HAD SP IT SPARKED A QUESTION AND I WENT TO A SMALL PRIVATE SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
UM AND IT WAS CHURCH RELATED .
UHHUH .
AND I GOT TO LOOKING AT MY CLASS OF SIXTYNINE .
UHHUH .
AND I REALIZED THAT EVEN THOUGH THAT SCHOOL S TWO HUNDRED MILES FROM HERE AND I VE LIVED IN OTHER STATES AND DONE OTHER THINGS FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS WHERE I GO TO CHURCH NOW THERE ARE FIVE OTHER PEOPLE THAT WENT TO SCHOOL AT THE SAME TIME IN THE SAME CLASS AS I .
WOW .
AND IT S IT S NEAT TO KNOW THAT WE HAVE THAT CONTACT THAT GOES BACK THAT SOME OF THE SAME MEMORIES IF NOT THE SAME EDUCATION IN .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW WE WERE NT ALL OUT TO BE TEACHERS OR OR WHATEVER SO WE DID NT HAVE THE SAME CLASSES BUT WE HAD A COMMON THREAD .
RIGHT .
SOMETHING THAT STILL TIES US TOGETHER .
WOW .
TWENTY ODD YEARS LATER .
THAT S GREAT .
AND IT S IT S IT S KIND OF NEAT JUST KNOWING THAT THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THOSE ARE WHAT I CARRY BEYOND THAT PIECE OF PAPER THAT ALLOWS ME TO BE AN EXEMPT AT T I .
RIGHT RIGHT .
I HAVE SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT TO ME THAN THAT .
THAT S GREAT THAT S GREAT YEAH THAT S WHAT I THAT S BASICALLY WHAT I AND WHEN I FIRST I VE BEEN OUT OF COLLEGE ONLY TWO YEARS NOW SO IT S STILL PRETTY FRESH ON MY MEMORY .
UHHUH .
UM BUT NOW THAT I M OUT WHEN I WENT INTO SCHOOL MY PARENTS TOLD WELL MY OKAY LET ME LET ME GO BACK TO MY MY SISTER NOW IS IN COLLEGE .
UHHUH .
AND MY FATHER WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN GETTING HER IN A SCHOOL THAT WOULD LOOK GOOD ON HER ON HER UH DIPLOMA ETCETERA .
UHHUH .
AND SO FORTH AND AND I KEPT PUSHING HER TOWARDS JUST KIND OF U T OR A LARGER SCHOOL AND IT WAS JUST A BIG CONFLICT BETWEEN US BECAUSE MY FATHER WANTED THE ACADEMICS AND I WANTED HER TO GET THE LIFE EXPERIENCE .
UHHUH .
OUT OF IT AND SO IT WAS YOU KNOW SHE WENT THE ACADEMIC WAY BECAUSE SHE S A STRAIGHT A STUDENT WHICH IS .
I WAS GOING TO ASK WHO WON .
YES YEAH SO SHE YOU KNOW THAT S PROBABLY YOU KNOW WHAT SHE WHAT SHE WANTS ANYWAY BUT THAT WAS THE BIG DEAL AND .
IN IN THAT CASE UH REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU OR YOUR FATHER PUSHED FOR IT SOUNDS LIKE SHE WAS GOING FOR WHAT SHE NEEDED .
RIGHT .
AND FINDING A SCHOOL THAT THAT MET HER SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS .
RIGHT .
AND AND MADE THE BEST FIT FOR HER .
AND THAT THAT S ANOTHER POINT IS THAT THE A PARENT SHOULD TELL THEIR CHILD TO BE OR OR TO GIVE THEIR CHILD THE LEEWAY TO CHOOSE THEIR SCHOOL .
YEAH .
NOT SO MUCH CHOOSE THE SCHOOL FOR THEM BUT YOU KNOW KIND OF GUIDE THEM ALONG BUT LET THEM MORE OR LESS CHOOSE WHAT THEY NEED AND WHAT THEY RE GOING TO DO .
I THINK IT HELPS A NOW MY GRANDFATHER WAS GOING TO PAY IF I WENT TO UH WHAT S NOW U T ARLINGTON .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE IT WAS THERE IN MY HOMETOWN I COULD LIVE AT HOME .
RIGHT .
BUT I CHOSE TO GO TO ANOTHER SCHOOL AND EVEN THOUGH HE WAS PLEASED THAT IT WAS A CHURCH RELATED SCHOOL HE WAS NOT WILLING TO PAY ANY AT ALL EVEN THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY .
HUH .
AND I THINK I VALUE MY MY EDUCATION MORE BECAUSE I HAD TO WORK FOR IT .
RIGHT UHHUH .
AND BECAUSE I KNEW ALL ALONG THAT S WHAT I WANTED .
UHHUH .
EVE EVEN THOUGH I HAD TO BUCK THE FAMILY IN ORDER TO TO DO WHAT I NEEDED TO DO SO .
RIGHT WELL THAT WAS PRETTY COURAGEOUS .
UM I GUESS I GUESS IT WAS IT WAS MY MOTHER S SUPPORT THAT GOT ME THROUGH IT .
YEAH .
THAT AND TEN YEARS OF OF UH LOANS .
OH YEAH YEAH .
AFTER I GOT OUT .
I M I M DEALING WITH THE LOANS RIGHT NOW SO SO .
SOUNDS FAMILIAR HUH YOUR IT S VERY FRESH IN YOUR MEMORY .
OH YES VERY EVERY EVERY MONTH .
I .
THAT MEMORY JUST SEEPS BACK IN MY MAILBOX .
YEAH WELL SORRY ABOUT THAT TANYA .
OH WELL I GUESS I LL GET OVER IT .
I M SURE IT WAS WORTH IT THOUGH .
OH YEAH YEAH OKAY .
IF IF NOTHING ELSE BECAUSE I WORK IN TRAINING AT T I NOW .
UHHUH .
IF NOTHING ELSE JUST THOSE EXPERIENCES BEYOND AND AND INCLUDING YOUR EDUCATIONAL CLASSES THAT HELP GIVE YOU THE SELFESTEEM TO DO AND ACHIEVE .
UHHUH .
WHATEVER YOU SET YOUR MIND ON .
UHHUH .
AND THE YOU YOU MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE IN GOING TO A SCHOOL THAT MET ALL OF YOUR NEEDS TO MAKE TO GIVE YOU THE THE POTENTIAL TO DO WHATEVER YOU WANTED .
RIGHT BECAUSE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU DO WANT WHEN YOU DO FINALLY GRADUATE THAT THAT S WHAT YOU NEED THE MOST I M FINDING OUT NOW THAT WHAT I M NEEDING THE MOST NOW IS NOT SMARTS NOT WHAT I CAN DO ON PAPER IT S STAMINA COURAGE UH MUMBLEX .
YOUNG LADY .
WORDS IT .
YOU HAVE GOTTEN YOUR EDUCATION THEN THAT THAT S RIGHT .
YES I M NEEDING YOU KNOW MY I M NEEDING TO RELY ON MYSELF .

NO I DO NT EITHER .
UH I MEAN IT S YOU KNOW IT .
I DO NT THINK IT S GOING TO CHANGE VERY MUCH BUT .
NO I AGREE WITH THAT .
AS AS FAR AS THE AS FAR AS THE MESS .
THAT S DEVELOPING AS A RESULT UM YOU KNOW AS A COUNTRY THE UNITED STATES UH I THINK OUR HANDS ARE TIED .
UHHUH .
AS FAR AS AS AS ANY FURTHER INVOLVEMENT .
YEAH .
UNTIL THE U N SANCTIONS IT .
IN FACT IT REALLY WAS TO BEGIN WITH .
YEAH .
AND UH I JUST I HEARD A COMMENT ON THE RADIO .
THIS MORNING THAT UH YOU KNOW IT IT GETS TO A POINT WHERE UH IF ENOUGH PEOPLE ARE ARE GOING TO BE SLAUGHTERED OVER THERE OVER THE THE THE INTERNAL PROBLEMS UM SOMEBODY MAY STEP IN AGAIN .
UHHUH .
BUT UH I REALLY THINK IT S IT S A U N ISSUE .
YEAH .
AT THAT POINT BECAUSE IT IS INTERNAL .
WELL YOU KNOW THE FUNNY THING .
I FIND ABOUT AMERICAN OPINION IS THAT WHEN WE HAVE GONE IN TO DESTABILIZE A GOVERNMENT BEFORE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC GOES CRAZY .
UHHUH .
AND NOW THE FACT THAT WE RE NOT INTERFERING WITH THE INTERNAL REBELLION IN IN IRAQ THEY RE GOING CRAZY .
THAT S RIGHT THAT S RIGHT .
YOU KNOW I MEAN YOU CA NT PLEASE THEM .
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER .
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT .
YOU KNOW AND I AND I THINK THAT I I AGREE WITH YOU THIS IS EXACTLY THE RIGHT COURSE .
I MEAN THAT S AN INTERNAL PROBLEM TO IRAQ .
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH US .
UHHUH .
AND UNTIL HE STARTS DOING SOMETHING SO INHUMANE THAT THE U N GETS INVOLVED THEN IT .
S .
NOBODY .
S BUSINESS .
THAT S RIGHT .
UM .
I MEAN THESE THESE TYPES OF INTERNAL THINGS GO ON ALL OVER THE WORLD .
ALL THE TIME .
ALL THE TIME .
I MEAN YEAH I MEAN .
SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOR FOR TENS OF YEARS .
YEAH .
IF IF I UNDERSTAND IT RIGHT IN PLACES LIKE THE SUDAN AND .
YEAH AND IT S CERTAINLY AND IT S CERTAINLY BEEN GOING ON OVER THERE FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS .
YEAH .
AND IT S GOING TO CONTINUE .
THAT S RIGHT .
AS LONG AS YOU HAVE SO MANY DIVERSE GROUPS .
THAT ARE THAT ARE VYING FOR POWER IT S GOING TO HAPPEN ALL THE TIME .
YEAH THAT S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT .
I MEAN THE KURDS HAVE TRIED IT BEFORE .

EITHER THAT OR MY MOM JUST HAD SOME BAD SEED OR SOMETHING .

THIS YEAR THIS LAST SEASON IT WAS TOO WET UP HERE .
UHHUH .
WE LOST A LOT OF OUR ROOT THINGS OUR SQUASH AND OUR POTATOES AND WE GOT HALF OUR YIELD .

RIGHT .
IN THERE .
WELL IT SEEMS .
I MEAN I GUESS IT D GO WITH MY FLOWERS .

YEAH I DO NT I DO NT I JUST DO NT THINK YOU I ALWAYS THOUGHT I D PUT A TOMATO PLANT IN THERE OR SOMETHING WEIRD .
UHHUH .
BUT I DO NT THINK I COULD REALLY EAT THE FRUIT OFF IT WITHOUT WONDERING AND I DO NT KNOW IF THEY MAKE LANDSCAPE TIES THAT ARE NT TREATED .
WELL YOU CAN GET UM YOU CAN GET PRESSURIZED LUMBER .
YEAH BUT THEY PUT .
OH THAT S RIGHT .
SOME KIND OF CHEMICALS IN THERE TOO .

YEAH WELL I M NOT REALLY WORRIED ABOUT IT IT S MAINLY FOR FLOWER BED SO I M NOT GOING TO NO GOI I M JUST NOT GOING TO PUT THAT TOMATO PLANT IN THERE .
ALL RIGHT .
BUT I YEAH I DO WANT TO HAVE A RAISED BED I VE NEVER MY FLOWER GARDENS ARE ALWAYS BEEN LIKE ON THE GROUND .
RIGHT .
THEY DO NT IT JUST LOOKS SO MUCH BETTER WHEN IT S UP AGAINST THE HOUSE TIERED UP .
WELL YOU CAN SEE IT A LITTLE BETTER AND IT STANDS OUT .
YEAH THIS HOUSE THAT I HAVE IS JUST A THREE BEDROOM RANCH AND I CAN TELL YOU THERE S NOTHING AROUND IT CEMENT .
UM .
FOUNDATION ALL THE WAY AROUND IT NOT A SHRUB NOT A BUSH THERE WAS A LILAC TREE AND THE LANDLORD CUT IT DOWN AND SAID YEAH THAT S ONE THING YOU HAVE TO DO IS KEEP THAT LILAC BUSH CUT DOWN SO IT DOES NT RUB UP AGAINST THE SIDING .
OH GEE .
AND I M LOOKING AT HIM LIKE JEEZ PEOPLE WOULD KILL TO HAVE A LILAC BUSH .
YEAH .
AND HE S CUTTING IT DOWN SO THAT S ALL RIGHT FLOWER BEDS ARE ALL RIGHT ANYTHING AS LONG AS IT DOES NT RUB UP AGAINST THE SIDING .
RUB UP AGAINST THE SIDING UH .
YEAH THAT S WHAT HE S WORRIED ABOUT THE TREES OR A BUSH BECAUSE LILAC BUSHES THEY THEY GROW FAST SOME PEOPLE UH WOULD REALLY LIKE TO HAVE THEM AND THEN THE PEOPLE THAT DO HAVE THEM THEY SPREAD AND THEY SPROUT ALL OVER TH THEIR LAWN .
UHHUH .
SO THEY RE KIND OF A PAIN BUT YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO DO NT HAVE THEM THINK THEY RE GREAT AND PEOPLE WHO DO HAVE THEM .
CURSE .
RIGHT .
ANOTHER THING I HAVE THAT UM IS WEIRD IS THE A LOCUS TREE IN THE BACK YARD AS A MATTER OF FACT THERE S THREE OF THEM VERY BADLY TRIMMED THEY ARE NT TRIMMED AT ALL .
UHHUH .
AND I CAN IMAGINE IF I HAD TO MOW THE LAWN IN THE BACK WHICH WE SAID WE D DO IF THE TREES HANG DOWN SO AND THE LOCUS TREES HAVE LIKE THREE QUARTERS OF AN INCH THORNS ON IT .
YEAH THEY RE LIKE I THINK I VE SEEN THOSE BEFORE BUT I DO NT REMEMBER WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE .
THEY RE A PRETTY TREE BUT YOU JUST WHEN YOU WALK UP TO THEM THEY RE COVERED WITH THORNS SO WE RE GOING TO GET A CHAIN SAW AND LIMB IT EXTENSIVELY SO IT GETS THE TREES UP OVERHEAD .
SO IT LL GIVE YOU ROOM TO GET UNDER IT SURE .
YEAH BECAUSE I CAN JUST SEE BRUSHING UP AGAINST IT THAT IT WOULD .
YEAH .
RIP YOUR SKIN IT S WORSE THAN A ROSE BUSH .
UM .
MANY TIMES WORSE BECAUSE OF COURSE IT S A TREE .
OH A TREE MUMBLEX IS ALWAYS SOMETHING VERY NICE TO HAVE .
YEAH MY DAD USED TO WORK ON THEM SO I DO NT THINK I LL HAVE A PROBLEM MY HUSBAND WILL HAVE PROBLEMS BORROWING ONE .
THEN YOU GOT TO GET HIM TO IF HE S GOING TO DO IT YOU VE GOT TO TWIST HIS ARM TO GET HIM TO GO DO IT .
WELL IF THAT S NOT THE PROBLEM .
I LL LET YOU GO FIRST .
OH WELL WHAT S THERE TO SAY .
DOES NT SEEM LIKE IT S BEING CARRIED OUT VERY WELL IN MY OPINION .
SEEMS LIKE IT TAKES SO LONG BETWEEN CONVICTION AND CARRYING OUT THE PENALTY THAT I DO NT SEE THAT IT MAKES ANY DIFFERENCE TO SENTENCE ANYBODY .
YEAH IT SEEMS LIKE THEY COULD DIE OF OLD AGE WAITING TO GET THE DEATH PENALTY .
YEAH .
YEAH I KNOW WHAT .
YOU MEAN .
UM I IN MARYLAND THEY THEY DO HAVE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT .
UHHUH .
AND UH I VE SEEN UH A LOT OF PEOPLE GET CONVICTED SENTENCED AND THEN JUST NOTHING HAPPENS .
YEAH .
JUST ENDLESS ENDLESS ENDLESS APPEALS .
UHHUH WELL FROM WHAT .
I UNDERST I SAW A STATISTIC JUST A FEW DAYS AGO UM SO FAR THIS YE YEAR OR WAS IT DURING THE LAST YEAR SOMEWH DURING A YEARS TIME I THINK IT WAS THEY EXECUTED TWENTYFIVE PEOPLE IN THE NATION .
MEANWHILE THERE WERE TWENTYFIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE ON DEATH ROW .
SO I I AND IT S BUILDING UP YOU KNOW THEY RE THEY RE CONVICTING THEM FASTER THAN THEY RE EXECUTING THEM SO IT S REALLY BUILDING UP .
YEAH WHAT S AMAZING IS SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN ON DEATH ROW FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS .
UHHUH .
AND UH HERE IN MARYLAND I KNOW WE HAVE A REAL PROBLEM WITH OVERCROWDING IN PRISONS UH JUST .
YEAH EVERYBODY .
S GOT THAT .
YEAH BUT I MEAN IN HERE IT S UH TO THE POINT WHERE THEY WERE LETTING PRISONERS GO .
UHHUH .
UH COMMUTING THE SENTENCES OF THOSE .
THAT WERE IN IN JAIL FOR LESSER CRIMES .
YEAH .
IN ORDER TO PUT MORE PEOPLE IN INTO THE JAILS .
UHHUH .
AND IT WAS JUST UH AMAZING TO ME AND OF COURSE .
THEY MADE A BIG DEAL OUT OF THE THE FEW .
THAT GOT OUT AND TURNED AROUND AND COMMITTED A CRIME WITHIN FIVE DAYS OF GETTING OUT .
YEAH .
AND BEING REARRESTED AN .
IS NT IS NT MARYLAND WHERE THE FAMOUS WILLY HORTON CASE WAS .
UH I CA NT REMEMBER .
REFRESH MY MEMORY .
IT WAS UH THAT WAS THE ONE .
THAT WAS USED SO MUCH IN THE CAMPAIGN .
IN THE POLITICA IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE .
UH MAY IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN MARYLAND .
IT MAY HAVE BEEN MASSACHUSETTS I DO NT REMEMBER .
UM I DO NT REMEMBER MYSELF .
ANYWAY WELL THE QUESTION IS YOU KNOW DO YOU THINK I IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN WHETHER OR NOT A CRIMINAL COMMITS A CRIME OR DO YOU THINK IT CAN IF IT S DONE RIGHT .
UM I THINK IF THEY IF THEY STARTED EXECUTING THEM ON A REGULAR BASIS UH THAT I THINK IT MIGHT MAKE A DIFFERENCE .
RIGHT NOW .
IF IT .
I DO NT SEE IT MAKING A DIFFERENCE .
I DO NT SEE SOMEONE NOT GOING OUT THERE AND COMMITTING MURDER BECAUSE THEY RE AFRAID THEY RE GOING TO GET SENTENCED TO DEATH .
I MEAN .
UHHUH .
MOST PEOPLE OUT THERE COMMITTING MURDERS MUMBLEX DO NT CARE .
THEY JUST DO NT CARE .
YEAH .
WELL I THINK IN LARGE MEASURE .
THE REASON .
THEY DO NT CARE IT S NOT BECAUSE THE PUNISHMENT BUT SO MANY OF THE PEOPLE .
THAT COMMIT CRIMES DO NT GET PUNISHED .
YEAH .
THE POLICE DO NT CATCH THEM OR THE COURTS DO NT CONVICT THEM OR OR THEY DO NT SERVE VERY MUCH OF THE TIME AND SO UH YOU KNOW THEIR THEIR SUCCESS RATE IS VERY HIGH .
CRIME DOES PAY CA YOU CAN MAKE A GOOD LIVING AT IT .
YEAH YEAH AND THERE S UH THERE S A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE IN BALTIMORE THAT UH HAVE AND WE JUST HAD UH A REAL BIG COCAINE BUST AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW THEY RE THEY RE PLAYING IT UP REAL BIG THAT IT WAS LOOKED LIKE IT WAS A VERY VERY SMALL RING AND THEY JUST HAPPENED TO GET LUCKY AND CATCH THE GUY .
YEAH .
BUT I MEAN UH BALTIMORE HAS UH AN ALL TIME RECORD FOR THE NUMBER OF DEATHS SO FAR THIS YEAR .
I THINK THEY VE GOT OVER A HUNDRED DEAD ALREADY THIS YEAR .
LAST YEAR .
IT WAS D C I GUESS BALTIMORE CAUGHT THEM .
WELL IT S KIND OF IT S KIND OF MOVED UP AND YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT IT IT IT UH THERE S I THINK X NUMBER OF PEOPLE OUT THERE .
THAT ARE GOING TO COMMIT MURDERS .
UHHUH .
AND UH ONCE YOU KILL OFF A FEW OF THEM .
YEAH .
I MEAN IF YOU MURDER A GUY BECAUSE HE MURDERED YOUR PARTNER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I MEAN PRETTY SOON YOU RUN OUT OF PEOPLE TO MURDER .
YEAH THE ONLY CONSOLATION IS SO MANY OF THE MURDERS ARE YOU KNOW THE THE VIOLENT PEOPLE GOING AGAINST EACH OTHER AND SO THEY YOU KNOW SOCIETY S NOT GOING TO PUT THEM TO DEATH WELL AT LEAST MAYBE THE GUY .
THEY CROSS NEXT TIME IS GOING TO .
UH I THINK I THINK CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS AN APPROPRIATE PUNISHMENT FOR THE KIND OF PEOPLE WHERE WE SAY YOU KNOW THIS SORT OF PERSON IS JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE TO OUR SOCIETY AND WE ARE THERE BY GOING TO REMOVE THEM FROM SOCIETY NOT TEMPORARILY BUT PERMANENTLY .
YEAH .
I MEAN I I PERSONALLY THINK LIFE IMPRISONMENT I DO NT THINK MUCH OF LI OF LIFE IMPRISONMENT .
FIRST OF ALL IT S NEVER TURNS OUT TO BE LIFE BUT SECOND YOU KNOW WHY SHOULD WE THE IDEA OF LIFE IMPRISONMENT WITH NO CHANCE OF PAROLE .
WELL THAT MEANS .
YOU RE GOING TO PUT THEM IN A CAGE .
YOU THINK IT S NEVER EVER GOING TO BE SAFE FOR THEM TO WALK THE STREETS AGAIN WELL THEN WHY BOTHER .
JUST EXECUTE THEM BECAUSE THAT S THAT WAY .
YOU RE SURE THEY LL NEVER EVER GOING TO WALK THE STREETS AGAIN .
YEAH .
SO ANY ANY ANYBODY .
THAT SAYS LIFE IN PRISON WITH NO CHANCE OF PAROLE I D SAY UH GIVE THEM .
THE DEATH PENALTY .
SO .
YEAH YOU KNOW IT MAKES SENSE UM YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE OCCASIONAL PERSON .
WHO MAY HAVE BEEN FALSELY ACCUSED BUT I MEAN UH SO FEW AND FAR BETWEEN UH YOU KNOW MAKES GOOD T V MOVIES AND THAT S ABOUT IT .
YEAH AND AND ALSO UM THE THE THING .
I DO NT LIKE ABOUT A LOT OF THESE COURT TRIALS AND A LOT OF THESE APPEALS IS THAT IT S NOT BASED ON WHAT IS TRUE AND WHAT IS FALSE BUT RATHER IT S ON THE RULES OF EVIDENCE WHAT CAN I HIDE AND WHAT DO I HAVE TO TELL .
YEAH .
AND I THINK OUR COURTS SHOULD BE GEARED MUCH MORE STRONGLY TOWARDS FINDING OUT THE TRUTH THAN THEY CURRENTLY ARE .
YEAH .
AND AND THAT WAY .
WE CAN BE SURE YOU KNOW WE CAN FIND OUT THE TRUTH WE CAN FIND OUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED AND AND BASE THE VER SENTENCE ON WHAT .
THE PERSON DID NOT ON WHAT .
WE RE ALLOWED TO LET THE JURY HEAR .
YEAH I HAD MY UH MY FATHERINLAW PARTICIPATED IN A UH A JURY TRIAL HE WAS HE WAS ACTUALLY ON THE JURY .
UHHUH .
AND UH THIS MAN WAS ACCUSED OF KILLING UH I THINK IT WAS TWO PEOPLE UH AND SHOOTING A UH POLICEMAN UM POINT BLANK IN THE FACE .
OF COURSE .
HE DID NT DIE .
UHHUH .
AND UH THIS WAS DURING A HOLDUP OF A UH UH A RESTAURANT AND IT CAME OUT DURING THE TRIAL THAT UM THEY HAD TRIED TO ROB ANOTHER PLACE AND UH WHEN THE GUY CAME OUT WITH THE BAG .
THEY THOUGHT WAS MONEY IT TURNED OUT TO BE A COUPLE COOKIES AND UH YOU KNOW JUMBO COOKIES AND AND SO THEY WERE SO UPSET FROM ROBBING THIS GUY YOU KNOW TRYING TO DO THIS HOLDUP .
THAT DID NT WORK THAT THEY QUITE LITERALLY WERE MAD AND WENT INTO A RESTAURANT TO HOLD THE PLACE UP AND JUST STARTED YOU KNOW SHOOTING PEOPLE .
JUST STARTED SHOOTING PEOPLE .
YOU KNOW IT S .
BECAUSE THEY BOTCHED THE FIRST JOB AND .
YEAH .
SO NOW THEY RE GOING TO GET EVEN .
YEAH AND GET EVEN WITH WHO I MEAN .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW STUPID GUYS .
AND UH IT TURNED OUT THAT THE YOU KNOW POLICEMAN SURVIVED TO THE POINT THAT HE WAS ABLE TO YOU KNOW IDENTIFY THE GUY .
UHHUH .
AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW THEY TRIED TO MAKE THE COP LOOK OU LIKE HE WAS UH A UH NO GOOD ROTTEN DRUNK .
YEAH .
I MEAN IT WAS AMAZING .
SO WHAT WAS THE VERDICT WHAT WAS THE RESULTS THERE .
OH HE WAS FOUND GUILTY YEAH .
OH .
HE UH UM LAST I HEARD HE UH HE BEAT A PUSH FOR THE DEATH PENALTY .
NOW WHETHER THEY FINALLY GOT IT OR NOT I DO NT KNOW .
UHHUH .
I .
KIND OF UH STOPPED LISTENING AFTER A WHILE .
UHHUH .
UM YOU KNOW HE WOULD COME HOME AND AND YOU KNOW AFTER THE TRIAL WAS OVER HE CAME HOME AND TOLD US .
WHAT WAS GOING ON AND OF COURSE THEN THEY HAD TO GO BACK TO DEC YOU KNOW AFTER HE HAD TO GO .
THE THE PENALTY PHASE YEAH THEY VE DECIDE THE PENALTY SEPARATELY FROM THE VERDICT .
RIGHT .
AND UH YEAH EVERYBODY EVERYBODY WAS PRETTY MUCH YOU KNOW LET S BURN HIM .
UHHUH .
AND THAT S YOU KNOW THAT S THE WAY .
THEY WANTED TO DO IT .
AND HE WAS SURPRISED BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THERE WAS GOING TO BE A PROBLEM BECAUSE HE UH YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE ON THE CASE WERE WERE A LITTLE HESITANT ON CONVICTING HIM ON SOME OF THE CHARGES BUT I MEAN WHEN IT .
ALL CAME DOWN THEY JUST WITHIN AN HOUR DECIDED THE MAN S FATE .
YEAH WELL YOU KNOW YOU JUST HAVE TO DECIDE YOU KNOW WHA YO WELL THERE S REALLY TWO SEPARATE DECISIONS THERE I GUESS ONE IS DID IT REALLY HAPPEN THE WAY .
THE THE PROSECUTOR SAID IT HAPPENED YOU KNOW IS THIS MAN REALLY GUILTY AND YOU HAVE TO DECIDE THAT BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO DECIDE YOU KNOW AS A MEMBER OF SOCIETY .
WHAT DO I WANT TO DO WITH THIS GUY .
WHO DID THIS THING .
YEAH .
AND THAT W I I VE NEVER BEEN ON A JURY I VE NEVER HAD THAT EXPERIENCE I M NOT SURE I D LOOK FORWARD TO MAKING THAT KIND OF DECISION ABOUT A MAN S LIFE .
YEAH YEAH WELL IT IT IT WENT PRETTY PRETTY QUICK FROM WHAT .
HE SAID .
UHHUH .
BUT I MEAN THERE S THERE S THERE S A LOT OF OTHER CRIMES OUT THERE I MEAN BESIDES MURDER I THINK UH NOW IF YOU RE DEALING DRUGS NOW .
UHHUH .
CAUGHT MORE THAN TWICE OR SOMETHING UH .
YEAH .
IT THERE S UH A DEATH PENALTY ASSOCIATED WITH IT .
WELL THE THING .
I D BE MOST LIKELY TO ATTACH THE DEATH PENALTY TO IS THE VIOLENCE .
I MEAN YE I CAN HANDLE PEOPLE PEOPLE SELLING DRUGS YOU KNOW IT S IT S WRONG BUT IT IT S NOT WORTH .
SOMEBODY GETTING EXECUTED FOR .
BUT WE HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT THE VIOLENCE AND HOW IT S NOT SAFE TO WALK THE STREETS BECAUSE SOMEBODY YOU KNOW THESE RANDOM DRIVE BY SHOOTINGS AND THAT SORT OF THING .
UHHUH .
AND THE PEOPLE I D MOST LIKELY WANT TO SENTENCE TO DEATH ARE THE PEOPLE .
THAT JUST SHOW A REALLY LOW REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE .

ALL RIGHT .
BYEBYE .
BYEBYE .
I DO NT KNOW .
I GREW UP UH IN THE THE SIXTIES AND AT THAT TIME UH IT WAS IS A CHANGING TIME FOR THE WHOLE MUSIC SCENE I GUESS AND I GREW UP WITH THE BEATLES AND THE ROLLING STONES AND THE WHOLE POT CULTURE DURING THAT TIME AND WENT THROUGH THAT PHASE AND KIND OF STAYED WITH IT .
I GUESS FOR SEVERAL YEARS AFTER I GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE AND AND THEREAFTER BUT HAVE SINCE UH I GREW UP IN A SMALL TOWN IN IN SOUTHERN OKLAHOMA I HAVE KIND OF GONE BACK TO UH MORE OF A COUNTY UH FLAVOR IN MUSIC .
UM I M NOT QUITE SURE WHY THAT IS AND IT SEEMS LIKE ALMOST A OPPOSITE BUT I GUESS I GOT AWAY FROM WHAT .
I CONSIDER TO BE THE POT UH SOUNDING MUSIC .
IT DID NT HAVE WHAT YOU KNOW I GUESS WHAT .
I WAS LOOKING FOR AT THE TIME COUNTRY TELL S MORE OF A A STORY .
IT .
KIND OF REMINDS ME OF MY ROOTS OF GROWING UP AND I VE I VE BECOME I GUESS MORE OF A COUNTRY FAN OVER THE YEARS .
WHEN YOU SAY THAT YOU GREW UP UH IN THE SIXTIES I TAKE IT .
THAT WAS THE UH TEENAGE TYPE YEARS OR UH .
YEAH THAT WAS MY TEENAGE YEARS .
I WAS BORN IN FIFTY AND AND UH .
OKAY WE WE RE VERY SIMILARLY AGED SO WE PROBABLY HAVE AN IN INTERESTING PERSPECTIVE ON THE MUSIC ON THE TIMES SO I M JUST A COUPLE YEARS OLDER THAN YOU .
YEAH .
UM ESSENTIALLY I WAS ONE OF THE NERDY TYPES IN HIGH SCHOOL REALLY WHICH MEANT THAT I FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER I DID NT PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO MUSIC BUT AS I LOOK BACK NOW I REALIZE IT WAS VERY FORMATIVE FOR ME UH MY EARLY POPULAR MUSIC INTERESTS WERE IN SIMON AND GARFUNKEL WHOM .
I SAW PERFORM WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE AND I BECAME ATTACHED TO THAT STYLE OF UH URBAN URBAN COUNTRY IF THERE IS SUCH A THING .
YEAH .
I THINK WITH IN A WAY .
ONE COULD TALK ABOUT SIMON AND GARFUNKEL .
THAT WAY BECAUSE THEY DO TEND UH TO HAVE A DRAMATIC OR STORY APPROACH TO THEIR MUSIC UH USUALLY TEND TO HAVE SOME GOOD OR BAD MORAL TO IT .
UH OVER TIME .
I BECAME VERY INTERESTED IN IN BAROQUE CLASSICAL AND I THINK THAT WAS JUST THROUGH EXPERIENCING CONTACTING COLLEGE AND THE FACT THAT I FOUND IT IT VERY RELAXING FOR ME .
MY TASTES NOW RUN I GUESS TO A UPBEAT UH SIMON .
YEAH .
IT .
S .
SOMETHING .
THAT INTERESTS ME UH COMBINED WITH WITH THE CLASSICAL TASTES I HAD MENTIONED .
AND MY CLASSICAL MUSIC TENDS TO BE CONFINED TO THE SEVENTEEN HUNDREDS EARLY EIGHTEEN HUNDRED MUSIC .
I M NOT A MUSIC UM MUMBLEX I M NOT PARTICULARLY SCHOOLED IN IT .
I KNOW WHAT .
I LIKE TO LISTEN TO AS FAR AS CLASSICAL MUSIC .
AND I .
THAT S KIND OF THE WAY .
I AM .
I SPENT A GOOD DEAL OF TIME LISTENING ALSO TO UH PEOPLE FROM THE LATE SEVENTIES REALLY UM NEIL DIAMOND FOR INSTANCE .
UM PEOPLE OF OF THAT PARTICULAR TIME .
UHHUH .
I LISTEN TO SOME COUNTRY AND WESTERN BUT I M NOT SCH SCHOOLED IN IT AND I I VE ENJOYED THE TIMES WHEN I HAVE LISTENED TO IT .
I PLAYED A LITTLE BIT OF PIANO .
I CONTINUE TO DO THAT .
I WANT TO DO IT AND I NEVER HAVE THE DISCIPLINE TO STAY WITH IT BUT WHEN I DO PLAY UH AND BEGIN TO REACQUIRE SKILLS I INEVITABLY FALL IN LOVE WITH COUNTRY WESTERN MUSIC .
WHICH TENDS TO BE IN SOME WAYS EASY TO PLAY FOR A FOR A NEW PIANO PLAYER .
IT IS IT S GOT UH BASICALLY AN EASY UH RHYTHM AND AND TONE .
RIGHT .
AND IT S IT S PRETTY FAIRLY WELL EASILY TO UH UH SOMETHING TO FALL INTO .
I M KIND OF THE SAY WAY I I VE GONE THROUGH DIFFERENT PERIODS OF LIFE UH IN MUSIC FROM POP TO CLASSICAL .
I GUESS ONE OF THE THINGS WAS THAT INFLUENCED ME WAS THAT I I VE WORKED IN RADIO STATIONS AS A D J FOR ALL MY COLLEGE YEARS TRYING TO SUPPORT MY WAY THROUGH THERE AND SUPPOR WAS SUPPORT I WAS INFLUENCED BY ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF MUSIC BUT BASICALLY BECAUSE THAT S WHERE I WORKED .
AND I VE DEVELOPED A REAL LOVE FOR UH CLASSICAL MUSIC IN PROBABLY JUNIOR HIGH AND HIGH SCHOOL BECAUSE MY BAND INSTRUCTOR WAS UH HEAVY INTO CLASSICAL TYPE MUSIC .
HE SAID HE USED TO SIT ON SATURDAY MORNINGS AND WATCH CARTOONS JUST TO HEAR THE MUSIC UH THAT THEY WERE USING BEHIND THEM BECAUSE THEY USED ESPECIALLY DISNEY USED A LOT OF CLASSICAL MUSIC UH BEHIND THE CARTOONS AND SO CONSEQUENTLY WE WIND UP WOUND UP PLAYING A LOT OF CLASSICAL MUSIC THERE AND I THINK THAT UH GOT DEEP SEATED INTO ME .
ONE OF THINGS I ESPECIALLY LIKE NOW IN MUSIC REGARDLESS OF WHAT KIND .
IT IS UH ARE THOSE .
THAT CALL ON THOSE CLASSICAL UH ROOTS I GUESS UH BARRY MANILOW COMES TO MIND FOR SOME REASON .
THERE S THERE S NOT A WHOLE LOT OF HIS STUFF THAT I M REAL CRAZY ABOUT BUT HE DOES HAVE SOME THINGS .
CHICAGO HAD SOME THINGS .
RIGHT .
UH AND I THINK EVEN ELECTRIC LIGHT ORCHESTRA HAD SOME SOME REAL UM INFLUENCES BY CLASSICAL MUSIC AND I M STILL STILL MY FAVORITE IN FACT MOST OF MY C D S ARE CLASSICAL MUSIC .
I FIND IT VERY INTERESTING THAT SOME TELEVISION SHOWS THAT I ENJOY I PARTICULARLY LIKE THE MUSIC .
I DO NT KNOW WHICH IS CHICKEN AND EGG IN THAT SITUATION .
UH A GOOD EXAMPLE WOULD BE UH I HAVE CONNECTIONS BUT BUT NOT PARTICULARLY DEEP ONES TO THE VIETNAMESE WAR TYPE SITUATIONS .
UHHUH .
UH AND I FOUND THAT I REALLY LIKE CHINA BEACH AND I PARTICULARLY LIKE TOUR OF DUTY AND BOTH OF THEM I HAD AS MUCH FASCINATION OF THE BACKGROUND MUSIC I THINK GOING ON AS I DID TO THE THEME OF THE SHOWS .
YEAH .
UH AND I I VE UH THIRTY SOMETHING I M PARTICULARLY INTERESTED BUT IT S THE MUSIC .
YEAH .
ALMOST THAT I FIND MYSELF LISTENING TO UH .
I M KIND OF THINKING THAT S MAYBE OUR GENERATION WAS UH SO IN TUNED TO MUSIC OF THAT TIME THAT WE IDENTIFY GOODNESS OR BADNESS WITH UH THINGS NOW WITH THE MUSIC .
THAT S BEHINDS .
THEM .
THAT COULD WELL BE .
I I UH SPENT MY JUNIOR YEAR UH AND SOPHOMORE AND JUNIOR YEAR IN IN COLLEGE WHEN I A SONG BY THE UH UH I THINK THE TITLE OF IT WAS JUST DOWNTOWN .
UHHUH .
UH AND IF YOU RECALL HOW IT GOES DOWNTOWN .
RIGHT .
TA DA DA DA UH ALL .
I HAVE TO DO IS HEAR THAT SONG AND I GET STRONGLY EVOKED MEMORIES OF OF DIFFICULT TIMES IN SCHOOL BEING BEHIND ON WORK .
UHHUH .
UH AND MY FAMILY NOW KNOWS IF THEY COME INTO MY STUDY AND UH I HAPPEN TO HAVE HAD A TOUGH DAY AT WORK AND MAYBE I M TRYING TO GET A PROJECT DONE UH AT SCHOOL UH AND I M HUMMING OR WHISTLING IN A SORT OF MAD CRAZY WAY .
THE TUNE TO DOWNTOWN .
THEY KNOW TO JUST STAY AWAY .
THAT S THEIR SIGNAL .
THEY CAN HEAR THE UNCONSCIOUS MUSIC SIGNAL BEHIND IT .
YEAH .
THAT S RIGHT .
WHEN DID YOU FIRST TAKE YOUR UH FIRST PIANO LESSON .
UH PROBABLY ABOUT FIRST GRADE .
YEAH .
AND I HAVE UH RETURNED ABOUT EVERY FOUR OR FIVE YEARS TO THINKING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT .
I USUALLY GET TO THE POINT WHERE I CAN PLAY SOME OF MY FAVORITE THEMES AND THEN INEVITABLY I AM SWEPT AWAY BY THE THE PRESSURE OF OTHER TYPES OF THINGS .
YEAH .
UH .
IT IS A TIME CONSUMER .
IT IS .
IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO TO GROW AND I I ALWAYS THINK THAT I LL BE ABLE TO DO IT AND THEN I INEVITABLY DISCOVER THAT I HAVE NO INNATE MUSIC TALENT RELATIVE TO COMPOSITION AND THAT I STRUGGLE AND REALLY CA NT QUITE UNDERSTAND WHAT IS THAT OTHER PEOPLE TAKE FOR GRANTED .
YEAH .
IN COMPOSITION THEMES AND I KEYS AND THINGS ARE SOMETHING TO ME .
THAT REMAIN A MYSTERY .
NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I BANG ON THEM .
I HAVE A PRETTY GOOD MATHEMATICAL CONCEPT FOR WHAT S INVOLVED .
RIGHT .
UH BUT IN A IN A INNATE MUSIC SENSE THERE JUST SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING MISSING THERE .
WHICH IS ALWAYS FRUSTRATING FOR ME SINCE I HAVE PRETTY HIGH MATH APTITUDE AND I KEEP THINKING GEE I THOUGHT THAT ALL THE MATH AND MUSIC PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO GO HAND IN HAND BUT .
BUT IT DOES NT FOR ME .
NO IT S MAKING THAT THAT CONNECTION ESPECIALLY WITH THE MECHANICAL PARTS OF IT .
I WAS NEVER ABLE TO TO MASTER ALL THAT .
IN FACT MY BROTHER AND SISTER .
BOTH THEY WERE OH THIRTEEN SIXTEEN YEARS OLDER THAN I THEY WENT THROUGH THE UH PARENT THING WHERE YOU VE GOT TO PRACTICE OR YOU RE NOT GOING OUT TO PLAY THING .
AND WHEN IT CAME TO MY TURN .
THE FOLKS SAID NO WE RE NOT GOING THROUGH THAT AGAIN THEY SOLD THE PIANO AND IS THE TURNS OUT I WAS THE ONLY ONE .
WHO REALLY HAD AN INTEREST IN IT AND NEVER GOT TO SO I .
UHHUH .
THAT S ONE OF THINGS I FELT LIKE I MISSED IN LIFE AND I I REALLY IN FACT UH ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS TO DO NOW IS SIT DOWN AND LISTEN TO CHOPIN THAT IS PLAYED ON UH PIANO .
I JUST YOU KNOW I CAN JUST DRIFT OFF INTO SOME OTHER WORLD JUST LISTENING TO THAT FOR HOURS IF I EVER HAVE THE TIME TO DO THAT .
OH MUMBLEX .
MAYBE ONE OF THESE DAYS I LL YOU KNOW I M KIND OF LIKE YOU MAYBE ONE OF THESE DAYS I LL GET AROUND TO IT I LL DO SOMETHING WITH THE PIANO BUT PROBABLY NOT .
SO WE .
BOTH HAVE A SECRET BACKGROUND .
THAT SAYS SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER WE JUST KNEW WE WERE PIANO PLAYERS AND NEVER GOT A CHANCE UH .

WELL UM I M UH PRETTY PRO GUN CONTROL OVER ALL .
I UH I VE HAD A LOT OF ARGUMENTS WITH PEOPLE ABOUT THE ISSUE OF GUN CONTROL AND UH I MUST SAY THAT THERE ARE A COUPLE OF ARGUMENTS AGAINST UH STRONG GUN CONTROL .
WHICH .
I FIND VERY COMPELLING ALTHOUGH MOST THE PEOPLE .
WHO ARGUE GUN CONTROL WITH ME .
I FIND UH USE SORT OF CANNED ARGUMENTS YOU KNOW SORT OF THE N R .
A SLOGAN ARGUMENTS AND UM UH SEE I VE BEEN VERY FRUSTRATED WHEN I DO DEBATE WITH PEOPLE ABOUT IT .
UM I GUESS ON A ONE A SCALE OF ONE OF TEN .
I M PROBABLY AROUND A TWO IN TERMS OF FAIR RESTRICTING GUNS AND I HAVE TO ADMIT MOST OF THAT IS UH STRONG PERSONAL DISTASTE .
I DO NT LIKE THE IDEA OF PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO KILL ME WITH VERY LITTLE EFFORT .
UM AND UH GUNS ARE VERY SYMBOLIC OF THEM HAVING THAT POWER OVER ME .
WELL ME BEING FROM TEXAS .
UHHUH .
I HOPE YOU RE READY FOR THIS .
UM UH I LL GIVE IT .
A TRY .
I VE GOT MY TEXAN STEREOTYPES IN PLACE .
WELL I M NOT YOUR STEREOTYPICAL TEXAN .
I WAS RAISED AROUND GUNS HUNTING .
UHHUH .
SO I DO NT HAVE A FEAR OF FIRE ARMS IN ANY RESPECT .
UHHUH .
I RESP I RESPECT THEM AND WHAT .
THEIR CAPABILITIES ARE .
UHHUH .
AND ON TOP OF THAT SPENDING A GOOD PORTION OF MY EARLIER YEARS IN THE MILITARY AS A GREEN BERET I DEFINITELY RESPECT THE POWER OF WEAPONRY .
UHHUH .
IT .
S PRETTY POWER IS NT IT .
AND HERE IN HOUSTON AS WELL AS JUST ABOUT ANY BIG CITY ANYWHERE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AND HERE HERE HERE YOU GO HERE YOU THIS WILL BE BORDER LINE N R .
A .
WHICH .
I AM NOT A MEMBER OF .
OKAY .
OKAY .
WHEN YOU I MEAN YOU VE HEARD THE THE SLOGAN UM IF YOU OUTLAW GUNS THEN ONLY OUT LAWS WILL HAVE GUNS .
UHHUH .
THAT APPLIES TO ANYTHING AS WELL AS GUNS .
MUMBLEX A GUN .
WELL YOU YOU VE GOT WELL ANY OF THE BIG CITIES YOU VE GOT THE DIFFERENT RIVAL GANGS AND THEY RE HAVING THEIR LITTLE TURF WARS OVER THEIR LITTLE DRUG KINGDOMS AND SUCH .
UHHUH .
AND THEY GET OUT THEIR LITTLE MAC TENS THEY GET OUT THEIR LITTLE UZIS AND THEY RE GOING TO FIGHT WITH THEM .
AND IT DOES NT MATTER WHAT RESTRICTIONS YOU PUT ON THAT TYPE OF WEAPON OR A CLASS THREE FIREARM .
IF THEY WANT IT .
THEY LL GET IT .
I DO NT CARE IF IF THEY VE GOT TO GO DOWN INTO NEW MEXICO TO GET IT .
THEY LL GET IT AND THEY LL GET ACROSS THE BORDER .
NOW MY POSITION ALTHOUGH I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO USE FOR A FULLY AUTOMATIC WEAPON .
UHHUH .
ANYWAY .
SINCE I AM A LAWABIDING CITIZEN AND I HAVE NEVER HAD A FELONY IF I WANTED TO BUY ONE I DO NT THINK THERE SHOULD BE THAT BIG OF A RESTRICTION ON IT .
IF THEY WANT TO RUN A BACKGROUND CHECK ON ME FINE .
IF THEY WANT TO PUT A SEVEN DAY WAITING PERIOD FINE AGAIN .
UHHUH .
IF THEY WANT WANT ME TO PRESENT A LETTER FROM MY COUNTY SHERIFF SAYING THAT I VE GOT HIS PERMISSION TO HAVE AN AUTOMATIC WEAPON IN HIS COUNTY THAT S FINE TOO .
UHHUH .
UHHUH .
WHAT .
I DO NT GETS DANGEROUS IN TERMS OF CIVIL LIBERTIES BECAUSE PRETTY SOON IT .
S .
IT WOULD NT YOU DO NT WANT TO HAVE SOMEONE MAKING A PERSONAL TRUST IN THAT WAY I WOULD HOPE .
I MEAN BECAUSE I MEAN SOMEONE THE PERSONAL SHERIFF DOES NT LIKE DOES NT GET TO HAVE A GUN AND SOMEONE THE PERSONAL SHERIFF .
WELL .
MUMBLEX .
THE ONLY WELL THE CRITERIA .
THE SHERIFF WOULD HAVE TO FOLLOW HAS IS THIS GUY .
A CONVICTED FELON .
UH IS HE .
A HABITUAL TROUBLE MAKER .
ARE WE PICKING HIM UP EVERY SATURDAY .
YEAH .
FOR A DRUNK AND DISORDERLY AND IF HE HAD AN AUTOMATIC WEAPON COULD HE REALLY BE RAISING SOME PROBLEMS .
YOU KNOW JUST PROVING THAT YOU RE A BASICALLY A GOOD CITIZEN .
BUT IF YOU RE NOT A IF YOU RE NOT A BASICALLY GOOD CITIZEN YOU JUST TOLD ME THAT YOU RE GOING TO GET ONE OF THOSE GUNS ANYWAY .
IF IF THEY WANT THE FIREPOWER .
THEY CAN GET IT .
SO WHY HAV .
BECAUSE IT DOES NT MATTER HOW RESTRICTIVE YOU RE BORDER CONTROL POINTS ARE THEY LL GET IT ACROSS THE BORDER ONE WAY OR THE OTHER .
SO WHY HAVE ANY RESTRICTIONS AT ALL .
UH OKAY .
LET GO BACK TO THAT ONE TO TEN SCALE WHERE ONE .
BEING .
FULL GUN CONTROL .
UHHUH .
TEN BEING NONE .
YEAH .
I D SAID ABOUT AN EIGHT .
UHHUH .
UHHUH .
WELL WE CAN COULD BE .
I SAID THE RESTRICTIONS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ON FOR ANYBODY WHETHER IT BEING FOR HANDGUN A RIFLE A SHOTGUN I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM GO THROUGH EITHER I D LIKE TO SEE A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY NOT N R .
A BUT WHETHER IT BE THE YOUR STATE POLICE OR YOUR COUNTY POLICE FOR YOU TO BE ABLE PURCHASE .
A HANDGUN .
YOU GOT TO GO THROUGH THEIR COURSE AND GET CERTIFIED THAT YOU KNOW HOW TO PROPERLY HANDLE THE WEAPON HOW TO SAFELY HANDLE THE WEAPON HOW TO PROPERLY MAINTAIN IT THE THREE BASICS .
WELL THAT MAKES A LOT OF SINCE TO ME .
I MEAN I CERTAINLY FEEL THAT IF IF WE MAY DISAGREE ON WHEN SOMEONE SHOULD OWN A FIRE ARM BUT UH I CERTAINLY AGREE THAT IF SOMEONE OWNS A FIRE ARM .
THAT HAVE AS MUCH RESPONSIBILITY TO KNOW HOW DO USE IT SAFELY AS SOMEONE LEARNS HOW TO DRIVE IF NOT MORE SO .
WELL THE HAN IN THE HANDS OF THE WRONG PERSON .
THE CAR CAN BE JUST AS DEADLY AS THE WEAPON .
YEAH .
AS A AS A PISTOL .
WELL I HAVE A BICYCLE AND THAT SCARES ME TOO TO TELL YOU .
THE TRUTH BECAUSE I VE BEEN RUN OFF THE ROAD AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS .
WELL I M STILL I M STILL PUZZLED THOUGH WHAT IS THE ARGUMENT HOW DOES THE ARGUMENT WORK IF UH IF THE BAD GUYS ARE GOING TO HAVE GUNS ANYWAY .
WHAT S THE POINT OF PUTTING A RESTRICTIO BASICALLY THE RESTRICTIONS ARE JUST TO PENALIZE THE GOOD GUYS BECAUSE THE BAD GUYS ARE GOING TO GET THE GUNS ANYWAY THEY RE NOT GOING TO TAKE THOSE COURSES .
IS IT UH IS IT .
A WAY OF RAISING THE PRICES OF ILLEGAL GUNS .
WELL THERE S .
IF IT S NOT GOING TO CUT THE SUPPLY OF ILLEGAL GUNS .
IT MUST GOING TO AT LEAST RAISE THE PRICES DOES THAT UH MEAN ADVANTAGE .
UH NOT NECESSARILY A PRICE THING .
WHAT IS HAPPENING AT LEAST IN THIS STATE AND I EXPECT TO SEE IT IN OTHER STATES VERY SOON LEGISLATION BEEN INTRODUCED AS THAT IF A CITIZEN OF THE STATE BEING .
UHHUH .
MYSELF HAS NOT COMMITTED A FELONY AND HAS COMPLETED A CERTIFIED WEAPONS COURSE I CAN CARRY A WEAPON ON ME AT ALL TIMES CONCEALED OR UNCON UNCONCEALED .
UHHUH .
OKAY .
YOU YOU RE YOU RE FROM CALIFORNIA RIGHT .
UHHUH .
L .
A AREA .
UH NO .
BAY AREA .
SAN FRANCISCO .
OKAY .
BAY AREA .
OKAY .
YOU VE BEEN TO THE CITY .
UHHUH .
AND ALL THESE PEOPLE COME AROUND SOMEONE ATTEMPTS TO MUG ME .
I WOULD JU I WOULD AS IT STANDS NOW IF HE PULLS A BLADE ON ME .
WE RE EQUALLY MATCHED BECAUSE I CAN MEET HIM .
BLADE FOR BLADE .
UHHUH .
NOW IF THIS LEGISLATION COMES THROUGH HE .
PULL I M OUT WITH MY FAMILY .
UHHUH .
WE VE GONE SHOPPING WE RE FIXING TO GET IN THE CAR THIS GUY COMES UP HE PULLS A BLADE ON ME .
I CAN PULL A GUN ON HIM NOW .
WHEN YOU RE AND WHEN YOU RE LOOKING DOWN THE BARREL OF A HAND CANNON THINGS CHANGE REAL QUICK .
WHAT IF YOU RE LOOKING DOWN THE BARREL OF A HAND CANNON .
THEN IT S STILL EQUALLY MATCHED .
HAVING .
I .
HAVING SPENT TIME IN COMBAT .
I FEEL .
YEAH .
I FEEL IT BEFORE THEY LL GET THE GUN ON ME .
WELL .
IF I M .
I M I M SURE .
MUMBLEX AT THE SAME .
I M SURE GIVEN ALL .
TIME .
GIVEN ALL YOUR TRAINING .
I M SURE THAT YOU KNOW YOU D IF I WALK INTO A BAD NEIGHBORHOOD .
I M SURE I D WANT TO WALK THROUGH WITH YOU BECAUSE I M SURE YOU HAVE GOOD YOU KNOW FA FAR ABOVE THE AVERAGE INSTINCT FOR HOW TO USE GUNS AND HOW TO USE THEM EFFECTIVELY AND EVERYTHING .
UM I M QUITE CONCERNED THAT IF YOU LET EVERYONE .
HAS NT YET USED A GUN IN A HAVE NT HAS NT YET COMMITTED A FELONY IF YOU LET THEM .
ALL WALK AROUND CARRYING GUNS IN THIS SORT OF WILD WEST SCENARIO YOU RE GOING TO GET AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE SHOOTING GUNS PRETTY QUICKLY JUST GIVEN HUMAN NATURE .
YOU RE GOING TO START GETTING A LOT OF GUNFIRE .
IT S IT S HARD FOR ME TO IMAGINE THAT A A SITUATION OF YOU KNOW TAKE IT TO A LOGICAL EXTREME IF EVERYONE WALKING AROUND CARRYING A GUNS YOU RE NOT GOING TO HAVE AN INCREASE IN GUNFIRE .
I ACTUALLY IT S NO IT S MORE OF A POLICE ACTION IN ITSELF THE FACT THAT EVERYBODY IS PACKING A PIECE IS A DETERRENCE FOR SOMEONE SAYING WELL I M GOING TO MUG THIS GUY RIGHT HERE BUT HEY HE S CARRYING JUST AS MUCH FIREPOWER AS I CAN .
AND IF THEY RE SCA IF YOU GOT TO GO THROUGH A CERTIFICATION COURSE TO GET WHERE TO WHERE YOU CAN CARRY IT IN PUBLIC .
UHHUH .
THEN THIS INDIVIDUAL ALSO KNOWS THIS GUYS PRETTY GOOD WITH IT .
NOW WHETHER THIS PERSON IS MADE THE MORAL DECISION WHETHER HE CAN TAKE ANOTHER HUMAN LIFE OR NOT .
UHHUH .
THAT S ANOTHER TRIP .
UHHUH .
BUT .
UHHUH .
UHHUH .
IN DEFENSE OF MYSELF DEFENSE OF MY FAMILY OR DEFENSE OF MY FRIENDS I CAN BLOW SOMEBODY A WAY IN A HEART BEAT .
UHHUH .
EVEN EVEN MORE SO WHEN IT COMES TO MY MY WIFE AND SON .
YEAH .
ANYBODY .
I KNOW .
ANYBODY TRIES TO HURT THEM .
I WO NT EVEN BLINK .
NO .
I I UNDERSTAND THAT .
WHAT IF UH WHAT IF YOU THINK SOMEONE S TRYING TO HURT THEM AND YOU MAKE A MISTAKE .
THIS THIS IS WHERE THE QUESTION OF GUN CONTROL COMES IN .
YEAH .
WELL UH THAT .
WHAT .
THAT WAS THE TOPIC .
I CONSIDER GUN CONTROL IS BEING ABLE TO HIT MY TARGET WITH THE FIRST SHOT .
UHHUH .
SAY A PERSON UH UH GET ALL OF A SUDDEN MY COMBAT IN ME GOES UP AND SAY I VE GOT THE VIBES THIS GUYS FIXING TO DO SOMETHING I GO AHEAD AND PULL MY PIECE .
UHHUH .
AND I MAKE SURE THIS PERSONS SEES IT SO THAT HE S GOT NOW DOUBT THAT I WILL USE IT ON HIM AND I WILL USE IT RIGHT THEN .
UHHUH .
IF HE DOES NT BACK UP AT THAT POINT .
HE DESERVES WHAT .
HE GETS BECAUSE I HAVE SENT THE CLEAREST SIGNAL .
YOU MESS WITH ME YOU MESS WITH MY FAMILY I M GOING TO DUST YOU .
AS IT STANDS NOW I VE GOT TO DO THAT WITH A BLADE .
AND THE ONLY REASON .
I FEEL CONFID COM COM COMFORTABLE DOING .
THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE TRAINING .
I VE HAD .
UHHUH .
UHHUH .
WELL AS AS SOMEONE .
WHO WOULD WOULD POSSIBLY BE IN THE ROLE OF AN INDEPENDENT BYSTANDER I FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE WITH PEOPLE HAVING BLADES BECAUSE UH YOU RE NOT GOING TO GET BULLETS FLYING AROUND KILLING PEOPLE INSTANTLY AND UH .
WELL IF I M THE ONE DOING THE SHOOTING .
I DO NT MISS .
THAT S THE KIND OF TRAINING .
I VE HAD .
I MEAN .
OKAY .
WELL HAVE YOU EVER UH HAD A FAMILY REUNION .
YES .
OH .
AND UH LET ME TELL YOU .
THIS IS A REALLY NEAT THING TO DO TOO THAT THEY DID I DID NT DO IT .
SOME OF THE OTHER PEOPLE THE OLDER PEOPLE ORGANIZED IT .
UHHUH .
AND WHAT .
THEY DID THEY HAD UH A BOOK MADE UP AND IT WAS LIKE .
OH .
WHEN OUR ANCESTORS FIRST CAME OVER .
NO KIDDING .
AND THEN WHAT .
THEY DID WAS THEY ASKED EVERY FAMILY TO WRITE SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR FAMILY .

AND LIKE HOW MANY KIDS YOU HAD AND WHO .
YOU HAD MARRIED AND YOU KNOW IT WENT THROUGH LIKE AND IT SHOWED WHO .
MY UH WELL WHO .
MY HUSBAND S PARENTS WERE YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .

HE MARRIED AND THEN HOW MANY CHILDREN WE HAD AND THEN LIKE HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND IT WENT THROUGH THE WHOLE FAMILY AND STUFF .
OH THAT S SO NEAT .
AND IT WAS SO GOOD .
OH GREAT .
YEAH .
BUT IT IT REALLY DID YOU KNOW AND PLUS IT S GOT A LOT MORE PEOPLE INTERESTED IN IT BECAUSE .
UHHUH .
YOU GOT TO PARTICIPATE SORT OF .
YEAH .
SO SO DID EVERYBODY SEND IN THEIR INFORMATION AND THEY MADE A BOOK UP .
RIGHT .
ABOUT IT .
UHHUH .
AND THEN YOU COULD GET IT AT THE REUNION .
RIGHT .
AND EVERYBODY GOT A BOOK .
OH NICE .
THAT CAME TO THE REUNION .
AND IT TOLD LIKE UH YOU KNOW WHERE THE FIRST CONNALLY S CAME OVER .
UHHUH .
UHHUH .
AND UM IT TOLD WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THEY GOT THERE AND HOW MANY KIDS THEY HAD AND IT JUST KEPT COMING ON UP THROUGH THE GENERATIONS .
WOW .
SO IT WAS REALLY THAT WAS REALLY NEAT .
THAT IS NEAT .
AND .
SO DO YOU HAVE A BIG FAMILY .
WELL HE DOES .
OH HE DOES .
YEAH .
HE DOES I DO NT .
BUT UH HE HAS ENOUGH RELATIVES TO MAKE UP FOR ME NOT HAVING ANY .
THAT S KIND OF HOW MY HUSBAND AND I ARE .
I HAVE A KIND OF A BIG FAMILY AND HE JUST HAS HIMSELF AND HIS BROTHER AND HIS PARENTS .
UHHUH .
AND THAT S IT .
SO HE HAD TO KIND OF GET USED TO US WHEN WE FIRST STARTED GOING TOGETHER .
YEAH .
THAT S WHAT THAT S .
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN I WHEN I .
FIRST UH MET MY HUSBAND .
I SAID THIS CA NT BE YOU KNOW NOBODY CAN HAVE THIS MANY RELATIVES .
BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM LIVED IN LIKE A GROUP YOU KNOW DOWN ONE HIGHWAY .
UHHUH .
UHHUH .
AND THERE WAS A LAKE AND THEY .
ALL LIVED DOWN THERE BY IT .
OH HOW NICE .
AND SO WE WERE GOING DOWN .
THE HIGHWAY YOU KNOW AND HE KEPT SAYING THIS IS WHERE MY UNCLE LIVES AND THIS IS WHERE MY AUNT LIVES AND MY UNCLE .
OH MY GOSH .
AND I KEPT THINKING THIS GUY IS PUTTING ME ON .
NOBODY HAS THIS MANY RELATIVES YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
SO BUT .
HOW FUNNY .
THEY REALLY WERE ALL THERE .
AND ANOTHER THING .
THAT S REALLY GOOD ABOUT UH FAMILY REUNIONS .
UHHUH .
IS HAVING EVERYBODY JUST COOK WHATEVER IS THEIR SPECIALTY .
UHHUH .
AND BRING IT .
UHHUH .
AT BECAUSE NOBODY .
IT SEEMED LIKE LIKED THE SAME THING .
OH .
BUT YOU HAD A CHOICE AND THEN YOU GOT TO TASTE A LOT OF NEW DISHES AND STUFF TOO .
YEAH .
AND GET A LOT OF GOOD RECIPES .
YEAH .
WHERE IF YOU SAID A CERTAIN THING AND SAY OKAY WE RE ALL GOING TO HAVE FRIED FISH OR WE RE ALL GOING .
YEAH .
TO HAVE FRIED CHICKEN .
YEAH .
EVERYBODY MIGHT NOT LIKE THAT .
NOT BE ABLE TO DO IT .
SO DID PEOPLE COME LIKE FROM OUT OF TOWN TO THE REUNION OR .
OH YEAH .
YEAH .
THEY DID .
THEY CAME FROM ALL OVER .
DID YOU PUT THEM UP IN OTHER PEOPLE S HOUSES OR DID YOU HAVE HOTEL ROOMS OR HOW DID YOU DO IT .
UM THEY JUST STAYED WITH DIFFERENT ONES OF THEM .
THEY DID .
UHHUH .
THEY JUST CAME DOWN AND LIKE SAY OKAY THIS AUNT AND UNCLE KIP UH ALL THEIR KIDS AND THEIR GRAND KIDS AND EVERYTHING AND THEN .
UHHUH .
THEY HAD IT .
IT HAD GOTTEN SO BIG THAT THEY HAD IT AT THE CHURCH .

HOW NICE .
UH THEN THEY ATE OUT ON THE GROUND .
AND THEY JUST BROUGHT FOOD WITH THEM .
UHHUH .
DID THEY JUST HAVE LIKE OVER A WEEKEND .
IS THAT HOW THEY DID IT .
YEAH .
UHHUH .
UHHUH .
WELL I M REAL CURIOUS BECAUSE MY FAMILY IT DID NT SOUND I DO NT THINK MY FAMILY IS AS BIG AS YOUR HUSBAND S .
I DO NT THINK WE D NEED A WHOLE CHURCH BUT UM THE PROBLEM IS WE ARE ALL REALLY SCATTERED .
AROUND .
THERE IS NT ANY ONE PLACE WHERE MOST OF US LIVE SO IF WE EVER HAD A REUNION WE D KIND OF ALL HAVE TO STAY IN A HOTEL .
I MEAN YOU KNOW THERE WOULD BE ONE PERSON .
WHO LIVED THERE .
THAT WOULD HAVE A HOUSE BUT THEY COULD NT PUT EVERYBODY UP .
SO IT I THINK IT WOULD GET KIND OF EXPENSIVE .
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT .
YOU CAN DO .
HUH .
A LOT OF THESE LAKES AND THINGS IF YOU COULD FIND A CENTRALLY LOCATED LIKE SAY ABOUT THE SAME DISTANCE FOR ALL OF YOU .
ALL TO COME .
UHHUH .
THEY HAVE THESE PLACES WHERE YOU CAN RENT THEM AND IT YOU KNOW LIKE ON A LAKE .
UHHUH .
LIKE UH IT S A BIG PLACE I MEAN YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
IT .
S GOT LITTLE ROOMS .
THAT SEPARATE OFF OF IT AND STUFF .
UHHUH .
AND IT S NOT VERY EXPENSIVE THAT WAY .
OH YOU MEAN SO OH I SEE SO EVERYBODY COULD STAY TOGETHER .
RIGHT .
IT .
S LIKE A .
YEAH .
THEY HAVE LIKE A .
A HOUSE OR SOMETHING .
A CONVENTION TYPE THING .
UHHUH .
AND THEN IT HAS LITTLE ROOMS OFF OF IT WHERE .
OH .
YOU KNOW YOU D GO AND SLEEP AT NIGHT TIME .
BUT THEN IT HAS LIKE A KITCHENETTE AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT YOU .
SEE THAT WOULD BE GREAT BECAUSE THEN YOU COULD SPEND SO MUCH MORE TIME TOGETHER .
RIGHT .
THAN IF YOU .
ALL WERE IN YOUR OWN HOTELS OR SOMETHING .
AND ANOTHER .
AND THEN EVERY TIME .
YOU WANTED TO GO EAT WITH SOMEBODY YOU D PROBABLY HAVE TO GO TO OUT EAT OR SOMETHING .
IT WOULD RUN INTO A LOT OF MONEY .
SO .
YEAH .
BUT THEY HAD THAT WAS YOU KNOW THAT .
THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN .
WHAT .
YOU CAN DO IS YOU CAN WRITE DIFFERENT PLACES THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE .
UHHUH .
TELL THEM .
WHAT .
YOU RE INTERESTED IN .
UHHUH .
ASK THEM .
WHAT .
THEY HAVE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AT AREA LAKES AND ALL .
YEAH .
IF THEY HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE NOW EVERY TIME .
WE PLAN ANYTHING JUST ABOUT WE WRITE TO THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF WHERE WE RE GOING BECAUSE .
UHHUH .
YOU CAN FIND OUT SO MUCH EASIER .
YOU GET A .
THAT WAY THAN TRY TO LOCATE IT YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
CALLING DIFFERENT PLACES CAN R REALLY RUN YOU UP A BILL .
YEAH .
BUT IF YOU CAN FIND A CENTRALLY LOCATED PLACE WHERE EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE TO COME ABOUT THE SAME DISTANCE I MEAN YOU CA NT GET IT EXACT YOU KNOW USUALLY .
OH YEAH .
BUT UH AND THEN EVERYBODY GOES TO THAT PLACE .
AND THAT IS NOT BAD AT ALL .
UHHUH .
UHHUH .
BUT THEY HAVE LOT OF TIMES THEY LL HAVE LIKE UH LITTLE CABINS .
UHHUH .
AND THREE OR FOUR OR FIVE FAMILIES CAN STAY IN THOSE CABINS BECAUSE THEY HAVE YOU KNOW JUST THE SINGLE BUNK BEDS AND STUFF .
UHHUH .
AND THEY CAN ALL STAY IN THOSE CABINS .
AND THEN YOU KNOW YOU CAN HAVE COOKOUTS AND STUFF LIKE THAT .
THAT DOES NT COST YOU AS MUCH .
THAT WOULD BE GREAT .
THAT WOULD BE REALLY NICE .
YEAH .
BUT THAT S UH YOU KNOW THAT S THE BEST WAY .
I FOUND .
YEAH .
BECAUSE WHENEVER YOU HAVE .
THAT SOUNDS GOOD .
SOMETHING WHERE YOU GO AND NOW WE HAD ONE THIS WAS BEFORE I LOST A LOT MORE OF MY FAMILY BUT IT WAS NT ANY OF MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY ANYWAY .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE I DID NT HAVE ANY OF THEM LEFT .
BUT UM .
UHHUH .
THEY HAD UH UH THING WHERE YOU COULD EVERYBODY COULD COME AND MEET AND GO OUT TO EAT .
UHHUH .
BUT I DID NT THINK THAT WAS AS GOOD .
BECAUSE .
YEAH .
IT WAS LIKE YOU KNOW YOU COULD NT REALLY TALK AND STUFF LIKE YOU COULD WHEN .
YEAH .
YOU WERE AT THE LAKE .
YEAH YEAH .
OR SOMEWHERE YOU KNOW WHERE YOU WERE OUT .
RIGHT .
THIS WAS LIKE EVERYBODY CAME INTO TOWN AND WENT TO THIS RESTAURANT .
AND YOU HAVE TO SIT AT A TABLE AND JUST YEAH .
YEAH .
AND IT JUST I DID NT LIKE THAT MUCH .
WELL UM DID YOU WAS IT HARD TO DECIDE WHO TO INVITE AND WHO NOT TO INVITE .
I MEAN DID YOU HAVE TO DRAW A LINE OR DID THE PEOPLE .
THAT HAD THAT REUNION HAVE TO DRAW A LINE .
NO .
LIKE THEY JUST WHOEVER .
WHAT .
THEY DID WAS .
WANTED TO COME .
WELL SEE WHAT .
THEY DID WAS OKAY THEY UH THEY WROTE TO ALL THE INITIAL PEOPLE YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
THE THE OLDEST ONES .
RIGHT .
OKAY THEN THOSE IN TURN GOT A HOLD OF THESE OTHER ONES .
UHHUH .
AND THEY HAD LIKE I THINK THERE WAS FOUR OR FIVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
THAT WOULD CALL .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW SOME OF THEM IF THEY DID NT HAVE THEIR ADDRESSES AND ALL ON THEM AND YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
THEY TOLD THEM THAT WHAT .
WE HAD TO DO WAS WHEN WE SENT BACK IN OUR INFORMATION WE HAD TO TELL THEM HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE GOING TO BE COMING YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
AND THEN WHEN THEY WHEN THEY TALKED TO US OR WHEN THEY SENT US .
THE LETTER IT UH YOU KNOW TO GET THE INFORMATION AND ALL .
UHHUH .
IT ASKED YOU KNOW WILL YOU BE WILLING TO BRING AND YOU HAD TO CHECK OFF WHAT ALL .
YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO BRING .
OH I SEE .
AND SO REALLY THERE WAS NT ANY PROBLEM WITH THAT S THE REASON .
IT ENDED UP IN A CHURCH BECAUSE .
UH .
I MEAN THERE WAS JUST SO MANY OF THEM .
THERE YEAH YEAH .
BUT IT TURNED OUT SO MUCH BETTER LIKE THAT .
YEAH .
BECAUSE EVERYBODY KNEW THEY KNEW AHEAD OF TIME HOW MANY PEOPLE TO EXPECT .
RIGHT .
NOW IF THERE WAS A SICKNESS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I MEAN YOU KNOW YOU RE NOT GOING TO LOSE .
SURE .
THAT MANY .
SURE .
NO THAT WOULD JUST BE A FEW .
RIGHT .
BUT HOW ABOUT LIKE BECAUSE OF DIVORCE AND STUFF LIKE THAT .
LIKE MY PARENTS ARE DIVORCED .
OKAY WELL .
AND THEY ARE BOTH REMARRIED AND YOU KNOW THERE I MEAN THERE S I DO NT KNOW .
WELL SEE THEN OKAY IF YOU WANTED THEM .
BOTH TO COME .
YEAH .
THEN YOU WOULD PUT YOU WOULD HAVE PUT THAT DOWN ON THE LIST AND YOU WOULD HAVE SENT YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN THE ONE .
THAT SENT THEIR INVITATION TO THEM .
YEAH .
AND ASK FOR THEIR INFORMATION .
YEAH .
SO THEN .
TO SEND BACK TO THOSE OTHER PEOPLE .
I I M KIND OF LIKE IN CONTROL OVER WHO COMES .
UH JUST FROM MY FAMILY .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE ONCE IT WENT TO THE THE OLDEST PEOPLE AND THEN THEY KNEW WHO .
THEY WANTED TO INVITE .
YEAH .
THEN THEY SENT THEIR LITTLE THINGS TO US .
YEAH .
OKAY IT WAS UP TO ME .
UHHUH .
WHO .
I WAS GOING TO YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
WHETHER I WANTED MY KIDS AND YOU KNOW MY ANY OF MY FAMILY TO COME .
RIGHT .
I SEE .
SO .
I SEE THAT S A PRETTY GOOD IDEA TO DO IT .
THAT WAY .
AND THEN YOU KNOW IT NEVER DID LIKE IF I DID NT WANT SOMEBODY TO COME THEN I JUST WOULD NT SEND THEM .
ONE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRES .
UHHUH .
SO THERE REALLY WAS NT A PROBLEM .
THAT WAY .
RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT .
WELL THAT S A REAL GOOD IDEA .
WELL .
YEAH .
BUT I TELL YOU .
WHAT THAT S THE NEATEST BOOK .
WE VE GOT .
I BET .
COURSE .
WE VE GOT WE VE STILL GOT IT AND THEY CHARGED US I THINK IT WAS LIKE IT WAS LIKE FIVE OR SIX DOLLARS I CA NT REMEMBER .
UHHUH .
EXACTLY YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
THAT WE PAID FOR THE BOOK TO BE PRINTED .
YEAH .
AND IT S NOT UH IT S NOT A HARD BACK BOOK IT S JUST A OH LIKE A YOU KNOW FOLDER TYPE THING .
UHHUH .
BUT IT HAS THE ENTIRE YOU KNOW IT HAS EVERYBODY THAT YOU COULD EVER IMAGINE .
HOW NEAT .
AND SOME .
YOU COULD NT .
YEAH I KNOW THAT S REALLY NEAT .
THAT S REALLY NEAT .
AND IT WILL BE SOMETHING .
MY KIDS WILL HAVE YOU KNOW .
JUST LIKE .
I WAS JUST THINKING OF THAT .
YEAH .
WHAT .
YOU COULD TELL YOUR KIDS .
BECAUSE IF YOU STOP AND THINK I DO NT KNOW IF YOU RE LIKE ME BUT I KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT BEFORE MY GRANDPARENTS .
UHHUH .
UHHUH .
I MEAN VERY VERY LITTLE ABOUT IT .
I JUST THE THING IS I KNOW A LOT OF STORIES BUT I CA NT REMEMBER WHO .
IT WAS ABOUT .
MY GRANDPARENTS TOLD US WHEN I WAS GROWING UP AND EVEN WHEN I WAS AN ADULT .
THEY STILL TELL ALL KINDS OF STORIES ABOUT THEIR PARENTS AND THEIR COUSINS AND THEIR BEST FRIENDS CAUSE THEY .
ALL GREW UP IN NEW YORK CITY BUT I CA NT YOU KNOW I REMEMBER THESE STORIES BUT I HAVE NO IDEA .
WHO .
IT WAS THAT WAS IN THOSE STORIES .
YEAH .
SO I MEAN I COULD NT GIVE AN ACCURATE I COULD NT TELL MY KIDS .
WHAT YOU KNOW THOSE PEOPLE WERE LIKE I JUST REMEMBER THEY HAD SOME FUNNY STORIES BUT I DO NT KNOW WHO .
IT WAS .
MAYBE WHAT .
YOU COULD DO IF YOU COULD NT GET INTO A FULL FAMILY REUNION .
UHHUH .
AND YOU WANTED TO GO BACK SOME BUT THEN USUALLY WHEN YOU FIND OUT SOME INFORMATION FROM LIKE YOUR PARENTS .
YEAH .
THEN YOU CAN FIND OUT FROM YOU KNOW YOU CAN FIND SOMEBODY ELSE THAT CAN TELL YOU .
SOMETHING ELSE ABOUT THESE .
OKAY .
ALL RIGHT .

WHAT KIND OF RECYCLING PROGRAMS DO YOU HAVE IN ROWLETT .
UM TH WELL RIGHT NOW THEY VE GOT A KIND OF A CENTRAL LOCATION OFF OF THE MAIN HIGHWAY AND THEY VE GOT SOME GREAT BIG BINS THERE FOR NEWSPAPER UM PLASTIC UM I THINK THREE BINS FOR GLASS WHITE GREEN AND WHATEV WHATEVER .
OTHER COMBINATION THERE IS .
AND AND I THINK THEY VE GOT A COMP UH SOME KIND OF CONTAINER FOR ALUMINUM .
PLANO S DOING REAL GOOD ON THAT .
THEY HAVE UH THEY START OFF PUTTING OUT GREAT BIG HUGE GARBAGE CANS .
UHHUH .
WHICH .
WE RE SUPPOSED TO PUT ALL OUR WEEK S GARBAGE INTO IT AND OF COURSE .
IT DOES NT FIT RIGHT NOW .
YEAH .
BUT NOW WE START IN MAY BREAKING IT DOWN AND THEY RE PICKING IT .
ALL UP .

SO THEY RE GOING TO BY AND WE HAVE TO SEPARATE OUR PAPERS AND OUR GLASS AND THEN UH THEY HAVE ONE DAY FOR LIKE UM OH EVERYTHING .
YOU PICKED UP FROM YOUR YARD .
UHHUH .
AND WE PUT THAT IN DISPOSABLE BAGS AND THEY PICK THAT UP ON MONDAY .
UM .
SO IT S REALLY GREAT .
I I M REALLY GOING HEAD YOU KNOW COMPLETELY FOR IT I THINK IT S MARVELOUS .
WELL THAT S GOOD .
WELL ROWLETT HAD SENT SENT OUT A SURVEY NOT TOO LONG AGO UM IN TERMS IN HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE INTERESTED IN HAVING A A PICK UP I GUESS ON THE DAYS THEY DO TRASH OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
AND APPARENTLY A LOT OF PEOPLE RESPONDED TO IT .
FAVORL FAVORABLY BECAUSE THEY RE GOING TO DO IT .
I DO NT KNOW HOW HOW SOON THEY RE GOING TO DO IT OR HOW ORGANIZED .
IT S GOING TO BE BUT THEY RE THEY RE SUPPOSED TO INITIATE THAT SOME SOMETIME IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS .
WELL DOES YOUR UH WHERE YOU WORK DO THEY ALSO HAVE ALUMINUM CANS PICKUPS AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
UM I VE NEVER NOTICED THAT .
WE DO NT HAVE A A WHOLE LOT BECAUSE WE RE IN A HOSPITAL SETTING SO MOST OF THE THINGS WE HAVE ARE THROUGH OUR CAFETERIA .
UM .
WELL DOWN IN THE CAFETERIA DO THEY HAVE ANY PLACE WHERE YOU CAN PUT YOUR YOU KNOW POP CANS AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
UM NO .
THERE S THERE S ONLY ONE POP MACHINE AND IT S NOT ACCESSIBLE TO THE CAFETERIA NOW SO UH MAINLY WHAT .
THEY SERVE IN THERE IS JUICE AND COFFEE AND TEA .
SO YOU DO NT HAVE MUCH CHOICE THERE .
NO .
NOT NOT REALLY .
WELL I WORK AT UH J C PENNY AND LAST WEEK .
THEY BROUGHT THEY HAVE A SIGN UP THAT SAYS FOR ONE FULL WEEK .
UHHUH .
YOU BRING IN YOUR OLD WIRE HANGERS AND THEY RE GOING TO RECYCLE THEM .
UM .
SO IT S GETTING PEOPLE CLEAN OUT THEIR CLOSETS AND SUCH .
UHHUH .
AND THEN LIKE THE WEEK BEFORE THAT THEY SAID GO THROUGH YOUR CUPBOARDS AND ANY FOOD .
THAT IS STILL GOOD BRING IT IN AND THEY BROUGHT IT DOWN TO THE SHELTERS .
AND THEY HAVE ONE TWO THEY HAVE THREE I THINK THAT I KNOW OF .
UHHUH .
FOR CANS FOR PEOPLE HAVE POP AND THEY PUT THEM RIGHT NEAR WHERE THEY HAVE THE TIME CARDS .
YEAH .
AND IT WORKS GREAT .
AND THEY HAVE ONE IN THE ROOM WHERE THE SNACK MACHINES ARE TOO .
THAT S GOOD .
SO THEY RE REALLY GOING AT IT AND I THINK IT S MARVELOUS BECAUSE .
YEAH .
I I GUESS ROWLETT S DONE A LOT FOR THE SIZE TOWN .
IT IS .
WELL .
AND I THINK THEY RE TRYING TO TO MAKE SOME CHANGES .
I I NOTICED AT THE LIBRARY OR SOMEPLACE THIS PAST UH MONTH MONTH AND A HALF AGO THEY WERE HAVING A SPEAKER UM TALK ABOUT DOING LAWN WORK AND H HOW IMPORTANT .
IT IS TO TO CUT YOUR LAWN WITHOUT A BAG .
JUST TO KIND OF MULCH IT .
UHHUH .
RATHER THAN BAG IT UP BECAUSE OF A ALL THE .
THE GRASS .
THAT S BEING BAGGED AND BEING HAULED AWAY BY THE GARBAGE TRUCKS AND STUFF AND IT S UH I GUESS A LOT MORE E ECOLOGICAL TO JUST MOW THE GRASS AND LET IT WORK IT S WAY BACK INTO THE SOIL .
WELL DID YOU WATCH THE PROGRAM .
THE OTHER NIGHT ON UM WAS IT SAVE AMERICA .
I SAW PART OF THAT .
IT WAS GOOD .
THE ONLY THING .
I G THOUGHT UM THAT I HAVE NT BEEN TRYING IS WHEN I YOU KNOW GO TO TAKE A SHOWER TO SAVE THE WATER .
UHHUH .
AND TO PUT IT ON MY PLANTS .
WHICH .
I HAD NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT BEFORE .
UHHUH .
BUT I VE ALREADY GONE TO OH I STARTED YEARS AGO I GUESS NOT YEARS AGO BUT YEAH I WOULD SAY FIVE YEARS AGO TURNING OFF MY FOUNTAIN I MEAN MY WATER FAUCET .
UHHUH .
IN THE SINK WHEN I BRUSH MY TEETH .
BUT I DID NT REALIZE THAT WAS THE BIGGEST WASTE OF WATER .
YEAH .
THAT WAS SURPRISING TO ME .
UM .
I MISSED THAT QUESTION TOTALLY I MEAN REALLY BAD .
I M TRYING TO THINK I DID NT MISS TOO MANY I CA NT REMEMBER WHAT .
MY SCORE WAS BUT I DID EXCEEDING WELL .
I WAS SURPRISED .
BUT I DID NT REALIZE THAT OUR GARBAGE IS NT BEING DECOMPOSED .
THAT WAS A SHOCKER TO ME .
YEAH WELL THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS .
THAT ARE NT I M THAT S UH ONE OF THE THINGS I WONDER ABOUT UH ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WAS DO YOU THINK MORE SHOULD BE DONE OR SOMETHING ELSE .
I I WONDER ABOUT SOME OF THE PROD PRODUCTS THAT THEY DO NT TAKE LIKE SOME OF THE PLASTICS AND THINGS THAT THEY DO NT TAKE .
UH WHY WHY THEY COULD NT DO MORE RECYCLING WITH THOSE .
WELL I WAS IN UH BIZMART .
THE OTHER DAY AND WHAT .
I DO NT UNDERSTAND IS THERE IS RECYCLED PAPER IN THERE AND IT COST MORE THAN REGULAR PAPER .
UM .
AND IT WAS ONLY I THINK UH FORTY CENTS MORE YOU KNOW FIFTY CENTS MORE BUT .
YEAH .
IT UPSET ME TO REALIZE THAT HEY THE RECYCLING THAT THEY RE GOING THROUGH THE EXPENSE OF RECYCLING BUT PEOPLE ARE NT BUYING IT SO THE COST OF IT IS HIGHER .
TRUE .
YEAH I NOTICED THAT ABOUT THINGS LIKE I S I SEEN A LOT OF ADDS RECENTLY FOR ORGANIC FERTILIZERS AND AND LAWN ADDITIVES AND THAT TYPE OF THING BUT THE COST IS IS LIKE DOUBLE OR SOMETIMES TRIPLE .
UHHUH .
WHAT .
THE REGULAR THINGS YOU FERTILIZERS AND THINGS YOU BUY .
SO IN IN TERMS OF THAT IT S YOU KNOW AND FOR THE ENVIRONMENT .
IT S IT S THERE S A GOOD REASON TO DO IT BUT THE COST IS KIND OF PROHIBITIVE .
NOW SEE THAT S RECYCLING YOU KNOW COMPANIES .
THAT DO AT LEAST GO INTO IT I D LIKE TO SEE SUBSIDY BY THE GOVERNMENT OR SOMETHING OR TAXWISE OR SOMETHING HEAVILY ENOUGH TO WHERE THEY COULD GET THEIR PRICES LOWER THAN REGULAR .
UHHUH .
SO THAT PEOPLE WOULD USE THIS STUFF RE OVER AGAIN .
YEAH IT S A GOOD IDEA .
IT .
S LIKE WHEN HE WAS SAYING UH WHICH .
ONE WAS RECYCLABLE WHICH WAS REUSABLE .
UHHUH .
AND THE RECYCLE ONES ARE BETTER TO USE BUT LOTS OF TIMES YOU DO NT EVEN SEE THE SIGNS ON THE BOTTLES .
YEAH TRUE .
AND IF WE RE GOING TO REALLY DO SOMETHING THEY OUGHT TO PUT THAT STUFF OUT BIGGER FOR PEOPLE TO SEE IT .
I HAD TO PUT MY BIFOCALS ON TO SEE IT .
UM .
THAT S HARD WHEN YOU RE IN A GROCERY STORE AND YOU RE SHORT ANYWAY .
YEAH .
YOU HAVE TO GET ENOUGH NERVE TO ASK SOMEBODY TO TAKE SOMETHING OFF THE TOP SHELF .
YOU HAVE NT GOT ENOUGH NERVE TO SAY WELL PUT IT BACK IT S NOT RECYCLABLE .
I I D HEARD SOMETHING STRANGER TALK ABOUT BOTTLES .
THE OTHER DAY ON UH ON THE RADIO STATION I THINK IT .
S K L T Y .
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE I THINK IT S IN CANADA THEY RE USING OH RECYCLABLE MILK JUGS PLASTIC MILK JUGS .
UHHUH .
AS A A REINFORCEMENT FOR ROADS .
OH REALLY .
FOR ROAD REPAIRS .
AND APPARENTLY THEY THEY DO NT BREAK DOWN VERY EASILY AND .
OH .
THEY DO NT EXPAND OR OR CONTRACT WHEN THE WEATHER CHANGES AND THIS IS KIND OF AN UNUSUAL USE FOR THAT TYPE OF THING .
YOU KNOW THEY RE ALONG THAT SAME LINE THEY SAID THEY WERE USING UM WHAT IS OH I KNOW IT WAS TOILETS .
YOU KNOW THE OLD ONES .
UHHUH .
SMASHING THEM UP BECAUSE THEY RE THAT STUFF .
THERE IS GREAT FOR IN ROAD WORK .
HUH .
AND I THOUGHT WELL THAT S GOOD .
AND THEN I SAW RECYCLING ON TIRES BETWEEN UH WELL HOSES WERE BEING USED .
UHHUH .
AND UH UH SOAKER HOSES MADE OUT OF OLD TIRES .
YEAH .
WHAT ELSE SOMETHING ELSE WAS MADE OUT OF OLD TIRES I WAS TRYING TO REMEMBER WHAT .
IT WAS .
OH I CA NT THINK OF IT NOW .
BUT I WAS I WAS TRYING TO GET MY UH KIDS YOU KNOW TO SEE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE COULD COME UP WITH FOR RECYCLING PURPOSES .
UHHUH .
AND JUST ANYTHING TO YOU KNOW RECYCLE RATHER THAN KEEP THROWING IT AWAY BUT MY BIGGEST PROBLEM IS I TAKE THE BAGS OUT OF THE STORE BUY THE BAGS TO BRING THE BACK AND THEN I FORGET TO BRING THEM IN THE STORE .
YEAH .
I M FOREVER GOING BACK OUT TO MY CAR TO PICK UP MY BAGS TO BRING THEM AND TAKE MY GARBAGE BACK OUT .
I WISH THEY D REALLY PUSH THIS RECYCLING BIT BECAUSE I NEVER REALIZED I REALLY DID NT REALIZE HOW MUCH STUFF .
I ACTUALLY THROW AWAY .
WELL I THINK THE THE MORE PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF IT THE THE MORE .
THEY LL DO .
I THINK THAT S JUST THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS KEEPING IT IN IN FRONT OF THE PUBLIC SO THEY UNDERSTAND HOW SERIOUS THE PROBLEM IS AND HOW IMPORTANT .
IT IS TO DO THAT .
YOU KNOW WHAT .
I D LIKE TO SEE A LITTLE MORE .
I DO NT HAVE ANY .
LITTLE TINY KIDS .
UHHUH .
BUT IF THEY GET THE LITTLE TINY KIDS SAVING IT NOW .
YEAH .
IN FIVE YEARS WHEN THEY GET BIGGER IT LL WORK A LITTLE BIT MORE TOO .
TRUE .
BECAUSE IT S WE VE ALL GOT TO DO IT RIGHT NOW .
I JUST I REALLY AMAZED TO FIND OUT THAT WHAT IS IT EIGHTY PER CENT ARE FILLED NOW IN IN GARBAGE FILLS .
IN FIVE YEARS WE RE SUPPOSED TO BE AT MAX .
UHHUH .
I DO NT THINK I CAN KEEP MY OWN GARBAGE .

SO THEY RE REALLY NOT FULL FULL FORCE INTO IT BUT THEY RE TRYING SO WE RE ATTEMPTING IT BUT I WISH WE COULD DO MORE .
YEAH THERE S THERE S BEEN NO EMPHASIS ON RECYCLING AT ALL IN SAN ANTONIO .
I USED TO WORK FOR THE POWER COMPANY HERE AND THERE WAS DISCUSSION FOR A WHILE ABOUT UH BUILDING A GARBAGE BURNING UH .
UHHUH .
ELECTRIC GENERATION PLANT BUT IT JUST WAS NT COST EFFECTIVE AT THE TIME .
OH .
AND THERE S THERE S A LITTLE RECYCLING TRUCKS AND THINGS THROUGHOUT THE CITY BUT THERE IS NT ANY UH ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN .
THERE S JUST NOT ANY PUSH TO RECYCLE .
HUH .
I RECYCLE MY NEWSPAPERS AND UH ALUMI MY ALUMINUM STUFF .
RIGHT THAT S WHAT .
I DO .
BUT UH THEY MAKE IT AS HARD AS POSSIBLE IT S NOT VERY CONVENIENT TO DO .
RIGHT WHEN THEY PUT CENTERS AND STUFF LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
YEAH WELL WE HAVE THOSE UH WHICH .
I THINK IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS IS THOSE CASH FOR CANS .
I DO NT KNOW IF YOU .
ALL HAVE THOSE THINGS AROUND .
YES .
AND I REALLY LIKE THAT BECAUSE THAT MAKES IT REAL CONVENIENT BECAUSE THEY RE IN ALMOST EVERY SHOPPING CENTER AND YOU CAN JUST STOP BY .
NOW EVERYTHING ELSE LIKE THE TRA UH PAPER AND PLASTIC AND STUFF .
YOU STILL HAVE TO GO TO THE CENTERS BUT .
UHHUH .
BUT FOR ALUMINUM .
THAT S REAL NICE AND I STARTED DOING THAT AT WORK .
UM I PUT OUT A A TRASH CAN AND AND FOR PEOPLE TO PUT THEIR ALUMINUM CANS IN .
UHHUH .
AND THAT S REALLY HELPED A LOT I MEAN EVERYBODY S PITCHED IN AND .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW IT DOES NT BOTHER THEM TO WALK LITTLE BIT FARTHER PUT THEIR ALUMINUM IN A CAN RATHER THAN JUST THROWING IT IN THEIR TRASH CAN .
YEAH .
SO I REALLY I REALLY LIKE THAT BUT PEOPLE ARE REALLY CONCERNED IT S JUST THAT SOMETIMES IT S NOT THE RIGHT PEOPLE .
YEAH .
WHICH IS REALLY REALLY SAD BECAUSE I WISH WE WOULD DO MORE .
AT WORK .
WE STARTED UH ALL THE RECYCLING STUFF .
THEY RE REALLY TRYING I THINK WHAT STARTED IT AT WORK WAS THAT PLANET EARTH THING .
WE HAD LAST YEAR .
YES .
AND UH THAT REALLY STARTED A LOT OF STUFF OFF BUT YOU KNOW SOMETIMES IT DWINDLES DOWN .
YEAH WHERE I WORK NOW WE RECYCLE ALL THE COMPUTER PAPER .
THAT S GOOD .
BUT THAT S ABOUT THE EXTENT OF IT .
WELL THAT S UH AT LEAST YOUR TRYING SOMETHING .
YEAH YEAH .
IT S JUST YEAH IT WOULD BE NICE IF IT COULD BE MORE .
AND I M SURE THAT THE UH DRIVING FACTOR FOR RECYCLING THE COMPUTER PAPER IS THAT WE GET PAID TO DO SO .
OH DO YOU REALLY .
WE SELL THE PAPER BACK TO THE UH TO A PAPER MANUFACTURING COMPANY .
WELL THAT S A NEAT IDEA .
WELL IT IT DEFRAYS THE COST OF BUYING THE PAPER I THINK .
I NOT BY MUCH BUT IT DOES DEFRAY IT SOME .
RIGHT .
ENOUGH TO MAKE IT WORTH OUR WHILE TO HAVE SEVERAL BINS THROUGH OUT THE BUILDING .
WELL THAT S THAT S REALLY GOOD I MEAN AT LEAST THEY RE TRYING .
YEAH .
YEAH I KNOW A LOT OF COMPANIES .
THAT WASTE SO MUCH THAT I M EVEN TRYING YOU KNOW THAT WAS ONE THING .
WE NOTICED LAST WEEK THAT WE HAD SOME NEW PEOPLE MOVE INTO OUR BUILDING AND YOU KNOW THE NICE CARDBOARD BOXES THAT YOU MOVE PACKING BOXES .
YES .
AND THEY WERE JUST USED ONE TIME AND THROWN IN THE DUMPSTER AND I THOUGHT I DO NT UNDERSTAND THIS YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
WE RE TRYING TO CUT COST AND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT AND AND RECYCLE AND ALL THAT STUFF AND AND HERE WE ARE WASTING .
AND I DO NT UNDERSTAND SOMETIMES THE WAY THE THINKING THE LOGIC BEHIND IT .
WELL THE LAST TIME UH SOMEONE MOVED OFFICES IN MY BUILDING AND UH THE UH PROPERTIES PEOPLE CAME IN WITH ALL WITH THE GOOD CARDBOARD BOXES .
NOT THE CHEAP ONES OF COURSE .
UHHUH .
AND PACKED EVERYTHING UP AND MOVED THEM AND LEFT THEM LYING AROUND I I TOOK SEVERAL HOME BECAUSE I M MOVING PRETTY SOON AND THEY RE GOOD BOXES .
THAT S EXACTLY WHAT .
I DID .
AND THEY WERE JUST GOING TO THROW THEM AWAY .
EXACTLY WHAT .
I DID EXACTLY .
YEAH .
BECAUSE I DID NT WANT TO WASTE THAT .
HUHUH .
AND IT S HARD ENOUGH TO FIND GOOD PACKING BOXES MUMBLEX .
RIGHT AND AND THESE BOXES ARE YOU CAN UNFOLD THEM .
RIGHT .
SO YOU KNOW THERE THEY DO NT TAKE UP MUCH STORAGE SPACE .
EXACTLY RIGHT WELL THAT S VERY GOOD .
YEAH YEAH I I FELT A LITTLE GUILTY ABOUT TAKING THE BOXES FOR ABOUT TWO SECONDS UNTIL I REALIZED THEY WOULD BE THROWN AWAY SO .
RIGHT RIGHT .
I THOUGHT WELL I WAS DOING THEM .
A FAVOR BY TAKING THEM .
I FOUND ABOUT FIVE UH ABOUT NINE OF THEM .
THAT HAD NOT EVEN BEEN FOLDED INTO BOXES .
YEAH .
THAT WERE IN THE DUMPSTERS .
OH GOSH SO MANY PEOPLE NEED SO MANY PEOPLE GO TO THE GROCERY STORE AND STUFF AND GET THOSE BOXES .
UHHUH .
WHEN YOU KNOW THESE ARE PERFECT SO .
YEAH THE ONES AT THE GROCERY STORE HALF THE TIME THEY VE PULLED THE LID OFF SO YOU CA NT USE IT ANYWAY .
RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT .
THOSE AND THE REAL STURDY BOXES THAT COPY ROOM PAPER COMES IN WITH THE NICE LIDS .
THOSE GET THROWN AWAY .
UHHUH RIGHT .
AND I AM CONSTANTLY SCOUTING OUT THE COPY ROOM FOR THOSE BOXES .
THAT S EXACTLY WHAT .
I DO .
THOSE ARE PERFECT BOXES TO PUT FILES IN .
UHHUH .
THEY RE GOOD FOR STORAGE AND STUFF LIKE THAT .
THAT S WHAT .
I DO WITH A LOT OF MY DAUGHTER S THINGS IS I LL STORE HER YOU KNOW LIKE HER OUT DATED OR OUT OF OUT OF SEASON CLOTHES IN THEM AND THEY RE JUST PERFECT .
WHAT WHAT .
I VE DONE IN THE PAST I DO NT HAVE ANY NOW BUT I WOULD BUY SOME CHEAP WALLPAPER FROM SOMEWHERE AND COVER THOSE NICE BOXES WITH THE LIDS .
UHHUH .
AND YOU CAN STACK THEM UP AND AND LEAVE THEM OUT AND PUT THINGS IN THEM EVEN .
AND THEY LOOK JUST AS GOOD .
THAT S A SMART IDEA .
UHHUH YEAH .
I THINK I LL HAVE TO TRY THAT .
THAT S REALLY CUTE .
YEAH WELL YOU KNOW IT S CHEAPER THAN GOING AND BUYING THE KIND AT TARGET .
THAT ARE ALL READY WITH THE LITTLE DESIGN ON THEM OR WHATEVER .
THEY RE THE EXACT SAME THING .
THAT S ALL .
THEY ARE THEY JUST MADE THEM LOOK FANCY .
UHHUH YEAH .
YOU SAVED ME .
SOME MONEY .
AND YOU RE RECYCLING .
YES YEAH .
WELL THAT S NEAT .
WELL DO YOU .
ALL HAVE UH WE HAVE PLACES .
THAT UH PAY FOR PAPER TO RECYCLE I KNOW YOU DO YOURS AT WORK BUT FOR NEWSPAPER .
UHHUH .
BUT OURS ARE REAL HARD TO FIND .
THAT S THE ONE THING .
THAT REALLY DISCOURAGES ME .
I SAVED PA YOU KNOW I RECYCLE PAPER BUT THEY IT S ALMOST LIKE THEY DO NT WANT THE PAPER BECAUSE THEY DO NT PAY AT ALL .
I MEAN THEY RE REAL HARD TO FIND THE PLACES .
THAT PAY .
AND THAT S REALLY DISCOURAGING .
I MEAN I JUST GO AHEAD AND TAKE IT TO THE THE REGULAR PLACE WHERE IT S YOU KNOW THEY JUST ACCEPT IT .
UHHUH .
BUT THEY UH I THINK THEY SHOULD YEAH IF THEY WANT PEOPLE TO RECYCLE I THINK IT S UH YOU KNOW LIKE THE ALUMINUM YOU KNOW IT GETS PEOPLE TO UH DOING IT YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT YOU DO NT HAVE TO PAY THEM .
A LOT .
YEAH I LIVE NEAR A WALMART AND THERE S A BIG UH UH HUGE DUMPSTER LOOKING THING SITTING OUT FRONT IN FACT .
I THINK THERE S TWO OF THEM THAT HAVE SEVERAL OPENINGS .
UHHUH .
AND IT S FOR RECYCLING AND THEY HAVE ALUMINUM AND NEWSPAPER AND PLASTIC AND SOME OTHER CATEGORY .
UHHUH .
I DO NT MAYBE THERE S TWO FOR ALUMINUM .
AND YOU DO NT GET PAID BUT IT S REAL CONVENIENT JUST TO CHUNK .
THE NEWSPAPERS IN THERE .
WELL THAT S THAT S GOOD .
YEAH .
I THE ONE THING .
I DO NT LIKE ABOUT THE NEWSPAPER ALSO IS UH LIKE AT WORK .
WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT TRASH CANS AT YOUR DESK .
YOU HAVE ONE FOR PAPER AND ONE FOR JUST YOUR NORMAL TRASH .
UHHUH .
BUT IN UH IN THE PAPER .
ONE .
YOU HAVE TO SEPARATE .
YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOU DO NT THROW AWAY ANY OF THE SLICK PAPER LIKE MAGAZINES .
UHHUH .
YOU CA NT THROW ANY OF THAT AWAY AND YOU CA NT THROW CERTAIN FILE TYPE THINGS AWAY AND I JUST THINK IT S SUCH A HASSLE IT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE EASY TO TAKE IT .
ALL I DO NT KNOW OF COURSE I DO NT KNOW ALL THAT ABOUT RECYCLING SO .
UHHUH .
IT PROBABLY IS A HASSLE .
BUT I DO GET TIRED OF HAVING TO SEPARATE PAPER YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
IT GETS TO BE UH I GUESS YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT .
A HABIT I MEAN YOU HAVE TO GET SO USED TO DOING IT THAT IT S A HABIT .
RIGHT RIGHT .
AND WE HAD UH A WRITE UP IN OUR PAPER UH THIS LAST TIME AT WORK ABOUT UM THEY COME AND EMPTY YOUR TRASH .
EVERY OTHER DAY .
THEY DO YOUR NORMAL TRASH AND EVERY OTHER DAY .
THEY DO YOUR RECYCLING TRASH .
UHHUH .
AND SOMEBODY WAS WRITING IN COMPLAINING THAT THE PEOPLE HAD UH DUMPED ALL THE TRASH IN THE SAME BIN .
OH .
AND WHEN THEY WERE QUESTIONED ABOUT IT .
THEY SAID WELL WE RE RUNNING LATE OR WE DID NT HAVE TIME TO DO THOSE BINS OR SOMETHING AND THAT S REAL DISCOURAGING .
THINKING YOU RE SITTING THERE WORKING TO SEPARATE IT AND THEN THEY .
AND SOMEONE ELSE IS NT GOING TO TAKE THE TIME TO PUT IT IN TWO SEPARATE BAGS .
RIGHT RIGHT SO THEY RE THEY RE REALLY TRYING TO START KEEPING AN EYE OUT FOR THOSE YOU KNOW TALKING TO THE PEOPLE AGAIN ABOUT YOU KNOW SEPARATE THEM BECAUSE THAT IS DISCOURAGING WHEN YOU WHEN YOU DO THAT .
IT WAS HARD TO GET USED TO THOSE TWO DIFFERENT TRASH CANS .
UHHUH .
BUT LUCKILY THAT WILL ALL GET STRAIGHTENED OUT AND AND THEY LL THEY LL START SEPARATING THEM .
BECAUSE I DO NT MIND DOING THAT I FEEL LIKE I M DOING UH DOING SOMETHING FOR THE COMMUNITY WHEN I M DOING THAT .

WELL IN THE NORMAN IN A NORMAL ROUTE OF WAY .
WE DO THINGS HOW ABOUT THE LADIES GO FIRST .
ALL RIGHTY .
UM WELL I UH HAVE A FOUR YEAR OLD .
WHO WILL JUST BE ENTERING PUBLIC SCHOOL NEXT YEAR SO I M REALLY JUST STARTING TO GET INVOLVED IN UH IN WHAT S OUT THERE AND HOW THEY DO THINGS .
UM AS FAR AS THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE I REALLY DO NT SEE A PROBLEM WITH IT .
I DO SEE A PROBLEM WITH GRADUATING PEOPLE .
THAT THAT CA NT READ AND ARE NOT YOU KNOW PRODUCTIVE IN SOCIETY OR PRODUCTIVE TO THEMSELVES AND UH I THINK THAT S THE MAIN PROBLEM AT THIS POINT .
HOW ABOUT YOURSELF .
ALL RIGHT .
I M LIVE IN PLANO TEXAS AND UH .
UHHUH .
UH TODAY .
WE RE NOT EVEN SUPPOSE TO BE IN SCHOOL BECAUSE THE UH THE WAY .
THE TAXATION AND ALL THAT CRAP IS THERE REALLY LEGALLY IS NT ANY FUNDING FOR THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS IN TEXAS TODAY .
RIGHT .
SO UH I MEAN WHEN YOU WHEN YOU TAKE UH UH PROFESSIONALS AND PUT THEM IN SITUATIONS THEY HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON MONEY TO FUND PUBLIC EDUCATION AND THEY CA NT GET THEIR FINGER OUT OF THEIR EAR LONG ENOUGH TO TO GET THAT MAJOR SUBJECT IN LINE SOMETHING S WRONG .
SO I THINK HERE IN TEXAS MAINLY THAT THE THE THEY RE NOT SERIOUS THEY RE MORE SERIOUS ABOUT WHAT .
THE SALARY SHOULD BE FOR SENATORS THAN THEY ARE FOR WHAT HOW THE LEVEL OF EDUCATION SHOULD BE FOR CHILDREN .
I HAVE A ONE YEAR OLD SO I M NOT I M MORE OPINIONATED ABOUT THE OBSERVATIONS THAN THAN THE TRUE FACTS BUT .
UHHUH .
IT S JUST A SHAME TO ME THAT THAT THE OUR FIREMEN OUR POLICEMEN AND SCHOOL TEACHERS ARE THE THREE LEAST PAID UTILITIES UM THAT HAVE THE BIGGEST IMPACT TO OUR WELLBEING .
THAT S TRUE .
I HAVE I HAVE A REAL ISSUE WITH THAT .
UM I THINK THAT IF FROM EVERY YEAR WHEN THEY WHEN THEY PULL IN THE THE THE UH TEST THAT THE LAST THREE YEARS YOU KNOW TEN ELEVEN TWELVE YEAR UH GRADERS TAKE AND AND THEN YOU SEE THAT THEIR EDUCATION IS BELOW THE NORM THROUGHOUT OF ALL FIFTY STATES .
THEY RE NOT SAYING THAT SOMETHING S WRONG WITH THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM HERE IN TEXAS I HAVE A REAL CONCERN ABOUT THAT UM AS A MATTER OF FACT .
I M VERY CONTENT TO SPEND MY DAUGHTER OUT OF STATE TO COLLEGE IN VIRGINIA .
UHHUH .
UH VERSES HAVING HER GO DOWN HERE AND NOT LEARN ANYTHING AND THEN UH SO I M MUMBLEX MY OPINION .
I THINK THERE S A BIG CONCERN HOPE HOPEFULLY THE NEW UH EDUCATION SECRETARY OF EDUCATION WILL DO SOMETHING TO FIX THE PROBLEM BUT UH I DO NT KNOW THEY VE GOT TO QUIT WORRYING ABOUT UH THE UH RELIGIOUS UH OVERTONES IN OUR TEXTBOOKS AND GET ON WITH TEACHING THE PRODUCT .
YEAH I THINK THEY GET BOGGED DOWN IN A LOT OF SMALL ISSUES THAT PEOPLE YOU KNOW SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS CAN BLOW UP .
UHHUH .
AND UH AND NOT REALLY GET DOWN TO TEACHING .
WHAT S IMPORTANT .
TEACHING THESE KIDS YOU KNOW HOW MUMBLEX REALLY THE BASICS IS WHAT .
IT COMES DOWN TO .
EXACTLY .
I WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND OUT THAT THAT ACROSS THE UNITED STATES IN ALL PUBLIC SCHOOLS .
IT IS NOT MANDATORY FOR THEM TO TAKE PHYS ED .
IS THAT RIGHT .
HA THEY DO NT EVEN A LOT OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS DO NT EVEN UH THE KIDS NOWADAYS DO NT EVEN KNOW WHAT WHAT .
THE PRESIDENT S FITNESS EDUCATION PROGRAM IS ALL ABOUT .
HUH .
THEY DO NT HAVE TO DO SITUPS AND PUSHUPS AND ALL THAT CRAP .
WE HAD TO DO WHEN WE WERE GOING TO SCHOOL .
I REMEMBER .
AND YEAH AND UH I TALKED TO A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD LAST NIGHT .
WHO S UH GOES TO UH ONE OF THE PLANO HIGH SCHOOLS OR JUNIOR HIGHS I GUESS AND SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD A CHOICE SHE COULD EITHER HAVE TAKEN TENNIS OR WEIGHT LIFTING SO SHE .
CHOICE TO TAKE WEIGHT LIFTING .
OVER THE REGULAR GYM I MEAN GIVE ME .
A BREAK I MEAN THE KIDS SIT THERE AND THEY AND THEY DRINK COKES AND EAT POPCORN FOR FOR LUNCH AND .
AND TALK YEAH .
THEN GO OUT THERE AND LIFT WEIGHTS AND DO NT LEARN ANYTHING IT S JUST A REAL I HAVE A REAL PROBLEM WITH THE WHOLE SYSTEM .
HUH .
THEY NEED TO PUT SOME STERNNESS BACK INTO THE INTO THE TEACHERS AND LET THEM BE ABLE TO UH GET THE OLD WHIP OUT AND GET SOME DISCIPLINE .
YEAH THEN IT COMES DOWN TO WHAT .
YOU SAID BEFORE THOUGH ABOUT THEM BEING SOME OF THE LOWEST PAID PUBLIC YOU KNOW PUBLIC SERVICE .
UHHUH .
EMPLOYEES THAT THERE ARE .
I USED TO .
AND YET THEY RE SO IMPORTANT .
I USED TO DATE A GIRL .
WHO TAUGHT ENGLISH AT NINTH GRADE LEVEL .
UHHUH .
I MEAN I WAS ABSOLUTELY FLABBERGASTED AT WHAT THEY .
WO WHAT .
SHE WAS PAID .
TRUE SHE WAS YOUNG YOU KNOW BUT STILL IT S THE PRINCIPLE .
RIGHT .
OF COURSE IF SHE GOT HER MASTERS DEGREE .
IT WOULD ALL BE DIFFERENT .
BUT UH .
WELL YOU KNOW IT S HARD THOUGH BECAUSE THEN YOU START TALKING TAXES AND .
OH TAXES LORD FORBI .
THAT S A BAD WORD .
LORD FORBID TAXES .
GOODNESS GRACIOUS IF WE WOULD UH PLAN OUR EXPRESSWAYS .
A LITTLE BETTER THAT TEN DOLLARS FOR THE BRIDGES AND THE ROADS WE D CUT THAT IN HALF AND GET SOME TEACHERS WE MIGHT HAVE US .
A PROBLEM .
THERE S AN IDEA .
MAYBE I SHOULD RUN FOR OFFICE HUH .
RUN ON THAT THEN NO INCOME TAXES IN TEXAS HUH .
THAT S TRUE .
I M IN TEXAS TOO SO .
THAT S FUNNY THAT S FUNNY .
WELL THAT S ABOUT ALL .
I HAVE HERE .
WELL ME TOO I UH I THINK WE .
BOTH AGREE THERE S SOME PROBLEMS THERE BUT .

THAT S FUNNY .
AND UM SO YOU SIT THERE AND YOU WAIT FOR THE LONGEST TIME REALLY BORED AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN .
SOMETHING HAPPENS BUT YOU HAPPEN TO LOOK THE OTHER WAY DURING THE TIME .
YOU MISS THE WHOLE THING .
YEAH AND SO YOU RE BASICALLY YOU MUMBLEX SIT THERE AND WAIT FOR SOMETHING EXCITING TO HAPPEN AND WHEN IT HAPPENED HE MISSED IT .
THAT S FUNNY .
AND DID NT UNDERSTAND IT AND IT .
WHERE IS HE FROM IN FRANCE .
UM HE GREW UP OUT WELL HE GREW UP IN MUMBLEX .
UHHUH .
WHICH IS THE SORT OF O STRIP EAST TO WEST EASTERN PART BUT THAT .
YEAH .
I HAVE A I HAD A FRIEND IN COLLEGE FROM STRASBOURG .
YEAH HE S NOT THAT FAR HE WAS SORT OF IN BETWEEN STRASBOURG .
UHHUH .
AND PARIS .
PARIS .
AND MY COUSIN LIVES IN PARIS AND SHE S LIVED THERE FOR LIKE OH OFF AND ON FOR TWENTY YEARS .
OH IS SHE STILL THERE .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE .
SAINT CLAUDE IS THAT SOUND FAMILIAR .
YEAH SAINT CLAUDE .
YEAH .
YEAH WE USED TO THAT S ONE OF THE UM ENTRANCES TO THE PERIPHERY TO GET IN AND OUT OF THE CITY .
OH REALLY .
AND IT IT IT IT SITS RIGHT AT THE LIMIT .
UHHUH .
I MUMBLEX EXACTLY WHERE SHE IS .
BUT UM WE MET IN PARIS .
THAT S NEAT .
YEAH SHE MARRIED AND THEY HAVE TWELVE CHILDREN .
TWELVE CHILDREN .
SHE HAS TWELVE CHILDREN .
OH MY GOD THE POOR WOMAN .
SHE LOOKS GORGEOUS NO SHE S GORGEOUS AND SHE JUST LIKED HAVING KIDS AND SHE S THIN AND I MEAN .
WERE ANY OF THEM TWINS .
MUMBLEX FOUR OR MORE CHILDREN ARE THIN I MEAN I M NOT KIDDING YOU .
YOU PROBABLY CA NT AFFORD TO EAT IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN TWO OF THEM .
NO YOUR I HAVE A FRIEND NOW THAT HAS SEVEN .
AND UM AND THEY RE ALL EIGHT AND UNDER .
UHHUH .
AND NINE AND UNDER THEY RE ALL REAL YOUNG THEY RE JUST RAISED RIGHT THAT S WHAT .
GOD S TOLD THEM TO DO BUT THEY RE NOT CONDEMNING YOU IF YOU WE ONLY HAVE ONE CHILD YOU KNOW THEY DO NT SAY THEY DO NT PUT MUMBLEX ON BAD OR ANYTHING .
WHICH IS GOOD BECAUSE IT WOULD BE EASY I M SURE FOR THEM TO DO THAT YOU GET A CONVICTION LIKE THAT AND YOU THINK EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE IT .
AND SO I M REAL PROUD OF THEM BECAUSE THEY RE ARE NT REALLY THEY DO NT DO THAT AT ALL .
UHHUH .
YOU GO IN THEIR BATHROOM AND THERE .
S TEN TOOTH BRUSHES IN THERE .
AND I ALWAYS GIVE HER .
A HARD TIME MUMBLEX .
WHO S TOOTHBRUSH DID YOU REALLY USE THIS MORNING .

UHHUH .
ALMOST ANY DAY AND .
THEY LIVE LEAN FOR ONE THING AND THEY TITHE AND THEY MUMBLEX IT PUTS MUMBLEX .
A WHOLE IN YOUR MONEY BAG WE DO NT HONOR GOD WITH THIS MUMBLEX PORTION AND SO THEY I THINK THAT HELPS A LOT .
I THINK THAT S THE KEY IN HE LIKE HIS SALES LAST YEAR .
HE JUST WORKS A NORMAL JOB .
HE PROBABLY HAS AN INCOME OF THIRTYFIVE THOUSAND BUT LAST YEAR .
HE MADE MUMBLEX THAT GOT HIM .
A BONUS OF TWENTYFIVE THOUSAND .
WHICH ALLOWED HIM TO PAY CASH FOR A FULL SIZE VAN .
UHHUH .
HE LOVES GOD I MEAN IT WAS THE BIGGEST THING THAT ANY .
ONE IN THIS COMPANY HAD EVER DONE .
WOW .
AND HE GOT TO DO IT AND SO GOD JUST REALLY BLESSES HIM IN WAYS LIKE THAT DO TRUST GOD BECAUSE I DO NT KNOW KIDS ARE A BLESSING AND AND SOME PEOPLE MUMBLEX YOU KNOW WE THINK OF BLESSINGS AS NICE FURNITURE AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT KIDS ARE JUST AS MUCH OF A BLESSING INSIDE THESE MATERIAL THINGS BUT IT S A DIFFERENT KIND AND A LOT TIMES PEOPLE THINK OH WELL I M NOT BLESSED I HAVE AN OLD CAR .
BUT YOU VE GOT FIVE KIDS YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
YOU RE JUST AS BLESSED PROBABLY MORE BECAUSE IF YOU FOLLOW THIS THERE S A GOOD BOOK CALLED WHAT .
THE BIBLE HAS TO SAY ABOUT CHILD TRAINING .
UHHUH .
BY RICHARD FUGATE AND HE S YOU KNOW A LOT OF WISDOM IN IT .
AND THE KIDS AT BIBLE TALK ABOUT ANYTHING BUT TRAINING AND TRAINING IS DIFFERENT THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN IN PSYCHOLOGY DOES NT ADDRESS IT .
A LOT OF THE PSYCHOLOGY STUFF THE GOOD STUFF .
THAT S IN PSYCHOLOGY .
IT JUST COMES OUT OF THE BIBLE AND THEY DO NT QUOTE YOU .
THE PROVERB OUT OF IT BUT THE THINGS .
THAT WORK IN PSYCHOLOGY OTHER THE YEARS THAT THEY VE PROVEN TO WORK THEY JUST COME OUT OF THE BIBLE AND SO THIS BOOK .
IT JUST REALLY MUMBLEX ALL THESE THINGS AND HOW TO TRAIN THE CHILD SO THEY RE NOT GOING TO BE A CURSE TO YOU WHEN THEY RE THIRTEEN .
UHHUH .
WHAT .
I MEAN HOW TO TRAIN THEM SO THEY RE GOING TO BE A BLESSING AND SO YOU KNOW THEY DO THAT AND THEY THEY JUST LIVE LEAN PRETTY MUCH THEY DO NT SHE DOES NT SHOP AT FOLEY S .
YOU KNOW AND STUFF LIKE THAT .
BUT A LOT WOMEN DIE OR SHOP AT FOLEY S SO THINGS .
I I DO NT KNOW WHAT FOLEY S IS .
IT .
S LIKE A MACY S .
UHHUH .
KIND OF STORE IT S PRETTY NICE AND EVERYTHING S PRETTY EXPENSIVE AND YOU KNOW YOU JUST CA NT DO THAT AND YOU DO NT GO TO BASEBALL GAMES AS MUCH OR YOU GET PICTURES LIKE WE DID .
YOU KNOW WHAT .
I MEAN .
YEAH .
YOU DO THESE FUN THINGS YOU KNOW IN OTHER KINDS OF WAYS AND I KNOW MANHATTAN S REAL EXPENSIVE BUT UM IT S KIND OF A DIFFERENT SITUATION BECAUSE YOU RE PROBABLY LIVING IN AN APARTMENT RIGHT .
YEAH WELL THAT MAKES A REALLY BIG DIFFERENCE .
BUT .
YEAH .
BUT STILL IT S JUST AS HARD AS HAVING THAT BUT MUMBLEX YOUR COUSIN COULD HAVE A BASEBALL TEAM WITH TWELVE KIDS .
WELL MUMBLEX CHURCH MUMBLEX SOFTBALL LEAGUES SO .
UHHUH .
THEY RE NOT ALL BOYS AND RIGHT NOW WE DO NT HAVE A GIRLS LEAGUE BECAUSE I M THE ONE .
THAT S SUPPOSED TO START ONE AND I JUST HAVE NT GOTTEN AROUND TO DOING IT .
I KEEP SAYING WE NEED TO HAVE ONE .
THEY GO OKAY THEN START ONE .
BUT EVERYBODY .
MUMBLEX WANTS TO DO IT BUT YOU KNOW GOD S SITTING ON MY HEART AND I JUST HAD NT GOTTEN AROUND TO DOING IT BUT ANYWAY SO THEY COULD REALLY ONLY HAVE FOUR MEMBERS ON THE TEAM .
I THINK THEY ONLY HAVE FOUR BOYS .
I DO NT EVEN THINK THEY HAVE BUT TWO OLD ENOUGH TO PLAY YET .
UHHUH .
BUT UM THEN YOU DID NT BELIEVE ME ABOUT HER KIDS ARE THE .
THEY ARE SO GOOD .
I M NOT KIDDING YOU BUT SHE DOES WORK WITH THEM AND IT S A COMMITMENT AND THAT THAT S WHAT .
THEY RE CALLED TO DO .
UHHUH .
I HAVE A MOST OF MY FRIENDS .
I ADMIRE SOMEONE .
THAT CAN DO THAT YOU KNOW I REALLY CAN .
I KNOW I DO TOO I MOST OF MY FRIENDS HAVE THREE OR FOUR KIDS AND THEY FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW THAT S REALLY WHY GOD MUMBLEX AND SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN OUR CHURCH USE BIRTH CONTROL AND SOME OF THEM DO NT I HAD MY TUBES TIED SO YOU .
OKAY I THINK WE RE SUPPOSED TO DISCUSS OUR VIEW OF THE SOVIET UNION AS A CONTINUING THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES .
OKAY .
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT .
I DO NT REALLY I MORE I DO NT KNOW ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT AS MUCH AS UH THE PEOPLE UH I WOULD NT CONSIDER TO BE A THREAT AT ALL AND I REALLY DO NT FEEL MUCH LIKE THE SOVIET UNION ITSELF IS A THREAT ANYMORE I M I M WORRIED ABOUT THEM THEY RE IN A VERY UH TUMULTUOUS STATE RIGHT NOW WITH THE KINDS OF UH ADAPTATIONS THAT THEY RE ATTEMPTING TO GO THROUGH UH .
I M CONCERNED ABOUT THEM NOT AS A MILITARY THREAT BUT AS A BURDEN THEY RE VERY LARGE .
YEAH .
AND THEY CAN BECOME VERY QUICKLY A LARGE FINANCIAL BURDEN AS AS ONE MORE STEPCHILD WE HAVE TO CARRY AROUND .
YEAH I THINK THAT S THAT S A REAL IMPORTANT ASPECT AND THAT UH AS THE THE MO THE MOST THE MO LET S SEE THE MORE THAT WE DO THAT WE DO OR THAT WE CAN DO TO HELP THEM BECOME SELFSUFFICIENT IS GOING TO ELIMINATE MORE OF THE RISK OF THAT BECOMING UH YOU KNOW A REALITY I KNOW THAT UH THIS LAST WINTER WAS VERY HARD ON UH SEVERAL AREAS IN THE IN THE THE UKRAINE PARTICULARLY THE COAL MINING REGIONS OF SIBERIA UH THE PEOPLE THERE HAVE MONEY THAT S NOT THEIR PROBLEM BUT THERE S NO FOOD FOR THEM TO BUY AND ITS YOU CA NT EAT MONEY .
AND THEY HAVE A A PROBLEM THEIR THEIR WHOLE ATTITUDE UH I I M NOT SURE WHICH CROP IT WAS BUT THEY HAD A CROP THAT ROTTED IN THE FIELDS BECAUSE THEY COULD NT GET ANYONE TO HARVEST IT .
YEAH .
AND THE PEOPLE IN THE CITY WERE SAYING WELL WHY SHOULD I GO DO THAT MAKE THE GOVERNMENT DO THAT THAT S NOT MY JOB .
RIGHT THEY VE GOT A LOT OF ADJUSTMENTS TO MAKE WITH COMING OUT OF WHAT THEY VE BEEN THROUGH NOW AND UH THEY VE BEEN THEY VE BEEN UNDER UNDER THE OPPRESSION THAT THEY VE BEEN UNDER FOR SO LONG THAT NOW THEY HAVE SOME FREEDOMS BUT THEY DO NT KNOW HOW TO ACT YET THEY DO NT UNDERSTAND THAT TO MAKE THAT WORK THEY VE GOT TO TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEMSELVES IT S NOT JUST THE GOVERNMENT S RESPONSIBILITY ANYMORE YOU CA NT JUST BLAME IT ON THE GOVERNMENT WHEN THEY GIVE YOU THE FREEDOM TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF THEN THAT PUTS SOME RESPONSIBILITY ON YOU AS WELL .
ABSOLUTELY AND AND I THINK THAT THEY RE HAVING A HARD TIME WITH THE CONCEPT OF YOU CAN NOT GO BACK PEOPLE ONLY GO FORWARD AND I THINK THAT THAT IS GIVING THEM I M EXPECTING A CALL AND UNFORTUNATELY I THINK IT S COME THROUGH I VE ENJOYED TALKING TO YOU .
OKAY .

NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT .
WELL NOWADAYS YOU HAVE TO BE .

SO I AT FIRST THOUGHT YOU KNOW WHEN I DID NT HAVE KIDS I WAS GOING GOD HOW CAN YOU BE SO PROTECTIVE .
YOU .
UHHUH .

UHHUH .
NOW YOU UNDERSTAND .
YEAH .
DEFINITELY .
THAT S WHAT .
I M THINKING WHAT .
YOUR MOM AND DAD ALWAYS USED TO SAY WHEN YOU HAVE KIDS OF YOUR OWN .

THAT S EXACTLY RIGHT AND I DO .
UHHUH .
BUT ANYWAY .
WELL ARE YOU EVER ARE YOU B ARE YOU ARE YOU MARRIED .
YES .

OR .
YEAH .
WE D LIKE TO .
WELL THAT S GOOD .
YEAH .
BECAUSE THEY RE REALLY NEAT .
IT S JUST .
OKAY .
WELL .
FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO TELL YOU .
I HAVE TWO LITTLE KIDS BUT THEY RE NOT IN PUBLIC SCHOOL YET .
I I GET I GET THAT EXPERIENCE STARTING NEXT FALL .
AH .
WITH KINDERGARTEN .
YEAH .
YEAH .
SO YOU HAVE NT REALLY UH DEALT WITH THAT IN A SENSE .
NO .
BUT UH BEING ONE OF THESE LATE IN LIFE MOTHERS I VE LISTENED TO EVERYBODY ELSE S YOU KNOW .
COMPLAINTS AS TO WHA WHAT S THE MATTER WITH EITHER THEIR KIDS OR THE SCHOOL SYSTEM .
YEAH .
SO .
YEAH .
I VE BEEN SURPRISED .
DO ARE DO YOU HAVE SCHOOL AGE KIDS .
UH MINE ARE BOTH OUT OF SCHOOL .
OH .
AND UH .
YOU KNOW I I VE IN HINDSIGHT SEEN SOME THINGS THAT I WISHED THAT YOU KNOW I HAD DONE SOMETHING ABOUT THAT WAS YOU KNOW WITHIN MY POWER OR UH YOU KNOW WISH THAT IN SOME WAYS WE AS PARENTS HAD MORE CONTROL OVER .
SUCH AS .
WHAT S HAPPENING UP THERE YOU KNOW TYPE THING .
UH WELL JUST OVER THE YEARS .
THERE WERE SITUATIONS .
THAT UH UH CAME UP THAT I DID NT THINK WERE FAIR OR HANDLED CORRECTLY OR THE TEACHERS DID NT SEEM TO BE TEACHING ANYTHING .
OF COURSE IT S A LITTLE HARD TO TELL FROM THE INFORMATION THAT YOU GET FROM YOUR CHILD YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
THEY THEY BRING THINGS HOME AND I WAS NEVER ONE TO BELIEVE EVERYTHING .
MY KIDS SAID .
YOU KNOW ABOUT SOMETHING .
BUT UH STILL I I QUESTIONED THE ABILITY OF SOME OF THE TEACHERS TO UH REALLY DO A BANGUP JOB AND YET OTHERS I KNOW ARE JUST WONDERFUL .
WELL I HEARD A A FRIGHTENING THING .
ACTUALLY I DID NT HEAR IT .
IT WAS TOLD TO ME OR SUGGESTED TO ME UH THAT TO WORK AS A TEACHER IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEMS IN THE STATE OF TEXAS AND I THINK IT S SIMILAR IN IN MANY OTHER STATES IF YOU HAVE A DEGREE IN A TECHNICAL FIELD .
YOU DO NOT NEED A TEACHING CERTIFICATE BECAUSE THERE IS SUCH A SHORTAGE .
HUH .
OF UH PEOPLE TO TEACH MATH AND SCIENCES .
AND SOMEBODY SAID WELL YOU KNOW YOU COULD GO IN AND AND SUBSTITUTE TEACH AT SEVENTYFIVE DOLLARS .
A DAY AND THERE S ALWAYS GOING TO BE YOU KNOW SOMEBODY HAVING A NEED FOR A MATH OR SCIENCE TEACHER .
I THOUGHT CHRIST THEY RE LETTING ME IN .
YEAH .
TO YOU KNOW THIS WOULD BE THIS WOULD BE FRIGHTENING .
I DO NT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT .
THAT S PRETTY INTERESTING BECAUSE JUST .
JUST BECAUSE YOU KNOW A SUBJECT MATTER .
RIGHT .
DOES NT MEAN YOU CAN TEACH IT .
RIGHT .
AND EVEN IF I KNEW HOW TO TEACH THE SUBJECT MATTER I DO NT KNOW IF I D KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THAT KIND OF A A GROUP OF KIDS .
OH YEAH .
IN FACT I THINK THAT S THAT S ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS TODAY IS THE THE WAY .
THE KIDS BEHAVE OR ACT AND AND THE WAY .
THEY ARE SOMETIMES DISINTERESTED IN WHAT S GOING ON IN THE CLASS AND DISRUPTIVE .
I TELL YOU .
WHAT .
I M FINDING FRIGHTENING AND THIS COMES FROM YOU KNOW THE THE AGING HIPPIE NEAR FORTY MOTHER .
SO I WENT THROUGH THIS PERIOD OF SUPPOSEDLY YOU KNOW COSMIC SOCIAL ENLIGHTENMENT .
I M ON I M IN THE PLANO SCHOOL SYSTEM AND LIVING IN RICHARDSON AND THERE IS A REAL DICHOTOMY IN TERMS OF EDUCATIONAL AND ECONOMIC BACKGROUND OF THE KIDS .
THAT ARE GOING TO BE ATTENDING THIS SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
AND I USED TO THINK WELL THAT S WONDERFUL .
YOU KNOW THEY CAN GET A REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE .
WHAT .
I M SEEING NOW UH IN TERMS OF KINDERGARTEN PREPAREDNESS JUST FROM IN IN IN DIFFERENT PRESCHOOLS .
UHHUH .
IT .
S LIKE DAY AND NIGHT .
AND I WONDER HOW DO THEY HANDLE A CHILD .
WHO IS OBVIOUSLY VERY READY AND ANOTHER CHILD .
WHO DOES NT EVEN SPEAK ENGLISH LET ALONE KNOW HER COLORS .
YEAH .
AND THEY RE IN THE SAME CLASSROOMS .
AND I GUESS ALSO YOU RE GOING TO SEE THE FIRST OF THE UH CRACK KIDS STARTING KINDERGARTEN .
MY GOD I THINK IT WOULD BE NEXT YEAR IS WHAT .
I D READ .
I THOUGHT WELL HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU WEED THOSE OUT .
YES .
SOME OF THOSE CERTAINLY HAVE A LOT OF DIS DIFFICULTIES YOU KNOW WITH UH ALL SORTS OF THINGS .
AND I WOULD IMAGINE THEIR LEARNING DISABILITIES ARE QUITE LARGE IN SOME CASES .
WHEN I WAS LISTENING TO N P R THE NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO AND THEY VE QUOTED STATISTICS THAT I JUST ABOUT MY THROAT JUST ABOUT FELL INTO MY TOES .
THEY SAID AT THE BOTTOM OF THE S .
A T SCORES OF GRADUATING COLLEGE SENIORS ARE USUALLY THOSE PEOPLE .
THAT GO INTO EDUCATION .
OH WOW .
YES .
THAT S ENCOURAGING .
YES .
AND I AND I I GOT TO THINKING BACK WHEN I WAS TEACHING COLLEGE CHEMISTRY THE PEOPLE .
THAT TOOK YOU KNOW THE LOWER LEVEL COURSES I SOMETIMES WONDERED YOU KNOW ARE THEY REALLY EVEN EDUCATABLE OR TRAINABLE AND IT MY GOD YOU KNOW I ARE THE REST OF US .
WHO WENT FOR THE BIG BUCKS YOU KNOW STAYING OUT OF YOU KNOW WHERE MAYBE WE SHOULD BE KIND OF SOCIALLY OBLIGATED TO SPEND SOME TIME TEACHING OR SOMETHING WITH .
YEAH .
THESE KIDS .
I DO NT KNOW .
WELL THAT S YOU KNOW THAT S AN IDEA .
MAYBE THERE NEED TO BE SOME RADICAL CHANGES MADE .
DO SOME THINGS .
THAT ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT AND UNHEARD OF .
WELL YOU KNOW YOU YOU SIT HERE AND YOU THINK ABOUT THAT .
AT THE SAME TIME .
YOU THINK GOD I HOPE I DO NT SOUND LIKE A STAGE MOTHER BECAUSE .
RIGHT NOW IF YOU ASK MY FRIENDS T PUT TWENTY MOTHERS IN A ROOM AND ASK THEM HOW MANY HAVE GIFTED CHILDREN YOU RE GOING TO HAVE TWENTY HANDS YOU KNOW UP THERE .
OH YOU RE KIDDING .
OH NO .
NOBODY HAS NOBODY HAS A NONGIFTED CHILD .
AND I KEEP THINKING YOU KNOW GIFTED IS IS EINSTEIN OR YOU KNOW UH MUSICAL PRODIGIES .
IT S IT S NOT A KID .
WHO S YOU KNOW PRECOCIOUS .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW WHAT HAS YOU KNOW HAS HAS THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM BEEN WATERED DOWN TO THAT .
ANYBODY .
WHO .
S ABOVE AVERAGE IS NOW GIFTED .
HUH .
I DO NT KNOW .
THAT S INTERESTING .
I DO NT KNOW .
MINE DID NT DID NOT FALL INTO THE GIFTED CATEGORY .
OH DO NT SAY THAT .
NOPE .
AND I WOULD NEVER HAD SAID SO EITHER .
UH BUT UH THEY MANAGED TO GET THROUGH ALTHOUGH NOT ALWAYS WITH FLYING COLORS .
UH IN FACT ONE OF THE INCIDENTS I WAS THINKING OF THAT MY SON HAD .
UH HE WAS STRUGGLING WITH SENIOR ENGLISH AND I HAD A MEETING WITH THE UH VICE PRINCIPAL AND THE ENGLISH INSTRUCTOR AND UH SHE SHOWED ME .
A PAPER THAT HE HAD JUST HANDED IN .
AND SHE TOLD ME .
WHAT .
SHE HAD REQUESTED .
AND I READ IT AND WHILE IT HAD YOU KNOW A FEW LITTLE GRAMMATICAL PROBLEMS IT WAS NT VERY LONG AND SO FORTH .
I THOUGHT IT HAD SOME NICE WELL THOUGHT OUT UH PARTS TO IT .
UHHUH .
SHE GAVE HIM .
AN F ON THAT PAPER .
AND I THOUGHT WELL NOW HERE YOU HAVE A STUDENT .
WHO IS TRYING TO PASS WHO IS STRUGGLING WITH YOUR SUBJECT AND YOU GIVE THEM .
AN F ON SOMETHING .
THAT DOES NT SEEM THAT BAD TO ME .
WHAT ARE YOU TELLING THAT STUDENT .
YOU RE TELLING THEM THAT HEY YOU MIGHT AS WELL FORGET IT YOU KNOW .
WELL YOU SEE I THINK THAT THAT HARKS RIGHT BACK TO THE ELEMENTARY AND JUNIOR HIGH YEARS .
BECAUSE I HAVE A STEPSON NOW WHO S TWENTYFIVE AND UH I WAS JUST ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED UH THE FIRST TIME THAT I SAW HIS SCHOOLWORK .
UH I REMEMBER BEING YOU KNOW TAUGHT AND I THINK YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO TEACH HOW TO WRITE AN ANSWER AND YOU KNOW HOW TO CONSTRUCT A THOUGHT PROCESS .
UHHUH .
AND YOU KNOW THEY CAN GET A THEY CAN GRASP THE POINTS .
CAN THEY CONVEY THE DATA VERBALLY OR IN WRITING .
AND THAT S WHAT S YOU KNOW REALLY SCARY TO ME .
UH I WOULD REALLY YOU KNOW THERE S SUCH A A PUSH AMONG YOUNG MOTHERS THESE DAYS TO MAKE SURE THEIR CHILD IS COMPUTER LITERATE .
I WOULD REALLY THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE STRESSING MORE CAN THE KID WRITE A THOUGHT AND AT AN EARLY AGE .
AND IF THEY CA NT I MEAN IF THEY HAVE MISSED THAT TRAINING THEN SOMEBODY YOU KNOW BEFORE YOU RE YOU RE START PENALIZING THEM WITH BAD GRADES FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WHAT .
THEY RE THINKING TEACH THEM .
THESE BASIC SKILLS .
YEAH .
IT S PRETTY SAD TO THINK UH ABOUT THOSE .
WHO EVEN TODAY ARE GRADUATING FROM SCHOOL AND THEY ARE TELLING THAT THEY DO NT KNOW HOW TO READ YOU KNOW .
WELL MY STEPSON YOU KNOW I HE WENT INTO THE NAVY OR AIR FORCE .
I JUST REALLY GET MY MILITARY I MARRIED INTO A MILITARY FAMILY .
AND I DO NT KNOW I RE ADDRESS THEM .
ALL AS GENERALS SO I DO NT OFFEND ANYBODY .
BUT UH YOU KNOW FORTUNATELY FOR HIM HE .
WAS NT DUMB BUT BOY .
HE SURE HAD TROUBLE YOU KNOW PUTTING THINGS ON ON PAPER .
YEAH .
AND ONE OF THE THINGS .
THAT THAT THEY DID FOR HIM .
THEY TESTED HIM AND THEY SAID THAT HE S YOU KNOW GREAT IN ELECTRONICS BUT HE YOU KNOW HE S REALLY DOES NEED THE BASIC SKILLS .
AND THEY PUT HIM THROUGH SIX MONTHS OF COMPOSITION WRITING IN ADDITION TO ALL HIS ELECTRONIC TRAINING .
AND AT THAT POINT HE HAS NOW GRADUATED FROM WARFARE ELECTRONICS SCHOOL WITH HONORS .
OH .
THIS IS THE KID .
WHO WHO REALLY YOU KNOW BARELY .
YEAH .
MADE IT THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL .
AND I KEEP THINKING YOU KNOW IT S NOT IT S REALLY NOT TOO LATE AT ANY POINT TO DO YOU KNOW SOME .
THAT S INTERESTING THAT THE MILITARY SAW THAT AND DID SOMETHING ABOUT IT .
YES .
YOU WOULD HAVE EXPECTED THEM TO BE THE LAST ONES TO .
YES .
AND I .
KIND OF HAVE ALWAYS POOHPOOHED MILITARY EDUCATIONS .
BUT I THINK THAT FOR THIS KID IT S GOING TO BE YOU KNOW HIS LIFESAVER .
OTHERWISE HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DRIVING TRUCKS OR FRAMING HOUSES YOU KNOW FROM HERE TO ETERNITY .
YEAH .
SO I DO NT KNOW .
YOU KNOW IT DOES MAKE ME NERVOUS .
WELL I CAN SEE WHY IF YOU VE GOT LITTLE ONES JUST COMING ALONG .
THERE S A A WHOLE LOT OF STUFF GOING ON OUT THERE .
THERE IS A WHOLE LOT OF STUFF GOING ON OUT THERE AND AND PART OF ME SAYS I JUST WOULD LIKE TO YOU KNOW SHUT MY EYES AND PRETEND IT DOES NT YOU KNOW GO ON .
OR SEND THEM TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS .
AND THEN THE YOU KNOW THE OLD SOCIAL CONSCIENCE SAYS YOU KNOW I M NOT WORKING I DO NT NEED TO WORK .
MAYBE I SHOULD VOLUNTEER TO YOU KNOW TEACH WHAT .
I KNOW .
YEAH .
MAYBE ADULT LITERACY .
MAYBE YOU KNOW COMPOSITION WRITING .
MAYBE YOU KNOW UH VOLUNTEERING YOU KNOW ON A TUTOR LINE OR THOUGH THE EVEN THROUGH THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS FOR HELP WITH HOMEWORK OR THE OTHER PART OF ME SAYS IS GOD I VE HAD ENOUGH KIDS .
DO I REALL .
OKAY UH COULD YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK CONTRIBUTES MOST TO UH AIR POLLUTION .
WELL IT S HARD TO SAY I MEAN WHILE IT S CERTAINLY THE CASE THAT THINGS LIKE AUTOMOBILES AND FACTORIES UH POLLUTE A LOT UH IF YOU LOOK AT HOW MUCH POLLUTION IS SAY KICKED UP BY AN ACTIVE VOLCANO UH IT S CERTAINLY LESS THAN CLEAR THAT ANYTHING MAN CAN DO IN THIS SORT OF SCALE OF THINGS HAS MUCH EFFECT AT ALL WHAT DO YOU THINK .
UM WELL YOU TALKED ABOUT UH VOLCANOS I M NOT SURE HOW MANY ACTIVE VOLCANOS THERE ARE NOW AND AND WHAT THE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL THAT THEY DO UH PUT INTO THE ATMOSPHERE I THINK PROBABLY THE GREATEST CAUSE IS UH VEHICLES .
UHHUH .
ESPECIALLY AROUND CITIES UM UH DO YOU LIVE RIGHT IN THE CITY ITSELF .
NO I M MORE OUT IN THE SUBURBS BUT I CERTAINLY WORK NEAR A CITY .
OKAY SO CA HOW ABOUT YOU .
CAN YOU NOTICE WELL IT S IT S I LIVE IN A RURAL AREA .
UHHUH .
IT S MAINLY FARMS AND UH NO HEAVY INDUSTRY ATTLEBORO ITSELF I LIVE IN RHODE ISLAND .
OH I SEE .
AND IT S IN THE NORTH I LIVE UP IN THE UH NORTHEAST CORNER AND ATTLEBORO SITS IN JUST OVER THE LINE .
UHHUH .
WHERE T I S PLANT IS BUT THERE IS NT A LOT OF HEAVY INDUSTRY THERE S THE FREEWAYS AND WE GET AN OCCASIONAL IT DEPENDS WHICH WAY THE WINDS BLOWING FROM BOSTON CAUSE WE RE LIKE FORTY MILES SOUTH OF BOSTON SO WE LL PICK UP THAT AND UH I VE NOTICED OVER THE PAST SAY MAYBE FIVE OR SIX YEARS UH WE LIVE ABOUT TWENTY MILES AWAY FROM THE STATE AIRPORT AND I NOTICE THAT THE FLY PATTERNS NOW OF THE JETS ARE GETTING BIGGER THEY RE SWINGING WIDER SO THAT NOW THEY ARE COMING OVER OVER OUR HOMES .
UHHUH .
AND IT SEEMS LIKE UH WE RE CATCHING ALL THAT RESIDUE I M NOT SURE IF IT S KEROSENE OR WHAT THAT S DROPPING BUT OTHER THAN THAT YOU KNOW WE DO NT HAVE THE UNLESS WE RE CATCHING IT FROM THE MIDWEST THE EMISSIONS .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW FROM THE POWER PLANTS UM .
YOU MEAN LIKE FROM THE COAL .
YEAH YEAH WE GENERATE ONE OF OUR OUR BIGGEST ELECTRICAL PLANTS IN RHODE ISLAND USES COAL TO UH .
UM .
GENERATE ELECTRICITY UM THERE DOES NT SEEM TO BE MUCH EMISSION FROM THEM BUT I M NOT SURE ABOUT THE REST OF THE COUNTRY .
YEAH I NOTICE LOCALLY A MAJOR PROBLEM IS KODAK UM IT S INTERESTING BECAUSE IN ORDER TO UH KEEP WITH THE E P A STANDARDS WHICH WHICH TEND TO BE VISIBLE UH WHAT S COMING OUT OF YOUR SMOKESTACK THEY DO ALL THEIR EMISSIONS AT NIGHT UH SO PEOPLE GET UP .
OKAY WELL IS THAT RIGHT .
YEAH PEOPLE GET UP IN THE MORNING IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD AND THEY VE GOT THIS BLACK ASH ON THEIR CARS .
WHICH YOU KNOW SEEMS TO BE .
YEAH SURPRISE SURPRISE .
YEAH I MEAN I REALLY THINK THAT IF THE E P A HAD ANYTHING ON THE BALL THEY D GO IN THERE WITH A FEW PHOSPHOROUS GRENADES LIGHT UP THE SKY PHOTOGRAPH THE EMISSIONS AT THAT POINT AND UH YOU KNOW .
YEAH THERE THERE MUST BE UH UH SOME OF THE SOME OF THE UH LARGER PLANTS UP UH UP AROUND ONE HUNDRED TWENTYEIGHT .
UHHUH .
UM WE VE GOT REPORTS THAT UH DURING THE NIGHT SEEMS LIKE THEY D BLOW OFF THEIR THEIR STACKS FROM UH .
RIGHT .
THE WAREHOUSES FOR POWERHOUSES .
UHHUH .
AND THEY DO THAT AT NIGHT TOO BECAUSE .
RIGHT .
EMPLOYEES BEEN COMPLAINING THAT THE CARS HAVE BEEN PITTED AND YOU KNOW SPOTS ALL OVER THEM .
YEAH YEAH .
SO YOU RE RIGHT THEY COULD DO SOMETHING A ABOUT ABOUT THAT I GUESS .
YEAH THAT SEEMS A LITTLE RIDICULOUS .
HOW ARE YOUR UH YOUR LAKES AND UH .
OH THEY VE BEEN GETTING CLEANER .
THEY HAVE .
SURE BUT UM YEAH I M NOT SURE HOW MUCH THE WATER POLLUTION IS IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE AIR POLLUTION OTHER THAN ACID RAIN YEAH .
ACID RAIN YEAH THAT S THAT S WHAT I WAS UH .
I MEAN THE STUFF I VE READ RECENTLY IN TECHNOLOGY REVIEW BASICALLY INDICATES THAT ACID RAIN MAY BE A LITTLE BIT UH OVERSTATED THAT A LOT OF THE DIE OFF THEY VE SEEN IN FORESTS MAY NOT REALLY BE DUE TO ACID RAIN AT ALL UM YE I M NOT AN EXPERT .
YEAH NO DID NT THEY JUST HAVE AN ARTICLE OH ON UH THEY WERE DUMPING LIME .
UP HERE .
UP UPSTATE NEW YORK SOMEWHERE .
I HAVE NT READ THAT .
OVER HUGE AREAS .
OH YEAH .
AND THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS MORE BENEFICIAL BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT IT SOME OF IT DOES SOAK IN AND SOME OF IT RUNS OFF RIGHT AWAY INTO THE IN TO THE STREAMS AND RIVERS AND SOME OF THE FISH WERE SUPPOSEDLY MAKING A COMEBACK .
UHHUH .
I CA NT REMEMBER WHERE I I READ THAT RECENTLY SOMEWHERE AND I CA NT REMEMBER WHERE .
YEAH THAT S INTERESTI .
BUT I I THOUGHT IT WAS UP THERE SO THAT S INTERESTING BECAUSE NEW HAMPSHIRE .
UHHUH .
AND PARTS OF VERMONT UM THEY SHOWED PICTURES OF OF EXTENSIVE TREE DAMAGE THAT THEY ATTRIBUTED TO ACID RAIN .
UM .
UM YOU KIND OF THINK IT S SOMETHING ELSE THEN .
WELL THAT S WHAT THE ENVIRONMENTALISTS WERE CLAIMING IN THIS ARTICLE SO THAT .
OH THEY DID NT SAY THEY DID NT SAY WHAT THOUGH THEY JUST SAID THEY THOUGHT IT WAS .
THEY DID NT SAY WHAT THEY JUST SAID THEY THOUGHT ACID RAINS CONTRIBUTION MAY BE LESS THAN WAS PREVIOUSLY SUSPECTED UM THAT IT MAY BE OTHER NATURAL THINGS AT WORK UM .
UH NATURAL DISEASE .
YEAH SO IT S IT S LESS THAN CLEAR LIKE I SAID I DO NT REMEMBER THE ARTICLE THAT WELL .
YEAH YEAH .
BUT UM I DO NT KNOW I MEAN WHAT DO YOU THINK WE CAN UH I GUESS AS INDIVIDUALS OR AS A GROUP DO ABOUT UH AIR POLLUTION .
UH WE CAN DEMAND UH MORE EFFICIENT AUTOMOBILES FOR ONE THING I STILL THINK THAT S THAT S UH ONE OF OUR MAJOR CAUSES OF POLLUTANTS .
UHHUH .
UH HOW WE GO ABOUT THAT IT S UH UH IT S A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT .
I THINK IT S UP TO INDIVIDUALS TOO TO ASK AUTOMAKERS FOR .
YEAH .
FOR LESS POLLUTANT VEHICLES .
YEAH YOU NE YO NE I THINK YOU NEED A A VEHICLE SOMETHING LIKE UH RALPH NADER NADER S RAIDERS OR .
YEAH .
WHERE UH OR UH UH A A R P WHICH HAS A LOT OF MEMBERS .
UHHUH .
UH IF YOU CAN GET THOSE TYPES OF GROUPS .
DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT NEW VEHICLES THOUGH IS A BIG PROBLEM I MEAN I REMEMBER READING AN ARTICLE THAT SAID LIKE IT S UH THE OLDER POLLUTERS THE THE TWELVE AND FIFTEEN YEAR OLD CARS YOU KNOW CONTRIBUTE LIKE NINETY PERCENT .
YEAH .
OF THE AUTOMOBILE POLLUTION AND THE NEW CARS IT S HARDLY IS HARDLY ANYTHING .
YEAH THEY RE BETTER BUT HOW ABOUT ALL THE TRUCKS AND BUSES THAT ARE OUT THERE UH WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW A TRUCK THAT DID NT BELCH SMOKE OR UH .
YEAH BUT DOES NT THAT JUST MEAN THEY RE OUT OF TUNE .
UH I M NOT REALLY SURE YOU THINK THAT THAT THAT THE UH THE TRUCKING INDUS INDUSTRY IS THAT UH INCOMPETENT THAT THEY WOULD NT YOU KNOW FUEL IS IS ONE OF THEIR BIGGEST COSTS .
RIGHT .
SO YOU WOULD .
BUT DIESEL ENGINES .
YEAH DIESEL ENGINES .
IT YOU KNOW IT S IT I MEAN THEY DO GENERATE A LOT OF SOOT BUT THAT AT LEAST THAT KIND OF PARTICULATE COMES OUT OF THE AIR PRETTY QUICKLY .
YEAH YEAH WE COULD ALSO UH PUSH FOR LEGISLATION FOR UH RAPID TRANSIT SYSTEMS THIS COUNTRY SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE BEHIND ON THAT .
YEAH ON THE OTHER HAND MOST PEOPLE DO NT USE RAPID TRANSIT BECAUSE IT S SO INCONVENIENT .
UM YEAH BUT ONLY BECAUSE WE GOT USED TO UH SINGLE PERSON SINGLE CAR .
UHHUH .
DRIVING A LOT OF PEOPLE DO NT EVEN LIKE TO CARPOOL .
UHHUH .
BUT WE COULD THAT THAT LL HELP .
UHHUH .
POLLUTION AIR POLLUTION THE UH UNITED STATES AND CANADA ARE I GUESS IS IS GOING INTO UH SOME TYPES OF AGREEMENTS TO LIMIT UH WHAT S BEING GIVEN OUT BY POWER PLANTS .
UHHUH .
I GUESS CANADA S QUITE CONCERNED THAT WE RE SENDING A LOT OF OUR STUFF UP THERE .
YEAH SURE .
SO THAT S HELPING .
WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT LIKE A DEVICE A METER RIGHT ON A TAIL PIPE AND YOU PAY THE TAX BASED ON HOW MUCH YOU POLLUTED .
NOW THAT S AN IDEA DO NT SAY THAT TOO LOUD THOUGH BECAUSE UH EVERY CITY AND TOWN WILL HAVE A METER ON YOUR TAIL PIPE GENERATING GENERATING REVENUE .
WELL IT JUST MEANS IF YOU DO NT POLLUTE RIGHT OR YOU POLLUTE VERY LITTLE YOU DO NT HAVE TO PAY ANY TAX OR YOU JUST BUY ONE OF THESE THINGS AND IT IT UH MAYBE YOU YOU COULD PROBABLY DEVISE THEM SO IT SLOWLY CLOSED OFF YOUR TAIL PIPE AND UH THE LESS YOU POLLUTE THE LONGER THE DEVISE LASTS AND IF YOU POLLUTE A LOT THEN IT CLOSED OFF YOUR TAIL PIPE AND YOU COULD NT START YOUR CAR ANYMORE .
THAT S A THAT S AN INTERESTING CONCEPT IS THAT YOUR IDEA .
YEAH BUT UH YOU KNOW IT S UH I GUESS THE DIFFICULTY WOULD BE TO THAT SOMEBODY COULD OBVIOUSLY JUST TAKE IT RIGHT OFF THE TAIL PIPE AGAIN SO YOU PROBABLY WOULD HAVE TO BUILD IT RIGHT INTO THE MUFFLER OR SOMETHING .
WELL I WAS GOING TO SAY RIGHT YOU COULD PUT IT IN YOU COULD YOU COULD IT COULD BE INSTALLED LIKE A CATALYTIC CONVERTER .
RIGHT .
I MEAN I GUESS YOU COULD TAKE THOSE OFF TOO BUT .
YOU COULD TAKE CA BUT MUFFLERS WOULD BE A LITTLE MORE OBVIOUS IF YOU TOOK THAT OFF .
YEAH IF YOU CAN TAKE A MUFFLER OFF AND ONLY REPLACE WELL NOT UNLESS IT WAS BUILT INTO EVERY MUFFLER .
RIGHT .
AND THAT S MUMBLEX .
BUT IF YOU WAS TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING WHICH WAS MORE OR LESS UNIVERSAL THAT UH BUSSES AND ANY KIND OF VEHICLE .
HAD TO PAY A POLLUTION TAX UH THIS WOULD PENALIZE THE HEAVY POLLUTERS AND NOT PENALIZE THE LIGHT POLLUTERS .
THAT S A THAT S QUITE A CONCEPT YOU SHOULD UH PURSUE THAT I THINK OR PATENT IT YOU KNOW .
YEAH PATENT IT THAT S A GOOD IDEA .
IF YOU COULD COME UP WITH A DEVICE THAT S THE THING .
RIGHT .
BUT IT SHOULD NT BE TOO HARD TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT THAT S A THAT S A THOUGHT NO .
UHHUH .
YOU RE RIGHT AND THAT WILL SOLVE UH A LOT OF PROBLEMS I DO NT KNOW IF YOU UH IF YOU APPROACHED THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY IF THEY WOULD BE TOO KEEN ON INSTALLING SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
UH BUT YOU KNOW A PROPOSAL TO UH UH I GUESS THE PROPER AUTHORITIES .
UHHUH .
WELL YOU MIGHT UH GENERATE SOME .
YEAH THE AUTOMOBILE REGULATORY AGENCIES OR SOMETHING .
YEAH YOU MIGHT GENERATE SOME INTEREST IN IT BUT THAT S THAT S A GOOD IDEA OTHER THAN THAT I M NOT SURE WHAT WHAT INDIVIDUALS CAN DO OTHER THAN LIKE I SAID GET INVOLVED THROUGH A GROUP OR AN ORGANIZATION .
UHHUH .
ALL RIGHT WE NEED TO DISCUSS THE VOTERS .
YES .
ON A NATIONAL AND A LOCAL LEVEL .
I I .
WHY DO YOU THINK THE APATHY EXISTS I BLAME IT TO APATHY .
YEAH UM I I SUSPECT THE APATHY IS DUE TO SOMETHING LIKE PEOPLE JUST FEELING THAT THAT THEIR VOTE DOES NT COUNT ANYWAY I MEAN WHY WHY BOTHER VOTING IF UM IF YOUR VOTE WO NT MAKE A DIFFERENCE SO FOR INSTANCE IN UM THE LAST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION I M SURE A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT OH BUSH IS GOING TO WIN EITHER WAY WHY BOTHER VOTING .
WHY SHOULD I GO OUT OF MY WAY WHEN IT DOES NT MATTER .
THAT S RIGHT I THINK THAT S AND AND THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN IS UM PEOPLE SAYING WELL IF I REALLY LIKE THE UNDERDOG CANDIDATE I STILL THINK THEY RE NOT GOING TO WIN SO ARE ONLY THE SAME TWO CAUCUSES CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO WIN WHY BOTHER VOTING FOR HIM SO I THI I THINK THAT S A BIG UH A BIG A BIG REASON FOR IT HOW ABOU .
OH I THINK SO TOO AND I THINK THE OTHER THING IS THE NEWS ME MEDIA PUTS SUCH A BLITZ ON IT THAT THEY WE HAD IT PREDETERMINED WITH A HALF OF ONE PERCENT VOTING YOU KNOW .
UM THAT S TRUE ACTUALLY I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT THAT THAT S A GOOD REA .
AND I I THINK THE YOU HEAR THE NEWS YOU KNOW YOU START OUT IN THE MORNING AND ALL DAY YOU HEAR THE NEWS AND BY TIME SAY YOU GET OFF WORK AND GO TO VOTE YOU FEEL LIKE IT DOES NT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE .
THAT S TRUE THAT S TRUE .
DUE TO THE OVERABUNDANCE OF NEWS WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO US .
UHHUH .
WHAT DO YOU THINK ON THE LOCAL ELECTIONS THOUGH .
I THINK ON THE LOCAL ELECTIONS IT S ACTUALLY UM I THINK UM I THINK PEOPLE VOTE IN THE LARGER ELECTIONS BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE WELL YOU KNOW THE COUNTRY S REAL IMPORTANT AND YOU KNOW IF I IF WE HELP ELECT A PRESIDENT WHO S GOING TO SAVE US THEN THEN THE WHOLE COUNTRY WILL BE SAVED BUT THEY FIGURE LOCAL ELECTIONS DO NT MEAN THAT MUCH I SUSPECT SO PEOPLE DO NT REALLY WORRY ABOUT THEIR LOCAL MAYOR OR SOMETHING FIGURING THAT YOU KNOW AND I THINK WRONGLY FIGURING THAT THAT WELL WHAT GOOD IS ANOTHER MAYOR GOING TO DO ANYWAY BECAUSE OUR FEDERAL TAXES ARE MORE IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW AND YOU KNOW AND STUFF LIKE THAT SO PEOPLE THINK THAT THAT THAT THEY DO NT HAVE UM THAT THAT IT DOES NT MATTER AS MUCH WHEREAS I THINK IT S PROBABLY JUST THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE I THINK IT S PROBABLY THE CASE THAT PEOPLE COULD HAVE MORE EFFECT ON A LOCAL LEVEL .
OH I THINK SO TOO ABSOLUTELY UH I THINK ANOTHER THING AND UH I M MAKING A JUDGMENT HERE THAT MAY OR MAY I THINK IT IS TOTALLY WRONG WELL .
UH .
I THINK THAT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE HAVE UM A LOWER INCOME WHICH YOU AUTOMATICALLY EQUATE WITH LOWER EDUCATION .
RIGHT .
TEND NOT TO BE REGISTERED .
UM .
AND THEY DO NT REGISTER AND THEY DO NT UNDERSTAND THAT YOU CA NT GO AND VOTE AND REGISTER ALL AT THE SAME TIME OR WHEN IT GETS DOWN TO THE POINT OF SOMEONE SAYING ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE TODAY THEY SAY WELL I WOULD .
RIGHT BUT .
AND I BELIEVE IN THIS BUT .
YEAH THAT S THAT S POSSIBLE I STILL THINK THAT A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE THE ONES WHO REALLY THINK THAT THEIR VOTES DO NT MAKE A DIFFERENCE THOUGH AS WELL I THINK IT S THOSE SAME PEOPLE WHO DO NT KNOW ANY BETTER ABOUT HOW WE VOTE ARE ARE ARE A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT WELL LOOK AT ME I M JUST A LITTLE NOBODY MY VOTE S NOT GOING TO COUNT ANYWAY YOU KNOW AND I THINK THAT S PROBABLY A PORTION OF THE POPULATION THAT MASSIVELY UNDER REPRESENT I I I WOULD GUESS THAT THAT PORTION OF THE POPULATION IS MASSIVELY UNDER REPRESENTED .
I HAD AN INTERESTING COMMENT ONE TIME A THOUGHT THAT WOULD NEVER HAVE CROSSED MY MIND I HAD SOMEONE TELL ME THAT I WILL NEVER REGISTER TO VOTE BECAUSE I DO NT WANT TO SERVE ON A JURY .
UM WHAT DO THEY HAVE TO DO WITH ONE ANOTHER .
I JUST I THEY I JUST WANDERED OFF FROM THAT ONE I WAS JUST SO SURPRISED AND AMAZED WITH THE STATEMENT THAT THEY SAY ONLY REGISTERED VOTERS CAN BE PICKED FOR JURY SELECTION .
OH SO THEY DID NT WANT TO WIND UP BEING A JUROR EVER .
SO THEY WOR IF THEY DO NT VOTE THEY DO NT HAVE TO BE ON A JURY .
OH I DID NT REALIZE THAT ACTUALLY THAT .
THERE IS CONVOLUTED LOGIC FOR YOU .
YEAH THERE IS THERE ARE MUCH EASIER WAYS TO GET OUT OF JURY DUTY .
YES .
JUST GO IN AND SAY OH I WANT TO BE A JUROR I CAN SPOT A GUILTY PERSON A MILE AWAY .
OH I JUST RIGHT RIGHT THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER WAYS BUT THAT ONE IT JUST DEFEATED ME I DID NT HAVE ANY ANSWER FOR THAT ONE THAT ONE WAS JUST BEYOND MY IMAGINATION .
WELL THAT THAT JUST SEEMS TO BE A PERSON WHO JUST DOES NT CARE ABOUT MUCH OF ANYTHING AROUND SORT OF YOU KNOW DOES NT DOES NT SORT OF LIKES RIGHTS PROBABLY BUT DOES NT LIKE RESPON RESPONSIBILITIES .
THAT S A GOOD POINT YOU RE PROBABLY RIGHT .
I MEAN THAT S WHAT IT BOILS DOWN TO IS PEOPLE LIKE TO PEOPLE SAY OH I DO NT WANT TO BE ON JURY YOU KNOW I DO NT WANT TO SERVE ON JURY DUTY I DO NT WANT TO VOTE I DO NT WANT TO DO THIS AND THAT WELL THEN THEY COULD YOU KNOW PUT THEM IN THE REVERSE SITUATION IN THE PLACE WHERE THEY DO NT HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE ON JURY DUTY AND THEY DO NT HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE .
WHICH .
I SUSPECT THEIR OPINIONS WOULD CHANGE VERY QUICKLY .
AND THAT WAS WHAT I WAS THINKING EXACTLY ABOUT BECAUSE IN THE SOVIET UNION THEY HAD AN ELECTION AND THEY HAD WHAT LIKE A NINETYEIGHT PERCENT TURNOUT .
YES .
A MASSIVE TURNOUT AT LAST SOMEONE WANTS US TO VOTE THEY WERE STANDING IN LINES TO VOTE .
YES THEY WERE THEY WERE DOING THAT UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WHAT THEY THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT THEY WERE VOTING ON IT TURNS OUT .
AND THEIR VOTE DID NT COUNT .
THAT S RIGHT BUT BUT IT S THE THOUGHT THEY ALL GOT OUT BUT YOU WONDER IF YOU KNOW IF IF NOW THE NEXT ELECTION THEY HAVE IF ONLY HALF OF THEM ARE GOING TO SHOW UP OR HOW MANY GENERATIONS IT WILL TAKE UNTIL ONLY HALF OF THE VOTERS SHOW UP IN RUSSIA .
OR ANY ONE SHOWS UP .
RIGHT THAT S THAT S TRUE .
TOTAL INDIFFERENCE YOU KNOW WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE BACK .
RIGHT .
GONE THE FULL CIRCLE .
NOW IF THINGS GO THE WAY THAT THAT THAT THEY ARE THERE I THINK THAT THEY LL KEEP VOTING BUT I THINK THEY LL WIND UP LIKE US AT SOME POINT WHERE PEOPLE SORT OF ONLY HALF OF THEM WILL END UP VOTING AND SORT OF CARING ENOUGH TO REALLY MAKE A STATEMENT SO YOU KNOW I THINK I THINK THAT THAT THE PEOPLE WHO MOST NEED TO VOTE SOMETIMES ARE THE ARE THE ONES WHO WHO ARE REALLY OUT TO MAKE A STATEMENT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN WHEN YOU VE GOT AN UNDERDOG CANDIDATE WHO REPRESENTS SOMETHING AND EVEN IF HE DOES NT WIN A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE VOTING FOR THAT PARTICULAR CANDIDATE DOES I THINK MAKE A STATEMENT .
OH CERTAINLY THERE S A MESSAGE THERE .
TO EVERYONE ELSE .
EVEN IF THEY LOSE .
YEAH I THINK AND I THINK THAT S REAL IMPORTANT .
OH AND I THINK WOMEN TURN OUT TO VOTE FOR WOMEN TOO .
THAT S PROBABLY TRUE .
YEAH I THIN WELL I KNOW IT S TRUE YOU SEE A LOT OF THAT YOU KNOW RALLY BEHIND THE FEMALE SHE MAY LOSE BUT BY GOLLY WE RE GOING TO MAKE A STATEMENT HERE .
UM .
YOU KNOW .
THAT S GOOD THAT S ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD WELL ACT ACT ACTUALLY THE FEMALE WHO I WOULD MOST RALLY BEHIND RIGHT NOW RIGHT I DO NT KNOW MUCH ABOUT HER POLITICS BY THE WAY THE WAY SHE MAKES SPEECHES IS A LOCAL PERSON FOR YOU IS ANN RICHARDS .
OH OKAY .
I DO NT KNOW HER POLITICS I JUST KNOW THAT UH I SAW HER SPEAK IN THE EIGHTYFOUR DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION AND RIGHT THEN AND THERE IF THEY SAID TO ME VOTE FOR SOMEONE FOR PRESIDENT I WOULD HAVE SLAPPED DOWN MY VOTE FOR ANN RICHARDS .
WAS WAS THAT THE TIME NO THAT WAS EIGHTYFOUR THAT S TOO SOON SHE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT UH GINGER ROGERS DID EVERYTHING FRED ASTAIRE DID AND SHE DID IT BACKWARDS IN HIGH HEELS .
THAT S VERY GOOD .
SHE SAID THAT I DID NT SAID YOU KNOW DO NT TELL ME WHAT WOMEN CAN DO .
THAT S THAT S THAT S THAT S VERY GOOD THAT S I I LIKE THAT SO I WOULD UH I WOULD VOTE FOR HER AND I SUSPECT SHE COULD GET A LARGE VOTER TURNOUT .
I THINK I DID VOTE FOR HER AS A MATTER OF FACT I M PRETTY SURE I DID .
SAY I I I WOULD THINK THAT UM THAT THAT PEOPLE LIKE THAT I THINK IN INFLAMMATORY POLITICIANS ARE UM OR OR EMOTIONAL POLITICIANS CERTAIN VERY VIBRANT POLITICIANS TEND TO BRING CROWDS OUT I THINK I WOULD HOPE .
WELL AND SOME OF THE ISSUES ARE SO EMOTIONAL .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW SOME OF THE REALLY THE REALLY EMOTIONAL ONES HAVE YOU FOLLOWED THE DALLAS ELECTIONS ON ZONING .
NO I VE HEARD OF IT BUT NOT NECESSARILY THE I VE HEARD IT S VERY CONTROVERSIAL THOUGH .
I EVERYONE HAS MADE SO MANY STATEMENTS I DO NT LIVE IN DALLAS COUNTY .
UHHUH .
BUT I VE HEARD SO MANY STATEMENTS THAT I VE LOST TRACK .
UM .
I HONESTLY AT THIS POINT IT S IT S JUST TOO BLOWN OUT OF PROPORTION FOR EVERYONE YOU REALLY EVEN THE NEWS YOU CAN NOT FOLLOW .
YES .
WHAT THE STO THE ACTUAL FACTS ARE AT THIS POINT .
THAT S WHAT .
I DO NT I DO NT REALLY KNOW IF SOME OF THE POOR JUDGES THAT ARE TRYING TO DECIDE HOW IT SHOULD BE DIVIDED .
UHHUH .
I WONDER ABOUT THEM AT SOME POINT .
UM UHHUH WELL THEY WERE ELECTED AS WELL SO .
THAT S CORRECT .
SO SO THEY RE GOING TO BE .
AND THAT S AND THAT S ANOTHER INTERESTING QUESTION SHOULD JUDGES BE ELECTED OR APPOINTED .
THAT S TRUE THAT S TRUE WELL .
ARE THEY POLITICIANS .
WELL IN SOME SENSE THEY SHOULD BE POLITICIANS IN THAT YOU KNOW YOU WANT THEM TO RESPECT THE PEOPLE AND YOU DO NT WANT THEM TO HAVE YOU DO NT WANT A JUDGE TO BE APPOINTED BECAUSE YOU DO NT WANT SOMEONE S FRIEND TO BE A JUDGE .
SURE .
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND .
OR YOU WANT TO TAKE THE OTHER SIDE OF IT YOU CAN ARGUE THAT S ONE OF THOSE YOU CAN PICK EITHER SIDE .
RIGHT .
AND WE COULD SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON IT .
THAT S RIGHT .
BECAUSE IT S IT S DIFFICULT .
UHHUH .
IT S SITUATIONAL REALLY .
SO HOW DO YOU THINK WE CAN GET PEOPLE TO VOTE .
UH UH .
I VE HAD ONE IDEA THAT I THINK IS IS IS COMPLETELY UNDOABLE BUT BUT I THINK BUT I SUSPECT IT WOULD WORK AND THE WAY TO DO IT IS TO GET AN ABSOLUTELY ATROCIOUS CANDIDATE WHO YOU NEVER EXPECT TO WIN TO GO OUT AND MAKE INFLAMMATORY AND RIDICULOUS AND STUPID STATEMENTS SO THAT A LARGE POPULATION OF OF VOTERS WILL GO OUT AND VOTE AGAINST THAT PERSON FOR SOMEONE ELSE .
OH .
SO GIVEN A CHOICE BETWEEN YOU KNOW SO THAT SO IF YOU HAVE SO IF IF IMAGINE A WORLD WHERE YOU HAVE TWO REAL CANDIDATES AND ONE IDIOT WHO GOES OUT AND MAKES YOU KNOW ANTI YOU KNOW SORT OF UM ANTI WOMEN STATEMENTS ANTI SEMITIC STATEMENTS ANTI BLACK STATEMENTS ET CETERA ET CETERA WELL THEN I SUSPECT A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD GO OUT AND CHOOSE A CANDIDATE TO VOTE FOR JUST JUST TO SPITE THAT PERSON BUT I DO NT THINK .
UM .
THAT THAT WOULD ACTUALLY EVER WORK .
WELL THIS IS TRUE THIS IS TRUE I WAS WORRYING ALONG THE LINES OF YOU GET EVERY TIME SOMEONE PUTS IN A BALLOT IN A BALLOT BOX .
UHHUH .
A DOLLAR BILL COMES OUT THE BOTTOM .
THAT S AN INTERESTING NOTION .
THAT MIGHT WORK IN SOME PLACES .

I JUST REMEMBER WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT THAT IT HAD KIND OF MIXED REVIEWS .

THEY HAVE F F X TWO OUT I DO NT KNOW IF .
YEAH YEAH I REALLY NEED TO GO SEE THE ORIGINAL ONE I M SURE IT WAS A GOOD MOVIE I JUST I PROBABLY HAD A TEST THAT DAY OR SOMETHING I DO NT KNOW .
YEAH IT WAS ONE OF THOSE THAT HAS A LOT OF TWISTS IN IT .
YEAH .
YEAH IT S IT S IT S IT S UH I CA NT PUT IT EXACTLY ON THE LINES OF THE JAGGED EDGE BUT IT YOU KNOW .
UHHUH YEAH .
KIND OF ON THAT END YOU KNOW YOU GET THESE TWISTS AND IT S USUALLY PRETTY GOOD BUT UH .
I THINK I THINK THOUGH THAT MOVIES ARE LOSING THEIR LUSTER .
WHAT S THAT .
I THINK MOVIES ARE LOSING THEIR ATTRACTIVENESS JUST TO A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST I THINK I DO NT KNOW BECAUSE OF THE COST AND I THINK IT IT S JUST LOSING ITS ORIGINALITY OR SOMETHING I DO NT I CA NT PIN PINPOINT IT .
YEAH YEAH .
BUT IT DOES NT SEEM LIKE IT S AS BIG UH RAGE TO GET THE MOVIE THEATER AS IT USED TO BE .
THAT S PROBABLY TRUE I I I JUST YOU SEE THE SAME STORY LINES DIFFERENT CHARACTERS AND .
UHHUH YEAH EXACTLY .
UM I DO NT KNOW IT S IT S IT S HARD TO SAY AN AND I KNOW I DO NT YOU KNOW I DO NT KEEP UP WITH IT .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW BUT UH I DO NT TRY TO JU JU JUST FOR THAT REASON IT IS A IT DOES COST A LOT .
UHHUH .
SO WHY GO OUT AND SEE SOMETHING RIGHT AWAY YOU KNOW YOU KIND OF WAIT AND IF SOMETHING GETS REALLY GOOD REVIEWS MAYBE YOU D FINALLY GO SPEND THE TWELVE BUCKS .
RIGHT RIGHT UHHUH .
YOU KNOW TO GO TO IT BUT UM YOU KNOW I HAVE NT BEEN TO A G TO AN OPENING FOR OH YOU KNOW AGES .
UHHUH .
JUST BECAUSE .
OKAY WELL WHAT S YOUR OPINION ABOUT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT .
WELL CATHY I THINK THAT UH CAPITAL PUNISHMENT CERTAINLY HAS A PLACE IN OUR SOCIETY UM MAYBE FROM THE SENSE THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE JUST CA NT AFFORD TO HAVE REPEATED EVEN IN THE REMOTE CHANCE OF REPETITION .
RIGHT I THINK I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT TOO I I CA NT SEE ANY POINT IN KEEPING SOMEONE WHO S OBVIOUSLY BEYOND ANY KIND OF REHABILITATION UH KEEPING THEM YOU KNOW PAYING FOR THEM TO LIVE IN PRISON FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS WHEN YOU COULD PROBABLY JUST ELIMINATE THE PROBLEM MAYBE SPEND THE MONEY ON SOMEONE WHO COULD POSSIBLY BE HELPED .
THAT MIGHT BE TRUE UM I M WHAT I DO NT KNOW IS WHERE DO WE DRAW THE LINE .
RIGHT .
UH DO WE SAY THAT EVERY ONE WHO COMMITS MURDER IN THE FIRST DEGREE IS LIABLE FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IF THAT S WHAT THE JURY DECIDES IS AN APPROPRIATE PUNISHMENT FOR THEIR CRIME OR DO WE EXTEND IT BEYOND THAT .
UHHUH BEYOND MURDER OR JUST BEYOND LIKE FIRST DEGREE MURDER .
WELL EITHER YOU KNOW UH I HAVE A A NINE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND THERE ARE SOME CRIMES THAT COULD BE COMMITTED AGAINST HER THAT ARE NOT EVEN CONSIDERED CAPITAL CRIMES THAT THAT I WOULD CONSIDER BASIS FOR MURDER .
YEAH YEAH WELL THAT REALLY GETS INTO A STICKY ISSUE UH I COULD SEE THAT TOO I THINK THERE S PROBABLY THINGS I COULD THINK OF SHORT OF MURDER THAT SOMEONE I THINK SOMEONE WOULD PROBABLY DESERVE TO BE KILLED FOR BUT GOSH AND WHO S GOING TO DECIDE WHICH IS HOW BAD YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT TO YOU IS REALLY BAD MIGHT NOT BE QUITE SO BAD TO ME AND UH IT S GETS INTO A PRETTY STICKY ISSUE .
YES IT DOES A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE CULTURES THAT WE GREW UP IN AND WHAT S TERMED ACCEPTABLE AND UM TO WHAT S ALLOWABLE AND WHERE ARE WE .
RIGHT .
UH YOU KNOW IF WE WERE LIVED IN A DIFFERENT COUNTRY THEN MURDER IS NOT SO BAD .
YEAH .
BUT OVER HERE WHERE WE RE PROMISED THE CIVIL LIBERTIES OF PURS LIFE LIBERTY AND PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS THEN TAKING THAT AWAY IS A A HEINOUS ACT .
YEAH IN SOME EYES I THINK SOME PEOPLE GIVE UP THAT I THINK SOME OF WHAT WE CONSIDER RIGHTS ARE REALLY MORE PRIVILEGES THAN THAN WHAT MOST PEOPLE THINK OF THEM AS I DO NT KNOW WHAT UM TEXAS S CRITERIA FOR CAPITAL MURDER IS DO CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS DO YOU KNOW ARE THERE SOME SET GUIDELINES LIKE ONLY UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES .
I DO NT KNOW I BELIEVE IT S UH AT THE DISCRETION OF THE JUDGE OR JURY .
UHHUH I USED TO LIVE IN VIRGINIA AND I KNOW WHEN THEY FIRST REINSTATED CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IT WAS ONLY UM IF SOMEONE KILLED A POLICE OFFICER OR SOMEONE COMMITTED RAPE AND THEN MURDER THOSE WERE THE ONLY TWO CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE YOU COULD GIVE SOMEONE THE DEATH PENALTY WHICH I THINK IS A LITTLE TOO LIMITED .
I TEND TO AGREE WITH YOU THERE UM MY BELIEF IS THAT IS THAT UM ANY CRIME THAT S FREELY COMMITTED YOU KNOW FREEDOM OF CHOICE .
UHHUH .
THESE PEOPLE HAD A CHOICE OF COMMITTING THIS CRIME THAT INVOLVES THE TAKING OF ANOTHER S LIFE OR THE ALTERING OF SOMEONE S LIFE .
YEAH .
SUCH AS RAPE DESERVES PUNISHMENT BY DEATH BUT THEN I M ALSO TOLD THAT I M A PRETTY HARSH PERSON .
YEAH IN GENERAL TERMS I M NOT SO HARSH BUT THEN WHENEVER I HEAR OF A SPECIFIC CASE YOU KNOW WHERE SOMEONE DID SOMETHING THEN IT S LIKE YEAH PUT IT TO THEM SO I THINK I PROBABLY TEND TO BE A LITTLE BIT HARSH TOO AS FAR AS THAT GOES BECAUSE YEAH I THINK YOU RE RIGHT THAT PERSON VOLUNTARILY GIVES UP WHEN THEY DECIDE TO COMMIT THAT CRIME THEY VOLUNTARILY GIVE UP THEIR RIGHT TO CONTINUE ON WITH THEIR HAPPY LIFE JUST BECA YOU KNOW THEY RUIN SOMEONE ELSE S LIFE .
ALL RIGHT I CAN SEE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PERSON WHO GOES OUT TO ROB A STORE FOR FOOD .
RIGHT .
THAN A PERSON WHO COMMITS A CRIME TO EITHER FOR THE THRILL OF COMMITTING THE CRIME OR THE THRILL THE FEELING OF POWER THAT THEY GET FROM IT OR TO ACQUIRE DRUGS FOR SOME OTHER I MEAN ACQUIRE FUNDS FOR SOME OTHER ILLEGAL ACTIVITY .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THAT SECOND GROUP OF PEOPLE FALLS INTO THE GROUP THAT I SAY GIVE UP THEIR RIGHTS THE THE FIRST GUY YOU KNOW I JUST ASSUMED IT WAS A GUY THE FIRST PERSON .
THAT WENT OUT TO ROB A STORE FOR FOOD THAT TO ME IS IS A DIFFERENT SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE HE HE DESERVES HELP INSTEAD OF UH LOSS OF LIFE .
RIGHT .
YEAH HE DID NT GO OUT WITH THE INTENT OF HURTING SOMEONE ELSE .
THAT S RIGHT OR WITH THE .
OR WITH NO REGARD FOR SOMEONE ELSE S WELL BEING WHAT ABOUT UH LIKE TEENAGERS THAT GET INVOLVED IN A GANG AND DO A DRIVE BY SHOOTING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SAY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN YEAR OLD WOULD YOU CONSIDER UH CAPITAL PUNISHMENT FOR THEM .
I THINK I WOULD PROBABLY LOWER THE AGE TO ABOUT FOURTEEN .
UHHUH .
THERE S SOME AND I I CERTAINLY DO NT KNOW MYSELF BUT SOMEBODY NEEDS TO DO A STUDY THAT SAYS AT WHAT AGE TRUE AND COMPLETE LOGICAL THOUGHT TO INCLUDE THE THE CONSIDERATION OF OF LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES .
RIGHT .
BEGINS .
YEAH WHAT AGE THEY RE ACCOUNTABLE .
YOU KNOW .
FOR THEIR ACTIONS .
I HAVE AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD AND UH WELL HE S NINETEEN NOW AND I DO NT THINK THAT I SAW IT IN HIM UNTIL MAYBE LAST YEAR .
AND I HAVE AN ELEVEN YEAR OLD AND A NINE YEAR OLD AND I DO NT DO NT SEE IT IN THEM YET BUT I M I M NOT SURE WHERE IT BEGINS .
YEAH I KNOW THAT THEY ARE LOWERING THE AGE OF UH WHATEVER IS CONSIDERED A MINOR I THINK THE KIDS CERTAIN KIDS HAVE BEEN TRIED AS ADULTS WHO WERE A LOT YOUNGER THAN THEY USED TO BE LIKE I THINK I READ ABOUT A BOY THAT WAS NINE OR TEN THAT GOT MAD AT SOME PLAYMATES AND WENT IN AND GOT A GUN AND JUST OPENED FIRE ON THEM AND THEY WERE TRYING TO CHARGE HIM AS A .
OKAY UH WHY DO YOU THINK IT UH SOUNDS DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD ADOPT IT .
NO I DO NT LIKE METRIC SYSTEM .
YOU DO NT .
I I I THINK THE COUNTRY IS IS UH TOO INGRAINED IN THE INCHES AND AND JUST THE GENERAL UH BACKGROUND THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY HAS BEEN INCHES AND I DO NT THINK THERE S A BIG ADVANTAGE IN GOING TO THE METRIC SYSTEM .
UHHUH .
IT IT S GOING TO DISORIENT AND CONFUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND THERE ARE GOING TO BE PEOPLE .
WHO DIE BECAUSE OF IT BECAUSE THEY DO NT UNDERSTAND UH YOU KNOW SIMPLE THINGS FROM THE AMOUNT OF MEDICINE .
THEY SHOULD TAKE TO HOW FAST THEY CAN DRIVE .
YEAH .
AND YOU KNOW HOW FAR AWAY SOMETHING IS AND IT S IT S NOT IN OUR NATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS TO DO IT .
WE VE ALWAYS MEASURED THINGS IN THE ENGLISH SYSTEM .
YEAH .
AND YOU KNOW EVERYTHING YOU KNOW OUR LAND IS IN ACRES OUR PEOPLE ARE NT GOING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT .
RIGHT .
AN AMOUNT OF SOMETHING IS .
YEAH I I AGREE WITH YOU .
I DO NT THINK WE SHOULD EITHER EVEN THOUGH I KNOW THERE ARE BENEFITS TO THE METRIC SYSTEM I DO NT THINK THE BENEFITS OF THE METRIC SYSTEM OUTWEIGH THE THE DISADVANTAGES .
THAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE PEOPLE IN AMERICA .
YEAH .
AND ALSO THE UH I DO NT KNOW IT SEEMS ALMOST LIKE THERE S THIS IT S A PEER PRESSURE THING IS WHY WE KEEP WANTING TO DO IT IS SO WE LL LOOK GOOD TO THE OTHER NATIONS BECAUSE I THINK THEY THAT S AN AREA THAT THE OTHER NATIONS ESPECIALLY EUROPE LOOK DOWN ON US LIKE OH WE RE JUST BACKWARD WAYWARD CHILDREN .
WHO STILL USE THIS BACKWARD SYSTEM WHO HAVE NT REALLY ATTAINED IT YET .
AND I FEEL IT S JUST PRIDE OF WHY THEY KEEP TRYING TO PUSH IT ON US .
AND IT S LIKE HEY WE RE CONTENT WITH THIS .
NO IT S PROBABLY NOT AS ACCURATE PROBABLY YOU KNOW INTELLECTUALLY DOES NT IT S NOT AS SOUND INTELLECTUALLY BUT LIKE YOU SAID I MEAN COME ON .
I HAD SIX YEARS OF COLLEGE AND I DO NT KNOW THE METRIC SYSTEM AND I DO NT CARE TO LEARN IT .
YEAH .
AND I M NOT SOME KIND OF AN IDIOT I JUST .
AND IT S EASY TO TRANS WE HAVE A COMPUTER FOR JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING NOW AND IF IT S NECESSARY TO TRANSLATE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THEM IT CAN BE DONE .
YEAH .
BECAUSE I M A MECHANICAL ENGINEER AND I VE HAD TO WORK WHEN I WAS DESIGNING PACKAGES FOR PEOPLE I MEAN I HAD TO TO WORK BOTH .
SYSTEMS .
UHHUH .
BACK AND FORTH AND IT WAS NOT HARD AND YOU GET YOU CAN GET A CAT CAM SYSTEM .
THAT CAN TAKE ANY DESIGN .
YOU WANT AND YOU CAN PUSH A BUTTON AND IT LL CONVERT EVERY MEASUREMENT ON THERE .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW FROM ONE SYSTEM TO THE OTHER .
THERE S A LOT OF .
IN SECONDS .
PEOPLE LIKE YOU RE EDUCATED I M EDUCATED MY HUSBAND IS BUT I MEAN A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE FLAT NOT EDUCATED AND IF I HAVE A HARD TIME YOU KNOW .
REALLY .
PUTTING THAT INTO MY LIFE CAN WE PUT THAT OFF ON THE OTHER EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE POPULATION .
THAT DOES NT HAVE ANY COLLEGE OR I DO NT KNOW HOW MUCH OF THE .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW BUT A LARGE PERCENTAGE PROBABLY OVER HALF OF THE REST OF THE POPULATION .
ABSOLUTELY .
THEY DO NT HAVE ANY COLLEGE PROBABLY MUCH AT ALL AND IF WE CA NT TAKE IT AND USE IT EASILY WELL HOW CAN YOU PUT THAT ON LIKE ELDERLY PEOPLE AND .
OH YEAH IT S JUST .
YOU KNOW JUST PEOPLE .
THAT MAYBE JUST ARE NT BLESSED WITH AS AS MUCH SHARPNESS AND MENT MENTAL ACUITY .
OR OR EVEN HAVE HAD THE ABILITY YOU KNOW THE CHANCE TO TO GO TO COLLEGE OR TO TO .
YEAH .
TO LEARN ABOUT I THINK IT S STILL GOOD THEY DO COVER THE SYSTEM .
I THINK IT SHOULD STILL BE TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS .
YEAH .
AND THEY DO I KNOW NOW BECAUSE I EVEN WHEN I WAS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL YEARS AGO .
UHHUH .
THEY WERE YOU KNOW WE LEARNED WHAT .
A CENTIMETER WAS AND A DECIMETER AND THE VARIOUS YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
BASICALLY THE OTHER ALTERNATE FORMS OF MEASUREMENTS THINGS LIKE THAT .
YEAH .
AND AND THAT S ACCEPTABLE .
YEAH I THINK IT FAILED TOO BECAUSE LIKE WHAT .
YOU SAID OF JUST YOU KNOW HEY THIS IS RIDICULOUS .
THE THING AMERICANS HAVE SO MUCH STRESS ON THEM RIGHT NOW .
YEAH .
I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT THE AVERAGE FAMILY .
IT S LIKE MAN THEY BARELY HAVE TIME TO STOP AND GET GAS MUCH LESS TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH GAS .
THEY RE REALLY GETTING AND .
REALLY .
DO ALL THIS .
IT .
S LIKE I MEAN COME ON LET S TAKE THE PRESSURE .
YOU KNOW YOU NEED TWENTY GALLONS BUT DO YOU NEED HOW MANY LITERS .
YEAH AND IT S JUST LIKE ANOTHER THING .
YEAH .
THE AMERICAN FAMILY DOES NT NEED ANY MORE PRESSURE .
JUST LEAVE THEM ALONE LET THEM MEASURE THEIR DRINKING WATER IN CUPS AND .
YEAH .
LEAVE THEM ALONE .
AND IT IT JUST DOES NT MUMBLEX IT JUST DOES NT MAKE THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE IN THE AVERAGE LIFE AND THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AND PLACES WHERE IT S NEEDED .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW THAT S FINE AND THE REST OF THE WORLD I MEAN WE ARE IT S NOT WE MAY NOT BE THE TOP I DO NT KNOW IF WE RE THE TOP WE RE ONE OF THE TOP SUPERPOWERS OF THE WORLD .
UHHUH .
THAT S .
IT MAY BE ARROGANT BUT I MEAN LET THEM COME TO US .
THAT S KIND OF THE WAY .
I FEEL ABOUT IT .
WE CAN CONVERT .
AND AND IF THEY DO NT LIKE THE WAY .
WE DO IT JUST GET OFF OUR DO NT WORRY ABOUT IT .
AND I THINK .
YEAH IT IT S KIND OF LIKE EXPECTING EVERYONE TO SUDDENLY SPEAK GERMAN .
RIGHT IT IS .
YOU KNOW .
BECAUSE IT IS ANOTHER LANGUAGE YEAH .
YEAH .
AND AND INSTEAD OF SAYING THE WORLD SPEAK GERMAN WE FOUND OUT THAT WE CAN TRANSLATE .
AND THAT S WHAT .
I THINK WE OUGHT TO DO WITH THE METRIC SYSTEM .
THAT S FUNNY .
WELL THAT S GOOD .
I THINK WE KEPT IT AT REAL GOOD .
OKAY .
IS THAT .
ALL .
WE NEED TO SAY .
YEAH .
IT S BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU .
YOU TOO .
I THINK THAT WAS GOOD .
OKAY .
THAT WAS THE BEST ONE .
USUALLY I GET DISTRACTED OFF THE TOPIC .
YOU KNOW WHAT .
I MEAN .
YEAH .
AND WE LL END UP ONE MAN WAS TELLING ME ABOUT HIS GRANDFATHER IN LITHUANIA AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING TOT INCOME TAX OR SOMETHING .
ALL RIGHT .
AND I JUST .
WELL GOOD TALKING TO YOU .
ANYWAY I APPRECIATE IT .
HAVE A GOOD DAY .
BYEBYE .
UM WHAT DO YOU THINK THE MAJOR CAUSE OF AIR POLLUTION OR AT LEAST IN THE BOSTON AREAS .
WELL THE THE THE MAJOR CAUSE .
IT SEEMS UP HERE IS EXC I LIVE RIGHT ON THE OCEAN SO IT S KIND OF HARD FOR ME TO TELL WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF I LIVED IN SOME OF THE VALLEYS INLAND .
UHHUH .
BUT THE MAJOR CAUSE HERE AND WE ALWAYS SEEM TO AND IT SEEMS TO BE VALIDATED BY THE PRESS IS THE CAR POLLUTION .
WE DO NT HAVE TOO MUCH INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION .
YEAH YEAH .
UH CAR POLLUTION SEEMS TO BE THE ONE AND ONLY THING THAT THAT I CAN REALLY PUT MY FINGER ON HERE .
UM THAT IS NT THE SAME IN THE WASHINGTON AREA BECAUSE WE DO NT HAVE ANY MAJOR UM INDUSTRY EXCEPT FOR UH GOVERNMENT AND SERVICES .
AND THE THE TRANSPORTATION SITUATION IS SUCH THAT UH ALL THE CAR POLLUTION IS IS ABSOLUTELY AWFUL .
UM ALSO THE WORTH OF THE HUB OF THREE AIRPORTS IN THIS GENERAL AREA .
THERE IS UH NATIONAL DULLES AND THEN UH BALTIMORE WASHINGTON .
AND IT INTERESTINGLY SOME OF THE INFORMATION .
I VE BEEN READING INDICATES THAT THE AMOUNT OF AIR POLLUTION FROM UH UH AIRPLANES IS EXTRAORDINARY .
IS THAT SO .
YEAH .
I DID NT KNOW THAT .
AND THAT S ALWAYS SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW YOU JUST DO NT REAL YOU DO NT THINK ABOUT .
WELL MOST PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE NOISE POLLUTION FROM AIRPLANES RATHER THAN THE AIR POLLUTION .
BUT THE UH APPARENTLY THE AIR POLLUTION AND THE FACT THAT IT S DELIVERED RIGHT UP IN HIGH ALTITUDES .
YEAH .
IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT FACTOR .
I WOULD THINK SO .
YOU KNOW UH I I GUESS IT TALKED ABOUT ALL TYPES OF POLLUTION .
I HAPPEN TO R JUST READ SOMETHING THE OTHER DAY AT LEAST IN THE BOSTON PAPER .
THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT THAT COME TO NOTE .
ONE IS THAT THE CARBON FLUORIDES .
THAT ARE UH BEING RELEASED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE ARE CAUSING EVEN A LARGER HOLE IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE IN THE OZONE LAYER AND AGAIN AND NOW THEY VE LOCATED ANOTHER ONE OR LA RATHER AN EXPANDING ONE IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE .
SO CAR SO I M QUITE CONCERNED .
I DO NT THINK IT S INVOLVED ANY LONGER WITH WITH UH HAIR SPRAYS OR THOSE TH .
YEAH .
YEAH .
NO I THINK IT S NOW IS WHAT UH FROM WHAT .
I UNDERSTAND IT .
S AIR CONDITIONING UNITS AND AND .
UHHUH .
WE CERTAINLY TURNED INTO AN AIR CONDITIONED .
SOCIETY .
SOCIETY .
HAS ESPECIALLY RECENTLY .
YEAH I KNOW IN FLORIDA THERE S NO PLACE .
YOU GO THAT IS NT AIR CONDITIONED AND I DO QUITE A BIT OF BUSINESS IN WASHINGTON .
AND .
I MEAN YOU KNOW WHAT .
IT .
S LIKE HERE .
OH YEAH IT S QUITE IS IS THE UN IT S REALLY OUT OF THE NORM NOT TO FIND SOMETHING .
THAT IS NT AIR CONDITIONED .
AND .
YEAH YEAH YEAH .
AND I GUESS REFRIGERATORS .
WE JUST HAD THE .
ARE THE SAME WAY .
THEY RELEASE THAT .
THAT S RIGHT .
SO SOLUTIONS TO THIS .
YEAH .
WOULD BE I I .
WELL .
YOU KNOW IMPROVED .
WELL I GUESS THE FUR THE TO ME .
THE FIRST THING IS I WISH SOCIETY WOULD GET AS UPSET ABOUT THIS AS YOU DO GET GETTING PEOPLE UPSET ABOUT ANIMAL RIGHTS .
YEAH .
I MEAN THIS IS SO SO BASIC .
IT .
S HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE SENSE BUT UH IN TERMS OF DEMANDING IT S JUST NOT CAUSED BUT DEMANDING THAT UH WE CAN SPEND SO MUCH MONEY ON CERTAIN THINGS BUT THAT RESEARCH REALLY BE DIRECTED TOWARD UM IMPROVEMENT OF POLLUTING VEHICLES AND NOT JUST CARS BUT ALSO BUSES UM PLANES .
THAT SOMETHING CAN BE DONE .
I ME I CA NT IMAGINE THAT WELL .
WELL I I TH .
IF WE CA NT SEND PEOPLE TO THE MOON .
YEAH .
THAT WE CA NT IMPROVE THESE THINGS .
NO I THINK THAT IT CAN BE DONE SIMPLY BECAUSE UH UH WE VE WE VE EVERY CAR NOW IN AMERICA .
THAT S BEEN PRODUCED FOR THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS HAS WHAT .
THEY CALL A CATALYTIC CONVERTER .
CONVERTER YEAH UHHUH .
AND NO LEAD GAS WAS CAME TO THE PUMPS .
AND AND THAT S BEEN DONE .
THERE S THE LEAD POLLUTION HAS THAT PROBLEM ESSENTIALLY I GUESS BECAUSE IT WAS AT CRISIS PROPORTIONS WAS .
UHHUH .
WAS LICKED .
AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE TH THERE ARE SOLUTIONS .
AND THAT MUMBLEX FOR BUSES .
CERTAINLY WE DO NT EVEN NEED A NEED A RESEARCH ANYMORE .
IT S JUST A MATTER OF PASSING THE LAW AND PASSING THE LAW DEPENDS ON HOW HEAVY THE CAR INDUSTRY THE AUTOMOBILE LOBBY IS .
THAT S RIGHT .
WELL AND ALSO TO MAKE IT ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE .
THAT S RIGHT .
THAT S RIGHT .
UH AND PER TI ALSO IN BUSES .
I DO NT KNOW IF YOU EVER GOT CAUGHT IN A TRAFFIC JAM BEHIND A BUS .
OH YEAH WELL .
THAT YOU KNOW .
THAT THAT THE THE SMELL IS AWFUL AND BUT YOU KNOW I WAS READING THE OTHER DAY NOT TO GO ON WITH THIS BUT THAT .
UHHUH .
YEAH .
DIESEL FUMES ACTUALLY HAVE LESS POLLUTANTS IN THEM THAN GASOLINE FUMES .
UHHUH UHHUH .
SO I GUESS YOU RE BETTER OFF SITTING BEHIND A BUS THAN A CAR ALTHOUGH I CAN NEVER I COULD NEVER UH REALLY A A RATIONALIZE THAT WHILE I WAS SITTING THERE .
YEAH BUT EVEN OF COURSE IN THE LONGER TERM JUST TO GET AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS .
YEAH .
I MEAN I M I M THINKING OF RESEARCH IN THAT DIRECTION RATHER THAN WE WE VE TAKEN THE INTERMEDIATE STEP BUT I DO NT THINK .
WELL WE YOU KNOW .
FOSSIL FUELS ARE THE ANSWER .
UP HERE IN NEW ENGLAND UH WHERE I VE RIGHT CLOSE TO WHERE I LIVE IS THE SEABROOK NUCLEUS SITE .
WHICH IS .
UHHUH .
PRACTICALLY A YOU KNOW GUERILLA WAR UP HERE .
YES I ME .
WENT ON FOR YEARS .
UH MY DAUGHTERS MARCHED IN THE UH UH AGAINST THE SEABROOK AND I .
KIND OF UH .
MY FEELINGS WERE THAT WE NEEDED THIS BRIDGE TO .
YEAH .
TO UH TO M M JUMP FROM WHATEVER .
IT WAS GOING TO BE FROM FOSSIL FUEL TO WHATEVER .
IT WAS GOING TO BE .
YEAH YOU DO NT THROW THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATH WATER .
YEAH .
AND CONDEMNING NUCLEAR USE .
UN UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH I THINK THE OIL COMPANIES HAVE LIED TO US FOR YEARS .
YEAH YEAH .
SO WE REALLY DO NT KNOW WHETHER THERE S ENOUGH FOSSIL FUEL LEFT OR THERE IS NT AND UH AND UH .
BUT WITH THE POLLUTION ISSUE UH FOSSIL FUEL IS NOT THE WAY TO GO ANYWAY .
NO .
UH SO YOU VE TO LO YOU VE GOT TO LOOK ELSEWHERE .
YEAH .
SO UH BUT IT IS SOMETHING .
THAT S A LITTLE FRIGHTENING AND IN FACT WELL I WITHIN OUR FAMILY .
WE HAVE SAID MY HUSBAND I HAVE TWO SONS UH WELL ONE IS ALREADY IN COLLEGE IN NEW ENGLAND .
YEAH .
AND THE OTHER WILL BE GOING IN SEPTEMBER AND WE JUST FEEL THAT WHEN WE LEAVE UH THIS AREA W WE RE GOING NORTH NOT SOUTH .
YES .
UH I LIKE THE MENTALITY NORTH AND I ALSO LIKE THE FRESHER AIR UP THERE .
THAT S RIGHT .
SO I MEAN THAT S THE WAY .
WE WILL BE GOING .
YEAH .
BUT UM SO I I I D BE INTERESTED IN HAVING SPOKEN WITH SOMEBODY ALSO FROM THE FAR WEST ON THIS ISSUE TO SEE HOW THEY THEIR ATTITUDES ARE .
WELL SINCE SINCE TEXAS AND LOUISIANA AND UH CALIFORNIA THAT IN THAT RANKING ORDER THE WORST POLLUTANTS IN AMERICA .
UHHUH .
I MEAN I READ THAT THE OTHER DAY .
I MEAN LOUISI LOUISIANA FOR A SMALL STATE W IT WAS AMAZING BUT IT S THE INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION .
I SHOULD IMAGINE .
UHHUH .
AND CALIFORNIA SEEMS TO BE TAKING STEPS I MEAN YOU YOU READ ABOUT THE THE FAIRLY .
THE SMOG AND YEAH .
FAIRLY STIFF LAWS THEY PUT IN ON CARS NOW THEY RE THEY RE ENFORCING .
UHHUH YEAH .
BUT UH AGAIN UH THAT DID NT OCCUR WITHOUT A CRISIS .
NOTHING WILL OCCUR I GUESS WITHOUT A CRISIS .
I MEAN EVEN CALIFORNIA WAS NOTORIOUS FOR ITS SMOG YEARS AGO .
YEAH EXACTLY .
BEFORE IT EVEN WAS AN ISSUE .
EXACTLY .
OUT HERE .
WELL THE GREATEST THING .
THAT HAPPENED TO POLLUTION IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AS FAR AS I M CONCERNED IS THE NO .
SMOKING RULES .
ON AIRPLANES AND IN RESTAURANTS .
AND IT IT REALLY IS A PLEASURE FOR ME ALTHOUGH I GUESS SMOKERS DO NT THINK THAT .
BUT THAT .
WELL THAT THAT S .
TO ME WAS POLLUTION MUMBLEX .
THAT S PERSON THAT S PERSONAL AIR POLLUTION .
THAT WAS ITS MOST PERSONAL .
YES YES .
PERSONAL UH POLLUTION THAT I CAN THINK OF .
YEAH WELL I I D DEFINITELY ADVANCE THAT .
WELL LISTEN I ENJOYED SPEAKING WITH YOU .
SURELY .
AND LET S HOPE SOME THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE .
THAT FEEL THE SAME WAY .
MUMBLEX SOMETHING HAPPEN .
RIGHT ON THANK YOU .
YOU RE WELCOME .
BYEBYE .
BYEBYE .
OKAY .
OKAY .
WELL UH DO YOU BELIEVE ONLY FIFTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE ACTUALLY VOTE .
I THINK IT S SOMEWHERE REALLY CLOSE TO THAT CAUSE .
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THEIR ONE LITTLE VOTE IS NOT GOING TO MAKE THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE .
AND THEY REALLY DO NT LISTEN TO ANY OF THE ISSUES ANYMORE .
HUH .
BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE SO MANY OF THE POLITICIANS ARE LIKE CROOKED YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
AND SO THEY FIGURE WHY GO OUT AND VOTE YOU KNOW .
THEY RE GOING TO DO WHAT .
THEY WANT TO DO .
THEY RE CORRUPT ANYWAY .
AND .
WELL .
I THINK ONE OF THE GOOD WAYS OF SOLVING THAT IS TO LIKE EVERYBODY LIKES TO COME TO A PARTY SO HAVE A VOTING PARTY AND UH YOU KNOW LIKE IN COMMUNITIES AND HAVE THE ISSUES THERE AND THEN EVERYBODY GO VOTE TOGETHER AND THEN MAYBE COME BACK OVER AND HAVE BRUNCH OR SOMETHING .
I MEAN THAT S THE ONLY .
THING THAT I CAN FIGURE OUT BECAUSE I VE HEARD SO MANY PEOPLE SAY WELL I M NOT GOING ON VOTING ON THAT ONE YOU KNOW I I M GOING TO GO FISHING TODAY .
OR IT WO NT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE IF IF I DO NT VOTE AND I THINK IT DOES .
WE VOTE EVERY TIME .
WELL IT UH THERE S NO QUESTION .
IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE .
UH SO FAR .
AS HAVING A PARTY AND THEN ALL VOTING UH WHEN YOU HAVE DIFFERENT PRECINCTS MUMBLEX YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A PARTY IN EVERY PRECINCT .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE TO VOTE IN DIFFERENT AREAS AND UH NOT EVERYONE VOTES AT THE SAME PLACE .
UH I PERSONALLY THINK THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE ALONG THE EDUCATION LINES IN THE SCHOOLS AND THE CHILDREN FROM THE LITTLE ONES ON UP WITH THE IDEA OF THE THE VALUE OF VOTING AND THE PURPOSE OF VOTING AND THAT ONE VOTE DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE .
BUT .
RIGHT .
AND MA MAYBE LET THEM HAVE SOME MOCK I MEAN .
ABSOLUTELY .
UH YOU KNOW ELECTIONS AND STUFF .
ABSOLUTELY .
AND VOTE FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN THEIR CLASSES AND START REALLY YOUNG .
THAT S A REAL GOOD IDEA .
AND AND THEY ARE ARE DOING THAT IN A NUMBER OF SCHOOLS .
HOWEVER PROBABLY NOT ENOUGH OF THEM UH COUNTRY WIDE .
BUT IT S GOING TO TAKE AT LEAST A WHOLE GENERATION OF PEOPLE UH TO GET ACROSS THE IDEA OF VOTING .
UH JUST LIKE IT S TAKING A WHOLE GENERATION OF PEOPLE TO FINALLY UH REALIZE THE HARMFULNESS OF DRUGS AND .
RIGHT .
UH HOPEFULLY TO UH NOW WITH THE MANY PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY ON .
HOW TO RESIST TAKING DRUGS .
HOW TO SAY NO TO IT AND WHAT HAVE YOU .
THAT UH PERHAPS WE LL FINALLY GET THE YOUTH WEANED OFF OF IT .
BUT UH I KNOW I .
I SPENT THIRTYFOUR YEARS IN EDUCATION HERE IN THE DAYTON AREA AND IN NINETEEN FIFTYONE THE POLICE WERE TELLING US ABOUT THE DRUG DEALERS OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL AND HOW THEY WERE JUST GIVING AWAY THEIR MARIJUANA GIVING AWAY THEIR HEROIN AND WHAT HAVE YOU TO GET THEM STARTED .
UM .
AND YOU KNOW THAT WAS IN FIFTYONE .
THAT S FORTY YEARS AGO .
GOD .
THAT IT WAS ALREADY A PROBLEM .
SO IT S NOW UH TO THE FOREFRONT AND PEOPLE ARE FINALLY TAKING SOME ACTION AGAINST IT .
AND THE THING WE VE WE VE NEGLECTED THE VALUE OF VOTING .
AND .
RIGHT .
UH AND WHAT .
IT REALLY MEANS TO VOTE AND WE ALSO DO NT MAKE THE UH THE ISSUES PERHAPS IN LANGUAGE THAT PEOPLE FULLY UNDERSTAND THEM .
YEAH .
WELL I DO NT KNOW HOW IT IS UP THERE BUT DOWN HERE LOUISIANA HAS A BAD REPUTATION FOR THEIR POLITICIANS AND ALL .
UHHUH .
I MEAN I M SURE YOU HEARD ABOUT .
SURE .
SOME OF OURS .
RIGHT .
AND UH PEOPLE ARE JUST I MEAN IT S LIKE THEY RE TURNED OFF ON VOTING .
AND THAT S THE REASON .
I SAID MAYBE IF YOU HAD SOMETHING LIKE A BLOCK PARTY .
UHHUH .
OKAY WE RE GOING TO HAVE A BLOCK PARTY .
EVERYBODY S GOING TO GET TOGETHER .
WE RE GOING TO DISCUSS THE DIFFERENT ISSUES AND STUFF AND THEN WE RE GOING TO GO AND VOTE YOU KNOW .
WE RE GOING TO GO VOTE LIKE MAYBE THEY COULD GIVE SOMETHING LIKE UH THE TOP NEIGHBORHOOD IF YOU HAD A HUNDRED PERCENT IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW .
I MEAN IT DOES NT HAVE TO BE IT COULD BE LIKE A A SIGN THAT THEY WOULD PUT DOWN AT THE END OF YOUR BLOCK .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT IT IT S REALLY BAD HERE .
I MEAN TO ME .
IT IS .
IT SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE JUST DO NT CARE ANYMORE .
THEY SAY HUH WELL IT DO NT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE YOU KNOW .
ONE CROOK IS AS GOOD AS THE OTHER ONE .
YEAH .
AND THEY DO NT BOTHER TO LISTEN TO WHAT ANY OF THEM HAVE TO SAY .
RIGHT .
AND UH I KNOW MY HUSBAND NOW WE GO VOTE EVERY TIME .
I DO NT CARE HOW SMALL THE BALLOT IS I .
UHHUH .
RIGHT .
MEAN IF THERE .
S ONE THING IF THERE .
S ONE ISSUE BECAUSE THE WAY .
I FEEL IS IF I DO NT VOTE THEN I DO NT HAVE ANY REASON .
TO GRIPE .
TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT RIGHT .
RIGHT .
RIGHT .
AND I HEAR SO MANY PEOPLE SAYING WELL I WISH THIS WOULD CHANGE I WISH THAT AND YOU KNOW BUT THEY DID NT GO VOTE .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND UH MAYBE IF THEY LIKE YOU SAID IF THEY WOULD START WHEN LITTLE KIDS AND START LETTING THEM VOTE AND LEARN HOW TO VOTE .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND ALL .
THEN UH AND THE IMPORTANCE OF IT BECAUSE OKAY IF YOU DO NT VOTE FOR YOUR FRIEND OVER HERE WELL YOUR FRIEND S NOT GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE .
THA .
HE NEEDS YOUR VOTE JUST LIKE HE NEEDS EVERYBODY .
ELSE S YOU KNOW .
MAYBE IF THEY WERE BROUGHT UP THAT A WAY LIKE YOU SAID IT WOULD .
BECAUSE I KNOW HERE UH UNTIL YOU GET INTO HIGH SCHOOL NOW THEN THEY HAD THE VOTING MACHINES AND YOU VOTED FOR LIKE CHEERLEADERS .
YES .
UHHUH .
AND DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT BUT THEY SHOULD START THAT A LOT EARLIER .
YEAH .
I IT S THE SAME WAY WITH EVERYTHING IN EDUCATION THOUGH .
IT SHOULD BEGIN AND RIGHT DOWN IN THE FIRST GRADE .
UH AND YOUR .
VERY BEST TEACHERS IN MY ESTIMATION SHOULD BE FIRST SECOND OR THIRD GRADE .
SO THAT THE CHILDREN DEVELOP GOOD LEARNING PATTERNS AND YOU HAVE SOME SUCCESS AND WANT TO GO ON LEARNING AND CONTINUE LEARNING UH .
RIGHT .
AND NOT WAIT UNTIL THEY RE IN HIGH SCHOOL AND THEN IT S TOO LATE TO TRY TO CHANGE THEM AROUND AT THAT POINT .
YEAH .
BUT UH EVERYTHING SHOULD BE STARTED ON THE LOWER LEVELS AND UH CERTAINLY IF THE YOUNGSTERS HAD THAT OPPORTUNITY THAT YOU KNOW THEY THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT THE PRINCIPLES OF THE COUNTRY WERE ESTABLISHED SO THAT EVERYONE WOULD HAVE A SAY AND EVERYONE WOULD HAVE A VOTE AND WHAT .
THAT VOTE MEANT AND .
RIGHT .
UH BUT IT BUT YOU RE RIGHT FROM THE STANDPOINT THAT PEOPLE DO HAVE A NEGATIVE ATTITUDE TOWARDS POLITICIANS .
AND PERHAPS IT S BECAUSE OUR CAMPAIGNS HAVE BECOME SO TERRIBLY EXPENSIVE TO RUN UH THAT ONLY THE MOST WEALTHY CAN DO SO .
RIGHT .
AND THEY RE NOT ALWAYS THE BEST PERSON FOR THE JOB .
RIGHT .
BUT THEY HAVE THE MONEY TO BE ABLE TO DO IT .
SO UH .
DEFINITELY .
SO THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PROBLEMS ALONG THAT LINE ALSO .
AND PERHAPS THE GOVERNMENT .
YOU KNOW A GOOD I IDEA FOR THE YOUNG KIDS LIKE THAT TOO IS TO HAVE LIKE A .
A MOCK ONE .
AND OKAY THIS THIS CANDIDATE TELLS .
SURE .
YOU .
SOME THINGS .
THAT ARE GOING TO HAPPEN AND THIS CANDIDATE TELLS YOU .
RIGHT .
SOME THINGS .
OKAY THEN THIS PERCENTAGE OF THE VOTERS I MEAN THE KIDS IN THAT CLASS THEY ARE NOT GOING TO LET THEM VOTE THIS TIME BUT THEY HAVE TO DO WHATEVER .
THESE PEOPLE WHICHEVER .
ONE THE OTHER PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
ELECT DO .
IF THEY DID SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND STARTED KIDS OUT REAL YOUNG AND SHOWED THEM OKAY NOW YOU RE NOT GOING TO GET TO VOTE BUT YOU RE .
YES .
GOING TO HAVE TO DO WHAT .
THAT PERSON SAYS THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND PROBABLY BY THE TIME .
THEY WERE .
RIGHT .
IN HIGH SCHOOL THEY D BE READY TO VOTE .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND I THINK YOU KNOW THAT S AN EXCELLENT IDEA .
THEY WOULD PUT THEM TO REALIZE THAT THAT THEIR GOING TO HAVE TO DO WHAT .
SOMEONE ELSE SAYS EVEN THOUGH THEY DID NT VOTE FOR IT .
YEAH .
AND THAT MAYBE THEY NEED TO THINK TWICE ABOUT VOTING .
NOW SOME .
RIGHT .
PEOPLE OBJECT DURING PRIMARIES HAVING TO DECLARE A PARTY WHETHER REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT AND .
UHHUH .
YOU DO THAT IN THE PRIMARY .
UH AND I DO NT KNOW THAT UH A LOT OF PEOPLE VOTE IN PRIMARIES FOR THAT VERY REASON .
UH THEY CAN DECLARE ANYTHING .
THEY WANT AND THEY CAN ACTUALLY RIG IT .
IF THEY REALLY WANTED TO VOTE REPUBLICAN THEY COULD GO IN THE PRIMARY AND SAY THEY WERE VOTING DEMOCRAT AND THEN STACK THE BALLOT FOR SOMEONE THAT PERHAPS THE REPUBLICAN COULD BEAT .
BUT UH IT S UH IT S JUST A SAD SITUATION AND UH I DO THINK MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE ALONG THAT LINE TO HELP TO UH TEACH THE PEOPLE UH UH EVERYONE UH MORE ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH VOTING AND WITH NONVOTING .
YEAH .
SO THAT UH WE CAN MAKE THEY RE MAKING SOME .
MORE INTELLIGENT DECISIONS .
AND IT S GOING TO TAKE THESE YOUNG .
I THINK THAT SOUNDS GREAT .
YOU KNOW IT S GOING TO TAKE THE UH A WHOLE GENERATION OF MY FEELING UH BEFORE THAT S GOING TO BE ACCOMPLISHED .
WELL YOU KNOW THEY D HAVE TO START WHEN THEY RE REAL YOUNG .
THAT S RIGHT .
I MEAN YOU KNOW IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A CHILD .
THAT IS JUST COMING INTO SCHOOL .
BECAUSE WELL I LL TELL YOU .
ANOTHER THING TOO NOW .
WHENEVER THE FIRST TIME .
I VOTED I NEVER VOTED IN HIGH SCHOOL BECAUSE THERE WAS NEVER ANYONE .
THAT SHOWED US HOW TO USE THE .
UHHUH .
VOTING MACHINES NOW THIS SOUNDS DUMB BUT I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO USE THOSE VOTING MACHINES AND NOBODY EVER SHOWED US OR ANYTHING SO I DID NT VOTE BECAUSE ANYBODY .
THAT WENT IN THERE AND THEY ASKED A QUESTION ALL THE OTHER KIDS .
YEAH .
LAUGHED AT THEM .
THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS FUNNY .
AH SHE DO NT EVEN KNOW HOW WAH WAH .
RIGHT .
UHHUH .
SO THERE WAS NT ANY WAY .
I WAS GOING TO GO IN THERE AND VOTE .
AND IT TOOK ME I MEAN IT TOOK SUCH COURAGE .
YOU WOULD NT BELIEVE .
SURE .
TO GO VOTE THE FIRST TIME BECAUSE I WAS WAITING FOR SOMEBODY TO LAUGH AT ME BECAUSE I .
RIGHT .
DID NT KNOW HOW TO WORK THE MACHINES .
WELL SURE IT IS .
NOW THAT S BAD .
AND I MEAN I WAS OUT OF SCHOOL .
I WAS A MARRIED PERSON .
UHHUH .
AND UH I DID NT KNOW HOW TO WORK THE MACHINE YOU KNOW .
AND IT REALLY SCARED ME REALLY BAD .
BECAUSE I THOUGHT ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LAUGH AT ME BECAUSE I DO NT KNOW HOW TO WORK THIS MACHINE .
WHERE IF THEY D IF THEY D HAD A CLASS OR SOMETHING OR JUST TO A SHORT TIME YOU KNOW TO SAID OKAY THIS IS THE WAY .
WELL JUST THE JUST THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRY THE VOTING MACHINES YEAH .
RIGHT .
IT S THIS IS THE WAY .
IT S GOING TO BE .
AND MY SON WAS EXACTLY THE SAME WAY THAT I WAS AND I DID NT REALIZE IT UNTIL UH HIS SENIOR YEAR .
I S ASKED HIM .
SOMETHING ABOUT WELL DID YOU WHO DID YOU VOTE FOR FOR UH CHEERLEADER .
AND HE SAID OH I DID NT GO VOTE .
HE SAID UH THERE S NO WAY .
I M GETTING IN THAT MACHINE .
WELL THEN I REALIZED IT SO WHEN WE WENT AND VOTED THE NEXT TIME I ASKED THE UH LADY I SAID I WANT MY SON TO COME IN WITH ME AND SHE SAID WELL UH WHY YOU KNOW .
HE LL HAVE TO COME BACK OUT .
I SAID BECAUSE I WANT HIM TO KNOW HOW TO USE .
RIGHT .
ONE OF THESE AND I SAID I WO NT TURN ANY OF THE BUTTONS DOWN BUT I WANT TO SHOW HIM HOW TO USE IT SO THAT HE LL BE .
YES .
UHHUH .
ABLE TO VOTE .
AND UH SO HE WENT IN AND NOW HE S A .
GOOD .
REGISTERED VOTER .
BUT HE WOULD NOT VOTE .
YEAH .
BEFORE THEN .
AND I MEAN I THINK THAT S BAD .
SURE IT IS .
ABSOLUTELY .
YOU KNOW HERE I WAS .
AND AND EVEN OF COURSE .
THERE S A LOT OF YEARS BETWEEN THE TWO OF US BUT EVEN WITH THAT MANY YEARS BETWEEN .
UH YOU KNOW I WHEN I WAS MUCH YOUNGER UH THAN I AM NOW I I HAD WANTED TO GO TO THE PEACE CORPS AND UH IT SEEMS LIKE I IT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT I I REALLY WANTED WANTED TO DO .
CAN YOU SPEAK UP PLEASE .
SEEMS LIKE WANTING TO GO TO THE PEACE CORPS WAS SOMETHING THAT I HAD REALLY WANTED TO DO WHEN I WAS YOUNG .
YES .
BUT UH I DO NT BELIEVE THEY ACCEPT YOU AFTER YOU YOU KNOW AFTER YOU RE MARRIED AND YOU HAVE UH KIDS AND ALL THAT SO I GOT INTO .
UH .
THAT AND THEN I WAS NT ABLE TO TO UH PARTICIPATE .
BUT THEY WILL ACCEPT YOU LATER IN LIFE ALSO .
OH THEY WILL .
YEAH AFTER YOUR CHILDREN ARE GROWN .
OH I DID NT KNOW THAT .
YES .
THEN THERE S NO AGE LIMIT .
NO .
YOUR KIDDING .
NO I M NOT SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH PEACE CORPS AMONG OTHER THINGS WERE RETIRED TEACHERS UH THERE WAS A RETIRED PLUMBER THAT WENT TO UH UH URUGUAY I THINK AND HELPED THEM QUITE A BIT WITH CONCEPTS IN PLUMBING YOU KNOW PROVIDING FOR A FOR BETTER PUBLIC HYGIENE .
GOODNESS I M SURPRISED I REALLY HAD NO IDEA .
YEAH BUT SO DO YOU THINK THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO GIVE A COUPLE YEARS FOR THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY .
WELL I DO NT I DO NT REALLY THINK THAT THEY SH THEY SHOULD BE IT SHOULD BE MANDATORY I MEAN .
WHY .
WELL I DO NT KNOW I IT S THAT JUST MIGHT NOT BE SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY WANTS TO DO I MEAN THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO DO IT AND THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO GET INTO OTHER THINGS AND THEY GET ALL INVOLVED AND THEY JUST YOU KNOW DO NT WANT TO OR DO NT HAVE THE TIME .
WELL I UNDERSTAND BUT IF IT WERE TOLD TO US THAT WE WOULD FIND THE TIME SOMEWHERE BETWEEN OUR SEVENTEENTH AND UH TWENTYSIXTH BIRTHDAY TO GIVE A YEAR OR TWO TO THE TO THE COUNTRY IN THE FORM OF MAYBE BUILDING BETTER ROADS OR THE PARKS SERVICE OR THE PEACE CORPS OR SOMET YOU KNOW THE MILITARY SERVICE OR SOMETHING WOULD NT WE HAVE UH MAYBE A BETTER CLASS OF AMERICANS .
I DO NT SEE HOW THAT CAN CAN MAKE A BETTER CLASS OF AMERICANS TO MAKE EVERYBODY TO MAKE IT MANDATORY FOR EVERYBODY TO PARTICIPATE .
A LOT OF THESE PEOP A LOT OF OUR UH PARDON THE TERMINOLOGY BUT YUPPIES NOW ARE INTERESTED IN ONE THING AND ONE THING ONLY AND THAT S THEMSELVES .
THAT S TRUE WELL I DO NT I DO NT THINK THAT .
AND AT LEAST IF YOU LEGISLATED .
GIVING FOR A COUPLE YEARS OF THEIR LIVES OR OR UH A HONESTLY PURELY GIVING BUT BUT SOME SORT OF EQUITABLE EXCHANGE THEN AT LEAST THE COUNTRY WOULD HAVE GOTTEN TWO YEARS FROM THEM WHERE UM THEY WOULD HAVE GIVEN SOMETHING TO THE COUNTRY INSTEAD OF TAKE TAKING AWAY ALL THEIR LIVES .
YEAH ARE ARE YOU SUGGESTING THEN THAT IF IF UH IF I HAVE TO GO AND AND DO SOMETHING FOR THE COUNTRY FOR TWO YEARS THAT THE COUNTRY WILL COMPENSATE ME IN SOME WAY .
UH .
I I WILL BE COMPENSATED FOR THIS I M NOT JUST GOING TO .
GIVE THEM YOUR TI GIVE THEM YOUR ENTIRE LIFE FOR TWO YEARS NO .
OKAY .
IT WILL BE A JOB OF SORTS I M SURE THAT THE PEACE CORPS PAYS IT DOES NT PAY WELL IT S NOT TOP WAGES .
UHHUH .
BUT BUT IT DOES PAY .
UHHUH .
THE MILITARY FOR YOUNG HIRING IN SOLDIERS DOES PAY IT DOES NT PAY WELL .
UHHUH .
OKAY CURRENTLY IN OUR COUNTRY ESPECIALLY IN SOME REGIONS THERE S AN EMPLOYMENT PROBLEM YOU RE AWARE OF THAT I M SURE .
THAT THAT THAT S TRUE BUT IN EVEN IN OUR REGION THERE S AN EMPLOYMENT PROBLEM THERE S A LOT OF UH PEOPLE GOTTEN LAID OFF LATELY YOU KNOW FROM JUST COMPANIES LIKE GENERAL DYNAMICS AND .
AND TEXAS INSTRUMENTS .
AND TEXAS INSTRUMENTS THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE OUT THERE LOOKING FOR JOBS .
YOU KNOW IN IN ANOTHER TIME WE HAD THE W P A .
NO I M NOT .
WORKS PROGRESS ADMINISTRATION .
I M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT .
DURING THE GREAT DEPRESSION .
OH .
THOUGH I CA NT SEE WHY IT WAS GREAT .
UH THAT GAVE PEOPLE PAY THAT WAS HALFWAY BETWEEN RELIEF WHICH WAS WELFARE .
UHHUH .
AND THE MINIMUM WAGE .
I SEE AND THAT WAS THAT WAS SIMI THAT WAS SOME SOME PROGRAM WHERE PEOPLE GAVE THEIR TIME .
IN TRADE FOR .
IN TRADE FOR .
MONEY .
FOR MONEY OKAY .
AND AND LIVING .
UHHUH .
THEY GAVE THEM FOOD AND UNIFORMS AND .
UH HERE IN COLORADO YOU LL FIND A GREAT MANY THINGS PUBLIC ROADS THAT WERE WORKED ON BY THE W P A UH DAMS THAT WERE BUILT BY THE W P A .
UHHUH .
UH SCENIC OVERLOOKS PARKS .
UHHUH .
WE ARE ROAD OUR ROAD SYSTEM S FALLING APART OUR AIR OUR NATIONAL ROAD SYSTEM SYSTEM OF HIGHWAYS .
UHHUH .
AND ROADS IS FALLING APART .
WELL THEN I GUESS THERE ARE A LOT OF A LOT OF THINGS THAT PEOPLE COULD DO TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY .
THER THERE S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE .
UHHUH I I REALLY DO NT SEE ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT I JUST DO NT THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE MANDATORY THAT EVERY PERSON HAVE TO DO THAT .
I I CA NT SEE THE PROBLEM IN IT FOR A YEAR TH .
WELL .
WHAT WHAT I M SAYING IS THAT IF IT WERE MANDATORY .
UHHUH .
THAT EVERY PERSON RIGHT AFTER GRADUATION FROM HIGH SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
THAT WERE ABLEBODIED .
UHHUH .
WOULD GIVE A YEAR WELL OR NOT GIVE A YEAR BUT BUT TRADE A YEAR THEN THEY AT LEAST ONE NOT MORE THAN SAY THREE OR FOUR THEN IT WOULD DEFINITELY EFFECT UNEMPLOYMENT .
ALL RIGHT I WONDER IF IF THEY DID NT MAKE IT MANDATORY IF THEY WOULD ACTUALLY GET ENOUGH PEOPLE VOLUNTEERING TO TO DO IT THAT IT YOU KNOW THAT THEY WOULD HAVE ENOUGH .
I DO NT KNOW .
I MEAN I I D PROBABLY .
WELL YOU KNOW TEXAS NEW MEXICO COLORADO HUGE NUMBERS OF OTHER WESTERN STATES HAVE NO REAL WELFARE SYSTEM .
UHHUH .
THERE S AID TO DEPENDENT CHILDREN AND AID TO MOTHERS OF DEPENDENT CHILDREN BUT THERE S NO REAL WELFARE SYSTEM .
UHHUH .
BUT IF WE TOOK THESE PEOPLE OFF OFF THE STREETS FOR A YEAR THERE WOULD DARN SURE BE MORE HOURS LABOR AVAILABLE IN THE NATION FOR EVERYONE ELSE AND WHO KNOWS MAYBE SOME OF OUR GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS WOULD FIND OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE OF TH WHAT THE TRADITIONAL AMERICAN WORK ETHIC MEANS YOU KNOW WE HAVE HAD SOME PROBLEM WITH THAT IN RECENT YEARS .
OH WELL YES WE HAVE WITH WITH UH RECENT GENERATIONS I I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT I I MEAN I KNOW SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO DO NOT WISH TO WORK .
UH THEY WISH ONLY FOR THE PAYCHECK .
WELL THEY WISH FOR THE MONEY AND THEY THEY DECIDE THAT THEY RE GOING TO GET THE MONEY ANYWAY THEY CAN WITH YOU KNOW WITHOUT UH .
REALLY PRODUCING .
WITHOUT WITHOUT WORKING IN THE THE TRADITIONAL AMERICAN JOB MARKET .
YEAH BE IT SELLING DRUGS OR WHATEVER .
RIGHT SO ONE OTHER THING AND THEY THEY GET THE MONEY ANYWAY THEY CAN .

YEAH AND IT S I FORGET HOW MANY MILLIMETERS SO YOU USED THE METRIC .
WELL NO WHAT WE DID WAS WIND UP USING AND YOU JUST GO YOU JUST GO DOWN AND AND YOU GET OUT THE THE SO MANY INCHES AND AND WE JUST MARKED A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN THAT UH WHICH IS SOMEWHAT AWKWARD BUT HAD IT BEEN MILLIMETERS YOU COULD HAVE DONE I THINK WHAT S INTERESTING THE WAY ENGINEERING PEOPLE DO IS THEY THEY IN ESSENCE HAVE GOTTEN AROUND IT BY BY LISTING UH DECIMAL INCHES .
UH YEAH YEAH .
DO YOU ARE YOU INVOLVED IN ANY ENGINEERING DRAWING STUFF THAT .
UH YEAH YEAH UH I WORK IN METAL FAB AND TENTHS OF INCHES ARE ARE NORMAL AND YOU KNOW ME YOU KNOW IT IS BROKEN UP IN YOU KNOW THE INCH IS BROKEN UP AND HAS BEEN FOR QUITE SOME TIME FOR IN TENTHS HUNDREDTHS THOUSANDTHS TEN THOUSANDTHS OF AN INCH .
WELL HAVE HAVE YOU DO YOU ARE YOU INVOLVED IN ANY OTHER UH METRIC TYPE THINGS LIKE .
YES I AM I I HAVE A SUZUKI MOTORCYCLE AND AND I VE HAD MOTORCYCLES JAPANESE MOTORCYCLES FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND THE METRIC SYSTEM COMES EASY TO ME BUT MY .
I THINK IT S INTERESTING YOU WE YOU KNOW WHEN YO YOU GO OUT THERE AND YOU RE LOOKING FOR A WRENCH AND YOU WANT THE NEXT SIZE LARGER I VE GOT I INHERITED SOME SOME STUFF LIKE FIFTEEN THIRTY SECONDS .
RIGHT .
WELL NOW THAT ONE S FAIRLY EASY BECAUSE THAT S PROBABLY SLIGHTLY UNDER HALF AN INCH BUT SOME OF THEM LIKE LIKE TWENTYSEVEN AND AND THERE ARE SOME THIRTY SECONDS AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THAT UH DO NT TRANSLATE .
YEAH YEAH TRANS YEAH TO GO FROM FROM EIGHTHS TO SIXTEENTHS TO UH THIRTY SECONDS AND REMEMBER WHERE IT FALLS IT .
YEAH AND AND YOU VE GOT TO GO OVER THERE AND TRY IT AND I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW I NEED A LARGER ONE I NEED A SMALLER ONE I MEAN OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN LOOK AT IT AND SAY WELL ANYWAY I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT S INTERESTING IS THAT A LOT OF OUR STUFF IS ALREADY CHANGED THAT WE HAVE NT I DO NT KNOW DO YOU DO YOU DRINK ADULT BEVERAGES .
YEAH I DRINK BEER .
WE TH HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT UM THAT A LOT OF THE UM A LOT OF .
YEAH WHISKEY IS IN LITERS .
YES .
AND AND THE NEXT YEAH POINT SEVEN FIVE LITERS AND THEN LITERS AND THEN ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE LITERS YEAH .
IT S LIKE A FIFTH LIKE FIFTHS OF WHISKEY I THOUGHT WAS ALWAYS KIND OF STRANGE .
YEAH .
WHAT S A FIFTH OF WHISKEY .
YEAH I I ALWAYS WONDERED ABOUT THAT MYSELF .
IT WAS A MARKETING PLOY .
AND AND THEY HAD QUARTS AT THE SAME TIME THOUGH .
YEAH BUT THE IDEA WAS IS THAT BY WITH FIVE FIFTHS UM THEY COULD UH THEY COULD UH THEY COULD SELL FIVE AND AND UM IT WAS SIMPLY A PLOY TO TO GET PEOPLE YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
TO BUY TO BUY MORE FOR IT S UH I FIND THAT INTERESTING .
IT S .
BUT IT S LIKE YOU KNOW THE THE THE THE SODA AND THIS KIND OF THINGS COMING IN .
LITERS .
ON ONE LITER BOTTLES AND UM I I THINK IT S KIND OF GENERATIONAL ALTHOUGH I MUST ADMIT THAT THAT I AM NOT I CA I M NOT CONVERSANT IN SAYING YOU KNOW THAT S THREE CENTIMETERS AWAY I MEAN OR OR OR .
YEAH IT IT S LIKE I SAY I WORK IN A MACHINE SHOP AND UH EVERYTHING S STILL INCHES .
YEAH MUMBLEX .
EVERYTHING S STILL FRACTIONS OF INCHES OR PA OR TENTHS .
YEAH IT S IT S HARD TO THINK .
OR THOUSANDTHS OR OR .
THOUGH .
YES IT IS A MENTAL THING IT IS A CONVERSION THING .
IT S LIKE A MILL YOU KNOW WE WE DO UH UM WELL WE USE A ONE MILL BOND WIRE OR ONE POINT FIVE MILL CO BOND WIRE ON .
RIGHT .
ON SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES AND WELL WHAT S A MILL AND .
YEAH YEAH BUT WHAT REALLY ANNOYS ME IS THE WAY WE IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN CONVERTING TO METRIC WE HAVE A EIGHTYNINE CHEVY BLAZER AND BEFORE THAT WE HAD A HORIZON UH YOU KNOW PLYMOUTH HORIZON .
YEAH .
AND BOTH OF THEM WERE A MISMATCH OF BOTH AMERICAN AND METRIC .
DO NT YOU FIND THAT INTERESTING UH THAT THEY THAT THAT THEY RE DOING THAT UH IN ANY FIELD FOR HO WHY WHY WHY PIECES COULD YOU COULD YOU GET ANY CONNECTION ON WHICH WAS METRIC AND WHICH WAS NT .
UH OKAY THE ENGINE ITSELF WAS MOSTLY METRIC BECAUSE IT CAME FROM CANADA .
OH OKAY .
AND THE STARTER WAS BOSCH AMERICAN SO .
THE BOLTS WERE WERE ENG WERE WERE ENGLISH THEN .
YEAH YEAH IT WAS IT WAS ANNOYING ONE ONE HALF OF THE STARTER WA YOU KNOW THREE BOLTS ON THE STARTER AND TWO OF THEM WERE AMERICAN AND ONE OF THEM WAS METRIC .
NOW THAT S STRANGE .
AND UH YOU GO FROM THE UH WATER PUMP UP TO THE RADIATOR AND ON THE WATER PUMP IT WAS ALL METRIC AND AND ON YOU KNOW THE FACTORY FITTINGS YOU KNOW THE FACTORY UH .
YEAH UHHUH .
SCREW LOCK .
YEAH .
UH UH RADIATOR HOSE CLAMPS .
ESSENTIALLY THEY DO THAT THOUGH BECAUSE IF IF YOU LOOK AT GENERAL MOTORS THE SIZE AND AND AND OF COURSE FORD AND CHRYSLER IF THEY ALL WENT IF THEY ALL WENT METRIC BUT IN A SENSE UM YOU KNOW IT S LIKE WHEN YO A MEASUREMENT THOUGH WHEN WHEN YOU PUT UH YOU KNOW ONE POINT FOUR THREE TWO INCHES WHE WHEN YOU RE MILLING SOMETHING UH .
YEAH .
YOU SIMPLY SET YOUR UH EQUIPMENT OR OR YOU MEASU OR YOU GOT YOUR CALIPERS THERE AND AND YOU MEASURE YOU KNOW YOU MIC IT TO SEE IF IT S ACCURATE AND .
RIGHT IT S IT S NOT A PROBLEM EITHER WAY .
NO .
LIKE I SAID MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS WHERE THEY MIXED THEM ON THE SAME CAR .
YEAH .
AND YOU GO TO LOOK AT IT AND YOU DO NT KNOW WHICH SET TO REACH IN AMERICAN OR METRIC .
YEAH .
AND AND YOU RE NEVER QUITE SURE WELL IS THAT A METRIC BOLT .
YOU GET YOU A PAIR OF METRIC PLIERS RIGHT .
RIGHT RIGHT .
AND YOU BEAT ON IT AND A METRIC HAMMER .
IT IT CAN BE ANNOYING AND MY OTHER CON CONCERN IS IS THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT GOING TO FORCE US TO GO .
OH I THINK I DO NT THINK SO I I THINK THAT TH UH I THINK THEY VE NOW JUST TAKEN THE ATTITUDE THAT WELL IF IT HAPPENS IF IT BECAUSE IT THERE A LOT OF THINGS THAT THAT UH UM LIKE SPORTS YOU KNOW IT S A HUNDRED METER .
OH ABSOLUTELY .
AND UH UH BUT AUTOMOBILE RACES IF IT I DO NT THINK THEY D EVER IT S STILL GOING TO BE THE INDIANAPOLIS FIVE HUNDRED THEY RE NOT GOING TO .
YEAH YEAH THEY RE NOT GOING TO CHANGE THAT TO METERS IT WILL ALWAYS BE .
YEAH AND AND IT I I DO NT THINK IT I DO NT YOU KNOW I DO NT THINK I DO NT THINK IT S PARTICULARLY BOTHERSOME BECAUSE IN REALITY UH YOU IT S LIKE TROY OUNCES IN OUNCES OF GOLD HOW MANY OUNCES OF GOLD YOU KNOW .
TWELVE .
I WAS TRYING I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE UP GOLD CONTENT ON SOMETHING IT HAD HAS UH GOLD PLATED UH HEADER AND AND THEY RE TRYING TO THINK OF WHAT S A TROY OUNCE .
YEAH THERE S TWELVE TROY OUNCES TO THE POUND .
YEAH NOW THAT MAKES YOU KNOW .
YEAH AND AND IS THAT GOING TO CHANGE TOO .
WELL I MEAN AND AND THEN THERE S A METRIC TON AND THEN THERE S A TON BUT WHAT S A METRIC TON .
UH SE .
I DO NT KNOW .
I DO NT REMEMBER I I READ IT AND ARE WE STILL GOING TO MAINTAIN DRAMS FOR PERFUME .
YEAH AND AND THEN BUT THEN THE MEDICINE AND AND SOME OF THESE OTHER THINGS AND AND THE CHEMISTRY IN THOSE KINDS OF AREAS MILLILITER .
IT S ALL METRIC ALL READY .
YEAH AND AND SO UM BUT BUT WHEN YOU GO TO ORDER A DRINK UM YOU KNOW MUMBLEX SAY THEY THEY I DO NT KNOW IT S UH .
AND WHAT WILL A SHOT BE WILL A SHOT BE AN OUNCE .
I DO NT KNOW AND AND BUT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GO TO THE STORE AND AND YOU RE TRYING TO FIGURE YOU KNOW WELL THIS BOX IS IS UH IS IS TWELVE OUNCES AND AND THIS ONE S UH UH THREE POUNDS UM AND YOU .
AND THE OTHER ONE S TWO POINT ONE KIS AND AND YOU RE YOU RE LOST .
THAT S RIGHT AND AND I DO NT KNOW I I THINK THAT I I THINK I THINK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO MORE OR LESS LEAVE IT ALONE I THINK THEY VE GOT I THINK THERE ARE MORE PRESSING PROBLEMS .
OH YEAH THE ECONOMY .
YES .
UH WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT IS AN ECONOMICAL ISSUE CONCERNING IT UH A MACHINIST HAS A HUGE NUMBER OF DOLLARS INVESTED IN TOOLING PERSONAL TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO DO HIS JOB .
YEAH BUT BUT ARE ARE THE TOOLS THAT UH IF YOU RE CUTTING ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT CUTTING EQUIPMENT OR TOOLS FOR THA FOR SET UP .
UH TOOLS FOR SET UP AND FOR MEASUREMENT UH YOU GOT TO HAVE A ONE TENTH INDICATOR IT S A HUNDRED DOLLARS UH FIVE TENTHS INDIC UH USUALLY TWO ONE TENTH INDICATORS .
HUH .
AT A HUNDRED DOLLARS EACH UH FIVE TENTHS INDICATOR AT ABOUT A HUNDRED DOLLARS YOU GOT TO HAVE UH SIX INCH SET OF CALIPERS AT ANYWHERE FROM SIXTY TO A HUNDRED TWENTY DOLLARS YOU GOT TO HAVE A ZERO TO ONE FOR SIXTY DOLLARS UH ONE TO TWO INCH MICROMETER FOR SIXTY DOLLARS A TWO TO THREE FOR EIGHTY DOLLARS A THREE TO FOUR FOR EIGHTY DOLLARS .
SO YOU VE GOT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OR SO I MEAN YOU GET A THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF TOOLS .
REAL FAST .
YES .
REAL REAL FAST EDGE FINDERS AND .
BUT I WAS THINKING ABOUT THOUGH THAT THAT WHEN YOU ACTUALLY GET TO THE MILLING EQUIPMENT THOUGH WHEN IT STARTS TURNING .
WELL I KNOW BECAUSE OKAY YOUR END MILLS WILL BE MEASURED IN INCHES OR FRACTIONS OF INCHES .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
BUT WHE YOU WHEN YOU WHEN YOU SIMPLY DRILLING A HOLE I MEAN A REAL SIMPLE THING LIKE GEE I NEED A HOLE THERE .
WHAT SIZE HOLE .
YEAH .
AS IN METRIC SIZE HOLE OR A OR AN AMERICAN SIZED HOLE .
YEAH AND AND WHAT BUT THE THING IS THEN YOU VE GOT TO WITH SCREWS AND THAT S THE OTHER ISSUE UH THE PITCH AND .
YEAH YEAH WELL AND THREAD .
WELL I AM NEW TO TEXAS SO I DO NT EVEN KNOW WHAT THE LAW IS .
UHHUH .
IN THE STATE DO YOU .
WELL YES OF COURSE WE DO HAVE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT AND WE VE YOU KNOW DONE AWAY WITH OUR QUOTE FAIR SHARE NUMBER .
OH THAT S RIGHT I THINK NOW THAT I RECALL READING ABOUT IT IN THE PAPER .
YES .
UM YOU KNOW DIFFERENT THINGS IS IT RESTRICTED TO CERTAIN CRIMES OR JUST .
YES IT S CERTAIN CRIMES UH CAPITAL CRIMES MURDER OF COURSE UH RAPE .
UHHUH .
THIS SORT OF THING .
UM WELL .
IT SEEMS TO BE A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF BLACKS YOU KNOW THAT GET INTO THE SYSTEM .
YES I KNOW THE ONE THING THAT I THINK IS REALLY SAD ABOUT IT AS I RECALL FROM THE ARTICLES THAT I VE READ IS THAT IF IF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN THERE ARE GOING TO BE KILLED UM THERE S PEOPLE THAT COME TO THE PRISONS AND THEY RE VERY VIOLENT AND THEY WANT I MEAN THEY RE ANXIOUS FOR SOMEONE TO BE KILLED .
UHHUH YES .
I JUST I CA NT SEE THAT .
THAT HAPPENS ON OCCASION IT SURE DOES .
MAYBE IT JUST DEPENDS ON YOU KNOW HOW CLOSELY THE CRIME YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
HAS AFFECTED YOU PERSONALLY YOU KNOW I DO NT KNOW OR A PERSON PERSONALLY .
NO .
I THINK I WOULD BE YOU KNOW I GUESS REALLY IF I HAD TO SAY YES OR NO I GUESS I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW THAT I AM IN CERTAIN CASES IN FAVOR OF THE DEATH PENALTY I DO NT KNOW THAT IT S A BIG DETERRENT REALLY I DO NT KNOW THAT IT IS I DO NT KNOW HOW WE D EVER FIND OUT YOU KNOW REALLY WHETHER IT IS OR NOT .
WELL THERE IS SO MANY CHANCES FOR APPEAL THAT IT KEE .
OH YEAH OH ABSOLUTELY YEAH IT GOES ON FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND COSTS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TAXPAYER MONEY .
YE IT S REALLY SAD .
YEAH .
I DO NT KNOW I JUST THINK UM SOMEHOW I HOPED THAT AS A PEOPLE WE COULD BE BETTER THAN THAN UM EXPECTING .
YES .
THE FEELING THAT IT MUMBLEX WITH SOMEONE IS CALLING FOR SOMEONE ELSE TO BE KILLED YOU KNOW .
YES UHHUH .
IS REALLY KIND OF BAD .
YES IT IS IT S A TOUGH TOUGH QUESTION IT REALLY IS .
UM .
I SUSPECT I WOULD BE UH YOU KNOW A LOT MORE FAVOR OF IT IF YOU KNOW ONE OF MY CHILDREN WERE YOU KNOW BRUTALLY KILLED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT LIKE I SAY I THINK IT DEPENDS ON HOW PERSONALLY AFFECTED YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT BE BY IT .
THAT S TRUE AND THERE REALLY ARE CRIMINALS THAT ARE HARDCORE AND .
OH ABSOLUTELY .
REPEAT MUMBLEX AND NEVER HAVE ANY CHANCE FOR .
THA THAT S RIGHT .
MUMBLEX OH I DO NT KNOW IS IT DO YOU FEEL AT ALL LIKE IT S A RELIGIOUS ISSUE .
NOT WITH ME PERSONALLY IT IS WITH A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
IT S NOT NOT TO ME PERSONALLY NO .
UM .
NO .
I DO NT KNOW SOMETIMES I FEEL I MEAN I DO GO TO CHURCH AND THINGS I DO NT KNOW HOW I WOULD FEEL ABOUT IT BUT LIKE YOU SAY IF IT HIT YOU PERSONALLY .
UHHUH .
CLOSER AT HOME YOU WOULD FEEL .
YES .
FEEL DIFFERENTLY .
THAT S A IT S A TOUGH TOUGH QUESTION IT REALLY IS .
DO YOU THINK MOST STATES HAVE THAT OR .
YES I THINK MOST STATES DO HAVE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT YES .
UHHUH HUH .
BUT I THINK THE U S IS ONE OF THE FEW COUNTRIES THAT STILL DO .
THAT STILL DOES IT THAT S RIGHT .
YES THEY RE ONLY I WAS READING SOMETHING ABOUT IT THE OTHER DAY I MUMBLEX THINK THERE WAS ONLY LIKE SIX OR EIGHT COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD THAT HAVE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT STILL .
UHHUH .
A LOT OF THEM HAD TO HAVE EL ELECTED NOT TO DO SO NOW I DO NT KNOW WHAT THEY DO IN PLACE OF IT YOU KNOW MAYBE IT S LIFE IN PRISONMENT OR YOU KNOW SOMETHING I DON I DO NT KNOW HOW THEY HANDLE IT BU I WAS SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT SO FEW COUNTRIES HAVE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT .
HAVE THAT WELL AND IT DOES NT SEEM LIKE VERY MANY PEOPLE UH ARE REALLY I MEAN THERE S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE ON DEATH ROW .
OH YES .
BUT THERE S NOT VERY MANY PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY UM DO GET KILLED .
YES A LOT OF THEM DO GET THEIR SENTENCES COMMUTED TO SOMETHING ELSE .
UHHUH SO IT SEEMS LIKE A OF PEOPLE LIVE THERE AND THEN THROUGH APPEALS .
YES .
BECAUSE I KNOW THEY DO FREQUENTLY I MEAN THEY COVER COVER IT PRETTY HEAVILY ON TELEVISION AND THE NEWSPAPER .
UHHUH YES .
IF IT FINALLY GETS TO THAT POINT .
RIGHT THE FIRST APPEAL IS AUTOMATIC SO THAT DELAYS IT FOR A FEW YEARS JUST RIGHT OFF THE BAT .
YEAH .
THERE S THERE S A LOT OF YOU KNOW LAST MINUTE UH THINGS THAT HAPPEN CAUSE A PERSON NOT TO .
UHHUH .
HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE WHOLE THING .
UHHUH SO IS IT UH ARE WE DOING LETHAL INJECTION NOW .
YES UHHUH THAT S THAT S FAIRLY RECENT I DO NT KNOW HOW RECENT BUT FAIRLY RECENT IN THE STATE OF TEXAS BEFORE THAT IT WAS UH DEATH BY ELECTROCUTION .
UHHUH WH WHICH SEEMS SO AWFUL .
YES IT CERTAINLY DOES .
SO IT S A LITTLE BIT MORE HUMANE I GUESS IT IS .
YES IT WOULD ALMOST HAVE TO BE I SUPPOSE IF YOU IF YOU HAD TO CHOSE I GUESS I WOULD I AM SURE I WOULD TAKE THE LETHAL INJECTION .
YES THE OTHER ONE JUST SEEMS SO TERRIBLE .
YES ABSOLUTELY .
UM .
IT S A IT S A TOUGH QUESTION IT REALLY IS I GUESS IF I HAD TO SAY YES OR NO I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW YES I I WOULD HAVE TO LEAN TOWARD CAPITAL PUNISHMENT YOU KNOW FOR CERTAIN CRIMES .
WELL DO YOU THINK THAT WE DO IT BECAUSE WE WANT IT TO DETER CRIME OR IT S NOT BECAUSE WE DO NT WANT TO PAY FOR INMATES TO STAY IN PRISON .
NO I DO NT THINK IT S A MONETARY THING .
UHHUH .
I THINK WE HOPE THAT IT WILL BE YOU KNOW SOME SORT OF DETERM DETERRENT OR YOU KNOW AN EYE FOR AN EYE TYPE THING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
UM .
SOME OF THE CRIMES ARE JUST SO BRUTAL AND SO YOU KNOW USELESS THIS MAY SEEM TO BE THE BEST WAY OUT I DO NT KNOW .
YES .
EASIEST WAY OUT MAYBE NO I DO NT THINK IT S A MONETARY THING .
UM WELL UM AND I NOTICE THAT THE CRIME RATE WAS UP IN THE DALLAS AREA IT S .
YES ESPECIALLY THE MURDER RATE ITS JUST GONE CRAZY .
IT S KIND OF BEEN SCARY .
YES .
TO THINK ABOUT IT AND .

AND HOW THEY WOULD EXPECT .
UHHUH .
HOW THEY WOULD HOPE I MEAN YOU YOU HEAR OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE UM COMMITTED CRIMES AND THEN THEY GET OUT OF JAIL AND THEY GO AND THEY DO THE SAME THING AGAIN .
ABSOLUTELY .

BOTH OF THEM .
RIGHT BOTH OF THEM ARE DEAD AND THEY HAPPEN TO MEET IN THIS THIS TOWN UM THIS THIS SORT OF CITY WHERE YOU RE SET UP YOU KNOW THEY GO AND THEY DECIDE IF YOU CAN MOVE UP TO THE NEXT LEVEL .

YEAH YEARS AGO .
IT S SOMETHING LIKE THAT THEY SORT OF MOVE UP TO LEVELS AND AND THEY HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THEY RE GOOD ENOUGH AND AS IT TURNS OUT YOU KNOW THEY MEET THERE AND FALL IN LOVE AND STUFF LIKE THAT .
OH .
SO YOU CAN GUESS THE REST OF THE PLOT IT ACTUALLY IT S IT S REALLY FUNNY BECAUSE THEY RUN THROUGH YOU KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE THEM DO IS SIT DOWN AND SEE SCENES OF THEIR LIVES .
OH YEAH AND THEN DEFEND IT .
AND THAT S PRETTY GOOD ACTUALLY .
WELL I GUESS THAT S WHERE THE TITLE COMES FROM THEN .
YEAH AND IT S MUMBLEX YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO GO UP THERE AND YOU HAVE A THEY HAVE AN ATTORNEY FOR YOU KNOW ATTORNEY FOR YOU AND ATTORNEY A DEFENSE AND A PROSECUTION AND YOU KNOW THE PROSECUTOR S JOB IS TO MAKE SURE YOU DO NT MOVE UP A LEVEL AND THE DEFENSE S JOB IS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU YOU DO YOU KNOW IT S UH IT S A NEAT LITTLE STORY ACTUALLY .

UM .
WHAT EXACTLY DO WE YOU KNOW DO WE SEE ABOUT THIS WORLD OR WHY ARE WE SO FASCINATED WITH THE OTHER WORLD IS IT SUPPOSED TO BE BETTER .
THE OTHER WORLD YEAH .
SOMETIMES I THINK WE THINK IT IS WE LIKE THOSE THINGS THAT WAY .
UM I M I M SURE THAT IT SEEMS LIKE IT CERTAINLY WOULD WOULD EXPLAIN THE PREOCCUPATION WITH MUMBLEX BUT I SUSPECT IT S ALWAYS BEEN A PREOCCUPATION WITH THAT SORT OF THINGS .
WELL IT HAS ALL THE WAY THROUGH HISTORY THERE S I GUESS IF YOU WANT TO CALL ITS MYSTICISM OR THE OCCULT OR WHATEVER IT S ALWAYS FASCINATED I GUESS BECAUSE WE DO NT KNOW AND THERE S NO REAL WAY OF FINDING OUT .
RIGHT WELL .
THERE S ONLY ONE WAY OF FINDING IT .
WELL DID YOU EVER SEE UM FLATLINERS .
NO I DID UH DID NOT THE GIRL NEXT TO ME SAW IT AND SHE REALLY LIKED IT .
THAT S THAT S THAT S PROBABLY ONE OF THOSE ONES THAT YOU KNOW IT S ON VIDEO NOW I THINK .
YEAH IT IS .
PROBABLY PROBABLY WORTH SEEING ON VIDEO ACTUALLY WE REALLY ENJOYED IT BUT IT WAS ALSO RIGHT ALONG THE SAME LINES I MEAN .
YEAH .
THEY THEY WOULD GO AHEAD AND KILL THEMSELVES FOR THREE OR FOUR MINUTES TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS .
YEAH THEY SAID SHE SAID THAT THIS WAS ALMOST BELIEVABLE THAT COULD REALLY HAPPEN YOU KNOW YOU GET THE MEDICAL PROFESSION DOING THESE KINDS OF THINGS AND YOU NEVER KNOW .
ALMOST YEAH I I IT S A LITTLE FAR FETCHED TO .
FIND A BUNCH OF MEDICAL STUDENTS DOING IT BUT .
YEAH .
BUT IT WAS UM IT WAS IT WAS ODD ENOUGH YOU KNOW AND THEY DID NT JUST SORT OF MAKE IT SILLY IT WAS YOU KNOW IT WAS DONE FAIRLY WELL I THINK SO ACTUALLY I ACTUALLY ENJOYED THAT AS WELL .
YEAH I LIKE IT WHEN THEY WILL DO SOMETHING AND NOT GET TOO SILLY I VE BEEN DISAPPOINTED IN SOME MOVIES THAT THEY DO NT KNOW HOW TO END IT IT SEEMS LIKE SO THEN THEY GET CRAZY AND AND IT DOES NT END LIKE THE STORY HAS BEEN GOING .
THE STORY SORT OF KEEPS GOING AND GOING .
WELL I GUESS THAT COVERS OUR TOPIC .

OH .
NEWSPAPER AND KIND OF FORGOT ABOUT IT .
BUT UH YEAH I D SAY READING IS PROBABLY ONE OF MY BIGGEST ONES BECAUSE IT S THE TYPE OF THING THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN DO A LITTLE BIT AT A TIME WHEREAS I WOULD LOVE TO DO CRAFTS AND STUFF IF I JUST HAD THE TIME TO DO IT .
UHHUH .
OR IF I HAD THE SPACE .
I LIVE IN A PRETTY SMALL APARTMENT AND UH I WOULD HAVE TO YOU KNOW PUT STUFF AWAY .
I HAVE TWO CATS SO I COULD NT REALLY LEAVE IT OUT IF I WAS WORKING ON SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
READING IS A LITTLE BIT EASIER TO WORK AROUND .
YEAH YOU CAN PICK IT UP AND TAKE IT WHEREVER YOU GO .
THAT S RIGHT .
MUMBLEX .
ANY MUMBLEX SPACE .
I GET TOO INVOLVED IN READING SOMETIMES THAT I NEGLECT WHAT .
I SHOULD BE DOING .
THAT S TRUE I DO THE SAME THING .
YOU GET SO INVOLVED IN WHAT .
YOU RE READING .
WHAT TYPES OF CRAFTS DO YOU DO .
I DO A LITTLE BIT OF WOODWORKING WELL I USED TO .
I DO NT HAVE THE EQUIPMENT HERE .
WE MOVED TO DALLAS ABOUT A YEAR AGO .
UHHUH .
AND MY DAD HAD A LOT OF WOODWORKING EQUIPMENT .
UHHUH .
AND I DID SOME OF THAT .
UM HERE I VE MOSTLY DONE THINGS THAT I CAN DO STRICTLY BY HAND UM SEWING AND QUILTING AND UM WHAT ELSE HAVE I DONE .
THINGS TO HANG ON THE WALL .
UHHUH .
MOSTLY JUST STUFF THAT I CAN YOU KNOW USE RIGHT AROUND THE HOUSE .
UHHUH .
OR GIVE AWAY AS GIFTS .
RIGHT .
I VE BEEN MAKING A LOT OF QUILTS WELL NOT A LOT BUT SEVERAL QUILTS LATELY .
UHHUH .
SO .
I ENJOY UH SEWING AND NEEDLEWORK ALSO .
I VE I VE UH MADE SOME SMALL THINGS CROSS STITCH THINGS .
AND UM .
UHHUH .
BACK WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL I WORKED AT A NEEDLEWORK SHOP AND I I USED TO DO THE LATCH HOOK RUGS AND NEEDLEPOINT AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND I I STILL REMEMBER HOW TO DO IT .
IT S JUST BEEN SO LONG SINCE I VE ACTUALLY SAT DOWN AND TAKEN THE TIME TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
BUT I HAVE RECENTLY DONE SOME CROSS STITCH .
UHHUH .
AND I ENJOY DOING THAT .
IT S JUST THE SAME OLD THING IT S JUST GETTING THE TIME TO DO IT .
YEAH .
I VE DONE SOME CROSS UM CROSS STITCH BUT I NEVER COUNT RIGHT AND I ALWAYS HAVE TO EITHER TAKE IT OUT OR HAVE MY PICTURE SLIGHTLY OFF CENTERED .
UHHUH .
OR OR SOMETHING .
IT NEVER HAS WORKED OUT COMPLETELY .
YEAH IT TAKES A LOT OF CONCENTRATION .
I MEAN IT WAS THE TYPE OF THING I WAS I WAS MAKING SOME LITTLE THINGS FOR CHRISTMAS AND I ALSO MADE A LITTLE THING FOR A BABY GIFT AND UH I THOUGHT OH I CAN DO THIS WHILE I WATCH T V .
WRONG .
RIGHT .
NO YOU MUST PAY ALL ATTENTION TO WHAT .
YOU RE DOING .
IT S IT IS A LOT MORE DIFFICULT THAN IT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE .
IT TOOK ME UH QUITE A BIT OF TIME .
I THOUGH OH THIS WO NT TAKE LONG AT ALL .
BUT .
UHHUH .
I WAS WRONG .
IT .
TOOK .
IT TOOK A WHILE TO DO .
BUT IT WAS FUN I ENJOYED IT .
YEAH .
THE FIRST PROJECT .
I STARTED OUT ONE WAS A BIG ONE IT WAS UH IT WAS OF A LADY AND SHE WAS KNEELING AND IT WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN BY TWENTY MAYBE .
OH MY GOSH .
AND I IT WAS JUST TOO MUCH TO START WITH .
AND I STILL HAVE NT FINISHED IT BECAUSE I I STOPPED AND I THOUGHT I BETTER DO SOME SIMPLE THINGS AND WORK UP TO THIS .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE IT WAS JUST SO DIFFICULT .
YEAH .
TO GET IT DONE .
AND THERE WERE SO MANY DIFFERENT SHADINGS AND COLORS AND AND IT WAS JUST TOO MUCH TO BEGIN WITH .
AND I THINK KIND OF DISCOURAGED ME FROM DOING MUCH MORE WITH IT .
YEAH .
THAT S PRETTY UNDERSTANDABLE .
AND I VE DONE SOME OF THE CREWEL AND THE UM .
UHHUH .
SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THAT BUT IT DOES NT HAVE THE SPECIFIC STITCHES .
ANYWAY IT S A LITTLE BIT MORE LOOSE AND NOT QUITE AS STRUCTURED AND I LIKE THAT A LITTLE BIT BETTER .
UHHUH .
THE VARIETY OF STITCHES AND STUFF IN THAT .
MORE LIKE EMBROIDERY OR SOMETHING .
I M TRYING TO THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE I DO AS A HOBBY .
UM .
I DO NT EVEN WATCH T V VERY MUCH .
I WAS TONIGHT BUT .
YEAH .
I WAS READING WHEN YOU CALLED .
YEAH .
HOW ABOUT MOVIES DO YOU LIKE TO GO TO MOVIES .
YEAH I DO I DO LIKE TO GO TO MOVIES AND I HAVE A V C R SO I LIKE TO RENT MOVIES AND UM I HAVE RIGHT NOW I HAVE THE MOVIE CHANNEL SO I VE RECORDED QUITE A FEW MOVIES OFF OF THAT .
UM JUST I VE KIND OF GOT A COLLECTION GOING OF TAPES NOW AND WHENEVER I GO VISIT MY PARENTS THEY RE ALWAYS SAYING WELL BRING SOME OF YOUR TAPES .
THEY ALWAYS BORROW A FEW OF THEM .
I WAS OVER THERE THEY LIVE IN DUNCANVILLE .
UHHUH .
AND I WAS OVER THERE AT EASTER AND THEY SAID BRING SOME TAPES WITH YOU .
SO THEY ARE ALWAYS BORROWING MY TAPES .
YEAH .
BUT UH .
WELL WE .
I LIKE TO I LIKE TO DO UH STUFF WITH PLANTS .
I LIKE UM I HAVE A LOT OF PLANTS IN MY APARTMENT AND I VE GOT A PRETTY SMALL PORCH BUT IT S IT S UH I VE GOT A FEW PLANTERS OUT THERE THAT I I LL UH YOU KNOW IN THE WINTER TIME .
I USUALLY PLANT SOME PANSIES IN THERE AND THEN IN THE SUMMER .
I LL PLANT PETUNIAS OR SOMETHING .
THAT S COLORFUL AND LIKE THAT BLOOMS A LOT .
BUT .
UHHUH .
HAVE NT DONE THAT YET .
I KEPT THINKING THAT IT WAS GOING TO GET COLD .
ONE MORE TIME BUT I THINK WE RE PROBABLY PAST THAT NOW .
I PROBABLY SHOULD GO BUY SOME .
YEAH .
I GUESS IF I HAD A HOUSE .
I MIGHT ENJOY GARDENING SOME .
I M NOT REAL CRAZY ABOUT PULLING WEEDS AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
YEAH IT S THE HARD WORK .
YEAH I LIKE THE PLANTING AND WATERING IS OKAY .
IT S SO NICE THOUGH WHEN YOU HAVE A NICE YARD FULL OF FLOWERS IT S SO BEAU I MEAN WE DO NT .
WE LIVE IN AN APARTMENT ALSO .
UHHUH .
I VE GOT A FEW PLANTS HERE BUT I M NOT REALLY KNOWLEDGEABLE .
I FEEL REAL GOOD IF I WATER THEM AND THEY CONTINUE TO GROW .
YOU KNOW I FEEL LIKE OH I VE ACCOMPLISHED SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
SO I ENJOY IT BUT I M JUST NOT EXPERIENCED ENOUGH WITH IT .
YEAH .
I DO NT KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT IT EITHER .
MINE S PRETTY LIMITED TO MY LITTLE UH PORCH PLANTS .
UHHUH .
AND THEN THE ONES IN MY APARTMENT HALF OF WHICH DO NT LOOK REAL HEALTHY BUT I DO NT ALWAYS GET DIRECT SUN EXCEPT IN CERTAIN SPOTS .
OH YEAH .
AND SO THAT S PROBABLY MY PROBLEM THERE .
BUT .
HAVE YOU TRIED ANY GROWING ANY UM LIKE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES OR ANYTHING .
I GUESS VEGETABLES ARE IN INSI LIKE IN POTS AND STUFF .
NO I NEVER HAVE TRIED THAT JUST BECAUSE I DO NT HAVE THAT MUCH SPACE ON THIS LITTLE PORCH HERE IN THIS APARTMENT .
UHHUH .
OR THIS LITTLE BALCONY .
AND MY OTHER TWO POTS ARE THEY RE KIND OF THEY RE PRETTY BIG AND I HAVE ENOUGH PLANTS IN THEM THAT IT TAKES UP A LOT OF MY PORCH AREA SO BETWEEN THAT AND THE CHAIRS AND THE BARBECUE GRILL AND THE FIREPLACE WOOD .
THERE S NO ROOM FOR MUCH ELSE .
BUT MY DAD UH MY DAD USED TO GROW TOMATOES AND THINGS AT THE HOUSE .
AND I D I THINK WHEN I WAS REAL LITTLE I PROBABLY HAD A FINGER IN ON THAT EVERY TIME .
HE DID IT .
UHHUH .
AND HAD TO BE OUT THERE AND WATCH AND THAT TYPE OF STUFF .
BUT I VE NEVER REALLY TRIED ANYTHING LIKE THAT SINCE THEN .
WELL I CONSIDERED IT LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR .
BOTH BUT I HAVE NT DONE ANYTHING ABOUT IT .
UHHUH .
SO .
I THINK IT WOULD BE NICE TO JUST GO OUT AND PICK SOME TOMATOES OFF THE PORCH .
WE GET LOTS OF SUNLIGHT HERE AND THE PORCH IS SCREENED IN AND IT S PRETTY LARGE .
OH WOW .
SO UM I THINK IF I JUST WOULD BE IF I D DO SOMETHING BE MOTIVATED ENOUGH TO DO SOMETHING I THINK IT WOULD WORK OUT WELL .
UHHUH .
BUT BUT THERE GOES THAT MOTIVATION THING AGAIN .
RIGHT .
WELL I ENJOY PLAYING WITH MY CATS .
I DO NT KNOW IF YOU D CALL THAT A HOBBY BUT I HAVE TWO CATS AND I GAVE THEM .
A BATH TONIGHT SO THEY RE A LITTLE BIT ANGRY AT ME .
MUMBLEX .
CAN YOU .
THEY DID NT LIKE IT TOO MUCH .
CAN YOU PUT THEM RIGHT IN THE WATER .
YEAH OH YEAH .
OH THAT S GOOD .
RIGHT IN THE TUB AND IT HELPS BECAUSE ITS THE TIME OF THE YEAR THAT THEY RE SHEDDING A LOT AND CLEANING CAT FUR OFF THE COUCH AND OFF THE FLOOR IS NOT A HOBBY OF MINE .
SO I THOUGHT .
THIS LL HELP YOU KNOW HELP THEM SHED AND SURE ENOUGH BOY .
THE FUR JUST CAME OFF LIKE CRAZY ONCE I GOT THEM .
OH YEAH .
IN THE TUB .
SO THEY RE PRETTY CONTENT NOW BUT THEY WERE MAD AT ME FOR QUITE A WHILE .
THEY WENT AND HID AFTER THEY AFTER THEY GOT DRIED OFF .
SULKED FOR A WHILE HUH .
YEAH .
WELL I LIKE ANIMALS BUT WE DO NT HAVE ANY YET .
WE HAVE A NINE MONTH OLD WITH ANOTHER ON THE WAY .
UHHUH .
AND WE THOUGHT WELL MAYBE WHEN THEY RE A LITTLE BIT BIGGER .
YEAH .
THEN WE LL OR GET INTO A HOUSE WITH A LITTLE MORE SPACE .
I D LOVE TO HAVE HAVE SOME ANIMALS .
UHHUH .
BUT I LIKE DOGS AND MY HUSBAND LIKES CATS .
SO WE HAVE NT REACHED A REAL AGREEMENT ON THAT YET .
IF WE GET A PLACE WHERE WE CAN HAVE BOTH IT LL BE GREAT BUT UNTIL THEN .
YEAH I LIKE BOTH BUT SINCE I M IN AN APARTMENT I JUST I DO NT THINK AN APARTMENT IS BIG ENOUGH FOR A DOG .
DOGS TO ME DOGS NEED A YARD EVEN LITTLE DOGS .
UHHUH .
THEY JUST NEED A YARD .
CATS CAN DEAL WITH BEING INSIDE ALL THE TIME JUST FINE .
BUT I JUST THINK DOGS NEED NEED TO BE OUTSIDE THOUGH .
SO .
I AGREE WITH YOU .
I IF WE WERE GOING TO GET ANYTHING NOW IT WOULD DEFINITELY BE A CAT OR EVEN A BIRD OR A FISH TANK OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW .
YEAH NOW THAT S AN IDEA .
SOMETHING .
SMALL .
WITH THE SMALL BABIES .
THAT SHE CAN WATCH BUT WO NT TAKE TOO MUCH CARE .
YEAH BECAUSE YOU .
KIND OF EVEN EVEN A CAT YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN THEY MIGHT BITE OR SCRATCH OR SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
THERE NOT AS LIKELY TO AS A DOG MIGHT I GUESS .
BUT WITH LITTLE ONES I D BE KIND OF SCARED TO GET ANYTHING .
THAT HAS TEETH OR CLAWS .
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY RE NOT QUITE TO THE AGE OF UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY RE HURTING YOU KNOW THAT THEY GRAB HOLD WITH BOTH .
HANDS AND THEN JUST JERK .
OH YEAH .
AND IF I WAS A CAT OR DOG I D RESPOND PROBABLY BY BITING OR SOMETHING .
I DO NT KNOW .
OH YEAH .
THAT D BE MY SELF DEFENSE .
BUT .
UHHUH .
WELL I THINK WE PROBABLY REACHED OUR TIME LIMIT .
YEAH PROBABLY SO AND I M OUT OF OUT OF GOOD IDEAS FOR A HOBBY ANYWAY .
OH OKAY .
WELL IT WAS GOOD TALKING TO YOU .
THANK YOU FOR CALLING .
ALL RIGHT .
BYEBYE .
BYEBYE .
IT S IT S HARD TOPIC BECAUSE IS IS IS IT DOING A GOOD JOB OR A BAD JOB AND YOU GOT TO DIVIDE IT .
TWO DIFFERENT CATEGORIES WHETHER YOU LIVE IN THE CITY OR WHETHER YOU LIVE IN A MORE RURAL PLACE LIKE I DO .
YEAH AND ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC SCHOOLS BEING LOWER LEVEL HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL OR .
WELL PUBLIC SCHOOL .
ALL THE WAY UP .
STATE SCHOOL .
KINDERGARTEN .
ALL THE WAY UP TO UH UH HIGH SCHOOL .
OKAY BUT YOU RE EXCLUDING HIGHLEVEL EDUCATION .
YES WELL YEAH I AM .
OH .
OKAY .
A ACTUALLY I THINK THAT I HIGHER LEVEL EDUCATION I DO NT THINK THERE S SO MUCH OF A PROBLEM THERE .
IT S PRETTY MUCH FUNDED WELL .
THERE ARE SMALL COLLEGES THAT I M SURE ARE STRUGGLING BUT UH IT S THE JOB THAT THE THE HIGH SCHOOL AND THE GRADE SCHOOLS ARE DOING THAT I SEE IN A AREA LIKE OURS OUR SCHOOL EVEN A BAD SCHOOL IS A GOOD SCHOOL UP HERE WHERE IF I LIVED IN NEW YORK CITY OR WASHINGTON D C UH I WOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER MOVING IF I HAD A CHILD .
I WOULD NT LET THEM GO TO A PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM THERE .
BUT OF COURSE PEOPLE ARE TRAPPED ECONOMICALLY AND THEY CA NT DO THAT .
YEAH .
I KNOW DOWN HERE THE SCHOOL S ARE YOU KNOW I DO NT KNOW THEY RATE I MOVED TO ARKANSAS AND TEXAS AFTER LIVING IN OHIO AND THE SCHOOLS DOWN HERE RATE YOU KNOW BOTTOM TEN PERCENT ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND HAVING BEEN THROUGH GRADE SCHOOL UP THERE AND COMING DOWN HERE TO HIGH SCHOOL .
I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY .
BECAUSE THEY RE SO FAR BEHIND AND SO POORLY STAFFED HALF THE TIME .
THE TEACHERS DO NT KNOW WHAT S GOING ON .
WELL THAT S REALLY TOO BAD BECAUSE IT IT S GIVING SOME PEOPLE UNFAIR ADVANTAGE .
I MEAN WE OUR HIGH SCHOOL UP HERE IS LIKE A JUNIOR COLLEGE IN FLORIDA .
RIGHT .
WHAT .
WE LEARNED .
WELL THAT WAS MY EXPERIENCE GOING THROUGH JUNIOR HIGH UP THERE WHEN I CAME DOWN SOUTH FOR HIGH SCHOOL .
I WAS JUST REPEATING WHAT .
I D ALREADY DONE .
YEAH .
BECAUSE WE WERE SO FAR ADVANCED .
AND UH YOU KNOW I D BEEN IN A PAROCHIAL SCHOOL BEFORE JUNIOR HIGH AND YOU KNOW EVEN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE BEHIND THE PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS .
YEAH .
SO YOU KNOW I I LIKE THE CONCEPT .
THEY VE GOT NOW WHERE THEY HAVE MORE DIRECTED EDUCATION YOU KNOW YOU YOU PICK A CAREER PATH OR YOU GET COUNSELING EARLIER AND THEN YOU YOU LEARN THE THINGS .
THAT HELP YOU RATHER THAN SPENDING FOUR YEARS LEARNING THE SAME THINGS OVER AND OVER .
LIKE THEY HAVE THAT DOWN THERE .
THAT .
WELL THEY TALK ABOUT IT AND THERE ARE A FEW IN SOME OF THE MORE LIKE IN I LIVE IN A BIG METROPLEX AND SOME OF THE THE BETTER PARTS OF THE METROPLEX THE THE SUBURBS .
THAT ARE RICHER HAVE THOSE KIND OF TARGET SCHOOLS .
BUT UH YOU KNOW .
YEAH IT S LIKE IF IF YOUR FATHER OWNS A GROCERY STORE AND YOU RE REALLY INTERESTED IN THAT THERE S NO REASON THAT YOU SHOULD TAKE COLLEGE PREP COURSES WHEN YOU CAN GET SOME .
RIGHT .
GENERAL BUSINESS COURSES IN HIGH SCHOOL .
OR IF YOU RE GOING TO GO THE SCIENCE ROUTE .
YOU CAN GO TO A TARGET SCHOOL .
THAT SPECIALIZES IN SCIENCE OR ART .
YOU KNOW THERE S NO POINT IN YOU KNOW I M AN ENGINEERING STUDENT AND IF I HAVE TO GO TAKE ART CLASSES YOU KNOW I M NOT GOING TO USE THEM .
AND THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL .
I COULD HAVE GONE SO MUCH FURTHER IF I D GONE TO A SCHOOL .
THAT WAS DIRECTED .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
I WAS FORTUNATE .
I M A I M A TECHNICIAN AND WE HAD A VOCATIONAL UH ELECTRONICS IN OUR HIGH SCHOOL .
RIGHT IN HIGH SCHOOL .
SO WHEN I WENT TO MY FIRST YEAR OF TECH SCHOOL I HAD A VERY EASY TIME BECAUSE OUR HIGH SCHOOL .
RIGHT .
HAD A A GOOD PROGRAM .
I THINK THE SCHOOLS TODAY YOU KNOW THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE JUST THEY RE JUST OVERRUN YOU KNOW THEY DO NT KNOW WHAT TO DO THERE S TOO MANY KIDS AND NOT ENOUGH TEACHERS AND TOO MANY OF THE KIDS DO NT CARE .
YEAH I FIND THAT .
AND .
THAT THE THAT IN THE IN THE CITIES IT S MORE LIKE THE KIDS GO THERE SO SOCIALIZE .
RIGHT .
NOT REALLY TO LEARN AND THE PARENTS SEND THEM THERE BECAUSE THEY RE SUPPOSED TO AND PLUS IT GETS THEM OUT OF THEIR HAIR .
AND I ALSO FIND THAT THAT YOU CAN SEND A KID TO SCHOOL BUT IF DO NT WORK WITH THEM AS A PARENT I THINK YOU RE PUTTING YOUR CHILD AT A BIG DISADVANTAGE .
YEAH AND YOU KNOW THERE S SOME KIDS .
THAT YOU KNOW WANT TO GO LEARN BUT MOST OF THEM JUST WANT TO GO PLAY .
YEAH WELL I COULD I COULD SEE IF A KID DOES NT HAVE ANY ENCOURAGEMENT IF T THEY RE YOU KNOW COME FROM A BROKEN HOME AND THEY RE PARENTS ARE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT TRYING TO WORK AND OR MAYBE THEY RE UNEMPLOYED AND THEY RE MAD AT THE WORLD I CAN SEE WHERE THAT WOULD NT BE VERY GOOD FOR A A KID YOU KNOW HE S COMING UP WILL YOU HELP ME WITH MY HOMEWORK AND THEY RE NO GET AWAY FROM ME I VE HAD A TERRIBLE DAY .
SO IT S GOT A LOT TO DO WITH ECONOMICS IN THE AREA THAT YOU COME FROM .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
I M WONDERING WITH THE BOOM DOWN HERE .
IT S WELL NOT AT THE MOMENT BUT A LOT OF THE INDUSTRY S MOVING SOUTHWARD .
YEAH ARE THEY GOING TO MOVE TO UH .
SO .
MEXICO .
UH I DO NT KNOW ABOUT THAT BUT A LOT OF THE INDUSTRY UP IN UH YOU KNOW THE NORTHERN STATES IS MOVING SOUTH .
UHHUH .
AND I M WONDERING IF THAT S GOING TO HAVE ANY EFFECT YOU KNOW ON WHAT .
YOU SEE NOW .
WE RE WE RE WE RE BEHIND DOWN HERE .
ON THE .
I SAY WE BECAUSE I LIVE HERE .
IF THAT MIGHT NOT TURN AROUND IN THE NEXT YOU KNOW FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS .
YEAH MAYBE THE MAYBE THEY LL BRING THEIR GOOD SCHOOLS WITH THEM .
YOU KNOW IF THE INDUSTRY COMES .
YEAH .
HOPEFULLY THEY LL PROMOTE GOOD SCHOOLS .
BECAUSE I KNOW THE TOWN THAT I COME FROM THE THE UH THE LARGE I B M PLANT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE TOP RATED HIGH SCHOOL BECAUSE OF THEIR TAX BASE FOR ONE AND PLUS FOR FOR THE TYPE OF STUDENT .
THAT S GOING TO THAT SCHOOL IT S GOING TO RAISE THE LEVEL OF THE SCHOOL .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE YOUR PARENTS ARE ENGINEERS OR CHEMISTS .
THEY RE THEY RE YOU RE MOST LIKELY TO DO BETTER IN SCHOOL .
THEY RE GOING TO HELP YOU .
YOU HOPE .
YEAH YOU HOPE .
WELL I THINK I I DO NT KNOW .
I JUST THINK IT IT S IT S A DUTY OF THE PARENT TO DO THAT .
I MEAN JEEZ MY PARENTS ALWAYS HELPED ME AND I DO NT KNOW IT S JUST LIKE YOU SAY IT S THE WAY .
YOU RE RAISED AND THE ECONOMIC SITUATION .
YOU RE IN .
I CAN SEE SOME LADY SHE S TWENTYONE YEARS OLD AND SHE S GOT FOUR KIDS .
A KID IN HER FIRST GRADER I DO NT SEE WHERE SHE S GOING TO HAVE MUCH TIME FOR THEM .
SO I DO NT KNOW .
IT S JUST LIKE .
I GUESS YOU JUST HAVE TO WONDER IS IT UP TO THE IS IT YOU KNOW WHO WHOSE SUPPOSED TO MAKE THE CHANGE THE THE STATE THE GOVERN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT YOU KNOW WHERE S THE MONEY SUPPOSED TO COME FROM .
IS IT YOU KNOW .
I DO NT KNOW .
ACTUALLY I THINK IT S I THINK IT SHOULD BE .
WHAT WHAT DO YOU ADVOCATE MORE TAXES OR BETTER MANAGEMENT OF WHAT .
THEY GOT .
A CIVIC LEVEL THE CITY LEVEL AND A A SYSTEM LEVEL REALLY TO FIND OUT AND T TO SEE WHAT .
THEY NEED AND NOT OVERINFLATE IT LIKE IF THE TEACHERS ARE GETTING SIX PERCENT RAISES EVERY YEAR WHEN PEOPLE IN INDUSTRY HAVE BEEN GETTING CUT BACK AND YOU RE GETTING .
YEAH .
RAISES EVERY EIGHTEEN MONTHS YOU GOT TO GO NOW HEY WAIT A MINUTE WE RE IN A RECESSION HERE .
WE UH OUR TOWN DID NT PASS THE SCHOOL BUDGET .
THIS YEAR AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MANY MANY YEARS JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE ARE IN THE RECESSION AND THEY RE EVEN THOUGH WE VE UH ENJOYED VERY GOOD EMPLOYMENT HERE FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS NOW WE GOT EIGHT PERCENT UH UNEMPLOYMENT WHEN IT USED TO BE FOUR OR FIVE .
PEOPLE ARE GOING WHOA .
YEAH .
SO .
STARTS HITTING CLOSER TO HOME .
YEAH BUT I ALWAYS SEE IT S ALL IT S ALL MONEY .
THIS LIKE A COUPLE OTHER TOPICS WE HAD TALKED ABOUT WAS CRIME .
IT IT S IT S ALL MONEY BASED .
AND WHAT .
YOU CAN DO UNLESS YOU JUST GET DOWN TO THE PARENT LEVEL AND AND THEN IF YOU RE IN A BAD SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE TO SEND YOUR CHILD TO A BAD SCHOOL .
WHO KNOWS BU MAYBE WE DO WE NEED SOME MORE CATHOLIC SCHOOLS SUPPORT THE CHURCH INSTEAD .
THEY SEEM TO HAVE DONE A THE GOOD JOB IN THE PAST .
IN UH SOME PLACES UH YOU COULD NT GO TO A PUBLIC SCHOOL .
IT WAS MILES DOWN THE ROAD AND THE ONLY SCHOOL .
YOU COULD GO TO WAS THE BAPTIST SCHOOL OR THE CATHOLIC SCHOOL SO .
YEAH THEY RE A LOT MORE STRICT .
YEAH I DO NT .
YOU UH HAVE TO LEARN YOU ARE NT GIVEN THE CHANCE TO YOU KNOW SCREW OFF ALL THE TIME .
YEAH I DO NT KNOW IF I WOULD DO THAT TO MY CHILD THOUGH .
BUT SO PRETTY MUCH THOUGH SEE I DO NT HAVE ANY GOOD IDEAS OR OR ANYTHING .
THAT WOULD CONTRIBUTE .
SEE THIS IS NT A SUBJECT THAT I THINK A LOT ABOUT BECAUSE I M NEVER FACED WITH IT BECAUSE OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM IN VERMONT IT SEEMS TO DO A REALLY GOOD JOB .
WELL I KNOW I M IN THE YOU KNOW THE ONLY REASON .
I ASKED ABOUT SECONDARY SCHOOLS OR YOU KNOW ADVANCED EDUCATION IS BECAUSE DOWN HERE YOU KNOW GOING TO THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS THE EDUCATION .
I M GETTING I THINK IS KIND OF SHODDY FOR A PUBLIC SCHOOL .
IS IT .
I I DO NT THINK I M GETTING WHAT .
I SHOULD BUT YOU KNOW IN TEXAS IT S NEXT TO FREE BECAUSE TH THEY PAY SO MUCH OF IT .
IT .
S STATE SUPPORTED .
WELL THAT .
BUT AT THE SAME TIME .
IT S REALLY NOT IT S NOT LIKE GOING TO M I T .
MY ENGINEERING DEGREE WILL BE NOTHING LIKE SOMEBODY COMING OUT OF M I T .
AND THAT S IT S REALLY TOO BAD .
WELL .
BUT THAT S I DO NT KNOW I THINK IT JUST BUILDS ON THE FOUNDATION THAT THEY VE ALREADY BUILT .
YOU GET PEOPLE OUT OF HIGH SCHOOLS AND COL JUNIOR COLLEGES .
THAT DO NT HAVE THE BACKGROUND FOR AN M I T KIND OF CURRICULUM .
SO .
SO YOU HAVE TO GO TO A LESSER ENGINEERING SCHOOL .
WE HAVE A VERY GOOD PUBLIC SCHOOL UP HERE AND A DEGREE OUT THERE MEANS A LOT .
IT S A VERY GOOD SCHOOL .
IT S IT .
S UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT .
UH WE ALSO HAVE SOME TWO YEAR COLLEGE .
WELL THERE S A FOUR YEAR COLLEGES .
THEY .
ALL HAVE A PRETTY GOOD REPUTATION .
BUT LIKE YOU SAY YOU .
OKAY JAY WHERE DO YOU LIVE IN TEXAS .

YOU KNOW AT THE BANK TO HAVE A PROOF OF WHEN I MAILED IT AND I MEAN YOU CA NT DO THAT IT WOULD BE RIDICULOUS .
REALLY I LIKE TO USE MY CARD IF I BUY SOMETHING THROUGH THE MAIL WHICH I DO NT DO REAL OFTEN OR SOMETHING FROM OUT OF STATE YOU KNOW WHERE IF SOMETHING IS WRONG .
RIGHT .
YOU DO NT WANT TO END UP HAVING TO PAY FOR IT .
WELL YOU CAN .
A COUPLE TIMES I VE HAD TO WRITE BIG CREDIT CARD COMPANIES AND SAY YOU KNOW I DID NT REALLY GET THIS OR I DO NT KNOW WHAT THIS IS .
RIGHT OR I RETURNED IT SO DO NT CHARGE IT YEAH .
YEAH .
WELL THAT S BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENED WITH US IS WE BOUGHT A COMPUTER AND THE COMPUTER UM D WAS NT DID NT DO WHAT THESE PEOPLE SAID IT WOULD DO .
UHHUH .
WE NEED TO JUST PUT EXTERNAL CARDS IN AND IT WOULD NT DO THAT SO HE BROUGHT IT BACK TO THEM AND THEY RE SUPPOSED TO MODIFY IT AND SO I CALLED THE CREDIT CARD COMPANY AND SAID WELL WE HAVE NT REALLY TAKEN POSSESSION BECAUSE IT S NOT USEFUL FOR US WE CA NT USE IT .
UHHUH .
AND THEN THEY SAID WELL THEN DO NT PAY IT AND THEN A MONTH LATER I HAD TO DISPUTE IT IN WRITING AND I WAS OUT OF THE COUNTRY AND GOT BACK AND I TOOK CARE OF IT AS SOO AS SOON AS WE GOT THE COMPUTER BACK AND IT WAS OKAY I MAILED OFF A CHECK BUT THEN IT WAS TOO LATE SO NOW THEY RE HITTING ME UP THERE WITH A FINANCE CHARGE .
OH .
BUT IT S SORT OF YOU KNOW IT S IT S HALF OUR FAULT .
YES IT S I .
AND SO W .
W YEAH IF YOU FILED THAT LETTER WITH THEM THEN THEY WILL KIND OF .
RIGHT IF I HAD FILED THE LETTER TO DISPUTE IT AND THEN PAID IT EVENTUALLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OKAY .
YEAH .
SO I LEARNED THAT FOR THE NEXT TIME .
I M LIKE YOU TOO .
YEAH .
ABOUT THE YEARLY FEES I DO NT UH I DO NT LIKE TO PAY THE YEARLY FEE FOR A CARD RIGHT NOW BOTH THE MASTERCARD AND THE VISA WE DO NT HAVE TO PAY A YEARLY FEE ON AND .
UHHUH .
SINCE WE DO NT PAY THE INTEREST IT DOES NT REALLY MATTER WHAT THE INTEREST RATE .
RIGHT YEAH .
IS TOO JUST AS LONG AS WE DO NT HAVE TO PAY THAT YEARLY FEE NOW WE HAD AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS AND MY HUSBAND HAD ALWAYS HAD THAT BEFORE WE GOT MARRIED AND THOSE GOT SO HIGH WE FINALLY DECIDED FOR HIM AND ME BOTH TO HAVE A CARD IT WAS LIKE NINETY DOLLARS OR SOMETHING I THINK .
YEAH .
I CA NT REMEMBER BUT WE DECIDED LET THAT ONE GO AND .
WELL MY HUSBAND AND I BOTH HAVE THAT AND I DO NT KNOW WHAT WE PAY FOR HIS CARD I PAY I THINK I HAVE A GOLD ONE SO .
UHHUH .
I THINK IT S LIKE SEVENTYFIVE DOLLARS FOR ME .
YEAH .
AND I M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT IT IS FOR HIM BUT I HAD REALLY LIKE W THERE NOWADAYS I M NOT SU SO SURE THAT IT S WORTH IT .
UHHUH .
BUT UM IN THE PAST THERE YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME PLACES THAT ONLY TAKE AMERICAN EXPRESS .
YEAH .
AND THEN THEY DO NT HAVE THE CREDIT LIMIT BECAUSE I VE OVER DONE THE CREDIT LIMIT ON THE OTHER CARD IF MY HUSBAND AND I BOTH TRAVEL .
YEAH .
IT YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF PLAIN TICKETS AND A LITTLE BIT MORE AND YOU RE OVER THE LIMIT ON THE CREDIT CARD AND UM WITH THE AMERICAN EXPRESS THEY SAY THERE IS NO LIMIT THERE REALLY IS BUT THEY .
TELL YOU THAT BUT THEN THAT WAS ONE ADVANTAGE BUT TH THAT S LIKE I DO NT I THINK IT S SEVENTYFIVE DOLLARS FOR ME AND FORTY FOR HIM .
UHHUH .
FOR A YEAR WHICH IS A LOT .
YEAH .
BE N .
BUT YEAH LIKE YOU SAID IF YOU REALLY IF YOU NEED THAT EXTRA FOR CHARGING TICKETS AND STUFF .
YEAH WELL .
IT S MORE WORTH IT .
WE SHOULD PROBABLY GET ANOTHER UM VISA CARD .
UHHUH .
YE ONE ANOTHER ONE THAT S FREE BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME LIKE I THINK A T AND T HAS ONE THAT S FREE IF YOU MAKE TWO PURCHASES A YEAR .
OH .
WELL SO .
YEAH THAT WOULD NT BE TOO HARD TO DO .
YEAH AND SO THAT S EASY ENOUGH TO DO AND IF THAT S TRUE THAT S UM IT MIGHT BE BETTER OFF TO HAVE THAT AS A SECOND CARD JUST TO HAVE THE CREDIT .
YEAH .
AND GET RID OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BECAUSE IT COSTS SO MUCH .
HAVE YOU EVER RUN INTO PROBLEMS OF CHARGING UP MORE THAN YOU MEANT TO AND HAVING TO .
NO .
BE STUCK WITH THAT WE VE NEVER HAD .
NO .
THAT PROBLEM EITHER .
I AND I DO NT UNDER I MEAN I GUESS I DO UNDERSTAND THE MENTALITY OF PEOPLE DOING IT BUT I DO NT UNDERSTAND YEA BECAUSE PEOPLE THINK IT DOES NT REALLY COST THEM ANYTHING TO PAY I HAVE HAD MONTHS WHERE I WAS SHOCKED AT HOW MUCH HAD COME IN BECAUSE LIKE I THOUGHT I WOULD BUY A BIG EXPENSE AND THINK THAT IT WOULD TAKE ONE OR TWO MONTHS TO PROCESS .
UHHUH .
AND SOMETIMES IT COMES IN RIGHT AWAY AND IT S LIKE OH WELL GUESS .
I HAVE TO PAY THAT TOO .
YEAH .
BECAUSE MUMBLEX LIKE MANY TIMES I LL TR I LL BUY SOME THINGS TOWARDS THE END OF THE MONTH THINKING HEY I WO NT GET THAT BILL UNTIL THE NEXT BILL .
RIGHT .
NOT THIS BILL AND IT WILL COME IN ON THE NEXT ONE YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR IT RIGHT AWAY ANYWAY .
YEAH .
BUT SOMETIMES THE MUMBLEX IS LONG LIKE I VE HAD THINGS THAT I DID NT GET BILLED ON FOR TWO OR THREE MONTHS .
YEAH I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON WHOEVER YOU BUY IT FROM HOW FAST THEY TURN THEM IN OR SOMETHING .
YEAH .
LOT OF PLACES HAVE THO I GUESS THEY RE CALLED THOSE POINTED SALE TERMINALS WHERE IT S LIKE IT GOES IN THE MINUTE .
IMMEDIATELY .
YOU CHARGE IT .
YEAH .
YEAH .
BUT THAT S WHAT HAPPENED WITH US LIKE WE BOUGHT A WASHING MACHINE SEVEN MONTHS AGO .
OH .
AND THAT I GOT BILLED LIKE THE NEXT DAY .
OH GOSH .
IT DID NT MATTER BECAUSE WE COULD NT HAVE PAID FOR IT BY CHECK BUT WE PREFER G LIKE WITH THE CREDIT CARD YOU GET THE AUTOMATIC UM ONE YEAR GUARANTEE SO IF SOMETHING BREAKS THINGS LIKE THAT .
YEAH THAT S NICE .
YOU CAN UH RETURN IT SO LIKE THE WASHING MACHINE WE BOUGHT IT IN OCTOBER AND YOU KNOW IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG WITH IT WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR WE VE GOT AN AUTOMATIC GUARANTEE ON IT BESIDES THE MANUFACTURER S GUARANTEE .
RIGHT .
AND SOMETHINGS LIKE THAT ARE .
YEAH I LIKE THAT FEATURE AND THE INSUR LIKE IF YOU BREAK IT YOURSELF EVEN YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
IF YOU BUY SOMETHING THAT S BREAKABLE .
OR IF IT GETS STOLEN OR IF YOU LOSE IT OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE .
YEAH .
AND SO SO THAT S YOU KNOW ANOTHER ADVANTAGE AND THEN EVEN THINGS LIKE AIRLINE TICKETS YOU AUTOMATICALLY GET FLIGHT INSURANCE WHICH UM YOU HOPEFULLY YOU NEVER USE .
BUT LIKE IF YOUR BAGGA BUT THINGS LIKE IF YOUR BAGGAGE GETS LOST YOU GET MONEY FOR THAT .
OH REALLY .
TO BUY NEW BAGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
OH I DID NT KNOW THAT .
AND YEAH WHEN YOU RENT A CAR YOU GET THAT AND SOMETIMES YOU GET DISCOUNTS WITH THE CARDS AND SO .

YEAH .
TH THEY RE THEY RE GETTING OLD NOW AND IT S TIME TO GET RID OF THEM .

YEAH .
WELL I THINK THAT S ALL I HAVE TO SAY .
OKAY WELL .
OKAY HAVE A GOOD NIGHT .
GOOD TALKING TO YOU .
ALL RIGHT BYEBYE .
BYE .
WELL STEPHANIE WHAT S YOUR POSITION ON GUN CONTROL .
WELL ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN UH BEING TEN NO KIND OF LEGISLATION AND ZERO BEING UH TOTAL BAN I PROBABLY WOULD LEAN MORE TOWARDS SIX OR SEVEN .
UM I FEEL LIKE A TOTAL BAN ON GUNS IS JUST GOING TO PUT THE GUNS IN THE HANDS .
THE CRIMINALS .
UHHUH .
UM I LIVED IN MASSACHUSETTS FOR TWO YEARS AND THEY HAVE A TOTAL BAN ON GUNS AND I SAW THAT IT DID NT STOP CRIME IN THAT STATE .
NOW WAS THAT JUST ON HANDGUNS OR WAS THAT ON RIFLES .
ANY ANY KIND OF FIREARMS .
REALLY .
YEAH .
UH IT S THERE S WAS A MANDATORY JAIL SENTENCE IF YOU WERE CAUGHT UM WITH A FIREARM AND ALSO I THINK THERE WAS A FINE .
AND THAT DID NT HELP AT ALL .
NO I DO NT THE THE CRIME IS NOT ANY BETTER OR ANY WORSE I MEAN IT S .
HUH .
I I SHOULD NT SAY I DO NT KNOW IF IT WAS ANY WORSE BUT IT CERTAINLY DID NT GET ANY BETTER .
UHHUH .
I USUALLY JUST I M TRYING TO THINK OF I GUESS I WOULD TEND MYSELF TO BE MORE TOWARDS THE THE LIKE THREE .
UHHUH .
WHERE I DO NT THINK YOU SHOULD NECESSARILY BAN GUNS .
ANY BY ANY MEANS BUT YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY HAVE THE CHARACTER SEARCH AND THE SEVEN DAY HOLDING PERIOD AND THINGS ALONG THAT NATURE UH YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD NT BE ABLE TO GO OUT THERE AND JUST BUY ONE AND YOU KNOW RIGHT OFF THE SHELF .
YEAH I I I AGREE WITH THAT .
AND BUT .
I I THINK THAT THE THE LAW IS ON WHO CAN BUY A GUN ARE ARE WAY TOO LAX .
UHHUH EXACTLY .
I THINK THAT I THINK THAT THE .
AND SO I THINK THAT KIND OF CONTROL IS WOULD BE GOOD .
YEAH .
BUT THE UH I YOU KNOW I M TRYING TO THINK OF HOW MANY TIMES YOU MAKE THE STATEMENT AND JUST TO KIND OF EXAM .
IT .
A LITTLE BIT AND I I KNOW THAT ANY STATEMENT IN ABSOLUTENESS IS NOT NECESSARILY TRUE UH ONLY THE GUNS WERE IN THE HANDS OF THE CRIMINALS BUT HOW MANY TIMES I GUESS I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF A A ROBBERY BEING FOILED OR SPOILED BECAUSE THE PERSON WHO S BEING ROBBED HAD A GUN .
UM I .
AND MAYBE THEY JUST DO NT REPORT THOSE OR I M NOT SURE OR YOU KNOW I CA NT THINK OF EVER HEARING ON THE NEWS OR WHATNOT OR HEARING OR KNOWING ANYBODY .
WHO WAS BEING ROBBED BUT GOOD THING .
THEY HAD THEIR GUN ON THEM AND THEY THEY THWARTED THE ROBBERY ATTEMPT .
YEAH I I M I M NOT REALLY SURE I DO NT PERSONALLY I DO NT OWN A GUN .
UHHUH .
UM AND I DO NT THINK I PROBABLY EVER WOULD UM ALTHOUGH I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW TO HANDLE ONE AND I THINK IT S GOOD THAT EVERYB AND I THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD LEARN HOW TO HANDLE ONE .
UHHUH .
UM YOU JUST NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU MIGHT COME INTO CONTACT WITH ONE .
TRUE .
UM .
DID DID YOU WERE YOU BROUGHT UP IN A FAMILY .
THAT HUNTED OR .
NO .
UH NOBODY IN MY FAMILY HUNTED UH MY FATHER HAD HAD GUNS WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL BECAUSE HE GOT THEM FROM A FRIEND .
WHO LIVED IN MASSACHUSETTS .
WE LIVED IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AT THE TIME .
HOW ABOUT THAT .
AND HE LIVED IN MASSACHUSETTS AND HAD TO GET RID OF ALL HIS GUNS .
HUH .
SO WE ENDED UP UH WITH THESE GUNS .
UHHUH .
AND MY REALLY MY ONLY EXPERIENCE WITH A GUN WAS SHOOTING A PISTOL AND NOT KNOWING HOW TO HOLD IT RIGHT AND THE HAMMER CAME BACK AND HIT ME IN THE THUMB AND BLOOD SQUIRTED EVERYWHERE .
OH JEEZ .
AND SO THAT WAS REALLY THE ONLY EXPERIENCE THAT I VE HAD WITH GUNS AND IT .
RIGHT .
IT .
KIND OF SCARED ME .
UHHUH .
BUT I THINK THAT IF I LEARN HOW TO USE ONE I WOULD I WOULD FEEL BETTER .
RIGHT .
I VE ALSO ALWAYS THOUGHT ABOUT THE IDEA YOU KNOW MOST SPORTS YOU KNOW WHICH ARE THE N R .
A AND PEOPLE HAVE THEIR THING YOU KNOW IF YOU BAN GUNS YOU RE JUST BANNING THE THE RECREATION THE SPORT OF HUNTING THINGS OF THAT NATURE .
MOST OF THAT S DONE WITH RIFLES AND SUCH .
UH THOUGH THERE S YOU KNOW PROBABLY I M SURE SOME SECTOR .
THAT DOES IT WITH HANDGUNS .
BUT JUST BY THE MERE FACT OF OUTLAWING HANDGUNS WOULD MAKE IT SO THAT IT WOULD BE NOT AS CONSPICUOUS YOU COULD NT BE INCONSPICUOUS .
YEAH .
WHEN YOU WALKED INTO A STORE STUFF LIKE THAT YOU COULD SEE SOMEONE COMING OR DRESSED INAPPROPRIATELY YOU KNOW YOU IF THEY HAD TO HAVE A RIFLE OR WAS YOU KNOW MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO GET A A UH A HANDGUN .
NOW OF COURSE YOU KNOW IN THIS WORLD ANYTIME YOU VE FREEDOM .
YOU CAN BE ABLE TO GET ANYTHING .
YOU WANT .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
BUT I GUESS TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE PERSON .
WHO S JUST SO IRATE AND UPSET AND YOU KNOW TEMPORARILY A LITTLE BIT UH OFFSET OR OFF KEEL I DO NT KNOW IF THAT S A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF UH CRIME OR NOT BUT I GUESS IT WOULD BE SOME .
BUT I I THINK DEFINITELY LIKE TODAY .
THEY JUST INTRODUCED THE WHAT S CALLED THE BRADY BILL .
THE SEVEN DAY MANDATORY WAITING PERIOD .
UHHUH .
ON GETTING ANY GUNS .
AND I THINK THAT .
I WOULD DEFINITELY SUPPORT THAT .
SHOOT THAT S A GOOD IDEA .
YEAH .
I I I AGREE THE THING .
THAT SCARES ME UH THOUGH ABOUT WHERE I WOULD I WOULD WA DEFINITELY WANT SOME SORT OF LEGISLATION AND COMING FROM THE NORTH EAST I M JUST NOT USED TO SEEING UM THESE AND I I KNOW THIS MAY SOUND KIND OF STEREO TYPICAL BUT THE COWBOYS WITH THE GUN RACKS IN THE BACK OF THEIR TRUCKS .
OH SURE .
THAT S KIND OF SCARY TO ME THAT KIND OF TO ME .
IT IS MORE LIKE VIGILANTISM .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND IT .
KIND OF SCARES .
ME ESPECIALLY WITH ALL THE SHOOTINGS .
THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON .
RIGHT .
IN L .
A ON THE FREEWAYS .
YEAH THAT S CRAZY .
AND THEN YOU COME HERE IN IN THE DALLAS AREA UM I DO NT I DO NT BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CARRY GUNS IN THEIR VEHICLES .
YEAH THAT S KIND OF KIND OF WILD .
UM ESPECIALLY NOT IN THE BACK WINDOW .
UHHUH .
FOR EVERYBODY TO SEE .

OH ALL THE TIME .
DO YOU WATCH CHEERS OR .
OH YEAH OH YEAH .
THERE S THERE S IT S AT THAT WAS ACTUALLY A BIG DILEMMA FOR ME NOW BECAUSE UM CHEERS CHEERS AND TWIN PEAKS ARE NOW ON THE SAME TIME .
WELL BRENT I VE BEEN UM I KIND OF GAVE UP MY CAREER ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO TO STAY HOME WITH MY CHILDREN BECAUSE I THOUGHT UH IF IT IT S ONLY GOING TO BE ANOTHER YEAR UNTIL THE YOUNGEST IS IN SCHOOL .
RIGHT .
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD SACRIFICE TO MAKE .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE UM IT WAS IMPORTANT TO ME TO TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH KIDS I KNOW THAT WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL AND GETTING MY DEGREE AT THE SAME TIME MY HUSBAND WAS IT WAS REALLY HARD ON OUR FAMILY BECAUSE I WOULD HE WOULD COME HOME AND I WOULD LEAVE .
RIGHT .
AND THEN WHEN I WOULD COME HOME AND HE WOULD LEAVE AND UM SO I THINK ONE DAY ONE OF OUR KIDS SAID YOU KNOW SOMEONE CAME HOME AND THEY SAID WELL WHEN IS DAD LEAVING OR SOMETHING IT WAS LIKE THAT THEY THOUGHT THAT S THE WAY LIFE WAS .
UHHUH .
THAT YOU DID NT HAVE TWO PARENTS AT HOME AT THE SAME TIME AND SO I THINK UM IT S BECOME REAL IMPORTANT TO ME THAT WE TRY TO SPEND TIME TOGETHER AS A FAMILY SO THERE S ONE OR TWO NIGHTS A WEEK WE HAVE A ON MONDAY NIGHTS WE SET ASIDE TIME WHERE IT S CALLED UH FAMILY HOME EVENING AND WE STAY HOME THAT EVENING ALL OF US AND WE DO THINGS TOGETHER .
UHHUH YOU MUST BE A MUMBLEX .
YES .
SO AM I .
OH YOU ARE .
YES WHAT A COINCIDENCE .
YES AND .
YEAH I KNOW WHAT FAMILY HOME EVENING S ALL ABOUT .
SO YOU DO THAT AND RIGHT AND THEN WE TRY TO DO A FAMILY ACTIVITY ON SATURDAY .
UHHUH .
USUALLY IN THE MORNING .
RIGHT AND THEN THE FAMILY HOME EVENING TOO .
RIGHT AND THEN YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WE TRY TO DO OUR LESSON ON SUNDAY NIGHT AND THEN OUR ACTIVITY OR SOMETHING ON MONDAY BUT .
RIGHT .
WE RE IT S REAL IMPORTANT TO US TO SPEND TIME TOGETHER .
WELL THAT S GOOD UM HOW MANY CHILDREN DO YOU HAVE .
I HAVE TWO .
TWO .
UHHUH .
WHAT WHAT DO YOU HAVE .
I HAVE A GIRL AND A BOY AND THE BOY S FIVE HE S IN KINDERGARTEN AND THE GIRL IS FOUR SHE LL BE IN KINDERGARTEN NEXT YEAR .
FIVE AND FOUR .
UHHUH .
I HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS .
UHHUH .
MY OLDEST IS UH FOUR AND MY YOUNGEST IS ABOUT TO TURN THREE .
UH .
TWO GIRLS .
UHHUH .
AND THEY ARE A HANDFUL .
THEY ARE A HANDFUL .
YES WE VE MY UH WELL WHEN WE FIRST GOT MARRIED MY WIFE WORKED FOR A YEAR THEN WE DECIDED TO HAVE KIDS .
UHHUH .
AND UH SHE SHE GOT PREGNANT AND THEN WE DECIDED SHE WOULD STAY HOME WITH THE KIDS WE WOULD MAKE THAT SACRIFICE IT IS A FINANCIAL SACRIFICE TO MAKE BECAUSE WE GO FROM TWO INCOMES DOWN TO ONE .
UHHUH .
AND UH WE MADE THAT DECISION AND UH SO SH AFTER SHE HAD THE FIRST BABY SHE STAYED HOME AND AND WE HAD A SECOND BABY AND SHE S STILL AT HOME .
YES .
AND SO UH YOU KNOW AT WORK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE YOU KNOW I THINK WELL THIS IS NOT A NORMAL SITUATION ANYMORE IN OUR IN OUR WORLD WE LIVE IN MOST OF THEM UH CONTINUE TO WORK IF THEY HAVE HAVE KIDS .
UHHUH .
I ONLY HAVE ONE OTHER PERSON I KNOW IN MY IN MY GROUP HERE THAT WORKS WHERE THE WIFE STAYS HOME AND THAT S BECAUSE OF RELIGIOUS VALUES AS WELL THEY RE BAPTISTS AND THEY AND THEY THINK THAT S IMPORTANT .
UHHUH .
BUT EVERYBODY ELSE WORKS AND THEY DROP THEIR KIDS OFF AT DAYCARE AND AND LEAVE THEM AND I DO NT KNOW I JUST DO NT WANT I JUST DO NT WANT STRANGERS RAISING MY CHILDREN .
WELL NO AND IT S IT S JUST NOT UM IT S NOT AS STABLE FOR THE KIDS .
RIGHT .
AND THEY EVERYBODY DECIDED TO COME OVER AND TALK TO ME RIGHT NOW BUT UH IT S YEAH .
THAT S HOW IT IS AT OUR HOUSE WHEN YOU RE ON THE PHONE OH IT S OPEN ANYTHING GOES WHEN MOM S ON THE PHONE .
WELL IT S ALSO IMPORTANT I THINK UM FOR MY HUSBAND I I TRY TO GO OUT OF MY WAY TO TO PLAN THINGS THAT HE CAN DO WITH THE KIDS BECAUSE .
UHHUH .
SINCE I AM HOME WITH THEM AND SO I GET A LOT OF TIME WITH THEM HE NEEDS TO HAVE UM SOME TIME WITH THEM SO HE WHEN HE COMES HOME HE UM YOU KNOW IT S HIS JOB AT NIGHT HE PUTS THE KIDS TO BED .
RIGHT .
AND HE READS TO THEM .
RIGHT .
AND HE SPENDS ABOUT AN HOUR DOING THAT AND THAT S THAT S PRETTY GOOD QUALITY TIME .
RIGHT .
WITH THEM AND UM BUT IT S HARD FOR HIM ON SATURDAYS HE HE WANTS .
WITH ALL THE YARD WORK AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
RIGHT HE WANTS TO RUN OUT AND GET THINGS DONE AND SO UM I TRY TO SAY WELL WHY DO NT YOU GO FLY KITES OR WHY DO NT YOU .
UHHUH .
DO SOMETHING AND IF I HAVE SOMETHING IN MIND THEN HE HE REMEMBERS THAT .
UHHUH .
THAT S WHAT HE WANTS TO DO .
RIGHT WE FEEL THAT YOU KNOW JUST SPENDING TIME TOGETHER YOU DO NT NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE DOING ANYTHING YOU KNOW THAT COSTS MONEY OR OR YOU KNOW THAT REQUIRES YOU TO GO A GREAT DISTANCE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT IT S JUST THE KIDS LIKE TO BEING TOGETHER AS A FAMILY .
UHHUH .
LIKE LAST SATURDAY WE WENT HAD SOME ERRANDS TO RUN AND SO WE TOOK THE KIDS AND AND WENT BY THE FARMERS MARKET DOWN IN IN DOWN THERE IN GARLAND .
UHHUH .
AND THEY HAD A BLAST RUNNING AROUND THE FARMERS MARKET LOOKING AT ALL THE YOU KNOW .
THE FOOD AND TASTING ALL THE FREE SAMPLES THEY WERE GIVING OUT AND THEY HAD A LITTLE PEN THERE WITH ANIMALS IN THEY COULD PET YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
AND THEY LIKED THAT AND THEN ON THE WAY HOME WE DROVE BY THE LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL AND THERE HAPPENED TO BE AN F A F A A FUTURE FAR F A FUTURE FARMERS OF AMERICA F F A .
YES .
GOING ON THERE AND THEY HAD ALL KINDS OF PIGS AND HORSES AND GOATS AND SHEEP AND EVERYTHING YOU KNOW ALL OUT IN THIS IN THE IN THIS SCHOOLYARD THERE SO WE JUST SAID HEY LET S STOP AND .
UHHUH .
AND THE KIDS GOT TO GO AROUND AND YOU KNOW SEE PIGS AND ANIMALS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND AND FOR THEM THAT S WONDERFUL YOU KNOW THEY THEY THOUGHT IT WAS THE GREATEST FUN YOU KNOW AND IT DID NT COST ANY MONEY AND UH YOU DO NT HAVE QUITE AS MUCH MONEY WHEN WHEN THE WIFE DOES NT WORK .
WELL THAT S RIGHT BUT I DO THINK UM YOU KNOW LIKE THE CURRENT TRENDS ARE THAT UM THE FAMILY UNIT IS DEVALUATED IT S NOT .
RIGHT .
NEARLY AS IMPORTANT WE FIND THAT YOU KNOW BACK JUST EVEN FIFTY YEARS AGO WHEN PEOPLE HAD FINANCIAL PROBLEMS THE FIRST PLACE THEY WENT TO WAS THEIR FAMILY .
UHHUH .
AND FAMILIES TOOK CARE OF THEMSELVES AND UM BUT NOW YOU KNOW PEOPLE DO NT THEY DO NT .
RIGHT .
SUPPORT EACH OTHER THAT WAY .
RIGHT OH DEFINITELY MOTHERHOOD IS DEVALUED IN THIS S SOCIETY IF YOU RE STAY AT HOME AND YOU RE A MOTHER IT S LIKE WHAT A WASTE .
UHHUH .
PEOPLE THINK YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD BE FULFILLING YOURSELF AND AND A MOTHER IS NT AN IMPORTANT .
THAT S RIGHT AND .
IMPORTANT THING AS AS HAVING A CAREER AND AND THAT SHOULD BE FIRST AND AND CHILDREN SECOND BUT THEY DO NT HAVE KIND OF AN WHAT WE CALL AN INTERNAL PERSPECTIVE OF THINGS .
RIGHT RIGHT .
BUT THAT .
AND IT S NOT AN EASY SACRIFICE FOR A PERSON TO MAKE .
NO .
BECAUSE YOU KNOW I YOU KNOW I HAVE INTERESTS THAT .
RIGHT .
TOO AND IT IS HARD TO MAKE UH THOSE INTERESTS NOT BE AS A MAJOR PART OF MY LIFE .
UH AT THIS POINT .
UHHUH .
IT S NOT TO SAY THAT SOME DAY YOU WO NT GO BACK TO WORK MY MOTHER S A SCHOOL TEACHER AND WHEN WHEN WE STARTED UH HAVING KIDS SHE HAD TO WORK FOR A LITTLE WHILE BUT THEN SHE JUST STARTED SUBSTITUTING .
UHHUH .
SO SHE WOULD JUST SUBSTITUTE ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK YOU KNOW JUST FOR THAT LITTLE EXTRA MONEY WHEN WE WERE IN SCHOOL THEN WE WOULD JUST COME HOME AND JUST BE YOU KNOW GO TO A NEIGHBOR S HOUSE FOR AN HOUR THEN SHE D BE HOME BUT SHE WOULD NT DO THAT EVERY DAY .
RIGHT .
BUT NOW THAT MY MY UH YOUNGEST SISTER S AT B Y U NOW AND SO THEY HAVE NO ONE AT HOME SHE S BACK TEACHING SCHOOL FULL TIME NOW AGAIN SO IF YOU KNOW IT S NOT IT S JUST A TEMPORARY THING .
IT IS TEMPORARY IT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT IT SEEMS LIKE A LONG TIME .
UHHUH .
BUT YOU RE RIGHT IT IS TEMPORARY WELL I SEE THAT WE BOTH SHARE THE SAME BELIEF HERE THAT .
YEAH .
IT S IMPORTANT THAT WE SPEND TIME WITH OUR KIDS AND .
YEAH .
AND IN SPITE OF .
YEAH YOU IT S IT S HARD SOMETIMES AT WORK BECAUSE YOU KNOW PEOPLE SAY OH WE RE TAKING A CRUISE WE RE GOING HERE WE RE GOING THERE YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LOT MORE MONEY AND A LOT OF THEM DECIDE JUST NOT TO HAVE CHILDREN .
YES .
IT S IT S AMAZING THEY EITHER HAVE ONE OR NONE .
THAT S TRUE .
AND AND THE ONE PERSON I KNOW THAT HAS ONE THEY THEY FEEL GUILTY SHE HAS THIS CONTINUAL GUILT TRIP THAT SHE S NOT DOING THE RIGHT THING AND SO ON UH ON WEEKENDS SHE WOULD YOU KNOW SPEND ALL OF HER TIME WITH HER KIDS AND SPEND LOTS OF LOTS AND LOTS OF MONEY BASICALLY I THINK THEY THEY REALLY SPOIL THE CHILD .
UHHUH .
TO TRY TO OVERCOMPENSATE FOR THEIR GUILT FEELINGS AND AND AND THEY DO NT WANT TO HAVE ANYMORE CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY JUST DO NT THINK YOU KNOW THAT SHE DOES NT THINK SHE COULD BE A MOTHER AT HOME THAT S NOT HER BAG SO SHE JUST DOES NT THINK THAT SHE COULD YOU KNOW THE GUILT FEELINGS SHE CA NT DEAL WITH .
YEAH .
WITH IT ANYMORE SO .
WELL IT IS .
YOU KNOW .
THE HARDEST THING I VE EVER DONE AS MUCH AS YOU D GO OUT AND .
UHHUH YEAH MY WIFE UH LIKES STAYING HOME .
UHHUH .
UH SHE WORKS AT HOME SOME THOUGH .
UHHUH .
THE PLACE SHE WORKS WITH WORKED WITH BEFORE UM WORKED OUT AN ARRANGEMENT WITH HER WHERE SHE CAN WORK AT HOME .
WELL THAT S GOOD .
PART TIME AND SO UH THAT IT S KIND OF A SEASONAL THING THREE TIMES A YEAR SHE S REALLY BUSY DOING CERTAIN THINGS .
UHHUH .
BASED ON THAT KIND OF BUSINESS BUT THE REST OF THE TIME SHE S FREE SHE LIKES TO SEW AND DO CRAFTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO SHE ENJOYS STAYING AT HOME BUT UH THE MONEY PART OF IT IS NOT AS REWARDING OBVIOUSLY BUT .
NO .
THERE S DIFFERENT REWARDS YOU KNOW DIFFERENT KINDS OF REWARDS .
YEAH I THINK SO I THINK IT S AN INVESTMENT IN YOUR FUTURE EVEN IF IT S PURELY NOT NOT RELIGIOUS YOU CAN AT LEAST SAY THAT IT S IMPORTANT TO OUR COUNTRY .
RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT .
THAT OUR FAMILY UNIT STAYS STRONG .
AND YOU REALLY HAVE TO MAKE UH QUITE A BIT OF MONEY THE WIFE DOES NT MAKE IT WORTH IT WITH THE COST OF DAYCARE .
YES .
I KNOW THERE S YOU KNOW WHEN YOU ADJUST YOUR INCOME FOR WHAT YOU PUT OUT FOR DAYCARE YOU KNOW YOU RE ONLY MAKING LIKE FIVE .

WE WE TOOK A LOT OF VACATIONS WHILE WE WERE THERE BECAUSE EVERYTHING WAS WITHIN DRIVING DISTANCE .
NOW THERE S A PLACE .
I D LIKE TO VISIT .
SO WE WE .
TRAVELLED ALL .
OVER EUROPE .
OH THAT S NEAT .
WHEN I WAS WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG .
UNFORTUNATELY A A LITTLE BIT TOO YOUNG TO REALLY APPRECIATE .
UHHUH .
UH I WAS GRADE SCHOOL AGE .
UH .
MY HUS MY HUSBAND HAD A BICYCLE TOUR OF EUROPE OR TOOK A BICYCLE TOUR ABOUT FIVE MONTHS RIGHT AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR AND SO WE VE SEEN LOTS OF PICTURES OF THE OF THE BEAUTIFUL .
UM .
SPOTS AND .
THAT .
AREAS Y .
THAT WOULD BE A TO ME A REALLY NICE VACATION .
YEAH .
BECAUSE I M I M NOT IN PHYSICAL SHAPE FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT UH I I SURE WOULD WORK ON IT .
IF I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE THAT .
YEAH THAT S NEAT NEAT .
WHAT KIND OF VACATIONS DO YOU LIKE .
UH WELL MY HUSBAND AND I ARE SCUBA DIVERS .
OH .
H .
SO WE .
BOTH LIKE TO GO TO DIVE RESORTS .
UH WE WENT TO HAWAII ON OUR HONEYMOON .
UHHUH .
AND WE DOVE THERE .
UH BUT WE WE DID ABOUT SIX DIVES WHILE WE WERE THERE .
AND UH WE WERE ORIGINALLY PLANNING ON GOING TO CAYMAN .
OH UHHUH .
UH LAST YEAR .
UHHUH .
UH BUT WE WERE NT ABLE TO GET ENOUGH PEOPLE TOGETHER FOR THE TRIP .
WE HAD TO HAVE LIKE ELEVEN PEOPLE FOR .
OH UHHUH .
THIS PACKAGE UH DEAL .
YEAH .
UH AND WE COULD NT GET ENOUGH PEOPLE TOGETHER UH TO GO SO IT ENDED UP FALLING A FALLING THROUGH .
YEAH .
WE WERE GOING TO GET A REALLY GOOD PRICE .
WHEN WHEN OUR CHILDREN WERE YOUNGER WE ENJOYED WE LIVED UP IN UH NEW YORK .
UHHUH .
OR NEW JERSEY AND AND USED TO LIKE UH TRAVELING INTO UPSTATE NEW YORK AND CAMPING .
UHHUH .
AND WE HAD A LITTLE COLLAPSIBLE SAILBOAT AND LIKED TO SAIL AND THAT SORT OF THING BUT WE VE NEVER REALLY UH DID ANY DIVING OR ANYTHING .
LITTLE BIT OF S OF UH UH OH .
SNORKELING .
S WATER SKIING .
OH REALLY .
BUT NOT MUCH OF UH .
UM .
OF ANYTHING ELSE .
UH .
WELL MY HUSBAND AND I .
BOTH LIKE WATER .
UHHUH .
SO ANY ANY VACATION THAT WE GO ON IS USUALLY .
IT .
S GOT TO BE THE WATER .
INVOLVES CLOSE TO THE OCEAN .
RIGHT .
OR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
WHEN WHEN WE WERE IN JERSEY WE USED TO GO DOWN TO THE JERSEY BEACH .
A LOT AND REALLY ENJOYED THAT A LOT .
IT S REALLY THEY HAD .
YEAH WE .
A REALLY NICE BEACH AREAS THERE .
AFTER WE MOVED AWAY FROM GERMANY WE MOVED TO NEW HAMPSHIRE .
UHHUH .
AND I LIVED THERE FOR SEVEN YEARS .
OH I SEE .
UH .
THAT S A REALLY PRETTY AREA TOO .
AND I REALLY ENJOYED THAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE MOUNTAINS WERE REAL CLOSE .
UHHUH .
WE LIKE THE WE LIKE THE WHITE MOUNTAINS AND .
YEAH .
UH UNFORTUNATELY I DID NT REALLY GET TO GO SKIING MUCH WHILE I WAS THERE .
I WENT SKIING ONCE .
YEAH WE LOVED THE WE LOVED THE THE NEW JERSEY AREA TOO BECAUSE THE .
THE LAKES WERE REALLY PRETTY CLOSE YOU KNOW YOU COULD .
UHHUH .
YOU COULD DRIVE WITHIN TWENTY MINUTES TO AN HOUR AND JUST BE AT A REAL NICE VACATION SPOT WHERE YOU COULD SAIL AND AND JUST REALLY AND THEN WE WERE NT TOO FOR FROM THE APPALACHIAN TRAIL WE DID QUITE A BIT OF HIKING WHICH IS KIND OF FUN .
ARE YOU .
A YOU .
A HIKER OR NOT .
UH .
NOT SO MUCH HUH .
NOT NOT REALLY SO MUCH .
IF IF IF THERE WAS SOME PLACE THAT THAT WE WENT TO WHERE THERE WAS HIKING INVOLVED I I WOULD BE YOU KNOW HAPPY TO GO HIKING .
UHHUH .
BUT WE WE NEVER HAVE REALLY PLANNED A VACATION AROUND UH PLACES TO GO HIKING .
SO YOUR YOUR NEXT YOUR PLANS ARE TRY TO FIND SOMEPLACE TO S SCUBA DIVE .
YEAH .
OUR NEXT VACATION WILL WILL BE SCUBA DIVING I M SURE .
YOU HAVE ANY CHILDREN .
NO NOT YET .
OKAY THEN THAT S PROBABLY ONE OF THE REASONS OUR WE HAD LITTLE CHILDREN ALL THE TIME .
YEAH .
SO SOME OF THE THINGS ARE NOT AS QUITE AS UH ADAPTABLE .
YEAH IT S A IT S A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT PLANNING A VACATION .
YEAH IT IS .
WHEN YOU HAVE HAVE CHILDREN .
YOU HAVE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT KINDS OF THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO THAT THEY WILL ENJOY TOO AND .
YEAH .
SO I THINK WHA .
YEAH AND DIVING IS SOMETHING THAT ESPECIALLY FOR SMALL CHILDREN UH I THINK THE THE MINIMUM AGE FOR DIVING IS .
YEAH .
IS PROBABLY LEGAL ANYWAY WOULD BE PROBABLY ABOUT SIXTEEN .
ELEVEN OR TWELVE I WOULD THINK PROBABLY BUT MAYBE FIFTEEN EVEN .
YEAH .
I KNOW THAT UH UH ONE OF ONE THING .
THAT HAPPENS TO US TO VACATION TRIPS NOW IS THAT USUALLY THAT TRY TO INVOLVE SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY .
YOU KNOW WE GO WHEREVER SOMEBODY IS .
UHHUH .
THAT WE HAVE NT SEEN FOR A WHILE .
SO THAT THAT S KIND OF UH WE JUST CAME BACK FROM UH UH GRAND RAPIDS WHERE WE SAW ONE OF OUR SONS GRADUATE .

WE HAVE A WE HAVE A A REUNION IN IN SALT LAKE AREA UP BY PARK CITIES .

I HATE THEM BECAUSE THEY RE HARD TO JOCKEY AROUND YOU KNOW BUT MAYBE A PICKUP WITH THE BACK ON .

SO YOU COULD KIND OF SLEEP IN IT SOMETIMES BUT YOU WOULD NT WANT TO DO IT .
ALL THE TIME .
YEAH .

I .
WE WE READ BRUCE MUMBLEX BOOK BEFORE WE WENT YOU KNOW AND SO WE WERE READY TO LOOK UP THE PLACES WE READ ABOUT .

YEAH .
AND THEN WHEN WE EVENTUALLY WHEN WE HAVE KIDS .

WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE IDEA OF UH KIDS HAVING TO DO PUBLIC SERVICE WORK FOR A YEAR DO YOU THINK IT S A .
WELL I I THINK IT S A PRETTY GOOD IDEA I THINK THEY SHOULD EITHER DO THAT OR OR AFFORD SOME TIME TO THE MILITARY OR OR HELPING ELDERLY PEOPLE .
YES YES DEF .
I I YOU KNOW I THINK THAT WE HAVE A BUNCH OF ELDERLY FOLKS IN THE COUNTRY THAT COULD USE SOME HELP AND I THINK THAT BEFORE WE EXPEND ALL OUR YOUNG TALENT OVERSEAS AND AND HELPING OTHER COUNTRIES WE OUGHT TO PERHAPS GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF OUR HELP TO OUR OWN FOLKS AT HOME AND .
THAT S TRUE .
I M NOT SURE THAT THAT S NOT A BAD IDEA AND OR THE MILITARY FOR A YEAR OR TWO .
YEAH .
WOULD NT BE BAD FOR I THINK IT TEACHES KIDS HOW TO GROW HOW ABOUT YOURSELF .
UH I AGREE WITH YOU UH UH WHAT I M THINKING ABOUT IS BACK WELL WHEN I WAS A KID AND MUCH EARLIER THAN THAT KIDS WERE KIND OF I I YOU KNOW THE PARENTS KIND OF PUSHED THEM TO JOIN LIKE THE BOY SCOUTS OR GIRL SCOUTS AND THEY DID DO DO DO A LOT OF PUBLIC SERVICE ACTIVITIES BUT THESE DAYS THEY RE NOT UH PAR PARENTS ARE NT ENCOURAGING THEIR KIDS TO DO THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE WHEN I WAS IN THE GIRL SCOUTS WE DID A LOT OF PUBLIC SERVICE THINGS BECAUSE THAT S JUST PART O OF OF THE SCOUTING AND YOU KNOW .
YEAH I VE I VE THAT S REALLY GREAT I I REALLY THINK THAT BOTH THE BOY SCOUTS AND GIRL SCOUTS IS A EXCELLENT TWO EXCELLENT ORGANIZATIONS .
THEY ARE BUT PARENTS .
YOU KNOW KIDS SEEM LIKE WHEN THEY GET TEN OR TWELVE YEARS OLD THEY FALL OUT OF THAT .
YEAH THEY DO .
AND THEY DO NT FOLLOW IT AT ALL YOU KNOW THERE ARE VERY FEW SCOUTS GO ON .
OH NO .
AND BECOME EAGLE SCOUTS AND AND I DO NT KNOW WHAT THE HIGH RANK IS FOR THE GALS BUT .
I I UH SENIOR .
OH SENIOR OKAY SO THERE S NOT UH .
OH THEY RE JUST NOT ONCE THEY GET INTO JUNIOR HIGH IT JUST .
YEAH THEY THEY LOSE INTEREST .
NOT DONE ANYMORE .
AND THEN WHEN THEY YOUNG YOUNG ADULTS .
UHHUH .
THERE S EVEN LESS INTEREST THERE THEY RE MORE FOR I G .
ME .
NOT NOT YEAH .
GRAB GRAB GRAB WALK OUT .
YEAH YOU RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT .
YEAH .
I THINK IT S A REALLY A GOOD THING I I LIKE TO SEE OF COURSE THERE S YOU KNOW THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES THAT CAN USE ALL KIND OF HELP .
YEAH BUT THERE S A LOT THAT CAN BE DONE RIGHT HERE IN THIS COUNTRY .
BUT I THINK .
TOO .
WE OUGHT TO START RIGHT HERE AT HOME I M YOU KNOW .
YEAH UH I M NOT I M NOT SO SURE THAT OVERSEAS HELP HELPING OVERSEAS WOULD BE SUCH A HOT IDEA FOR FOR UH A LOT OF YOUNG K PEOPLE .
NO IT IT .
BUT SINCE THERE IS MUCH THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE HERE .
I THINK THAT YEAH I THINK THAT WE NEED TO REALLY ADDRESS WHAT WE VE DONE HERE AND AND THEN PERHAPS EVEN A SIX MONTH TOUR OVERSEAS THAT GIVES THEM MUCH BROADER OUTLOOK .
UHHUH .
WELL IT S BEEN REALLY GOOD WE TALKED ABOUT THIS FOR A FEW MINUTES AND UH HOPEFULLY WE LL HAVE OTHER GOOD TOPIC MAYBE ANOTHER CALL SOMEDAY BUT I I DO NT REALLY HAVE TOO MUCH MORE TO SAY ON THIS TOPIC I GUESS .

DURING PERCH SEASON AS WELL YOU PULL UP A LOT OF UH PROBABLY DURING DURING PERCH SEASON THE PERCH WILL RUN IN VERY LARGE SCHOOLS SO WHAT THEY LL DO IS J YOU LL YOU LL BE SORT OF BOATING AROUND THESE PEOPLE OWN A LITTLE ROW BOAT AND THEY LL BE BOATING AROUND AND THEY LL HIT A THEY LL HIT A SCHOOL OF PERCHES IN THE MIDDLE .

I KNOW THEY HAVE A WAITING LIST AND A QUOTA ON IMMIGRATION NOW .
I VE LOST TRACK I DO NT REALLY KNOW I I DO HAVE SOME OPINIONS BUT GO AHEAD .
YEAH UM WELL I KNOW THAT THEY RE THEY RE REAL CAUTIOUS ABOUT LETTING MIDDLE EASTERN PEOPLE INTO THE COUNTRY NOW BECAUSE OF ALL THE TERRORISM WHAT .
UH .
WHAT .
OKAY I HAD NT THOUGHT ABOUT THAT UH .
WHAT ALL DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT .
UH WELL I JUST HAVE AN OPINION NOW I DID NT THINK I THOUGHT THE TERRORISM THING WAS OVERSTATED I MEAN .
THERE WAS NOTHING OVER HERE IN FACT EVEN THIS IS NOT OUR SUBJECT I GUESS BUT UH MAYBE IT IS OR IS NT I SUPPOSE .
YEAH .
MY WIFE WHEN SHE TALKED ABOUT THE MIDDLE EAST AND EVERYONE S AFRAID YOU KNOW OF HOW THE WAR WAS GOING TO GO AND EVERYTHING I SAID I TOLD HER NO IT S JUST NOT GOING TO HAPPEN THERE S NOT GOING TO BE ANY TERRORISM OVER HIM AND THERE WAS NT YOU KNOW THEY JUST DID NT HAVE AN ORGANIZATION BUT UH I I I M CONCERNED THAT WE RE LETTING TOO MANY THAT WE DO NT HAVE ENOUGH CONTROLS I THINK THAT UH THE ASIAN GANGSTERS THAT WE VE LET IN HERE AND IF .
UHHUH .
AND THE GUYS FROM UH CUBA YOU KNOW THERE S A LOT OF CRIMINALS DOWN IN FLORIDA THAT WE VE LET IN FROM CUBA THAT FIDEL PUSHED OFF ON US AND UH AND THE LAST YOU KNOW OUT OF ALL THE ASIANS WE BROUGHT IN THERE S A TREMENDOUS CRIMINAL ELEMENT THAT WE LET IN FROM FROM ASIA AND I THINK THAT .
THAT S RIGHT .
THERE S GOT TO BE SOME SORT OF CONTROLS OVER THAT I MEAN THIS ASIA MAFIA THING IS GETTING OUT OF HAND .
UHHUH .
I DO NT I DO NT I DID NT KNOW WHAT I DO NT EVEN KNOW WHAT OUR CONTROLS ARE I DO NT EVEN KNOW WHAT UH IF WE HAVE ANY GUIDELINES AT ALL UH ON IMMIGRATION UM I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT WE DID BUT I DO NT I DO NT I DO NT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE RIGHT NOW .
THERE I DO NT THINK THERE S MUCH OF MUCH OF ONE BECAUSE I M SURE ALL THE PEOPLE FROM CUBA HAVE BEEN RELEASED FROM THAT CAMP THAT THEY WERE IN .
YEAH .
AND UH MOST OF THEM IT S JUST LIKE AUSTRALIA MOST OF THEM WERE CRIMINALS FROM CUBA .
YEAH .
AND I THINK THAT WAS JUST AN ATTEMPT THAT THAT FIDEL CASTRO TO UNDERMINE YOU KNOW .
YEAH THE .
THE UNITED STATES TO SOME EXTENT SO HE JUST RELEASED AND GOT RID OF ALL HIS CRIMINALS AND SENT THEM TO US .
YEAH .
AND IT S ALMOST THE SAME THING IN IN UH FROM ASIA BECAUSE .
BECAUSE WE .
A LOT A LOT OF THEM WAS PUT OUT OF BUSINESS IN VIETNAM AFTER THE WAR AND .
I I DO HAVE SOME SYMPATHY WITH UH YOU KNOW OF COURSE WE HAVE THIS BIG MEXICAN PROBLEM NOT A PROBLEM BUT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING WITH UH THE IMMIGRATION OF BACK AND A FORTH ACROSS MEXICO UH .
UHHUH .
I I M SYMPATHETIC I DO NT KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS I GUESS I M SYMPATHETIC CERTAINLY WITH THAT THAT THAT THEY WANT TO COME OVER HERE AND THEY I GUESS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS COME OVER EVERY YEAR TO WORK AND IF IF THEY HAVE JOBS YOU KNOW I HEAR THE STORY THAT THEY RE TAKING AWAY AMERICAN JOBS BUT I DO NT KNOW UH I DO NT KNOW HOW MANY AMERICAN JOBS THEY ARE REALLY TAKING AWAY .
RIGHT .
SO I I M SYMPATHETIC BUT I DO NT HAVE AN ANSWER I DO NT .
UHHUH .
UH I THINK THAT WE SHOULD HAVE GOOD RELATIONS WITH WITH MEXICO BUT THAT S NOT REALLY EXACTLY IMMIGRATION IT IS AND IT IS NT I DO NT KNOW TO WHAT DEGREE WE OWE THE PEOPLE WHO COME ACROSS BEFORE THEY RE CITIZENS OWE THE CHILDREN EDUCATION AND ALL THAT UH ALTHOUGH THE IDEA OF EDUCATION IS AN ANSWER TO A LOT OF PROBLEMS IN THE WORLD SO .
UHHUH .
I GUESS IT S WHAT THEY THEIR THE MEXICAN KIDS GET A GOOD EDUCATION ALONG THE WAY AND MAYBE THAT S A BENEFIT TO EVERYBODY YOU KNOW .
YEAH AND A LOT OF THE MEXICAN PEOPLE JUST CROSS THE BORDER DURING THE DAYTIME TO COME OVER HERE AND WORK .
UHHUH .
AND THEY HAVE GREEN CARDS AND UH THEN LIKE YOU SAID A LOT OF I RUN INTO PEOPLE EVERY DAY THAT CA NT SPEAK ENGLISH .
OH YEAH .
AND UH AND AND MOST OF THEM YOU KNOW ARE WORKING IN JANITORIAL POSITIONS SO .
YEAH AND THAT .
SO I I DO NT KNOW LIKE YOU SAID I DO NT KNOW HOW MUCH HOW MUCH THEY RE TAKING FROM THE WORK FORCE YOU KNOW .
YEAH I NEVER THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE MUCH I DO CRINGE WHEN I HEAR SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WE VE HAD .
UHHUH .
UM UH OF COURSE YOU MENTIONED THE LANGUAGE I FEEL SO BAD THAT WE HERE IN TEXAS OR CERTAINLY THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE UNITED STATES UH CALIFORNIA TEXAS AND ALL THAT WHY OUR KIDS DO NT SPEAK FLUID SPANISH UH BY JUNIOR HIGH YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
AS WELL AS US YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
SO THAT WE COULD WOULD NT HAVE THE LANGUAGE BARRIER CERTAINLY THAT THAT THAT IS A SHAME THAT WE HAVE THIS TREMENDOUS BORDER OF MEXICO AND THEN IN EUROPE YOU KNOW THEY SPEAK THEIR FRENCH AND ALL AND THEY TRY THEY GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO TRY TO SPEAK THEIR NEIGHBOR S LANGUAGE SO THEY CAN UNDERSTAND WE WE CERT WE DO NT REALLY EVEN MAKE AN EFFORT .
UHHUH .
TO SPEAK SPANISH AND I FEEL BAD ABOUT THAT GO AHEAD .
WELL THAT S I YEAH I TOOK SPANISH IN SCHOOL AND THAT S YOU KNOW ONE REASON THAT I DID IT .
YEAH .
IS BECAUSE BECAUSE WHENEVER YOU TRAVEL ANYWHERE NEAR THE BORDER YOU KNOW THERE MORE AND MORE PEOPLE SPEAK SPANISH .
YEAH I GUESS IT S NEVER TOO LATE I I DO HAVE SOME SPANISH BOOKS AND I VE ALWAYS UH EVERY YEAR I SAY I M GOING TO TRY TO SPEAK SOME NEWCOMERS LANGUAGE YOU KNOW I DO NT KNOW IF IT S COSTING US ANY MONEY OR HOW MUCH MONEY THEY RE PUTTING INTO IT UH THAT S ALWAYS A FACTOR I MEAN HOW MUCH MY WIFE SAYS HOW MUCH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS PUTTING INTO IT .
WELL .
IMMIGRATION .
YEAH WELL IT S BASICALLY ON THE WELL I THINK IT S MOSTLY CONCENTRATED TOWARD THE BORDERS AND UH IT S MORE UM THE IMMIGRATION IS TIED IN WITH UH DRUG TRAFFICKING SO THEY HAVE TO WATCH OUT WHO COMES IN AND AND THEY RE ALWAYS FINDING DRUGS ON YOU KNOW ON THE MOST UM INNOCENT LOOKING KIND OF .
YEAH .
I FORGOT WHAT THEY FOUND BUT A DOG FOUND IT THE OTHER DAY YOU KNOW .
OH YEAH .
ON THE BORDER .
OH YEAH I I I THINK THAT CERTAINLY IS A PROBLEM I GUESS OUR IMMIGRATION HISTORY THAT S A GREAT SUBJECT THEY UH DID NT SAY TO TALK ABOUT THAT BUT THAT IS I MEAN ON ELLIS ISLAND THEY YOU KNOW THEY RE REDOING THAT AND GOING TO MAKE IT A MUSEUM A NATIONAL MUSEUM .
UHHUH .
THAT CERTAINLY WAS INTERESTING SINCE ALL OF US HAD UH ANCESTORS THAT CAME OVER THAT WAY OR NOT ALL BUT I GUESS I GUESS IF YOU GO BACK FAR ENOUGH YOU CAME OVER ON A BOAT ORIGINALLY YOU KNOW BUT UH A LOT OF US HAVE PARENTS GRANDPARENTS MY GRANDPARENTS CAME OVER IN ABOUT EIGHTEEN NINETY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND I M SURE THEY CAME OVER YOU KNOW THROUGH ELLIS ISLAND YOU KNOW .
THAT S RIGHT WELL .
SO WE ALL IMMIGRANTS ONE WAY OR ANOTHER WELL WE CERTAINLY ARE COMING FROM EUROPE .
YEAH AND ONE OF THE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY GETS TO ME UH ABOUT THE MEXICANS IS THAT UM ONCE THEY HAVE CHILDREN OVER HERE THEIR CHILDREN ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS THEN .
OH YEAH THOSE WERE LAWS ARE UNUSUAL .
YEAH AND THEN THEY LL SHIP THE PARENTS BACK AND THAT LEAVES THE CHILDREN WITHOUT ANY PARENTS SO .
YEAH BUT I DO NT UNDERSTAND WHOSE RULE IS THAT YOU KNOW .
AND THEY YOU KNOW AND AND THEY JUST FOLLOW THE RULE NO MATTER YOU KNOW SO THAT DOES NT SEEM FAIR TO THE CHILDREN .
YEAH SOMETIMES COMMON SENSE SHOULD TAKE OVER RATHER THAN YEAH THAT S A LAW DOES NT SOUND LIKE IT MAKES ANY SENSE AT ALL .
RIGHT .
THAT YOU WOULD DO IT THAT WAY .
UHHUH .
YOU WOULD THINK THEY COULD AT LEAST GET A A A VISA OR SOMETHING UNTIL THEY UH GET CITIZENSHIP I M SURE THEY WANT TO .
YEAH AND THEN THEY GRANTED THEM AMNESTY IF THEY COULD PROVE WHEN WAS THAT IT WAS IN THE EIGHTIES SOME TIME .
OH YEAH .
IF THEY COULD PROVE THEY D BEEN HERE FIVE YEARS .
I HEARD SOMETHING ABOUT THAT YEAH .
AND UH A LOT OF THEM HAD BEEN YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
SOME OF THEM SOME OF THEM MOVED BACK AND FORTH BUT .
YEAH .
UH MOST OF THEM DO NT EVER WANT TO GO BACK TO MEXICO ESPECIALLY .
OH NO .
THE WAY IT WAS THEN .
OH NO I I COULD SEE YOU COULD SEE WHY .
UHHUH .
I DO NT KNOW HOW MUCH IMMIGRATION WE HAVE FROM EUROPE AND EVERYTHING WHAT THE CONTROLS ARE .
I THINK MOST YOU KNOW LIKE ESPECIALLY THE CELEBRITIES AND EVERYTHING THEY JUST HAVE A UH WELL THEY HAVE TO GET A GREEN CARD IF THEY GOING TO DO ANY KIND OF WORK YOU KNOW IN MOVIES .
YEAH .
AND AND SUCH BUT MOST OF THEM HAVE TEMPORARY VISAS .
YEAH I GUESS YOU CAN GET WORK VISAS PRETTY EASILY UH .
AS LONG IT S LIKE WELL IT S A KIND OF A BAD A BAD BAD EXAMPLE BUT WHEN RAFAEL SEPTIEN TOOK THE JOB WITH THE COWBOYS .
YEAH .
THEY HAD TO OFFER HIS JOB TO ANY OTHER APPLICANT THAT COULD DO IT .
OH REALLY .
YEAH .
SO THAT YOU KNOW AND THAT S THE THING WITH THE JOBS .
YEAH .
AND OF COURSE NO ONE BEAT HIM OUT .
YEAH .
SO YOU KNOW HE JUST RUINED HIS OWN CAREER SO .
OH WELL YEAH .
YEAH .
YEAH WELL IT S STILL INTERESTING AFTER ALL THIS TIME THAT WE RE PROBABLY ONE OF THE ONE OF THE FEW COUNTRIES THAT PEOPLE ARE STILL DESPERATELY TRYING TO IMMIGRATE TO UH ALTHOUGH I GUESS EUROPE NOW THAT THE COMMUNISM IS FALLING APART THAT MAYBE THERE LL BE WO NT BE THAT MUCH OF A RUSH TO GET OUT OF ALL THE COMMUNIST COM COUNTRIES UH I GUESS POLAND NOW NOW IS NONCOMMUNIST SO .
UHHUH .
MAYBE NOT MAYBE IMMIGRATION FROM EUROPE TO HERE WILL S YOU KNOW SLOWLY UH CHANGE MAYBE IT LL BE EVEN OUT LIKE TRADE YOU KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE WILL IMMIGRATE HERE IN THE TWENTIETH AT THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND SO MANY OF THE PEOPLE WILL GO BACK OVERSEAS YOU KNOW MAYBE IT WILL AVERAGE OUT I DO NT KNOW .
YEAH I THINK SO .
IT DOES NT HAS DOES NT SEEM SO FAR .
BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER I J UH JOB OPPORTUNITIES .
IN EUROPE THAT THERE ARE NT HERE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW EVEN UM LIKE OR ORCHESTRA PLAYERS CAN FIND A JOB SOMETIMES IN EUROPE WHEN THEY CA NT FIND ONE HERE .
UHHUH .
AND I M A TRUMPET PLAYER .
ARE YOU A TEACHER .
UH NO I UH I DO NT ANY MORE I JUST WENT TO SCHOOL AND I WAS A MUSIC MAJOR FOR A WHILE .
OH REALLY YEAH .
BUT I HAD A TRUMPET TEACHER THAT PLAYED IN THE MEXICO CITY SYMPHONY SO .
YEAH .
SO HE HAD TO HAVE A WORK VISA THERE .
OH .
AND OF COURSE THEY HAD A LOT OF MUSICIANS FROM FROM OTHER COUNTRIES .
UHHUH .
AND UH IN THE MEXICO CITY SYMPHONY .
UHHUH .
BUT I THINK UM LIKE THREE OUT OF THE FOUR OTHER PEOPLE IN THE TRUMPET SECTION ARE FROM MEXICO NOW .
OH REALLY .
BUT I THINK THE CONDUCTOR I DO NT KNOW OR ONE OF THE CONDUCTORS IS IS FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY .
UHHUH .
IT S LIKE ANY OTHER SYMPHONY .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW AND THEN AND EDUARDO MANA S FROM MEXICO SO HE HAD TO .
OKAY UH LET S SEE I I BELIEVE IN THE TRIAL BY JURY .
I THINK IF IT WAS UP TO THE JUDGE ALONE THAT THERE WOULD BE REAL POSSIBLE FOR UH PAYOFFS YOU KNOW BRIBERIES UH UNFAIRNESS ONESIDEDNESS YOU KNOW ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS .
AND I ALSO LIKE THE UNANIMOUS DECISION BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO PERSUADE EVERYBODY TO BE A HUNDRED PERCENT ABSOLUTELY SURE BEFORE YOU CONVICT SOMEBODY .
I I REALLY AGREE WITH THE UH INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY THEORY .
I THINK THAT S THAT S A GOOD WAY TO DO IT .
THAT S ABOUT ALL .
WELL I THINK I THINK BASICALLY WE RE IN A LOT OF AGREEMENT UH IN THAT I CERTAINLY AGREE THAT FOR ANY CASE INVOLVING SERIOUS INJURY TO ANOTHER PERSON THEN MAYBE THAT NEEDS UH SOME KIND OF LEGAL DEFINITION .
UHHUH .
BUT FOR ANYTHING INVOLVING THAT TRIAL BY JURY CERTAINLY SHOULD BE MANDATORY .
UHHUH .
BUT THERE SHOULD BE WITH OUR OVERWORKED UH JUDICIAL SYSTEM IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE THERE OUGHT TO BE A MEANS OF OF UM NOT HAVING TO TAKE EVERYTHING BEFORE A FULL COURT .
YOU KNOW MAYBE THERE OUGHT TO BE SOME KIND OF OF UH MUMBLEX IS NT THERE A TYPE OF WORD CALLED A JURY DUTY NOW .
UHHUH .
REALLY .
AND MAYBE INSTEAD OF OF UH JUST KIND OF BLOWING IT OFF JUST SPEND A DAY OR A DAY AND A HALF LIKE MOST FOLKS DO MAYBE WE SHOULD COMMIT TO SPEND A WEEK AND DURING THAT WEEK .
YOU RE KIND OF AN AD .
HOC LET S HEAR ABOUT IT GROUP OF I DO NT KNOW TWENTYFIVE INSTEAD OF TWELVE .
UHHUH .
AND EACH CASE IS PRESENTED TO THAT GROUP OF TWENTYFIVE AND THOSE CASES ARE UH LESSER DEGREES OF MAGNITUDE .
YOU KNOW THE GUY WAS CAUGHT BURGLING AND HE HAD HIS POCKETS FULL OF STUFF YOU KNOW WHEN HE WAS CAUGHT .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW THAT KIND OF STUFF .
YOU CAN JUST TURN TO THE JUDGE AND SAY YOUR PLEASURE YOUR HONOR AND THERE S NOT A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT KIND OF THING .
YEAH .
BUT THE WAY OUR SYSTEM OUR COURT SYSTEM WORKS THAT GUY IS GOING TO HAVE TO HANG AROUND IN JAIL OR OUT ON BAIL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT FOR AN EXTREME PERIOD OF TIME .
RIGHT .
I JUST THINK OUR SYSTEM IS OVERWORKED AND WE RE STARTING TO STRETCH THE TRUE MEANING OF OF RIGHT TO A SPEEDY TRIAL .
YEAH THAT S THAT S A GOOD IDEA .
MAYBE THIS PRE GROUP OF PEOPLE COULD DECIDE YOU KNOW WHICH KIND OF UH YOU KNOW WHERE THEY COULD GO FROM THERE .
DO THEY NEED A BIG LENGTHY TWELVE PERSON JU JURY OR DO THEY NEED A SIX PERSON JURY OR YOU KNOW THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND THE DEGREE OF THE OF THE YOU KNOW THE SERIOUSNESS OF IT YOU KNOW HOW IS THIS OPEN AND SHUT YOU KNOW LIKE YOU WERE SAYING OR DO YOU NEED SOMEBODY TO GO OFF FOR THREE MONTHS AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED .
YOU KNOW A JURY LIKE THAT .
YOU KNOW WE .
THEY COULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO THAT COULD WORK .
YOU KNOW KIND OF MUMBLEX OFF WHAT .
WE VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HERE UH I BELIEVE THAT OUR WE VE BECOME ALMOST A LITIGIOUS SOCIETY WHERE WE EVERYONE IS VERY QUICK TO SUE OR TO THREATEN TO SUE AND THAT KIND OF STUFF AND .
YEAH .
ALTHOUGH WE SUPPORTING A WHOLE SEGMENT OF SOCIETY CALLED LAWYERS MAYBE WE DO NT NEED TO DO THAT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW MAYBE INSTEAD OF BEING SO QUICK TO SUE YOU UH IF YOU HAVE A DISAGREEMENT WITH SOMEONE INSTEAD OF TYING UP COURT AND TIME AND THAT KIND OF STUFF MAYBE YOU .
NEE MAYBE YOU AND IF YOU WANT TO YOUR LAWYER OR YOUR YOUR OPPONENT NEED TO GO FACE .
THIS GROUP OF TWENTYFIVE OR A JUDGE MUMBLEX LIKE .
GOOD IDEA .
THEY HAVE ON T V .
YEAH .
AND LET EITHER .
HE OR THAT GROUP DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE A REAL CASE .
YEAH RIGHT THAT S .
AND LET S YOU KNOW LET S GET RID OF SOME OF THIS HARASSMENT SUING .
RIGHT THAT S THAT S A GOOD IDEA .
I IN THE BIBLE .
IT SAYS UH IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING AGAINST SOMEBODY TO GO TO THEM FIRST AND IF THAT DOES NT WORK THEN TO GO GET SOMEBODY YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE WISER AND OLDER AND TAKE THEM WITH YOU AND GO TO THEM AND IF THAT DOES NT WORK TO TAKE IT TO THE WHOLE CHURCH .
SO THAT S RIGHT OFF THAT SAME KIND OF PRINCIPLE .
YOU BET AND IF .
THAT S A THAT S A GOOD IDEA .
IF WE COULD ALL DEAL WITH THOSE KINDS OF BELIEFS WE WOULD NT HAVE HALF THE .
YEAH THAT S TRUE THAT S TRUE TOO .
BUT UH YOU KNOW THAT WHOLE BIBLICAL CONCEPT LIKE THAT THAT S TRUE IN A LOT OF OUR UM YOU KNOW THE THE WAY .
THE WHOLE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND THE GOVERNMENT IS BASED ON THAT .
IT DOES NT WORK ON THAT BUT IT S BASED OUT OF THAT .
AND UH SO THAT YOU KNOW THAT COULD WORK .
YES I D FORGOTTEN WHAT .

A AREA AND MY PARENTS LIVE IN ANAHEIM RIGHT NOW .
LIVED UP NORTH OF LOS ANGELES IN THOUSAND OAKS AREA WHERE THE COWBOYS HAVE THEIR TRAINING CAMP OR USED TO ANYWAY .
I VE BEEN THROUGH ALL OF THAT .
YEAH .
UH THERE IS AN AREA BEYOND THOUSAND OAKS NORTH OF LOS ANGELES .
THAT IS REALLY AN EERIE STRANGE LOOKING AREA .
MUMBLEX .
WITH BOULDERS I WON THEY RE NOT REALLY HILLS THEY RE MORE LIKE JUST HUGE BOULDERS WITH VERY LITTLE VEGETATION .
HUH .
I M NOT FAMILIAR WITH WHAT IS IT ALONG THE COAST OR .
UH .
OR INLAND .
WELL YOU KNOW IT MAY BE A LITTLE BIT MORE INLAND .
THAT IS ONE OF THE STRANGEST AREAS I HAVE EVER SEEN .
UM .
UH I HAD TO GO UP TO T I ON BUSINESS .
OUT THERE UHHUH .
A COUPLE YEARS AGO .
UHHUH .
AND WE WENT UP THAT COASTLINE AND I WAS JUST AMAZED HOW UNUSUAL THAT LOOKS .
HUH .
HERE HANG ON JUST A SECOND I VE GOT A LOS ANGELES MAP .
LET ME JUST QUICK .
YEAH THEY HAVE SOME .
PRETTY NICE WEATHER OUT THERE IN LOS ANGELES .
MUMBLEX VALLEY .
MUMBLEX VALLEY .
YES .
OKAY I KNOW WHERE THAT IS .
BEYOND THOUSAND OAKS .
I KNOW WHERE MUMBLEX VALLEY IS I VE BEEN OUT THERE BEFORE SURE .
YOU DO NT THINK THAT S STRANGE LOOKING .
I DID NT NOTICE ANYTHING STRANGE I GUESS .
OH OKAY .
ABOUT IT .
MAYBE MAYBE I M USED TO TEXAS .
MAYBE TEXAS .
THE WAY .
THE ELEVATION IS EXTREMELY HIGH .
UHHUH .
IT .
S GOT CURVING ROADS ON IT BUT BUT THE IT S JUST A STRANGE LANDSCAPE THERE S VERY LITTLE VEGETATION .
HUH .
I DID NT I DO NT REMEMBER SEEING THAT PART OF IT .
I KNOW MUMBLEX VALLEY YEAH IT S JUST A SUBURB OF L .
A .
RIGHT .
IT S A .
AND THEY VE BUILT SOME NEW HIGHWAYS OUT TO THAT AREA AND THINGS LATELY .
PEOPLE CAN GET IN AND OUT OF L .
A EASIER .
MAYBE IT S A PLACE .
I WENT TO IT WAS FAR EXTREME THOUGHT WE D NEVER FIND THE PLACE .
HUH .
IT WAS INTERESTING .
YEAH SOUNDS INTERESTING .
BECAUSE WE WENT OUT THE VENTURA HIGHWAY TO THOUSAND OAKS AND ON UP .
RIGHT .
THROUGH THAT WAY .
RIGHT RIGHT .
I I KNOW EXACTLY MUMBLEX THAT AREA .
IT S A NICE AREA OUT THERE .
I LOVE THOUSAND OAKS .
UH TEXAS I DO NT KNOW THING THINGS YOU JUST HAVE LESS A VARIETY I GUESS .
I THINK I DO NT THINK IT S QUITE AS GREEN YOU KNOW .
IT S GREEN WITH ALL THE TREES AND THINGS OUT HERE BUT IT S JUST .
OH IT S GREEN SOMETIME .
YEAH BUT IT S JUST YOU KNOW I DO NT KNOW .
WELL IT DOES NT STAY GREEN YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
THE REALLY AND IN ALL HONESTY I KNOW THIS SOUNDS LIKE A TEXAS STORY ALL HONESTY YOU HAVE NT SEEN THE HOTTEST OF SUMMERS IF YOU VE ONLY BEEN HERE FIVE YEARS .
WE HAVE NT HAD A .
YEAH .
REALLY BAD ONE .
I MISSED THAT ONE OF EIGHTY OR EIGHTYTWO OR EIGHTYONE .
OH .
THAT HAD THE HEAT WAVE .
IT MAY BE EIGHTYTWO BECAUSE WE BOUGHT OUR HOUSE IN EIGHTYONE AND WE BUILT A POOL IN EIGHTYTWO .
YES UM I WAS WONDERING WHETHER YOU WERE IN FAVOR OF STATEHOOD INDEPENDENCE OR THE STATUS QUO FOR PUERTO RICO .
I WAS A RESIDENT ALTHOUGH VERY YOUNG OF THE STA OF WHAT IS NOW THE STATE OF ALASKA IN NINETEEN FIFTYNINE WHEN ALASKA STOPPED BEING A TERRITORY AND BECAME A STATE UH SO I GUESS I HAVE A LEFT OVER POSITIVE FEELING ABOUT THE QUESTION EVEN THOUGH I DO NT KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT PUERTO RICO UH I KNOW THAT ALL THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED RELATIVE TO THAT TERRITORY IN ALASKA HAVE BEEN VERY POSITIVE UH AND I HAVE A SUSPICION THAT THAT I BELIEVE THAT A THE STATEHOOD IS A GOOD IDEA WHENEVER YOU HAVE A TERRITORY THE SIZE OF PUERTO RICO ONE OUGHT EITHER TO MAKE IT A FULLFLEDGED STATE OR OR LET IT GO ONE OR THE OTHER WHAT IS YOUR SITUATION .
WELL I M I GUESS I DO NT HAVE SU SUCH CLOSE EXPERIENCE WITH WITH UM AN AREA BECOMING A STATE AS YOU DO UM MY CONCERN IS THE ECONOMY BECAUSE AS I UNDERSTAND IT PUERTO RICO HAS A VERY LOW STA UH STANDARD OF LIVING OR AT LEAST UM ANNUAL AVERAGE INCOME UM PART OF THIS I SUPPOSE IS JUSTIFIED IN IN THAT THE CLIMATE THEY DO NT NEED PERHAPS THE HEATING AND THE HOUSING THAT SOME OF THE MORE NORTHERN TERRITORIES NEED HOWEVER IN THAT CASE I GUESS I WOULD FAVOR STATUS QUO I HAVE BEEN TO PUERTO RICO AND AND FOUND IT VERY VERY INTERESTING I DID PEACE CORPS TRAINING THERE .
OH THAT S VERY INTERESTING .
AND SO UM YOU KNOW I SAW IT ALSO AS A YOUNG STUDENT AND AND IT WAS VERY FOREIGN IN A CERTAIN SENSE ALTHOUGH I HAD GROWN UP IN CALIFORNIA AND SO THE SPANISH WAS NO PROBLEM UM IT WAS IT WAS YOU KNOW VERY LOVELY AND AND THE PEOPLE SEEMED VERY FRIENDLY AND AND NICE I HAVE ACTUALLY I WORK WITH UH A GIRL FROM PUERTO RICO AND I GUESS I HAVE NEVER THOUGHT TO ASK HER WHAT SHE FAVORS UM .
YOUR CONCERN ON THE ECONOMY WAS ONE IN TERMS OF IF IT BECAME A STATE WOULD THAT PUT EVEN MORE PRESSURES ON ON PUERTO RICO OR PRESSURES ON THE U S IN TERMS OF AID OR .
WELL PROBABLY MORE ON IN TERMS OF THE U S UM YOU KNOW I M I M NOT QUITE SURE HOW THE U S COPES WITH THIS SORT OF THING I VE LIVE ABRO ABROAD MOST OF MY LIFE SO I GUESS I I VE BEEN VERY CUT OFF I LIVED ACTUALLY IN LEBANON SO I WAS VERY CUT OFF FROM THE THE PRESS AS I YOU KNOW AND BE WAS BECOMING AN ADULT SO I DO NT KNOW HOW THE U S WOULD COPE WITH UH A NEW STATE THAT IS SO VERY VERY POOR .
UHHUH .
UM I GUESS YOU KNOW WE D HAVE A LOT OF AID IF IF YOU CONSIDER THE INNER CITIES OF LIKE NEW YORK AND AND HOW MUCH AID IT NEEDS I SUPPOSE THE WHOLE COUNTRY OR THE WHOLE UM NEW STATE WOULD REQUIRE SUCH AID .
I GUESS UM WE RE ASSUMING THAT THAT PUERTO RICO WOULD BE PER CAPITA SIGNIFICANTLY MORE POOR PERHAPS THAN THAN SAY MISSISSIPPI OR .
I THINK SO .
OKAY THAT S SOMETHING THAT THAT I GUESS I HAVE NOT MUCH OF AN IMAGE OF OTHER THAN THAN PUERTO RICO AS A TROPICAL ISLAND AND CONSEQUENTLY LARGE NUMBERS OF BAREFOOT NATIVES OR SOMETHING NOT IN A PERJURITIVE SENSE BUT IN A IN A CAREFREE SENSE I GUESS ALTHOUGH I M AWARE OF THE POLITICAL PROBLEMS AND UNREST AND AND ALSO DIFFICULTIES THEY HAVE UM I DO NT KNOW WHETHER STATE WOUL STATEHOOD WOULD IMPROVE THEIR ECONOMY I DO NT I DO NT KNOW THAT THE VE THE ACT OF BEING A STATE WOULD HAVE ANY IMPACT ON ON THEM UH I GUESS THEY WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO SOME TAXING THAT THEY DO NT HAVE NOW BUT OF COURSE IF THEIR ECONOMY IS WEAK THE THERE IS NOT MUCH OF A BASE ON WHICH TO TAX I DO NT KNOW IF THEY SUFFER IN A SENSE OF INCOME LOSS AS BEING SINCE THEY ARE NT A STATE WHETHER THERE ARE MONIES THAT ESCAPE THEM SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE THEY ARE NT ABLE TO TAX LIKE A TYPICAL STATE WOULD BE HOW DO YOU FEEL THOUGH ABOUT WELL I GUESS IT S TO THEIR ADVANTAGE TO BE A TERRITORY BUT UM I WONDER HOW HAVE HAVING BEEN IN A TERRITORY BUT ONLY AS A YOUNG STUDENT AND MY PARENTS WERE IN THE MILITARY AT THE TIME SO THEY DID NT HAVE READY NEGATIVE FEELINGS ABOUT BEING IN IN ALASKA AT THE TIME SINCE THEY VOTED ABSENTEE I I WOULD IMAGINE THAT IT MUST BE A LITTLE BIT OF A SE FEELING OF SECOND CLASS CITIZENRY UH TO BE IN A TERRITORY THAT LARGE AND NOT BEING ABLE TO VOTE THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA PEOPLE FOR INSTANCE ARE QUITE FRUSTRATED I THINK AT TIMES IN THEIR NOT HAVING A SENATE REPRESENTATIVE .
UHHUH YEAH THOSE ARE GOOD POINTS UM WHICH OBVIOUSLY I HAD NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT UH I DO NT KNOW UH I SUPPOSE THEY ALSO NOT BEING A STATE ARE PROBABLY FREER TO DETERMINE THEIR OWN UM WAYS OF LIFE THAN THEY WOULD IF IF I M TRYING TO THINK EXACTLY WHAT IS IMPOSED IF THEY WOULD BECOME A STATE VERSUS A TERRITORY .
UHHUH .
PERHAPS COMPULSORY EDUCATION .
UH I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN SO THAT .
UM AND TAXES .
YEAH TAXES WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY BE OCCURRING UH THERE I DO NT KNOW I DO NT EVEN UNDERSTAND EXACTLY HOW TAXES ARE HANDLED IN A TERRITORIAL SITUATION UM FREQUENTLY THE LAWS IN A TERRITORY ARE ARE IN SOME WAYS AS STRINGENT AS THEY ARE IN OTHER STATES I AND I M THINKING IN TERMS OF EDUCATION BUT THEN AGAIN EACH STATE SETS ITS OWN AND I DO NT KNOW HOW A TERRITORIAL GOVERNOR TAKES CARE OF SOMETHING LIKE PUERTO RICO UM IT S INTERESTING BECAUSE I HAVE NT THOUGHT OF THEM IN TERMS OF THE PROBLEMS RELATIVE TO UH ECONOMY UH I HAD THOUGHT OF IT MORE IN TERMS OF POLITICAL UH REALIZATION AND I GUESS I HAD AUTOMATICALLY MADE THE ASSUMPTION THAT GEE ANYONE WOULD RATHER BE A STATE OF THE U S THAN AN INDEPENDENT COUNTRY SO .
UHHUH WELL WELL ACTUALLY I THIN ONE ONE THING THAT I REMEMBER HEARING IN THE NEWS THE PAST COUPLE WEEKS THAT MIGHT BE SIGNIFICANT IS THAT THEY VE RECENTLY VOTED THAT SPANISH IS THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE WHICH I ALWAYS ASSUMED IT WAS ANYWAY SO IF THEY VE JUST TAKEN SUCH ACTION IT WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE TO ME EITHER THEY RE DOING IT BECAUSE THEY RE AFRAID THEY MIGHT BECOME A STATE AND WANT TO DECLARE THIS BEFORE THEY BECOME A STATE OR MAYBE BECAUSE THEY DO NT WANT TO BECOME A STATE FOR FEAR OF LOSING THE SPANISH OR HISPANIC HERITAGE .
UHHUH WELL THAT S INTERESTING TOO WELL IT SOUNDS AS THOUGH YOU ARE IN FAVOR OF UH STATUS QUO .
I I BELIEVE I WOULD PROBABLY TEND TOWARDS THAT .
AND I THINK UH HAVING LISTENED TO YOU RELATIVE TO THE ECONOMY THING I THINK IF I WERE BEING FORCED TO MAKE A DECISION I WOULD PLEAD IGNORANCE AND WAIT TO DO MORE RESEARCH BEFORE PICKING ONE OF THESE SO I M UL I GUESS I M ULTIMATELY IN FAVOR OF STATUS QUO ALSO AT THIS POINT .
WELL THAT S INTERESTING .
LEANING TOWARDS THE STATEHOOD .
RIGHT WHAT ABOUT IF IF UM THEY DEMANDED TO HAVE SPANISH AS THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE AS A CONDITION FOR STATEHOOD .
I THINK I WOULD BE TROUBLED I SUSPECT I BELIEVE THAT ANY OF OUR STATES AND I CONSTITUTIONALLY I DO NT THINK THERE ARE ANY PRESCRIPTIONS ABO AGAINST THAT DECISION EVEN IF LOUISIANA CHOSE TO GO WITH CREOLE OR SOMETHING UM I DO NT THINK THERE IS ANY PROHIBITIONS I WOULD BE BOTHERED BY THAT I M I M BOTHERED BY ANY TENDENCY TO RESIST WHAT I THINK WAS ONE OF AMERICA S STRENGTHS AND THAT S THE THE THE MELTING POT .
UHHUH .
UH I I AM PARTICULARLY FOND OF A NUMBER OF ETHNIC CUISINES BUT I M TROUBLED BY TOO CLOSE A CLINGING TO TO THE PAST AND I M ALSO REALIZING THAT THAT A COMMON LANGUAGE I THINK IS THE ULTIMATE BOND OF A COUNTRY .
UHHUH .
AND CANADA I GUESS COMES TO MY MIND AS THEY RE GOING THROUGH THE THROES UP THERE RELATIVE TO FRENCH QUEBEC AND WHATEVER UH THAT I I THINK THAT WOULD BE A NEGATIVE STEP TO MAKE AND I THINK THAT THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO REASSESS THAT UM I M TROUBLED EVEN IN BY BILINGUALISM UH IN SO FAR THAT IT INTR IT GETS IN THE WAY OF OF OF THE MELTING POT ASPECT .
UHHUH UHHUH THAT S INTERESTING BECAUSE ALTHOUGH I TEND TO BE BILINGUAL SPANISH BASED ON EXPERIENCE UM I WAS IN BILINGUAL EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA AND I DID NT HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH MY STUDENTS BUT I NOTICED MY MY BROTHER WHO WAS QUITE A BIT YOUNGER WAS LEARNING SPANISH IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND HE CA NT SPEAK A WORD .
UM .
AND SO OBVIOUSLY IT DID NT WORK IN CALIFORNIA .
YEAH BUT I M RATHER IN FAVOR OF PEOPLE BEING BILINGUAL .
RIGHT .
AND I D BE QUITE HAPPY TO SEE A NATIONAL LAW IN WHICH EVERY STUDENT WAS REQUIRED TO LEARN ENGLISH AND A SECOND LANGUAGE .
RIGHT .
BUT I M I M DISTURBED BY A COUNTRY THAT ATTEMPTS TO BE FUNCTIONALLY BILINGUAL AT THE OFFICIAL LEVEL .
OH I SEE .
UM I M I M CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THAT CAUSES FRACTIOUSNESS I GUESS .
UHHUH UHHUH .
WELL I THINK WE HAVE GONE TO TIME AND I APPRECIATE YOUR HAVING CALLED .
OKAY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH .
GOODBYE .

I SURE WAS TWO YEARS AGO I SPENT SOME FOURTH OF JULY TO LABOR DAY ON A JURY THAT WAS UH A CHANGE OF VENUE FROM COLUMBUS OHIO FOR AGGRAVATED UH MURDER AND KIDNAPPING .
WOW .
YEAH IT WAS QUITE A SESSION THAT DISTRUP DISRUPTED MY WHOLE SUMMER OF COURSE .
SOUNDS LIKE IT .
FIVE DAYS A WEEK BUT IT WAS AN ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING EXPERIENCE .
OH IT SOUNDS LIKE IT I HAVE NT HAD ANY ACTUAL REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE BUT UH MY FATHERINLAW S BEEN INVOLVED IN UH SEVERAL TRIALS INCLUDING UH A COUPLE MURDERS AND UH YOU KNOW TALKING TO OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN THERE AND SO I DO NT HAVE ANY REAL EXPERIENCE WITH TRIALS BUT I DO YOU KNOW I I VE I TOOK A LITTLE BUSINESS LAW IN IN COLLEGE AND AND I VE YOU KNOW TRY TO KEEP ABREAST OF THINGS .
UHHUH .
BUT UH M I THINK THAT THE UH TRIAL BY JURY IS IS A GREAT IDEA AT IT S INCEPTION BACK TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO UM RIGHT NOW THOUGH IT S IT S SO DIFFICULT BECAUSE THERE S SO FEW COURTS TO TO GET ANYTHING REALLY DONE AS YOU KNOW YOU SPENT YOU KNOW A WHOLE SUMMER ON ONE TRIAL .
UHHUH .
AND IT S JUST THAT I THINK THEY RE JUST TIEING UP THE UM WHOLE JUDICIAL PROCESS UM THERE S A LOT OF THINGS THEY COULD DO TO UH MAKE THINGS EASIER AND UH YOU KNOW LIKE UH THE SUGGESTION THAT UH MAYBE BE UH A JUDGE SHOULD BE THE ONE WHO DECIDES ON WHAT THE SENTENCE SHOULD BE RATHER THAN THE JURY .
UHHUH WELL I THINK THAT THERE ARE MANY CASES WHERE UH THE JUDGES PROBABLY DO MAKE THE DECISION RATHER THAN THE JURY OUR SITUATION WAS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT UH IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT UH WE HAVE NT WE WERE A LANDMARK CASE IT WAS THE FIRST TIME IN THE STATE OF OHIO THAT UM D N A TESTING WAS ENTERED AS EVIDENCE .
UHHUH .
AND THEY WERE BEING THE JUDGE WAS BEING ESPECIALLY CAREFUL THAT EVERYTHING WAS DONE CORRECTLY SO THERE COULD NT BE A A MISTRIAL OF ANY KIND .
UHHUH .
UH THE UM UH THE INTERESTING THING WAS THE TREMENDOUS SELECTION OF JURY PROCESS UH THAT WE EXPERIENCED THAT TOOK ONE FULL WEEK UH TO GET FORTYTHREE PEOPLE QUALIFIED TO SIT ON THE JURY AND THEN IT WAS A MATTER OF THE SELECTION OF UH TWELVE PEOPLE AFTER THAT ACTUALLY IT WAS FOURTEEN BECAUSE WE HAD TWO ALTERNATES .
JEEZ .
AND THE JUDGE WAS EXTREMELY CONCERNED FOR OUR WELFARE IF WE WERE WELL IF WE WERE COMFORTABLE AND UH THINGS OF THAT NATURE WHICH MADE US FEEL GOOD .
UHHUH .
UH AND WE WERE SEQUESTERED BUT THE MAKEUP OF THE JURY UH WAS TRULY A CROSS SECTION OF UH YOU MIGHT SAY A CROSS SECTION OF A COUNTRY .
UHHUH .
THERE WAS ONE OTHER PERSON BESIDES MYSELF WE WERE THE ONLY ONES THAT HAD EVER BEEN TO COLLEGE UM ONE WAS A FORMER STUDENT OF MINE A FEW YEARS BEFORE WHO WAS OUT OF WORK UH .
GEE .
TWO OTHERS WERE ONES WHO HAD NEVER FINISHED HIGH SCHOOL AND WERE OUT LOOKING FOR JOBS YET UM A COUPLE OF THEM WERE HOUSEWIVES WHO HAD NEVER WORKED AND THEN SOME ARE PEOPLE WHO DID WORK SO WE HAD QUITE A CROSS SECTION OF BLACK WHITE AND WOMEN AND MEN .
UHHUH .
AND UH IT UH IT WAS INTERESTING JUST TO LISTEN TO THE RATIONALE UH BEING PROPOSED AND THE LOGIC OF SOME OF THE PEOPLE UH IT WAS ALSO EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO STAY AWAKE SOMETIMES BECAUSE THERE WAS SO MANY WITNESSES AND WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE ANY NOTES OF ANY KIND UH AND I THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS A FAILING BECAUSE UH FROM THE STANDPOINT THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO TRY TO REMEMBER EVERYTHING .
YEAH .
AND AND YET THE JUDGE SAID WELL UM IF YOU RE TAKING NOTES YOU RE MISSING SOMETHING AND HE WAS RIGHT .
YEAH .
THERE ALSO BUT UH I CERTAINLY UM I THINK IT DEPENDS UPON HOW THE JUDGE HANDLES THE CASE AND IF THE CRIMINAL CHOOSES TO HAVE A THREE PANEL JUDGE UH A THREE JUDGE PANEL I SHOULD SAY I THINK HE CAN .
UHHUH .
HAVE THAT RATHER THAN TRIAL BY JURY .
YES YES I AGREE UH WOULD SURPRISE ME THAT UH WHEN I WAS IN TEXAS I HAD THE UH DISPLEASURE OF GETTING A UH TRAFFIC TICKET .
UHHUH .
AND UM I WENT TO COURT AND YOU CAN EVEN GET A TRIAL BY JURY FOR A TRAFFIC TICKET .
YOU RE KIDDING .
NO AND I THOUGHT MY GOD TALK ABOUT TIEING UP THINGS FOR FOR .
YES AND MONEY .
YES I MEAN THAT S EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE I MEAN THE FIRST THING YOU HAD TO DO WHEN YOU CAME BEFORE THE JUDGE WAS WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL I M LIKE GOD .
YEAH .
THIS IS RIDICULOUS .
YEAH I DO THINK THAT THAT UH I DO THINK THE JURY SYSTEM WORKS BUT I D I ALSO FEEL AS YOU SAID THAT THE ORIGINAL CONCEPT OF THE JURY AS IT WAS ORIGINALLY SETUP UH BACK UH IN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO WAS FINE BUT THAT IT NEEDS TO BE MORE REFINED FOR TODAY S STANDARD OF LIVING AND THE THE UH LEVEL OF EDUCATION OF THEM OF SO MANY PEOPLE NOW UH .
UHHUH .
BY THE SAME TOKEN WE HAD UM UH SOME PEOPLE WHO WANTED T HAD VACATIONS PLANNED AND ONE MAN IN PARTICULAR HAD RESERVATIONS MADE PLANE TICKETS MADE EVERYTHING AND THE JUDGE CALLED AND HAD IT ALL CANCELED SO HE COULD GET HIS MONEY BACK AND THEN HE WAS NT SELECTED ON THE JURY .
OH MY GOD .
AND THEN ANOTHER YOUNG FELLOW HAD TO MEET WITH THE JUDGE O AND THE PROSECUTOR AND THE DEFENSE ATTORNEYS ON THREE DIFFERENT OCCASIONS BEFORE HE WAS FINALLY EXCUSED FROM THE JURY BECAUSE HIS WIFE WAS ABOUT TO HAVE TWINS AND THEY HAD HE HAD TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THAT IF IN THREE DAYS TO GET EXCUSED FROM THAT JURY TO BE WITH HIS WIFE ON THE BIRTH OF THE TWINS AND UH YOU KNOW SOME OF IT JUST SEEMED RATHER EXTREME .
YES I I THINK THEY CAN PROBABLY COME UP WITH SOME WAYS TO INSURE THAT UH YOU KNOW PEOPLE WOULD GET A FAIR TRIAL .
YES .
AND NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS .
RIGHT .
I MEAN SOME THINGS ARE JUST SO CUT AND DRY UM IN THE IN YOU KNOW THE THE LEVEL OF EVIDENCE THAT THEY COME UP WITH NOW I MEAN YOU KNOW WHEN YOU START THINKING ABOUT WELL THEY VE GOT VIDEO TAPE AND AND AUDIO TAPES AND THEY VE THEY VE GOT YOU KNOW THEY VE GOT WAYS TO NAIL PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
TO THE POINT WHERE THEY THEY REALLY SHOULD NT EVEN BE GOING TO TRIAL .
RIGHT WELL I GUESS HE D HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHETHER WITH ENTRAPMENT OR SOME OF THOSE THINGS YES .
BUT UH I DO NT I ASSUME YOU HAVE SEEN ON TELEVISION RECENTLY AS PROBABLY THE WHOLE COUNTRY HAS THE BEATING OF THE MAN IN LOS ANGELES .
OH THAT WAS HORRIBLE .
IS NT THAT TERRIBLE AND UH YOU KNOW .
THAT IT .
AND THAT CERTAINLY UH CAN NOT BE SAID TO BE UH SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS EVERYWHERE BUT THE FACT THAT IT CAN HAPPEN THAT IT PROBABLY DOES HAPPEN IN MANY PLACES IT S IT S HORRENDOUS AND IT S JUST A STROKE OF LUCK .
YEAH .
THAT SOMEONE WAS ABLE TO GET IT ON TAPE AND THEN UH TO LISTEN TO THE TAPE RECORDING UH AT THE POLICE STATION OF THE WHOLE CONVERSATION AFTERWARDS .
YES I KNOW I MEAN I ONLY HEARD PORTIONS OF THAT BUT IT S ABSOLUTELY .
YEAH .
TERRIBLE AND YOU KNOW IF YOU BEAT A DOG LIKE THAT THEY LL PUT YOU .
ABSOLUTELY .
IN JAIL .
WELL WE GET A FEW OTHER CASE .
YOU KNOW .
UH LIKE UP AT THE END OF LAST YEAR WHERE ONE POLICE OFFICER IT WAS ON A DRUG RAID UH WAS TRYING TO EXTRA EXTRICATE UM A CONFESSION OR INFORMATION FROM A DRUG DEALER AND DID SO BY PLACING A HOT A HOT IRON ON HIS CHEST HIS BARE CHEST BURNED HIM .
JEEZ .
THEY WOUND UP PAYING HIM UH THE OFFICER OF COURSE WAS FIRED BUT THEY PAID THE DEFENDANT UH THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OR SOMETHING TO DROP THE LAWSUIT AND THEN LAST WEEK SOMEONE SHOT AND KILLED THE FORMER POLICEMAN .
HUH .
SO UH AS SOME OF THOSE THINGS UH ARE ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS AND WE DO NEED AN ALL AN OVERHAUL AND WE JUST NEED MORE DISCIPLINE COUNTRY WIDE .
YES I .
IT WOULD THEN WE D NEED IT ON THAT YEAH .
I BELIEVE THAT TOO .
WELL IT S BEEN VERY NICE TALKING WITH YOU .

I THINK .
UHHUH .
AFTER A WHILE THEY JUST KIND OF YOU KNOW THERE S NO NEW STUFF THEY CAN DO THEY VE DONE EVERYTHING DIRTY IN THE BOOK .
YEP .
YOU KNOW SO .
YEP I KNOW I KNOW WAS IT ACTUALLY BASED ON A BOOK .
WELL NO I IMAGINE .
OH BUT YOU WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT OKAY OKAY .
EVERYTHING YOU COULD THINK OF YOU KNOW .
YEAH RIGHT .
HAD A HARD TIME AND I THINK MAYBE WITH DALLAS AS FAR AS THEY LOST A LOT OF CHARACTERS THAT HAD BEEN AROUND AT THE FIRST .
THAT S TRUE THAT S TRUE .
WHERE I DO NT KNOW I NEVER WATCHED KNOTS LANDING BUT I THINK THEY VE HAD A LOT OF THEIR CHARACTERS STAY AROUND .
STAY UHHUH UHHUH YOU KNOW AND IF YOU NOTICE ON DALLAS THEY LOST ALL THE WOMEN .
YEAH .
YES SO THE MEN MAINLY STAYED BUT THE WOMEN WERE THE ONES WHO LEFT AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS VERY INTERESTING AND WONDERED KIND OF WONDERED ABOUT THAT UH WELL ANYWAY THAT S A WHOLE NEW ISSUE .
YEAH OH .
OH GOODNESS SO ANYWAY I DO NT KNOW IF OUR FIVE MINUTES ARE OVER YET BUT WE UH WE ALSO HAVE THE PAID UH TELEVISION CHANNELS UH THE ONLY THING I DO NT LIKE ABOUT IT ESPECIALLY WITH TEENAGERS IS THAT ALL THE VIOLENCE THE SEX THE NUDITY AND THE CURSE WORDS .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND SO I KNOW THEY DID NT PICK UP THESE CURSE WORDS FROM ME SO UH THEY HAD TO HAVE PICKED THEM UP FROM UH THE T V .
YEAH .
ONE NICE THING THOUGH ABOUT THE CABLE COMPANY WE USE THEY HAVE UH THEY HAVE THAT LITTLE PARENTAL UH UH KEY .
WHERE YOU CAN LOCK UP .
YEAH .
THE CHANNEL OR WHATEVER .
YEAH UHHUH SO I I HAVE THAT AT HOME AND I KEEP THE KEYS WITH ME .
YEAH .
AND THAT S ABOUT THE ONLY WAY THAT I CAN THAT I CAN DO IT BECAUSE THEIR NATURAL CURIOSITY YOU KNOW TO GO TOWARDS THAT WAY AND WANT .
YEAH .
YEAH .
AND I DO NT KNOW THE WAY THE GENERATIONS ARE GROWING UP NOW I MEAN I JUST THINK THEY WATCH SO MUCH MORE T V I TRY TO LIMIT WHAT THEY WATCH THEY ARE NT SITTING IN THE HOUSE WATCHING T V ALL DAY .
UHHUH UHHUH .
BECAUSE I THINK IT S GOOD FOR THEM TO HAVE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND THAT KIND OF STUFF TOO .
YEAH .
AND ESPECIALLY IN THE SUMMER TIME WE ARE NT IN THE HOUSE VERY MUCH IN THE EVENINGS IT S THE ONLY COOL TIME TO BE OUTSIDE .
THAT S TRUE WELL AND HERE LATELY IT HAS NT BEEN THAT COOL ANYWAY WITH THE HUMIDITY BEING SO HIGH .
WELL TRUE .
WELL IT WAS NICE TALKING TO YOU .
WELL IT WAS NICE TALKING TO YOU TOO .
OKAY TALK WITH YOU LATER .
OKAY GOODBYE .
GOODBYE .
WELL WHAT S YOUR VIEWS ON IT .
I THINK IT S UH A GOOD IDEA UM I GREW UP UH MY TEENAGE YEARS WERE SPENT DURING THE SIXTIES GRADUATING UH HIGH SCHOOL IN SIXTYEIGHT UM I REMEMBER WHEN THE PEACE CORPS MOVEMENT FIRST CAME ABOUT AND I THOUGHT IT WAS A VERY GOOD IDEA AT THE TIME I WAS ONE OF THOSE UH KENNEDY CHILDREN IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN .
UHHUH .
AND UH RIGHT NOW I SEE A LOT OF KIDS WHO GET OUT OF SCHOOL HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY WANT TO DO .
YEAH .
AND THERE S A LOT OF THINGS OUT THERE THAT WE COULD DO UH FOR OUR OWN COUNTRY .
SURE .
LET ALONE OTHER COUNTRIES .
SURE .
AND I THINK THAT WE VE GOT THE THE PEOPLE POWER TO DO IT IT S JUST UH WE NEED TO CHANNEL IT AND FOCUS IT ON SOME THINGS THAT THAT NEED SOME FIXING UP UM .
YEAH .
SOME EXAMPLES ARE THIS UH SOME OF THE THINGS LIKE JIMMY CARTER S BEEN INVOLVED IN UH A LITTLE PROGRAM TO YOU KNOW FIX UP HOUSING FOR PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
AND THERE S A LOT OF HOUSING .
YEAH .
A I KNOW IN THE AREA THAT I LIVE IN THAT S RUN DOWN AND BEAT UP BUT IT COULD BE FIXED UP AND USED .
UHHUH .
AND IT S JUST YOU KNOW SITTING THERE WASTING AWAY .
YEAH WE RE NOT TOO FAR BEHIND I GRADUATED IN SEVENTYONE SO I M I M SAME GENERATION I I M IT S GOING TO BE A SHORT CONVERSATION BECAUSE I AGREE WITH YOU .
I I THINK UH I DO NT I DO NT EVEN THINK IT OUGHT TO BE UH VOLUNTARY I THINK IT OUGHT TO BE MANDATORY UH FOR KIDS TO EITHER EITHER DO MILITARY SERVICE OR PUBLIC SERVICE ONE OF THE TWO UH A LOT OF REASONS FOR THAT NOT NOT JUST BECAUSE I M A I M A HARD ASS OR ANYTHING .
UHHUH .
IT S JUST THAT LIKE YOU SAY KIDS ARE GETTING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL NOT KNOWING WHAT IN THE HECK THEY RE GOING TO DO AND EITHER THE MILITARY OR PUBLIC SERVICE ORGANIZATION CAN GIVE THEM A LOT OF FOCUS AND I THINK THAT IT MIGHT STOP US SOME PROBLEMS LATER ON I MEAN YOU KNOW Y THESE KIDS WILL GET THEIR THEIR HEADS ON STRAIGHT AND AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY WANT TO DO INSTEAD OF HANGING AROUND STREET CORNERS SELLING DRUGS OR SOMETHING UH IT S I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THEM UH IT HELPS MATURE THEM A LITTLE BIT AND HELPS THEM UNDERSTAND THE WORLD THE WAY IT REALLY IS .
YEAH I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE GROW UP WITH UH WITH UH PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS LI WHAT THE WORLD S ABOUT .
OH YEAH .
A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO FROM TOO MUCH T V .
OH YEAH YEAH .
AND UH YOU KNOW IT S THERE S THERE S A HECK OF A LOT OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU KNOW THE INTAKE THAT YOU GET FROM T V AND AND MOVIES AND WHAT YOU HEAR IN SCHOOL AND THEN WHAT REALITY IS .
UHHUH .
UH I REMEMBER UH I VE I VE WORKED SINCE I WAS WELL I STARTED DELIVERING PAPERS WHEN I WAS TEN AND I HAD A REAL JOB WHEN I WAS THIRTEEN SO I VE YOU KNOW WORKED MOST OF MY LIFE BUT I REMEMBER WHEN I GOT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL ALL THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL WAS BOY I CA NT WAIT TO GET OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL I CA NT WAIT TO GET OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND I WANTED TO GO TO COLLEGE AND I HAD THE GRADES TO GO TO COLLEGE AND I GOT ACCEPTED TO COLLEGE BUT WHEN I GOT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL I KIND OF SAID YOU KNOW WHAT AM I GOING TO DO NOW .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW IT S LIKE YOU KNOW WHEN I ACTUALLY STARTED WORKING FULL TIME AND I I GOT MARRIED SHORTLY AFTER GETTING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL I UH THOUGHT I WAS SMART RAN AWAY AND GOT MARRIED .
AND UH I REMEMBER THERE WAS A TIME AND WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR OF MARRIAGE I SAID BOY WOULD NT I GIVE TO GET BE BACK IN SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
AND JUST HAVE TO DO HOMEWORK AND AND GO WORK MY PART TIME JOB .
YEAH .
BECAUSE LIFE AND THE REALITY OF WORKING FOR A LIVING AND TRYING TO MAKE ENDS MEET IS JUST SO OVERWHELMING TO SOMEONE .
YEAH .
IF THEY ARE NT PREPARED FOR IT .
AND AND MOST OF THEM ARE NT .
THAT S TRUE .
I MEAN YOU LOOK YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF MARRIAGES THAT ARE OCCURRING RIGHT OU I MEAN EVEN IN HIGH SCHOOL AND YOU KNOW Y YOU WONDER WHERE ARE THE PARENTS IN ALL OF THIS YOU KNOW WHY IS NT SOMEBODY STEPPING IN AND AND STO PUTTING A STOP TO THIS KIDS IN HIGH SCHOOL ARE JUST TOO YOUNG TO BE MARRIED .
YEAH .
THEY HA THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE WORLD IS LIKE THEY DO NT HOW TOUGH IT IS OUT THERE TO MAKE A LIVING .
YEAH A .
UH I MEAN I WAS IN THE SAME BOAT WHEN I LEFT HIGH SCHOOL I MY PARENTS WANTED ME TO GO STRAIGHT TO COLLEGE AND I DID NT YOU KNOW I WAS READY I WAS READY I HAD WANDERLUST I WANTED TO GET OUT AND SEE SOME THINGS SO I JOINED THE AIR FORCE AND ENDED UP STAYING THERE FOR THIRTEEN YEARS .
UM .
UM BUT I HAD LIVED IN MY OWN LITTLE BUBBLE UP UNTIL THAT TIME AND AND AFTER TRAVELING AROUND THE WORLD A FEW TIMES I REALIZED THAT THINGS AI NT THE WAY THEY SEEM .
YEAH .
AND I I DID A LOT OF GROWING UP THERE UH .
YEAH I THINK ONCE ONCE KIDS GET OUT AND SEE HOW OTHER PEOPLE REALLY LIVE .
UHHUH YEAH .
AND KNOW HOW BAD OFF SOME PEOPLE REALLY ARE AND HOW GOOD THEY VE GOT IT .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND WHAT IT TAKES TO HAVE THAT GOOD LIFE .
THAT S RIGHT .
A IF YOU RE WILLING TO WORK FOR IT .
UHHUH .
THEN THEY RE PROBABLY BE MORE INCLINED TO WORK FOR IT .
WELL YOU KNOW IT S JUST LIKE YOU SAY THERE S SO MUCH STUFF THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE HERE IN THIS COUNTRY AND UH YOU KNOW IF IF YOU COULD HAVE A THOUGHT OF SOMETHING LIKE UH LIKE A UH UH A PEACE CORPS SORT OF ORGANIZATION I MEAN THIS WOULD BE SO USEFUL JUST IN UH FOR INSTANCE JUST HELPING OLD FOLKS .
UHHUH EXACTLY .
YOU KNOW THEY YOU KNOW THEY NEED HELP THEY DO NT HAVE ANYBODY TO DEPEND ON AND IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE SOMEBODY COME OVER AND CUT THEIR YARD OR PAINT THEIR HOUSE OR DO MINOR REPAIRS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT Y .
YOU KNOW I VE I VE S I MY MY PARENTS ARE IN THEIR LATE SIXTIES NOW AND UM SO MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE AROUND THEM ARE UNABLE TO DO THOSE THINGS FOR THEMSELVES ANYMORE .
YEAH .
AND IT S IT S REALLY HARD ON THEM AND THE YOU KNOW THE THOUGHT THAT I I SEE THE UH THE MALL RATS YOU KNOW WALKING AROUND THE MALL NOTHING BETTER TO DO THAN JUST WALK AROUND THE MALL ALL DAY LONG WHEN THEY COULD BE DOING SOMETHING TO HELP SOMEONE .
UHHUH YEAH .
AND UH YOU KNOW YO THERE S A UH A NICE WARM FEELING I REMEMBER GETTING OUT OF DOING THINGS LIKE THAT WHEN I WAS YOUNGER .
YEAH .
I MEAN I WAS A BOY SCOUT AND THE WHOLE BIT AND .
YEAH MY MOM S IN THE SAME POSITION LATE SIXTIES AND AND IT GOT TO THE GOT TO THE POINT WHERE I MEAN ME AND MY BROTHER BOTH WERE WERE GONE AND SHE COULD NT MAINTAIN THE HOUSE WITHOUT LARGE EXPENDITURES OF MONEY .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW IT FINALLY GOT TO A POINT WHERE SHE JUST HAD TO SELL IT AND MOVE INTO AN APARTMENT AND UH I I M NOT I M NOT SAYING THAT THAT WOULD NT HAVE HAPPENED ANYWAY BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE IF THERE HAD BEEN SOMEBODY TO COME AROUND AND TAKE CARE OF THE LITTLE THINGS YOU KNOW LIKE THE LIKE THE YARD WORK AND LITTLE REPAIRS AND PAINTING AND STUFF LIKE THAT .
YEAH I THINK THERE D THERE D BE A YOU KNOW A UH ECONOMIC BENEFIT FOR YOU KNOW EVERYONE CONCERNED .
OH YEAH SURE .
THOSE DOING THE WORK AND THOSE RECEIVING THE THE UH THE SERVICES .
SURE I MEAN I MEAN THE KIDS WHO WOULD BE GIVING THE SERVICE ARE GOING TO GET A LOT MORE OUT OF IT THAN JUST MONEY .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW THAT I I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS A KID I USED TO DO LITTLE LITTLE THINGS FOR THE OLD FOLKS AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND UH I KNOW HOW IT MADE ME FEEL YOU KNOW YOU S UH PEOP PEOPLE JUST DO NT HELP PEOPLE ANYMORE THEY RE THEY RE OUT FOR THEMSELVES AND .
YEAH I THINK UH PRESIDENT BUSH COVERED THAT IN HIS UH STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS THIS YEAR WHEN HE SAID THAT YOU KNOW IT S TIME FOR YOU KNOW THE INDIVIDUALS TO START THINKING ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN DO TO HELP EACH OTHER OUT INSTEAD OF COUNTING ON GOVERNMENT TO DO EVERYTHING .
YEAH WELL THAT S THAT S THE THAT S THE POINT WE VE GOTTEN TO YOU KNOW EVERY TIME SOMEBODY WANTS SOMETHING THEY ALWAYS TURN TO THE GOVERNMENT AND Y THE GOVERNMENT S GOING TO BE LIMITED I WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO GET THE MONEY THEY RE GOING TO GET IT FROM US AND WE CAN DO IT A LOT MORE EFFICIENTLY THAN THE GOVERNMENT .
YEAH .
WE DO NT NEED TO ADD FOURTEEN LAYERS OF BUREAUCRACY TO A PROGRAM .
EXACTLY .
UM THE THING THAT CARTER WORKS ON UH HABITATS FOR HUMANITY I WAS INVOLVED IN THAT W UH IN MONTGOMERY BEFORE I CAME UP TO NORTH CAROLINA .
UHHUH .
AND UH IT WAS IT WAS A PRETTY NEAT LITTLE PROGRAM WE D JUST GO OUT AND THEY WOULD BUY A PLOT OF LAND AND CONTRACTORS AND BUILDERS AND EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD DONATE THEIR THEIR TIME AND UH THE MATERIALS WERE AT COST AND WE D PUT UP HOUSES AND THAT WAS KIND THAT WAS KIND OF NEAT I UH IN A WAY I THINK IT S A LITTLE BIT INEFFICIENT BUT BUT IT S BETTER THAN NOTHING .
YEAH .
AND AND AT LEAST I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF SEEING TWO FAMILIES MOVE INTO DECENT HOUSING UM COURSE ON THE OTHER HAND I CAN START COMPLAINING VERY LOUDLY ABOUT PEOPLE ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE WHO ARE QUITE CAPABLE OF DOING SOMETHING FOR THEMSELVES BUT JUST WO NT .
YES .
BECAUSE IT S FAR MORE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR THEM TO SIT THERE AND JUST DRAW UH WELFARE MONEY THAN IT IS TO WORK UH WE DID A UH A COST COMPARISON IN ONE OF MY COURSES AND WE TOOK ALL THE BENEFITS THAT A FAMILY THAT A A MARRIED COUPLE WITH TWO KIDS WOULD GET UNDER WELFARE AND WHAT THEY WOULD BE MAKING AT MINIMUM WAGE AND THEY CAME OUT FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS BETTER A YEAR BY TAKING WELFARE .
YES .
SO THERE S NO INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO DO ANYTHING FAR BETTER FOR THEM TO SIT ON THEIR BUTTS AND DRAW THE MONEY .
YEAH ONE OF THE THINGS THEY TRIED TO PUSH THROUGH IN MARYLAND AND UH WERE NT VERY SUCCESSFUL WAS THAT IF YOU WERE AN ABLEBODIED PERSON ON WELFARE .
YOU HAD TO DO SOMETHING .
YOU HAD TO DO SOME WORK AND .
YEAH A AN AND THAT S BEEN TRIED THAT WAS TRIED IN ALABAMA TOO AND IT GOT SHOT DOWN .
YEAH .
I D AND I DO NT UNDERSTAND THE REASONING FOR IT I REALLY DO NT IT IT SEEMS PERFECTLY LOGICAL THAT IF SOMEBODY S GOING TO TAKE PUBLIC MONEY THEN THEY SHOULD RETURN SOMETHING TO THE PUBLIC I MEAN IF NOTHING ELSE GO OUT ALONG AN INTERSTATE AND PICK UP GARBAGE .
THAT S EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE TRYING TO GET THEM TO DO .
YEAH WHAT DO THEY WHAT DO THEY DO IN MARYLAND DO THEY USE HIGHWAY PEOPLE OR DO THEY USE PRISONERS .
UM BOTH .
YEAH THA THAT S THE WAY THEY DID IT IN ALABAMA TOO .
YEAH THEY USE BOTH .
U USUALLY YOU D SEE THESE BIG CHAIN GANGS OUT THERE PICKING UP TRASH .
UH THEY HAVE A THEY HAVE ANOTHER PROGRAM IN MARYLAND THAT S CALLED ADOPT A HIGHWAY .
UHHUH UHHUH YEAH WE HAVE THAT HERE IN NORTH CAROLINA .

THEY THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY THEY BELONG THERE AND THEY VE BELONGED THERE FOREVER AND THE PALESTINIANS AND THE ARABS ARE UH MORE OR LESS THEY THEY CONSIDER THEM .
SECOND CLASS .
UHHUH .

I DO NT UH I DO NT KNOW IF THAT CONTRIBUTES TO THE PROBLEM .
WELL HOW DID THEY FEEL ABOUT THE UH THE UNITED STATES INTERVEN INTERVENING WITH PATRIOT MISSILES DID DID THEY .
OH UH I M I M SURE THIS IS THE ONE TIME THAT THE ISRAELIS ARE REALLY HAPPY TO HAVE THEIR BIG BROTHERS THE AMERICANS .

THEY THEY DO NT REALLY WANT THEM AROUND BUT THEY LIKE THEM AROUND BECAUSE THEY DO ALL THE MENIAL LABOR AND SUCH .
UHHUH .

AND I DO NT KNOW BEING I I LIVE IN UH VERMONT AND BEING UP HERE WE PRETTY MUCH TREAT EVERYBODY YOU KNOW AS SOMEONE .
THAT HAS MERIT EVEN IF THEY RE POOR OR IF THEY RE HISPANIC OR IF THEY RE BLACK .
WE GIVE EVERYBODY PRETTY MUCH THE BENEFIT OF A DOUBT BECAUSE WE DO NT SEE ALL THE CRIME AND ALL THE HURT IN THE BIG CITIES YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
I IF I LIVED IN WASHINGTON D C I THINK I D HAVE A DIFFERENT ATTITUDE ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE BECAUSE I VE HEARD THAT IT IT THE THEY RE TERRIBLE YOU KNOW IT S JUST LIKE IT S A DOG EAT DOG WORLD .
AND HERE YOU KNOW ALL ALL MY BLACK FRIENDS ARE PROFESSIONALS AND THEY RE THEY DO NT YOU KNOW THEY DO NT GO OUT AND ABUSE DRUGS AND THEY THEY SEND THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL AND THEY THEY THEY UH YOU KNOW REALLY ENCOURAGE THEM TO GO TO COLLEGE AND STUFF .

HOUSTON IS NOT AT ALL .

I MEAN OUR RED LIGHT DISTRICT I MEAN UH YOU COULD GO WALKING AROUND DOWN THERE AND PRETTY MUCH NOT FEAR FOR YOUR LIFE YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
AND WE RE JUST SO PROTECTED .
BUT IT S IT S OVER IN THE MID EAST ESPECIALLY ISRAEL IT S JUST LIKE ISRAELIS HAVE A LIKE A TOTALITARIAN SYSTEM WHEN IT COMES TO THE PALESTINIANS .
YOU KNOW THE ISRAELIS CAN DO ANYTHING .
THEY WANT BUT WHEN IT COMES TO PALESTINIANS IF THEY RE OUT IN THE STREET AT NIGHT IT S IT S REALLY LOOKED ON AS ODD .
UM USUALLY THEY RE THEY RE BUSSED IN TO THE THE UM JEWISH NEIGHBORHOODS AND THE JEWISH CITIES AND THEN AT NIGHT .
THEY RE BUSSED OUT TO THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES .
HUH .
SO THEY DO NT HAVE THAT .
BUT UH WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE MESS .
THAT S WE VE CREATED IN IRAQ .
I THINK IT S UNFORTUNATE UH AS FAR AS THE KURDS ARE CONCERNED IT I THI .
IT S JUST WHAT DO YOU DO FOR THEM YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING FOR THEM BUT YOU DO NT WANT TO GET SO DIRECTLY INVOLVED THAT YOU RE OCCUPYING THE THE COUNTRY .
YEAH YEAH WE CA NT GET INVOLVED IN THEIR CIVIL WAR UM UNFORTUNATELY BUT WE VE KIND OF DRIVEN THESE PEOPLE OUT .
TO DO IT YEAH BUT YOU SEE PRESIDENT BUSH IS TELLING THEM REBEL YOU KNOW UH UPRISE .
AND THAT S WHAT .
THEY DID AND NOW THEY RE LIKE ASKING HIM FOR HELP AND HE S LIKE NO WE CA NT GET INVOLVED .
WHAT .
MY HUSBAND HAD VERY STRONG FEELINGS HE UH AGREED WITH UM THE GENERAL SCHWARTZKOPF HE SAID UM HE SHOULD HAVE LET BUSH SHOULD HAVE LET HIM FINISH HIS JOB .
SURE .
HE SHOULD HE SHOULD HAVE LET THEM UM CORNER THE REPUBLICAN GUARDS .
WELL I THINK THE WAR ENDED TOO SOON .
YEAH EXACTLY THAT S WHAT .
EVERYONE SAYS .

E EVERYONE .
I TALK TO THEY SAYS YOU KNOW IT S REAL EASY TO SAY THAT .
WE WE DID NT DAMAGE ENOUGH OF THEIR ARSENAL .
WE DAMAGED MOST OF IT BUT WE WE SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN MADE SURE WE GOT EVERYTHING .
YEAH I DO NT THINK THE HIGHER UPS WERE THINKING ABOUT WH WHAT .
THIS GUY S GOING TO DO WITH THE REST OF HIS WAR MACHINE .
THEY RE GOING OH WELL IT S NOT GOING TO HURT US SO WE RE JUST GOING TO LET THEM GO BUT REALLY WE DID NT THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT HE WAS GOING TR AND I MEAN HE HE S JUST .
UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH THE THE ORIGINAL GOAL OF THE MISSION WAS TO DRIVE THEM OUT OF KUWAIT .
AND ONCE THAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED IT .
THEY YEAH THEY THEY DID THEY STUCK RIGHT TO THEIR GOALS .
YEAH .
AND RIGHT WHAT .
THEY WERE GOING TO SAY .
AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHEN THIS FIRST STARTED THEY WERE EVEN RELUCTANT TO LET THEM DO THAT .
YEAH .
SO THEY WERE THEY WERE PLAYING IT VERY SAFE BUT YOU KNOW IT AN OUNCE .
WHAT DO THEY SAY AN OUNCE OF HIND SIGHT IS WORTH WHATEVER .
YEAH .
TH THEY I DO NT KNOW THEY IT SCHWARTZ SCHWARTZKOPF KNEW WHAT HAD TO BE DONE AND IT S TOO BAD THAT HE JUST DID NT HAVE THE ABILITY JUST TO DO IT TO YOU KNOW THE UH THE GO AHEAD TO DO IT .
YEAH .
BECAUSE HE HAD THE FU HE KNEW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN MORE THAN ANY OF US .
BECAUSE I DID NT REALIZE THAT UM IT WAS GOING TO MAKE SUCH A MESS .

YEARS BUT UH .
THE WEST PART OF THE STATE IS AND THEN THE EAST PART OF THE STATE HAS GOT ALL THE BLEEDING HEARTS AND ALL THE WELFARE CASES SO .
THERE YOU GO I DO NT KNOW THAT S A DIFFERENT TOP SUBJECT .
RIGHT .
ALTOGETHER BUT UH I DO NT KNOW I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD FEEL IT IS SAME WAY IF THEY WERE TOUCHED BY CRIME I THINK EVERYONE WOULD YOU AND I THINK ARE HONEST AND CANDID BECAUSE WE COULD DO IT ON IN THIS .
RIGHT .
VEHICLE UH BUT I THINK EVERYBODY IF THEY WERE TOUCHED BY IT WOULD SAY IF THEY HAD ANY SENSE OF RAGE THAT COULD BE BROUGHT OUT .
SURE .
I THINK EVERY HUMAN DOES I THINK THEY D SAY YEAH DO IT IF SOMEBODY IN MY FAMILY OR IF IT HAPPENED IT ME YOU KNOW .
YEAH .

IF YOUR FRIENDS OR FAMILY GOT UH HAD THAT HAPPEN TO THEM I THINK EVERYONE WOULD I THEY D .
UHHUH .
PROBABLY PULL THE TRIGGER THEMSELVES OR FLIP THE SWITCH THEMSELVES AND WITH A SMILE ON THEIR FACE .
YEAH I JUST .
AS THEY DID IT .
DO NT THINK THAT UH YOU CAN REHABILITATE I MEAN I JUST DO NT UH OH I DID A PAPER BACK IN COLLEGE A LONG TIME AGO FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE CLASS AND I JUST THE SUBJECT I REMEMBER WE DREW THINGS OUT OF A HAT AND IT WAS SOMETHING UH IT WAS BASICALLY THE ESSENCE WAS DOES THE CRIME FIT THE PUNISHMENT AND WHEN YOU SEE HOW MANY REPEAT OFFENDERS THERE ARE UH CHECK CHECK FRAUD CASES WHERE THEY GO TO JAIL FOR FIVE TO TEN YEARS AND UH RAPE RAPIST GETTING THEIR HAND .
YEAH .
JUST SLAPPED YOU KNOW AND HOW IT IS BASED ON THE JUDGE AND IF THE TIME OF DAY THAT THE COURT IS IN SESSION .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW ALL THESE UH I I INTANGIBLE THINGS AND YOU RE THINKING OH YOU WOULD NOT ONLY WOULD YOU NOT WANT TO BE A VICTIM YOU WOULD NT WANT TO BE A CRIMINAL EITHER .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE YOU WOULD NT KNOW WHAT YOU RE GETTING UH .
RIGHT .
BUT I DO NT KNOW METHODS OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT I HAVE NO OPINIONS ON THAT EITHER I JUST .
WELL UH I UH YEAH I DO NT KNOW I THINK THE OLD GAS CHAMBER SEEMS TO BE ABOUT THE MOST PAINLESS BECAUSE I GUESS IT S A PRETTY .
UHHUH .
PRETTY ROUGH THING TO BE UH ELECTROCUTED .
IS IT UH HOW ABOUT THE INJECTION .
OH YEAH AN INJECTION .
IS THAT SUPPOSE TO BE .

I M NOT EVEN SURE IN THE SPLIT AMONG THE FIFTY STATES DO YOU KNOW WHICH WAY IT IS THE RATIO IT S MORE THAN ARE NT UH THA IT S MORE THAT DO NT HAVE IT .
I THINK .
IS NT THAT CORRECT .
YEAH THERE S MORE THAT DO NT HAVE IT BUT AMAZINGLY IT S LIKE UH MASSACHUSETTS WENT BACK .
UHHUH .
AND REINSTATED CAPITAL PUNISHMENT OH MAYBE SIX OR SEVEN YEARS AGO .
UHHUH .
I DO NT KNOW IF THEY VE USED IT SINCE THEN SINCE THEY VE REINSTATED IT BUT UH IT S ON THE BOOKS .
YEAH I DO NT KNOW IF THEY VE THEY DID SOMETHING ABOUT I M NOT SURE IF TEXAS MINNESOTA I THEY DID NT THEY DID NT THEY WERE AGAIN WELL DID THEY HAVE IT THEY WERE AGAINST IT UH TEXAS AS I SAID HAS IT BUT I HAVE NT BEEN BACK HERE LONG ENOUGH TO TO REALIZE WHETHER OR NOT .
RIGHT .
IF THEY VE DONE IT IN THE LAST .
WELL I ALWAYS THINK I M PAYING TOO MUCH TAXES HOW ABOUT YOU .
YEAH OH DEFINITELY SEEMS LIKE .
ALTHOUGH AT LEAST TEXAS DOES NT HAVE A STATE INCOME TAX YET I MEAN YOU KNOW THEY KEEP THREATENING US THAT MAYBE THERE WILL BE A DAY THAT THEY RE GOING TO UH ENACT THIS I THINK UH THE UM OTHER MEANS OF PROVIDING INCOME FOR THE STATE HAVE BEEN DWINDLING SO THEY KEEP TRYING TO SAY WE MAY NEED A UH STATE INCOME TAX .
YEAH I THINK THAT UH WE PROBABLY WILL HAVE TO HAVE HAVE TO UH HAVE A STATE INCOME TAX BECAUSE UH TEXANS DO NT APPROVE OF SUCH THINGS AS LOTTERIES UH WELL I I COME HERE FROM NEW YORK AND NEW YORK HAD A STATE LOTTERY .
UHHUH .
AND IT REALLY RAISED A LOT OF MONEY FOR THE FOR THE STATE .
UH ALTHOUGH WE IN NEW YORK WE HAD TO PAY A STATE AND A CITY UH TAX AND IT WAS REALLY A GREAT RELIEF WHEN I GOT TO TEXAS THAT I DID NT HAVE TO PAY THAT CITY INCOME TAX THOUGH .
YEAH MAKES QUITE A BIT OF DIFFERENCE IN YOUR UH WELL YOUR INCOME LEVEL .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW BECAUSE OTHER STATES QUITE A BI A CHUNK OUT FOR UH CITY AND STATE TAXES SO YOU RE UH LOOKING AT YOUR YEARLY SALARY IT MAKES QUITE A DIFFERENCE .

EIGHT POINT FIVE .
SOMETHING LIKE THAT FOR THE UH SALES TAX .
UHHUH .
WHICH YEAH THAT REALLY IS PRETTY HIGH .
IS IT THE S IS IT UH LESS IN COLLIN COUNTY THAN IT IS IN DALLAS COUNTY .
I THINK SO ALTHOUGH I REALLY I DO NT GO UP THERE TOO MUCH I MEAN I I NORMALLY JUST KIND OF GO TO RICHARDSON SQUARE MALL OR VALLEY VIEW MALL JUST KIND OF FOR THE CONVENIENCE OR I GUESS MAYBE IF I WAS GOING TO BUY A CAR OR SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
MAYBE I WOULD CONSIDER WHERE I WAS BUYING IT TO TRY TO YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
SAVE A LITTLE BIT ON THAT SALES TAX BECAUSE ON A CAR THAT REALLY MO KIND OF MOUNTS UP .

RIGHT .
IT DO NT MATTER WHAT THEIR EXCESSES WERE AND I BELIEVE AT THE TIME THAT I WAS DOWN THERE THAT UH THE GOVERNMENT UH THE SALVADORIAN GOVERNMENT MUMBLEX YOU KNOW REALLY GOTTEN OUT OF HAND YET THE UH RIGHT WING DEATH SQUAD TYPE SITUATION I BELIEVE THAT THAT WAS BEGINNING TO FORM BUT I DO NT I I WAS NT REALLY AWARE OF IT S BEING YOU KNOW TERRIBLY UH YOU KNOW MUMBLEX AT THE TIME THAT THAT I WAS DOWN THERE I THINK THAT REALLY KIND OF DEVELOPED A LITTLE BIT LATER ON BUT UH OUR POLICIES SEEM TO BE PRETTY MUCH ONE OF UH YOU KNOW TRYING TO SETUP BUSINESSES DOWN THERE AND USE THE ONE RESOURCE ANYWAY THAT SALVADOR HAD PLENTY OF AND THAT WAS PEOPLE .
RIGHT .
WE DID NT SEEM TO BE GOING IN AND TAKING ANYTHING OUT OF THE COUNTRY OTHER THAN JUST IT S IT S LABOR .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE EVERYTHING THAT T I DID ANYWAY WE WE SHIPPED IN AND IT WAS WORKED ON DOWN THERE ASSEMBLED AND THEN SENT BACK HERE SO .
UHHUH DID THAT HAVE .
I DID NT FEEL THAT WE REALLY EX EXPLOITING THEM ANY .
UM SO YOU DO NT YOU DO NT FEEL THAT THAT WE WERE UM EXPLOITING IN THE SENSE OF WE WERE BENEFITING AND THEY WERE NT .
NO UH IN THE PARTICULAR INCIDENCE THAT I WAS AWARE OF NOW T I WAS NT THE ONLY ONES IN THERE PLAYTEX WAS IN THERE WAS UH SEVERAL OTHER COMPANIES .
UHHUH .
AND UH OF COURSE WE KIND OF CONCENTRATE ON MUMBLEX THERE WAS NT MUCH TO TAKE OUT OF THE COUNTRY MUMBLEX I FELT LIKE WE RE GOING IN AND TAKEN ALL THEIR UM THEIR GOLD OR OIL .
UHHUH .
OR BANANAS OR COFFEE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE UH IT JUST THE ONLY THING THAT THEY HAD A GREAT ABUNDANCE OF WAS UH YOU KNOW HUMAN BEINGS AND UH .
UHHUH DI DID WE TEND TO UM CHANGE THEIR ATTITU ATTITUDES LIKE SOMETIMES WHEN AMERICANS GO INTO FOREIGN COUNTRIES THEY TEND TO FLAUNT AMERICAN THINGS AMERICANISM UM CONSUMER PRODUCTS T V THE WHOLE WORKS .
YEAH I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU SAY THERE WAS A UH THE TIME THAT I WAS DOWN THERE I STAYED QUITE A A BIT AT THE UH UH ONE OF THE BIG HOTELS SAN SALVADOR AND AT THE TIME I THOUGHT THERE OUGHT TO BE A LAW AGAINST AMERICAN TOURISTS BECAUSE THEY FOR THE MOST PART TEND TO BE THE MOST OBNOXIOUS AS A AS A GROUP AND I SAW THIS IN PANAMA ALSO .
UHHUH .
UH OH YOU KNOW IT S IT S THE UH THE ALMOST STEREOTYPE YOU KNOW FLOWERY SHIRT SHORTS CAMERA HANGING AROUND THEIR NECK YOU KNOW DEMANDING THIS THAT AND THE OTHER THING YOU KNOW WE RE WE RE HERE AND WE WANT THIS AND WE WANT THAT AND THAT SORT OF THING THAT S THAT S THE STEREOTYPE THAT S VERY STRONG DOWN THERE YOU KNOW THE THE THE YOU KNOW THAT SORT OF THING I I I BELIEVE THOSE OF US WHO WERE WORKING DOWN THERE GOT A LITTLE BIT MORE APPRECIATION FOR YOU KNOW THE LOCAL UH CULTURE MUMBLEX I REALLY DO NT BELIEVE THAT WE WERE QUITE THAT BAD BUT YET THEY WERE HAVING TO DEAL DIRECTLY WITH UH YOU KNOW WITH THE UH THE LOCAL PEOPLE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND UH BUT BOY THERE IS A THERE IS A BAD UH UH YOU KNOW THE OLD BRASH OR UGLY AMERICANTYPE .
UHHUH .
SITUATION AND I SAW INCIDENCES IN THE HOTEL WHERE I JUST WANTED TO GO OVER AND CRAWL IN THE CORNER AND SAY OH MY GOD THOSE ARE THOSE ARE NOT AMERICANS THEY CA NT BE .
RIGHT .
BUT THERE ARE AND UH OF COURSE NOW I I DO HAVE TO I REMEMBER ONE CASE WHERE WE HAD SOME CANADIANS IN THERE WHO WERE EVERY BIT AS BAD BUT I MEAN IT I THINK IT S JUST KIND OF THE NORTH AMERICAN SITUATION MUMBLEX IN PANAMA THEY VE BEEN USED TO AMERICANS DOWN THERE FOR SO DARN LONG BUT I DID NT SEE QUITE AS MUCH OF THAT SORT OF THING AS PANAMANIANS ARE JUST ABOUT AS AS UH AS MUMBLEX AS AMERICANS AS FAR AS UH CREATURE COMFORTS YOU KNOW THEY RE UH THEY RE THEY RE EVERY BIT UH I I KNOW WHEN MY MY SON WAS IN THE AIR FORCE AND HE WAS STATIONED IN PANAMA AND HE MARRIED A PANAMANIAN GIRL AND WHEN SHE CAME UP HERE UH YOU KNOW SHE S Y KN EXCEPT FOR THE LANGUAGE SITUATION SOME OF THE CULTURES SHE S JUST ABOUT AN AMERICAN .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW IS AS FAR AS T V AND AND YOU KNOW THE THE MONEYMAKING PART OF IT AND ALL THAT MATTER OF FACT IF ANYTHING SHE S WORSE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
BUT UH UH IT IT JUST THERE S LITTLE ENCLAVES DOWN THERE WHERE YOU KNOW AMERICANS HAVE A LOT OF INFLUENCE AND THE LOCAL POPULATION KIND OF UM YOU KNOW SORT OF ACCEPTS THAT BUT I VE ALSO SEEN THE OTHER SIDE OF IT TOO .
UHHUH .
WELL YOU WERE IN PERU .
YEAH I WAS IN PERU BUT UM I THERE WERE NT AS I RECALL OR AT LEAST I WAS NT AWARE OF THAT MANY AMERICANS THERE EXCEPT FOR A VERY HEAVY CONCENTRATION OF PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEERS .
UHHUH .
THIS WAS WHEN THE PEACE CORPS FIRST ARE STARTED .
UHHUH .
AND IT WAS ONE OF THE BIG TARGETS AND UM I DO NT I DO NT THINK AT THAT TIME AT LEAST PEACE CORPS WAS UH AN OBNOXIOUS GROUP IN THE SENSE THAT THAT WE WERE VERY CONTROLLED REGARDING NUMBER OF DAYS OFF AND .
OH .
AND YOU COULD NT JUST TAKE UP TAKE OFF AND LEAVE YOUR GROUP AND GO EXPLORE AND AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
BUT AND I WAS WORKING ACTUALLY IN THE SAVINGS AND LOAN PROGRAM SO THAT WAS QUITE SPECIALIZED ALTHOUGH I WAS LIVING IN THE SLUMS I WAS REALLY WORKING WITH THE MIDDLE CLASS .
UHHUH WHAT UH WHAT AREA DID YOU LIVE IN .
I WAS UP IN AREQUIPA .
OH OKAY YEAH .

UHHUH .
THAT HAD GONE IN AND AND SOME OF THEM WERE QUITE BIG IN THE SENSE THEY WERE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND THEY WERE BUILDING SCHOOLS AND DOING COOPS AND THINGS LIKE THAT HEALTH UM INOCULATION AND AND THINGS .
OH HAS THOSE INFLUENCES LASTED MUMBLEX DO YOU KNOW WHETHER THE THE THINGS THAT THAT YOU AND YOUR GROUPS BEFORE YOU DID DID THOSE DID THOSE LIVE ON OR WERE THEY REABSORBED OR HOW .
NO NO I BELIEVE THEY DID BECAUSE UM SOME OF SOME OF THE THE PEACE CORPS UH THAT I KNEW OF DID MARRY PERUVIANS .
UHHUH .
AND HAVE BEEN BACK AND EVERY NOW AND THEN SOME NEWS FILTERS IN THAT THEY WENT TO SEE SOME OF THE OLD THINGS AND OF COURSE THE SAVINGS AND LOAN PROGRAM UM THAT WAS THAT YOU KNOW THAT THAT JUST CONTINUED TO GROW IN FACT AFTER MY GROUP I MEAN WE WERE JUST A VERY SMALL SPECIALIZED GROUP TOO TO GET THAT GOING AND SPREAD AND THEN OF COURSE PEACE CORPS BOWED OUT OF THAT BECAUSE THAT S UH UH SOMETHING THAT NATIONALIZED VERY QUICKLY .
UHHUH .
AND THE SAME WITH THE COOPS .
WELL THAT S THAT WAS KIND OF THE THE AIM WAS NT IT TO GET IT STARTED AND THEN HAVE IT .
RIGHT .
TAKEN UP BY THE OH OKAY O SO YOU KNOW WELL THAT S I HAD WONDERED SOMETIMES I KNEW THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF A LOT OF EFFORT AND A LOT OF WORK WENT INTO A LOT OF THAT AND I JUST WONDERED IF IF IT LASTED AND IF IT TOOK YOU KNOW LIKE .

HUHUH .
BUT ONCE THEY GET STARTED IT S REALLY IT SAVES THEM MONEY IN THE END AND IT CUTS DOWN ON THE END PRODUCT THAT HAS TO BE DEALT WITH SOME OTHER WAY .
HUHUH .
AND IF THEY WOULD ALL THAT S WHAT THAT S WHAT WE WANT DONE IS WE WANT INDUSTRY TO TAKE YOU KNOW MORE RESPONSIBILITY IN TAKING CARE OF IT .

ALL RIGHT OKAY .
OKAY SO UH WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT UH WHAT DO WHAT DO WHAT DO YOU THINK WE CAN DO TO SOLVE THE CRIME IN AMERICA .
OH IF I KNEW THAT I D BE A VERY WEALTHY PERSON .
YEAH BUT WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE THE STEPS .
WELL YOU HAVE TO SEE I THE WAY .
I LOOK AT IT YOU HAVE TO THINK FIRST OF ALL WHY OR HA HAS CRIME INCREASED AND IF SO WHY HAS CRIME INCREASED .
WELL SEE THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT UM WHAT HAPPENS IS AS THAT YOU RE UH YOU KNOW AS YOU GO FROM THE COUNTRY TO A CITY CRIME ALWAYS INCREASES RIGHT .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE IN THE COUNTRY PEOPLE STILL RESPECT UH THE PROPERTY OF OTHER PEOPLE .
RIGHT .
AND SO AS AS AND THE PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY DO NT WANT AS MUCH AS THE PEOPLE IN THE CITY .
UHHUH .
NOW WHAT HAPPENS IS ALL THOSE .
THAT DO NT HAVE ANY MONEY IN THE COUNTRY MOVE TO THE CITIES AND THEY RUSH TO GET THE SAME THING .
THEY SAY WHY CA NT WE HAVE THE SAME THINGS THAT THESE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE AND THE THING THAT WE CAN DO IS WE NEED MONEY FOR DRUGS AND WHAT .
WE HAVE TO DO IS WE HAVE TO GO UH GET SOME STUFF STEAL IT AND THEN YOU KNOW JUST RESELL IT .
IT S EASY YOU SAID THE MAGIC WORD THERE .
WHICH .
ONE .
DRUGS .
YEAH .
AND THAT CERTAINLY IS ONE REASON WHY CRIME HERE HAS INCREASED .
THAT S UH THAT S UH THE MAIN REASON .
I THINK UH EVERYWHERE BECAUSE UH YOU HAVE DEATHS .
I MEAN I MEAN YOU HAVE MURDERS AND YOU HAVE YOU KNOW PEOPLE STEALING OTHER PEOPLE S STUFF AND THAT S A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH DRUGS .
OH YES .
IT DOES NT HAVE TO DO I MEAN THE THING IS IS THAT YOU KNOW IT S LIKE YOU MIGHT BE STANDING SOMEWHERE RIGHT AND LIKE LET S SAY YOU YOU RE YOU RE YOU KNOW YOU RE DRIVING OUT AND YOU RE DRIVING BACK HOME AND IT S LATE AT NIGHT .
AND YOU STOP BY ONE OF THESE YOU KNOW TWENTYFOUR HOUR YOU KNOW GAS STATIONS JOINTS .
YEAH .
AND UH SOMEBODY WALKS IN THERE WITH A GUN .
I MEAN THEY RE GOING TO WANT THE MONEY AND YOU CAN TELL BY THE PEOPLE .
WHO ARE ALWAYS CAUGHT THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE THERE TO GET MONEY FOR DRUGS .
I MEAN THEY DO NT WANT THE MONEY SO UH SO THEY CAN DO SOMETHING ELSE WITH IT .
NO THEY DO NT WANT THE MONEY FOR FOOD THAT S FOR SURE .
RIGHT RIGHT AND SO .
WELL BUT YOU KNOW THE THE STRANGE THING UH PERHAPS NOT STRANGE BUT SOMETHING THAT MANY PEOPLE DO NT REALIZE IS THAT YOU CAN GO BACK AS FAR AS NINETEEN FIFTYONE AND FIFTYTWO AND FIND THAT THERE WERE DRUG DEALERS AT THAT TIME TRYING TO INFLUENCE THE HIGH SCHOOL KIDS BECAUSE UH I M A RETIRED EDUCATOR .
OKAY .
AND IN FIFTYONE AND FIFTYTWO THE POLICE CAME TO THE HIGH SCHOOL WHERE I WAS AND WERE TELLING US HOW TO RECOGNIZE WHEN KIDS WERE ON DRUGS HOW TO RECOGNIZE THE PUSHERS .
YEAH .
OUTSIDE THE ONE ENTRANCE THAT THEY WERE GIVING THEIR DRUGS AWAY IN ORDER TO GET THE KIDS STARTED AND SO ON AND SO ON .
SO IT S A PROBLEM .
THAT S BEEN AROUND FOR OVER FORTY YEARS AND WE RE JUST REALLY UH UH NOW TRYING TO UH FIGURE OUT HOW TO COPE WITH THE PROBLEM BECAUSE IT HAS GROWN SO HUGE .
YEAH THERE S A THERE S A UH A SONG THAT I KNOW WHICH SAYS YOU KNOW THA IT S LIKE IN UH NINETEEN EIGHTYEIGHT NINETEEN EIGHTYNINE THE LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS SPENT THE LEAST AMOUNT OF MONEY ON CRIME IN AMERICA AND UH THEIR FIGURES I THINK ARE TOO SO I MEAN IT S LIKE COMPARED TO YOU KNOW COMPARED TO WEAPONS OR STUFF LIKE THAT I MEAN YOU RE SPENDING NOTHING ON ON CRIME IN THE COUNTRY .
ITSELF .
WHAT .
YOU RE DOING IS YOU YOU KNOW IT S LIKE YOU HAVE OTHER THINGS YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE AIDS WE RE GOING TO SOLVE TRY TO SOLVE .
UHHUH .
THE AIDS PROBLEM WHILE WHILE YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE ARE GETTING KILLED HERE AND THERE AND THEN .
YEAH AND ANOTHER ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS THAT THE PEOPLE .
WHO ARE THE DEALERS THE BIG DEALERS IN DRUGS .
UHHUH .
MAY BE MAY BE PART OF THE POWER STRUCTURE .
THAT S KEEPING US FROM SPENDING THE MONEY IN THAT DIRECTION .
BUT THOSE PEOPLE NEVER GET CAUGHT .
THE PEOPLE THAT .
THAT S RIGHT THEY LL NEVER GET CAUGHT .
THAT THAT I SEE THEIR THEORY IS THAT IF I M SURROUNDED AND I M GOING TO BE CAUGHT I M GOING TO TRY TO FIND MY WAY THROUGH AND THEY RE NOT GOING TO TAKE ME ALIVE .
UHHUH .
BUT I HAVE SUCH A BIG ARMY OUTSIDE OF MY PLACE THAT NOBODY CAN TOUCH ME .
THAT S RIGHT .
BUT THEY LL .
YOU KNOW IT S LIKE OF COURSE I MEAN I MIGHT BE YOU KNOW THE .
THE LEADING DRUG DEALER HERE BUT YOU WO NT FIND ME DEALING IN DRUGS I MEAN THERE S NO CONNECTION .
THAT S RIGHT .
BETWEEN ME AND THE PEOPLE .
THAT WERE CAUGHT YOU KNOW .
THAT S RIGHT AND THEY ONE PERSON DOES NT KNOW THE OTHER PERSON DOWN THE LINE .
RIGHT .

S WHO S REALLY MAKING THE MILLIONS AND THE MILLIONS IS THE ONE .
WHO ALSO MANY TIMES IS PART OF THE POWER STRUCTURE UH THE UH AND HAD THE POLITICAL .

GOLLY .
I LIE .
HUH .

I DO NT KNOW IF I DID UNDERSTAND POLITICS I PROBABLY WOULD VOTE MORE .
UHHUH .
BUT LIKE I SAID IF I VOTED FOR BUSH OR LIKE WHEN UH GARY .

HART WAS RUNNING .
UHHUH .
A LOT OF WOMEN WOULD HAVE VOTED FOR HIM JUST BECAUSE HE WAS NICER LOOKING NOT THAT I THINK HE WAS GOOD LOOKING BUT .
YEAH .
HE WAS YOUNG .
YEAH .
AND THEN I DID NT THINK THAT WAS RIGHT BECAUSE HE MAY HAVE BEEN A GOOD PRESIDENT OR WHATEVER .
UHHUH .
BUT BECAUSE IT WHAT HE HAD AN AFFAIR .
YEAH YEAH .

YEAH .
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE GO BY THEIR UH PERSONAL LIFE WHEN THEY VOTE AND .
UHHUH YEAH .
WHICH .
I GUESS IF YOU GOT TURMOIL IN YOUR PERSONAL LIFE YOU RE GOING TO LET IT COME INTO WORK BUT .
UHHUH .
I M SURE THERE S A LOT OF PEOPLE .

IT S ALL SO SECRETIVE SEE WE REALLY DO NT SEE THE .
THAT S RIGHT .
THE TRUE PERSON ANYWAY .
I THINK THAT S THAT S HAVING A BIG EFFECT ON HOW POORLY THAT THE COUNTRY IS BEING RUN IS THAT UM THE THE ELECTION THE PEOPLE .
THAT WANT TO GET ELECTED ARE TURNING IT INTO A POPULARITY CONTEST BY ADVERTISING THE THINGS .
THAT .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW THAT REALLY DO NT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH HOW WELL THEY DO THE JOB .
BUT SEE THEY RE TRYING TO FIND AN EXCUSE NOT TO DEAL WITH WHAT YOU KNOW THE ISSUES THAT PEOPLE REALLY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT BECAUSE ON THOSE ISSUES YOU HAVE TO SAY YES OR NO .
AND IF THEY DO NT SAY YES OR NO THEN MAYBE SOMEBODY WILL VOTE FOR THEM .
THAT WOULD NT HAVE IF THEY HAD COME DOWN ON THE WRONG SIDE .
DO YOU KNOW WHAT .
I M SAYING .
RIGHT .
SO THEY JUST TRY AND MAKE IT .
A PERSONAL THING I MEAN IF YOU REMEMBER ANY OF THE T V COMMERCIALS FROM THE LAST PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN THEY .
ALL HAD UH PICTURES OF BUSH WITH HIS GRANDCHILDREN WALKING AROUND WITH HIS GRANDCHILDREN AND EVEN FROM REAGAN IT WAS ALL JUST LIKE LOOKS LIKE A MCDONALD S COMMERCIAL YOU KNOW .

DO YOU THINK HE WON FROM CARTER BECAUSE OF THE UM THE HOSTAGES .
THAT WERE HELD AT THAT TIME .
WELL I THINK THAT WAS PART OF IT I THINK THERE S A LOT OF THIN THE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS THAT THE COUNTRY WAS HAVING AT THE TIME AND THE THE RECESSION AND STUFF .
UHHUH .
PEOPLE JUST HAD A PICTURE OF CARTER AS NOT BEING REAL CAPABLE BUT HE ACTUALLY ALL RIGHT THIS I THOUGHT HE WAS GREAT .
I THOUGHT CARTER WAS GOOD TOO AND THAT WAS YEAH .
DID YOU .
I ALWAYS LIKED HIM I THOUGHT HE WAS GREAT AT THE TIME AND I I JUST COULD NT GET OVER THE FACT THAT REAGAN BEAT HIM .
I YOU KNOW THAT I JUST COULD NT BELIEVE THAT HE GOT VOTED OUT .
BUT I THINK I WAS NT WELL LET S SEE THAT S BEEN ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO RIGHT .
UHHUH YEAH .
OKAY SO I WAS ONLY FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN BUT I REMEMBER CARTER AND I LIKED HIM .
YOU DID .
HAVE YOU HEARD STUFF ABOUT HIM LATELY DO YOU KNOW WHAT .
HE S DOING .
NO I SURE DO NT .
WELL HE IS JUST HE IS REALLY ACTIVE STILL POLITICALLY .
HE S BEEN OVERSEAS .
YOU REMEMBER WHEN HE WAS IN OFFICE .
HE DID A LOT OF STUFF FOR THE MIDDLE EAST FOR PE .
WELL I LL TELL YOU WHY I FEEL SO I FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT THIS TOPIC I DO NT KNOW A WHOLE LOT ABOUT THE IMMIGRATION LAWS BUT I DO KNOW THAT IN THE WHERE I LIVE AND I TEACH SCHOOL THERE ARE SO MANY ORIENTALS THAT HAVE COME HERE AND THERE S A LOT OF MEXICAN PEOPLE TOO WHICH IS NOT NEITHER HERE NOR THERE BUT THE FACT IS THAT ALL THE ORIENTALS THAT ARE HERE ARE VERY AFFLUENT UH VERY WISE IN MONEY MATTERS AND HAVE TA HAVE TAKEN OVER A LOT OF BUSINESSES AND HAVE REALLY KI IT S KIND OF SCARY BECAUSE THEY RE SO BRIGHT THEY RE ALL THE KIDS THAT I HAVE THAT ARE ORIENTAL ARE REALLY FAR ABOVE THE AMERICAN KIDS AND THEY AND THE THE PARENTS ARE UNBELIEVABLE BECAUSE THEY ARE JUST ON THE WAY UP AND MONEY IS THEIR MAIN GOAL AND IT S K IT REALLY IS KIND OF SCARY BECAUSE THERE S THERE S JUST OODLES OF THEM AND YOU CAN NOT BELIEVE THE BUSINESSES AND CORPORATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN OVER BY ORIENTALS AND IT S K IT S KIND OF SCARES ME NOT THAT I DO NT WANT THEM HERE AND NOT THAT I DO NT APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW THAT THEY HAVE RIGHTS TOO BUT ON THE OTHER HAND YOU FEEL LIKE ALMOST THEY RE THEY RE INVADING US TO THE POINT WHERE THEY RE GOING TO TAKE OVER .
RIGHT ACTUALLY MY SON ONCE SAID THAT THAT PERHAPS UH WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS IS BUY A LITTLE SQUARE OF LAND SOME PLACE IN THE MIDWEST AND AND THAT MIGHT BE THE SOLUTION .
I THINK PROBABLY THAT S .
A GOOD IDEA .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE I LIVED IN IOWA FOR FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS BEFORE I CAME HERE AND I WAS BORN IN OHIO .
UHHUH .
SO IT IT REALLY AND THERE IS THERE ARE A LOT OF MEXICAN PEOPLE HERE BECAUSE WE RE SO CLOSE TO THE BORDER .
UHHUH .
AND AND THEY ARE WONDERFUL PEOPLE AND AND I M NOT YOU KNOW I DO NT WANT TO DENY THEM THEIR RIGHTS JUST THAT YOU YOU FEEL LIKE WHEN YOU WERE BORN AND RAISED HERE AND YOU WORKED RE VERY HARD TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY WHAT IT IS UH IT SCARES YOU WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE SOMEBODY S TAKING OVER AND A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE PLAN ONE DAY TO GO BACK YOU KNOW TO TO VIETNAM OR TO YOU KNOW TAIWAN OR WHEREVER THEY RE FROM AND TAKE WITH THEM A LOT OF AMERICAN DOLLARS PLUS A LOT OF POWER IN AMERICAN COM COM COMPANIES AND IT S KIND OF SCARY .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND YOU KNOW I DO NT KNOW I DO NT KNOW THE IMMIGRATION LAWS THAT UH THAT WELL AND I DO NOT AND IN FACT I DO NT KNOW THEM AT ALL I DO NT KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE THEY ALLOW IN THE UNITED STATES PER YEAR OR IF THERE S EVEN A I DO NT EVEN KNOW IF THERE IS A NUMBER THAT THEY ALLOW IN ANYMORE DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT .
NO I DO NT I DO NT KNOW I LIVED IN THE MIDDLE EAST FOR SOMETIME AND I I .
OH .
DO BELIEVE THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME SORT OF QUOTA SYSTEM BECAUSE UH I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WERE IN A SENSE NOT QUALIFIED IS THE WRONG WORD BUT CERTAINLY WERE DESERVING TO COME .
UHHUH .
AND IT SEEMED TO TAKE THEM A LONG TIME OR OR THERE WAS A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO COME .
YEAH .
AND SO I WOULD GUESS THAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE QUOTAS FOR DIFFERENT PLACES .
I WOULD THINK SO TOO IT .
YOU KNOW I I I THINK THERE S SOMETHING ABOUT BEING ABLE TO TO CLAIM UM IMMINENT DANGER OR I M NOT SURE WHAT THE TERMINOLOGY IS .
UHHUH UHHUH .
MAYBE POLITICAL A .
ASYLUM OF SOME SORT .
YEAH THERE THERE YOU GO YOU GOT THE TERM .
UHHUH .
AND MAYBE THAT S A AN ISSUE WITH A A LOT OF PEOPLE I DO NT KNOW BUT .
WELL .
YEAH I I GUESS I HAVE NT BEEN IN A SITUATION WHERE IT S IT S BEEN THREATENING TO TO ME UH .
WELL I TEACH IN THE SUBURB OF DALLAS AND AND UH MY KIDS GO TO SCHOOL IN ANOTHER SUBURB OF DALLAS AND WITH VERY VERY GOOD SCHOOL SYSTEMS AND THEY RE CONSIDERED YOU KNOW ONE OF THE TOP THREE IN THE STATE BOTH OF THEM YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
AND IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF THE ORIENTALS MAKE SURE THAT THEIR KIDS GO TO THESE SCHOOLS .
UHHUH .
AND THEY RE HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE A LOT OF THE KIDS HERE AND THE KIDS IN THIS AREA ARE VERY BRIGHT AND COME FROM YOU KNOW PARENTS THAT ARE PROFESSIONALS OR SEMIPROFESSIONALS AND AND UH VERY INTERESTED IN THEIR EDUCATION BUT UH I THINK IN THE LAST YEAR I M NOT IF I M NOT MISTAKEN IN FOUR OF THE SIX HIGH SCHOOLS THE GRADUATING CLASS VALEDICTORIAN AND SALUTATORIAN WERE UH ALM HALF OR MORE ORIENTAL .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND YOU KNOW THEY RE JUST EXTREMELY BRIGHT KIDS AND ALSO THEY VALUE LEARNING .
I WAS GOING TO SAY I M NOT S I I WOULD GUESS THAT IT S NOT THAT THEY ARE ANY BRIGHTER BUT THEY JUST MAYBE WORK HARDER OR .
WELL I I THINK THINGS COME EASY FOR THEM TOO BUT I DO THINK THAT THEY HAVE THAT WORK ETHIC THAT WE SOMEHOW HAVE MISSED THE BOAT IN WITH A LOT OF KIDS IN THE UNITED STATES I DO NT THEY UH DO NT WANT TO WORK FOR ANYTHING THEY WANT IT TO COME TO THEM BUT AND BE THERE BUT THEY DO NT WANT TO WORK HARD AND THESE KIDS WORK REALLY HARD .
RIGHT RIGHT MAY .
AND AND THEY HAVE .
BUT MAYBE PART OF THAT S THE PROBLEM THAT HERE WE VE WE VE LET THIS VALUE SLIP .
YEAH I KNOW I AGREE WITH THAT .
AND THEY NEED TO HAVE SOME COMPETITION .
BUT WHAT I SEE IS Y THE COMPETITION IS THERE BUT INSTEAD OF MEETING THE CHALLENGE THEY RE STARTING TO RESENT THEM .
UHHUH .
AND IT S CAUSING YOU KNOW I THINK SOME SOME PROBLEMS .
WELL THAT S TOO BAD .
IT REALLY IS .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE WE SEE A LOT OF RACIAL PROBLEMS IN DAL THE DALLAS AREA ANYWAY .
UHHUH .
ESPECIALLY IN DALLAS AND IT S MAINLY BLACK AND AND AND HISPANIC .
UHHUH UHHUH .
BUT UH THERE IS SOME THERE HAS BEEN SOME RESENTMENT WITH ORIENTALS IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY BECAUSE THEY VE STARTED BUSINESSES THERE AND THE BLACKS RESENT THEM COMING IN AND TAKING THEIR MONEY AND THERE S BEEN SOME VIOLENCE BECAUSE OF IT .
OH THAT S REALLY SAD .
IT IS IT S IT IS VERY SAD .
UHHUH .
SO YOU KNOW I REALLY I I VE I VE ALWAYS PRIDED MYSELF ON NOT BEING PREJUDICED AND BEING YOU KNOW UH WELCOME WELCOMING EVERYONE .
UHHUH .
THAT WANTS TO COME HERE AND EVEN WHEN I WAS YOUNGER WH WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE I WAS A MEMBER OF THE N A A C P BECAUSE I LIVED UP NORTH AND I WAS VERY INTO THAT THE HUMAN RIGHTS PART OF EVERYTHING .
UHHUH .
BUT I I VE I VE BECOME VERY CYNICAL .
UHHUH .
IN THE LAST THREE FOUR YEARS LIVING IN TEXAS .
WELL AND IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU FEEL THAT THERE IS NEED FOR CHANGE MAYBE THE UH YOU KNOW THE E THERE IS TOO BIG OF A CONCENTRATION COMING ALL AT ONCE TO TO ALLOW FOR ADEQUATE MELTING INTO THE SOCIETY .
UHHUH UHHUH WELL AND EXACTLY THAT S EXACTLY TRUE PLUS THE FACT THAT THESE PEOPLE DO COME FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TWO TWO THREE FOUR MAYBE FIVE YEARS AND THEN GO BACK AND PICK OUR BRAINS WHICH IS WONDERFUL AND TAKE ALL THAT BACK WITH THEM AND AND UH PLUS A LOT OF AMERICAN DOLLARS BUT IN IN THE LONG RUN MAYBE THAT S GOING TO MAKE A BETTER WORLD TOO .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW YOU JUST DO NT KNOW .
EXACTLY .
AN AND YET YOU KNOW WITH UH WITH UH THERE S SOMEBODY ON MY OTHER LINE BUT I M GOING TO IGNORE .
OH .
THAT UH ANYWAY I JUST YOU YOU KIND OF YOU DON YOU REALLY DO NT KNOW WHAT TO DO AND AND I DO NT I WANT MY KIDS TO HAVE VALUES WHERE THEY RE ACCEPTING AND SO FORTH .
UHHUH .
AND BOTH OF MY CHILDREN ARE REALLY TOL MORE TOLERANT OF BLACKS AND H HISPANICS THAN THEY ARE OF THE ORIENTALS .
UM .
FOR SOME REASON THEY FEEL YOU KNOW LIKE THEY VE TAKEN OVER THEY FEEL LIKE UH YOU KNOW THEY RE TAKING SOME OF THE THE REWARDS THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE .
RIGHT .
AND I REALLY DO NT WANT THAT TO HAPPEN .
RIGHT .
BUT .
RIGHT .
BUT IT S HAPPENING .
RIGHT .
AND I THINK A LOT OF THEIR FRIENDS FEEL THE SAME WAY TOO .
UHHUH UHHUH .
SO AND I REALLY DO WISH I KNEW ABOUT QUOTAS AND REALLY WISH I I REALLY DO WISH I I KNEW MORE ABOUT IMMIGRATION LAWS BECAUSE I HAVE NO IDEA ANY MORE .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE THEY VE CHANGED A GREAT DEAL .
I WOULD I WOULD SUSPECT THAT THEY HAVE WELL I GUESS UM I DO NT HAVE MUCH MUCH MORE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE TOPIC .
YEAH I DO NT REALLY EITHER I WISH I KNEW MORE .
YEAH .
PROBABLY IF I DID I MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT MORE UH TOLERANT .
UHHUH .
PERHAPS AND I AND EVEN IF I I REALLY WISH I KNEW THE SITUATIONS THEY WERE GOING BACK TO OR COMING FROM .
UHHUH .
YOU DO NT KNOW ANY OF THAT AND YOU FEEL YOU KNOW YOU CA NT PUT YOURSELF IN THEIR SHOES OR REALLY UNDERSTAND THEM .
RIGHT .
UNLESS AND FOR SOME REASON ORIENTALS ARE VERY UH MY GOOD FRIEND CALLS THEM PUSHY BUT I CALL THEM VERY THAT THEY KNOW WHAT THEY WANT AND THEY GO GET IT .
UHHUH .
AND IN STORES AND SO .
GOAL DIRECTED .
AND SO FORTH IT S WH PARDON ME .
GOAL DIRECTED .
YEAH BUT IN STORES AND THINGS SOMETIMES THEY CAN BE VERY IMPOLITE BECAUSE THEY CAN THEY GET IN FRONT OF YOU .
OH I SEE .
OR THEY UH THEY TAKE SOMETHING THAT YOU HAD IN MIND TO GET BEFORE YOU DID YOU KNOW JUST GOING FOR IT THEY TAKE IT QUICKLY .
UHHUH .
AND UH THEY DO NT THINK ANYTHING OF THAT AND I DO NT YOU KNOW THAT S MAKES PEOPLE RESENTFUL TOO AND SO .
SURE SURE .
AND YET THEY HAVE THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO BE HERE AND I KNOW THAT .
UHHUH .
BUT IT S IT SOMETIMES IT S GETS TOUCHY .
UHHUH UHHUH .

IS THAT RIGHT .
AND UH OF ALL OF ALL VARIETIES AND WITH THE SAME YOU KNOW SOME OF THE SOME OF THE SAME PROBLEMS THAT YOU VE MENTIONED BUT UH I DO NT KNOW I GUESS I WAS NT INVOLVED ENOUGH TO TO UH REALLY STOP TO THINK ABOUT IT .
UHHUH WELL I YOU KNOW SINCE I TEACH I SEE TH SEE IT AND AND I FEEL AND I LOVE THE EXAMPLE THAT MOST OF THESE CHILDREN GIVE THE OUR AMERICAN CHILDREN AND YET YOU KNOW I CAN SEE WHY SOME OF THE PARENTS ARE FEAR THAT ARE FEARFUL TOO .
UHHUH UHHUH .

UHHUH .
AND THIS PARTICULAR ONE HAS PEOPLE THAT ARE IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE .
UHHUH .
A LOT OF THEM HAVE HAD UM LIMBS AMPUTATED OR UM HAVE SERIOUS ILLNESSES .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THAT KIND OF THING AND UM I WATCHED THE INTERESTING THING WAS I WATCHED THIS PARTICULAR ONE CHANGE HANDS IT STARTED OUT JUST BEING A TERRIBLE PLACE FOR THE PEOPLE .

UHHUH .
AND CAME IN AND REMODELED THE WHOLE PLACE .
UHHUH .
HIRED NEW NURSES AND UH JUST REALLY JUST REDID IT YOU KNOW .
JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY WHAT WHAT KINDS OF THINGS WERE THEY DOING WHEN THEY WERE CONSIDERED A BAD PLACE .

UHHUH .
BUT THIS NEW COMPANY CAME IN AND THEY LIKE I SAID THEY REMODELED THE PLACE .
UHHUH .
AND IT SMELLS NICE WHEN YOU WALK IN AND IT LOOKS NICE AND THEY GOT LIKE SEVERAL NEW COLOR T V S FOR THE PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
AND REDID THE DINING ROOM WHERE THEY MADE IT YOU KNOW A LOT MORE PLACE FOR THEM TO BE .
UHHUH .
THEY MADE A LITTLE PATIO AREA WHERE THEY CAN GO OUTSIDE .
THAT S GREAT .
YEAH JUST YOU KNOW SMALL THINGS THAT MAKE IT SEEM A LOT MORE HOMEY .
YEAH .
YEAH AND IT S LIKE IT S A LOT MORE LIKE AN APARTMENT PLACE INSTEAD OF JUST UH .
I WOULD I WOULD PERSONALLY HATE TO KNOW THAT MY MOTHER OR GRANDMOTHER OR ANYONE IS IN A HOME LIKE THAT AND MY BIGGEST FEAR WOULD THAT THEY WOULD BE IS THAT THEY WOULD BE LONELY .
RIGHT .
AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE YOU KNOW JUST A LOT OF ACTIVITIES LIKE YOU SAID YOU KNOW JUST PUTTING A PLANT IN A ROOM .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW JUST MAKES JUST BRIGHTENS AND AND .
RIGHT .
AND JUST MAKES THEM JUST A LITTLE MORE ACTIVE TELEVISION .
UHHUH .
THEY CAN GO OUTSIDE AND JUST TO KNOW THAT THEY RE NOT YOU KNOW LAYING IN A ROOM .
RIGHT .
LOOKING AT GRAY WALLS YOU KNOW .

THAT THAT S WHAT WOULD JUST REALLY KILL ME .
YEAH .
I D LIKE TO KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THEY HAVE FRIENDS THERE .

UHHUH .
AND MAKE SURE THAT IT S NOT A PLACE LIKE THIS ONE WAS .
I DID NT REALIZE THAT THERE WERE GROUPS THAT GO IN LIKE THAT THAT S .
YEAH .
REALLY NEAT .
YEAH YEAH IT IS IT S REAL NICE AND UM I KNOW OUR CHURCH DOES IT AND THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER CHURCHES AND THEY ARE JUST LIKE CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS .

YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING TO LOOK FOR THAT S REALLY NEAT .
YEAH YEAH .
THAT REALLY IS .
I THOUGHT THAT WAS A REAL UNUSUAL THING .
UHHUH .
FOR SOMEONE TO DO SO YEAH THERE S A LOT THAT CAN BE DONE .
UHHUH .
IT S JUST A MATTER OF PEOPLE NOT BEING LAZY .
RIGHT .
AND YOU KNOW DOING THE BEST THEY CAN AGAIN I DO NT KNOW WHAT I D DO IF IT WAS MY OWN MOTHER OR GRANDMOTHER .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
PUTTING ANY OF MY FAMILY IN AN ELDERLY HOME TO ME WOULD BE THE VERY LAST RESORT .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW IT UM AND I KNOW IT S HARD FOR A LOT OF FAMILIES IF YOU RE TRYING TO TO WORK OR TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR OWN FAMILY .
RIGHT .
IT S KIND OF HARD TO TO BECAUSE AN ELDERLY PERSON SOMETIMES CAN BE TOTALLY DEPENDENT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW ON YOU AND I KNOW THAT S HARD SOMETIMES AND .
YEAH .
BUT IT WOULD REALLY HAVE TO BE A LAST RESORT .
YEAH .
BECAUSE THAT WOULD JUST I WOULD FEEL SO GUILTY .

YEAH .
UH JUST SEEMS TO MAKE THEM REALLY FEEL GOOD .
NOD YOUR HEAD AND SMILE AT THEM .
RIGHT I LL TELL YOU THE PEOPLE I FEEL THE SORRIEST FOR THERE S A GUY AT THIS PARTICULAR ONE I GO TO .
UHHUH .
THAT I THINK THAT HE S REALLY AN INTELLIGENT PERSON .
UHHUH .
BUT HE HAS CEREBRAL PALSY SO BAD THAT HE JUST CAN NOT COMMUNICATE .
UHHUH .
AND UM HE S BLIND AND HE HAS SEIZURES YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
I MEAN HE S JUST LIKE IN A WORLD OF HIS OWN AND YET HE WANTS SO MUCH .
RIGHT .
TO BE AROUND PEOPLE AND IF YOU COME OVER TO HIM IF HE CAN TOUCH YOUR HAND HE LL GRAB IT AND KISS IT .
OH .
OH AND HE S ALWAYS GOT A SMILE I MEAN HE REALLY TRIES TO BRIGHTEN UP YOUR LIFE OH IT S JUST AMAZING .
OH .
BUT HE CA NT SAY ANYTHING HE CAN JUST KIND OF MAKE NOISES .
THAT S SOMETHING THAT IF I HAD TO WORK IN AN ELDERLY HOME I DO NT THINK I COULD DO IT .
YEAH .
LIKE I I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO BE A TEACHER .
YEAH .
BUT I DO NT THINK I COULD DO IT BECAUSE I M VERY VERY EMOTIONAL .
ME TOO .
AND THE MINUTE I MEAN THE MINUTE SOMETHING HAPPENS .
YEAH .
I CRY ON I MEAN HALLMARK COMMERCIALS .
I KNOW .
THAT S JUST THE END OF ME .
I KNOW .
AND SO I MEAN SOMETHING REAL LIFE I JUST .
UHHUH .
I INTERVIEW A LOT OF CHILDREN I M AN EDUCATION REPORTER .
UHHUH .
AND I ALWAYS GO AND DO AN EDUCATION THINGS .
UHHUH .
I MEET THESE KIDS WHO ARE YOU KNOW DROPPING OUT OF SCHOOL LEFT AND RIGHT .

AND ALL THE SUDDEN THEY RE IN THIS PROGRAM THEY RE MAKING STRAIGHT A S THEY RE GOING TO GRADUATE EARLY .
UHHUH .
AND I M JUST I JUST WANT TO HUG THEM .

AND THOSE PEOPLE THEY RE SO SWEET AND .
UHHUH .
AND SO GENUINE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND ALL THEY WANT IS JUST FOR EVERYTHING TO BE HAPPY .
YEAH .
AND YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
AND SO THAT WOULD PROBABLY JUST TEAR ME APART .
OH IT DOES .
I MEAN IN A GOOD WAY BUT .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
YEAH IT IS IT S REALLY HARD AND .
UHHUH .
BUT ONE OF THE NEATEST THINGS I THINK THOUGH IS WE ALWAYS TAKE OUR KIDS I HAVE A THREE YEAR OLD AND A SIX YEAR OLD .
UHHUH .
AND THEY UM HAVE GOTTEN COMFORTABLE BEING AROUND THESE PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE THEY VE ALWAYS GONE WITH US .
UHHUH .
AND THE PEOPLE LOVE THEM .

YEAH .
AND THEY VE NEVER BEEN AFRAID BUT THAT S SOMETHING TO ME CHILDREN .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW NEED TO PEOPLE NEED TO TAKE GROUPS OF CHILDREN .

IT WOULD BE A LAST RESORT .
AND I WOULD HATE IT IF ANYONE PUT ME IN ONE .
OH I KNOW I M ALWAYS AFRAID LIKE OH NO WHAT IF I LOSE MY MIND .

SOMEBODY TAKE CARE OF ME .
YEAH THAT S RIGHT .
OKAY .
WELL .

YEAH I THINK UM THIS IS A TOUGH SUBJECT BECAUSE UH WHEN YOU COME FROM TWO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY UH THE POLITICAL VIEWS ARE REALLY DIFFERENT I UH I I GUESS I VE HAD TO DISCUSS A NUMBER OF WHAT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES .
UHHUH .
I GUESS LIKE LIKE THEY RE NOTHING I GUESS NOTHING IS AS AWFUL AS ABORTION BUT LIKE GUN CONTROL AND UH DAY CARE AN THINGS LIKE THAT AND THERE ARE SOME VERY DIFFERENT VIEWS UH OF THE PEOPLE CONNECTED WITH THE PROGRAM WHICH I THOUGHT WAS REALLY INTERESTING YOU KNOW .
WELL NOW YOU YOU SAY TWO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY WHAT ARE ARE ARE YOU REFERRING TO YOURSELF OR .
YEAH WELL BEING IN IN BALTIMORE SEE MARYLAND IS UM IS SORT OF UM IS PROB AS AS A HUB OF LIBERALISM .
YOU KNOW COMPARED TO THE COUNTRY UH YOU KNOW VERY UH IN IN MANY WAYS UH VERY LIBERAL VERY SOMEWHAT TO NEW ENGLAND THOUGH PENNSYLVANIA AND NEW YORK UH I ARE NT ACTUALLY AS LIBERAL MARYLAND IS A VERY LIBERAL UH STATE SO SO WHERE HERE WE HAVE UM WE HAVE GUN CONTROL LAWS WE PROBABLY HAVE SOME OF THE STRICTEST GUN CONTROL LAWS IN THE NATION AND MOST PEOPLE IN MARYLAND VOTE FOR THAT YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
SO IT REALLY IS A DIFFERENT UM .
UH WELL OF COURSE YOU TALK GUN CONTROLS DOWN HERE IN TEXAS AND YOU RE ASKING TO BE LYNCHED .
YEAH THAT S THAT S RIGHT TALK TO I HAD TO TALK ABOUT GUN CONTROL WITH SOMEBODY AND I TALKED WITH A WOMAN WHO ACTUALLY YOU KNOW H HAD JUST PURCHASED A GUN THAT DAY .
UHHUH .
AND WAS GOING TARGET SHOOTING YOU KNOW AND IT WAS VERY DIFFERENT IT WAS A WHOLE .
DIFFERENT VIEW IT S REALLY UM THIS HAS OPENED MY EYES TO THINKING YOU KNOW AT ONE TIME I JUST SAT HERE AND THOUGHT WELL HOW CAN ANYBODY BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE I D REALLY NEVER MET PEOPLE THAT DID AND NOW I TALK TO PEOPLE THAT DO SO THAT S IT S REALLY INTERESTING .
WELL IT S VERY TRUE NOW I M A UH NEW YORKER BY BIRTH .
UHHUH .
ALTHOUGH I CLAIM FLORIDA AS MY HOME NOW UH I HAVE TWO SONS LIVING DOWN THERE BUT I ALSO HAVE TWO SONS LIVING ELSEWHERE .
UHHUH .
ONE IN TENNESSEE ONE IN MISSISSIPPI BUT I LIVED IN TE IN FLORIDA FOR TEN YEARS AND I KIND OF LIKE IT DOWN THERE BUT THEY HAD A GUN CONTROL LAW WHICH WENT A LITTLE BIT TOO FAR .
YEAH .
I THINK UH WELL IN YOUR WORDS .
THEY WERE A LITTLE BIT TOO LIBERAL .
YEAH IS NT IT FUNNY .
I MEAN THEY P THEY I BELIEVE IF I M CORRECT I BELIEVE THEY PERMITTED THEIR CARRYING CONCEALED WEAPONS .
UHHUH .
BUT .
UH .
THEY UH SH QUICKLY DID AWAY WITH IT .
YEAH .
I THINK IN THE NEXT SESSION THEY THEY UH MODIFIED IT BUT IT S STILL LEGAL TO OWN OR POSSESS WEAPONS IN UH UH FLORIDA .
YEAH WELL YOU CAN POSSESS EM HERE TOO BUT THEY HAVE TO BE THEY RE REGISTERED AND UH LIKE .
UH THE THE BRADY BILL THAT S .
CURRENTLY BEING DISCUSSED NATIONALLY AND WHATEVER IS VERY WELL SUPPORTED HERE IN GUN CONTROL AVENUES AND UM .
THE .
THE ONE WEEK UH SEVEN DAY THE DELAY .
YOU HAVE THE SEVEN DAY WAITING PERIOD .
UH HUH .
YEAH .
WELL .
THAT S .
I DO NT .
UH THAT S .
MIND THAT TOO MUCH I M I M WITH THE N R A MYSELF .
YEAH .
AND UH UH REALLY THE ONLY OBJECTION WE HAVE IS UH YOU YOU GIVE A LITTLE AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW MUMBLEX SOMEBODY S TRYING TO TAKE MORE .
YEAH THAT S TRUE THAT S VERY TRUE THAT S AND THAT S THE .
WAY I GUESS MOST OF THE UM THE .
POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS WORK YOU KNOW THE SAME I KNOW THE ABORTION ISSUE WITH RIGHT TO LIFE AND RIGHT TO CHOOSE .
YEAH .
AND AND BOTH OF THEM .
ARE BOTH WANT THE EXTENT OF EXTREMES SO THAT THEY DO NT GIVE ANYTHING FOR A BALANCE .
YOU KNOW THERE S THERE S ALWAYS THAT DIFFICULTY .
WELL .
THEN TELL ME DO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF A LIBERAL .
UM I WOULD SAY I M PROBABLY LIBERAL YEAH .
WELL LET .
YEAH .
ME ASK YOU THIS THEN .
SURE .
HOW IS YOUR WHAT IS YOUR FEELING ABOUT UH UH EXPRESSING YOURSELF BY BURNING THE AMERICAN FLAG .

IT S THEIR RIGHT BY FREEDOM OF SPEECH WHAT DOES SPEECH HAVE TO DO WITH .
YEAH .
BURNING A FLAG .
WELL IT S FREE .
THAT THEY I THINK THE IDEA OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH GOES BACK TO AND I UH UH THE THE THE WHOLE ASPECT .
OF BEING ABLE TO DISPLAY YOUR UH YOUR .
IDEAS YOU KNOW THE WHAT THE COUNTRY STANDS ON AMERICA STANDS ON IS THAT THEY CAN DO THAT UH THOUGH I WOULD NEVER EVEN CONSIDER .
IT IN A MILLION YEARS TO DO IT MYSELF I I I THINK UH YOU .
KNOW BUT I I STILL WHAT THE STAN FLAG STANDS FOR I GUESS TO ME IS .
THAT IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO VOICE THEIR OPINION OR DISPLAY THEIR OPINION OPENLY AND IF THAT IS A A WAY THAT THEY CAN SHOW .
THEIR OPINION THEN THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED UH .
NOW UH WELL I I STILL .
UNLESS .
GO .
THE .
BACK .

THEN WOULD YOU CONDONE THE BURNING OF THE CAPITOL BUILDING .
UH .
NO BUT I THINK THAT S THAT S UH IT S THAT S TAXPAYER S MONEY IF SOMEBODY .
BUYS THEIR OWN FLAG AND AND BURNS IT THAT S FINE BUT THAT THAT S YOU KNOW THAT S DESTRUCTION AND OF UH PUBLIC .
PROPERTY AND WHATEVER .
UH THEN YOU DO NT DRAW A LINE BETWEEN PUBLIC PROPERTY AND UH UH UH WHAT A PUBLIC UH SYMBOL .
NO .
I DO NT KNOW I GUESS THE SYMBOLISM OH I THINK WHAT AMERICA STANDS FOR IS THE RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO DISAGREE WITH THE GOVERNMENT .

THEY ALWAYS TALK ABOUT MUMBLEX THEY FEEL THAT THIS PERSON BELIEVES IN THE FRAMING OF THE CONSTITUTION WHAT .
THE ORIGINAL FRAMERS THE IDEALS THE ORIGINAL FRAMERS SET DOWN .
UHHUH .
AND UM I BELIEVE THAT THE IDEA OF BURNING .
HUH .
THE FLAG IS IS IN .
MY UNDERSTANDING OF HOW IT WAS FRAMED IS THAT YOU THIS COUN THE THING ABOUT THIS COUNTRY IS THAT YOU CAN DISAGREE WITH ITS GOVERNMENT AND YOU CAN DISPLAY .
YEAH .
THAT .
UHHUH .
UH I YEAH I G AND AND SO THAT AS A FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND SPEECH AND .
WHATEVER I I THINK THAT THAT S VIABLE UM AS LONG AS IT S YOUR FLAG AND AND YOU VE MADE YOUR YOUR POINT I THINK YEAH BECAUSE REALISTICALLY LIKE FOR YOU FOR YOU YOU DO NT THINK IT S RIGHT .

UHHUH .
I DO NT THINK THAT I DO NT THINK THAT UH WE .
HAVE A RIGHT TO STOP SOMEBODY FROM THAT YOU KNOW THE SAME I DO NT KNOW I GUESS I GET I GET UH ALL .
IT S .
MIXED UP INSIDE WHEN .
IT S VERY EASY TO DO .
YEAH IT G WHEN IT S UH IT S AN EMOTIONAL ISSUE AND YOU SIT AND YOU TRY AND THINK .
ABOUT IT LOGICALLY AND AND AND YOU KNOW YOU TRY TO SAY TO YOURSELF NOW EMOTIONALLY THIS IS A DISGUSTING THING UH BUT LOGICALLY UM .
EVEN YOU KNOW FOR INSTANCE THE PRO LIFE PRO CHOICE MOVEMENT UH YOU KNOW I DO NT KNOW ANYBODY THAT ACTUALLY SUPPORTS ABORTION BUT THEY .
UH .
WOULD VOTE PRO CHOICE .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT S JUST A DISGUSTING THING YOU KNOW SOMEBODY AN ABORTION MEANS IT S SOMEBODY S IN TROUBLE AND THAT IT S AN AWFUL THING .
YOU KNOW .
WELL .
BUT .
I THINK IT SHOULD BE PERMITTED UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUS .
YEAH .
CIRCUMSTANCES .
BUT .
IT THAT S UH THAT S WHAT I MEAN SEE MO BUT BUT REALISTICALLY WHEN YOU THINK OF IT IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE SUCH AN AWFUL THING AND IT EVOKES AN EMOTIONAL RESPONSE I THINK THAT S THE HARDEST THING I DO NT KNOW IF I COULD EVER BE A JUDGE BECAUSE .
UHHUH .
SOME .
HUH .
THINGS .
WELL .
EMOTIONALLY .
TELL ME .
JUST .
HAS .
ARE NT .
IT .

I THINK THE UM SOMETIMES I GUESS WHAT DID I READ RECENTLY THE UM TH THE UH CHRISTIAN UH POINT .
IS IS ALWAYS THE POINT OF WELL IT S AT CONCEPTION BUT THEN UM A FRIEND OF MINE S A DOCTOR AND ARGUES WITH OTHERS THAT CONCEPTION IS A BIBLICAL TERM AND THERE S NO CONCEPT OF CONCEPTION IN MEDICINE OR BIOLOGY .
HUH .
SO THEN THAT SO THAT THROWS OUT THAT IDEA MAKES IT A RELIGIOUS DISCUSSION THEN SO IT S I .
DO NT KNOW IT S VERY IT S IT S UH YOU KNOW IT S A IT S A TOPSYTURVY WORLD AND IT S REALLY SOMETHING HOW UM POLITICAL .
IDEAS AND VIEWPOINTS WITHIN ONE COUNTRY CAN VARY SO MUCH AND ALSO WITHIN UM .
OR .
WITHIN .
THEY .
A .
ON THEIR O WITHIN THE OWN UH SOCIETY .
YEAH .
IT CAN .
AND .
VARY .
HOW YEAH HOW IT LL SWAY FROM ONE E ONE EXTREME TO ANOTHER .
UHHUH .
UH I THINK THAT UH YOU KNOW I I JUST READ SOMETHING I THINK IN TIME MAGAZINE UH ABOUT UM PROTEST .
WHERE DO YOU GET MOST OF YOUR NEWS .
I WATCH THE MACNEIL LEHRER NEWS HOUR AND I SUBSCRIBE TO THE PAPER ON THE WEEKENDS .
WHERE WHERE ARE YOU .
I M IN DALLAS .
OH YEAH .
ARE YOU IN DALLAS ALSO .
NO I M IN SAN ANTONIO .
OH REALLY OKAY .
I GET MY NEWS FROM A COMBINATION OF SOURCES .
I TAKE THE PAPER .
EVERY DAY .
UHHUH .
AND I READ IT ON THE WAY IN TO WORK ON THE IN A CARPOOL .
OH REALLY .
UHHUH .
AND UH AND I WATCH THE UH ACTUALLY I WATCH THE MORNING NEWS BEFORE I LEAVE FOR WORK .
AND THEN YOU KNOW USUALLY OVER LUNCH THERE LL BE A BIG TOPIC OF CONVERSATION ON SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
FROM THE NEWS .
I NORMALLY FIND THAT UH I I M PROBABLY THE MOST UM NEWS HUNGRY OF MY FRIENDS SO I DO NT WE DO NT NORMALLY TALK ABOUT THE NEWS AT LUNCH .
I I FIND THAT I HAVE TO ONLY SUBSCRIBE TO THE PAPER ON THE WEEKEND SIMPLY BECAUSE I USED TO GET IT DURING THE WEEK .
UHHUH .
BUT UM I WOULD ALWAYS END UP ARRIVING AT WORK LATE BECAUSE I WOULD ALWAYS END UP SKIMMING THE HEADLINES SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME .
READING IT IN THE MORNING .
YEAH .
SO I HAVE TO CUT MYSELF DOWN TO THE WEEKEND PLUS AFTER WORK .
UM THE MACNEIL LEHRER NEWS HOUR IS ON PUBLIC TELEVISION .
UHHUH .
AND I ENJOY THAT QUITE A BIT .
YEAH .
UM ONE OF THE WOMEN THAT I WORK WITH HER HUSBAND IS IRANIAN .
UHHUH .
SO HERE LATELY WITH ALL THE MIDDLE EASTERN NEWS .
WE VE HAD SOME .
VERY INTERESTING CONVERSATIONS OVER LUNCH .
I WILL ADMIT I WORK WITH UH SOMEONE .
WHO S IRANIAN AND HE DEFINITELY HAS A VERY DIFFERENT SLANT ON THE NEWS .
UHHUH .
HE S VERY VERY SKEPTICAL OF THE NEWS MEDIA AND I WILL ADMIT I M REASONABLY SKEPTICAL ALSO .
BUT HE S I DO NT KNOW UH HE S MU MUCH MUCH MORE SO .
IT .
S SORT OF INTERESTING THOUGH BECAUSE HE DOES BRING A A MUCH UM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE WITH ALL THE GULF GOINGS ON UM .
HE WAS ALWAYS SPEAKING IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW AMERICAN IMPERIALISM REASSERTING ITSELF .
UM I SUPPOSE IT S A DIFFERENT ATTITUDE THAT WE NORMALLY DO NT HEAR IN THE COUNTRY .
UHHUH .
WELL I I UH I LIKE THE PRINT NEWS .
UHHUH .
MUCH BETTER THAN THE TELEVISION NEWS BECAUSE TELEVISION NEWS TENDS TO SENSATIONALIZE .
TRUE UM THE .
I UNDERSTAND THAT THE MACNEIL LEHRER PROBABLY DOES NT .
THEY UM TEND TO SPEND QUITE A BIT OF TIME ON ONE STORY .
UHHUH .
THEY WILL HAVE MAYBE TWO OR THREE MAIN STORIES AND JUST SPEND A VERY LARGE AMOUNT OF TIME .
SORT OF LIKE THE UH WHAT IS THAT A B C S NIGHTLINE .
UHHUH .
WELL I GUESS THEY ONLY NORMALLY STICK WITH JUST THE ONE UM STORY .
BUT THEY THEY CAN DO A MUCH BETTER JOB SINCE THEY DO NT HAVE TO CHOP IT INTO LITTLE TWO MINUTE STORIES .
THEY DO NT REPORT ON EVERY MURDER AND SHOOTING .
THAT HAPPENED IN IN EVERY LITTLE TOWN .
NO NO .
IT S VERY MUCH NATIONAL INTEREST NEWS .
YEAH .
A LOT OF TIMES THEY END UP UM WITH THESE PANELS OF EXPERTS AND THEY GO BACK AND FORTH WHERE EVERYONE S GIVING SOME OPINIONS AND SOMETIMES THAT I DO NT KNOW THE VALUE OF THAT BECAUSE I SAW PLENTY OF JOKES AND AND UM OH EDITORIAL CARTOONS ABOUT ALL THE RETIRED GENERALS .
MAKING A LIVING DURING THE THE GULF WAR .
I VE BEEN GETTING A KICK OUT OF THOSE LATELY .
UHHUH .
ALTHOUGH UM .
I I M ONLY TWENTYFIVE SO I VE NEVER ACTUALLY BEEN THROUGH A PERIOD OF WAR .
UHHUH .
AND I DO NT KNOW ANYONE IN THE MILITARY AND I DO NT HAVE A LOT OF BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE IN UH MILITARY STRATEGY AND AND WEAPONRY AND AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF .
AND I THOUGHT THE GENERALS WERE VERY INTERESTING .
NOW WHEN THEY STARTED TO SPECULATE I I SAW THAT FOR WHAT IS WAS .
UHHUH .
AND THOUGHT ALL OF THESE GUYS DO NT KNOW WHAT S GOING ON .
BUT I THOUGHT THE THE THEY WERE INTERESTING AND AND THEY SHED SOME LIGHT ON WHAT WAS GOING ON FOR ME .
I WILL ADMIT IT S INTERESTING .
I I I M TWENTYSIX .
SO I DO NT HAVE ANY MORE EXPERIENCE IN THAT THAN YOU .
UM IT IT IT WAS VERY INTERESTING THAT IT SEEMED LIKE SOME OF THE COMMENTATORS HAD THEIR AXE TO GRIND YOU KNOW THERE WERE SOME .
THAT WERE SCREAMING FOR AIR POWER THERE WERE SOME .
THAT WERE SAYING THE AIR POWER WAS NT GOING TO DO IT .
UHHUH .
AND THEY SEEMED TO MOLD THE EVENTS TO THEIR VIEW OF THE WORLD WHICH .
I SUPPOSE JUST ABOUT EVERYONE DOES BUT THESE GUYS HAD A A UH NATIONAL SOAP BOX TO STAND ON AND AND EXPRESS THIS VIEW .
YOU KNOW ONE OF THE BEST TELEVISION NEWS SHOWS THAT I SAW DURING THE WAR WAS A SHOW ON A SATURDAY MORNING ON A B C AND IT WAS FOR CHILDREN .
UHHUH .
AND IT WAS HOSTED BY PETER JENNINGS AND IT WAS SO INTERESTING BECAUSE THEY WERE RELATING THE WAR TO THESE CHILDREN IN THEIR STUDIO AND THEY ALSO HAD CHILDREN CALLING IN LIVE FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND ASKING QUESTIONS .
AND THEY THEY HAD ALL THEIR CORRESPONDENTS IN THE DIFFERENT AREAS IN SAUDI ARABIA AND ISRAEL AND AND ALL .
THEY HAD THEM .
ALL UH ON I DO NT KNOW WHAT .
YOU D CALL IT OTHER THAN ON LINE .
THEY HAD THEM .
ALL ON HOLD .
UHHUH .
AND IF A CHILD ASKED A QUESTION THAT THE PERSON IN JERUSALEM COULD BEST ANSWER THEY WOULD CUT TO THAT PERSON AND THAT PERSON WOULD ANSWER THE QUESTION .
IT WAS JUST VERY INFORMATIVE AND INTERESTING AND UH I WAS REAL IMPRESSED AT HOW A B C HANDLED UH TRANSLATING .
UHHUH .
THE WAR FOR CHILDREN .
YEAH I DID NT SEE ANYTHING LIKE THAT ALTHOUGH I DID UH I GUESS ONE THING THAT I FOUND SORT OF INTERESTING THIS IS GETTING A LITTLE OFF THE TOPIC BUT THERE WAS A A A BIG PUSH WITH THE LOCAL T V STATIONS TO HAVE LITTLE HOT LINES WITH COUNSELORS .
UHHUH .
TO TO HELP PARENTS LEARN HOW TO TALK ABOUT THEIR WAR WITH THEIR CHILDREN .
I THOUGHT THAT WAS A REALLY UNUSUAL THING .
AND OUR LOCAL H E B STORES HERE I DO NT KNOW IF IT S H E B STATEWIDE OR WHATEVER BUT THEY HAVE VIDEOS .
THAT UH I DO NT KNOW IF THEY STILL HAVE THEM BUT THEY WERE FREE RENTAL .
UHHUH .
VIDEOS THAT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE WAR .
JU .
UH IT WAS .
IT WITH THE CHILDREN S ASPECT .
RIGHT .
IT WAS SOMETHING FOR CHILDREN THAT THEY THEY HAD SEVERAL ADVERTISEMENTS ON TELEVISION PUSHING PARENTS GOING AND UH GETTING THE VIDEO AND WATCHING IT WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND DISCUSSING IT .
UHHUH .
AND THAT KIND OF THING .
I SUPPOSE THAT IS A VALUABLE SERVICE .
AGAIN NOT HAVING UH LIVED THROUGH ANOTHER WAR I DO NT KNOW IF THAT S A COMMON THING THAT PEOPLE THOUGHT OF OR IF THAT WAS .
WELL .
A NEW CONCERN WITH PEOPLE .
BACK DURING THE VIET NAM CONFLICT THAT NO ONE WILL WILL HAVE THE GUTS ENOUGH TO CALL A REAL WAR .
UHHUH .
UH THE THAT TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY JUST WAS NT AT PEOPLE S DISPOSAL .
THAT S TRUE .
THAT S TRUE .
SO I DO NT THINK THERE S EVER BEEN A WAR .
THAT S BEEN SO THOROUGHLY COVERED BY THE NEWS .
AND PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANTLY ONE .
THAT LASTED SHORT ENOUGH THAT THAT PEOPLE S INTEREST DID NT FLAG TOO BADLY .
YEAH .
I TELL YOU .
WHAT THE FIRST THREE DAYS I WAS GLUED TO THE TELEVISION .
I WILL ADMIT THE SAME THING .
AND I .
AND I .
WOULD COME HOME AND FLIP ON MACNEIL LEHRER AND THEY WOULD RUN THESE EXTENDED TWO THREE HOUR VERSIONS OF THE PROGRAM .
YEAH .
AND I I WAS JUST I WAS HORRIFIED AND FASCINATED BY WHAT .
I WAS SEEING .
I TELL YOU .
WHAT .
THE UH THE WAR START LET S SEE WAS IT .
A WEDNESDAY OR THURSDAY .
MUST HAVE BEEN THURSDAY UH AND FRIDAY NIGHT .
I WAS I STAYED UP UNTIL TWO OCLOCK IN THE MORNING SITTING RIGHT DEAD CENTER IN FRONT OF MY TELEVISION JUST WATCHING PRACTICALLY WITH MY MOUTH HANGING OPEN .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE I WAS WATCHING C N N AND THEY WOULD THEY WOULD SWITCH BACK TO ONE OF THEIR ISRAEL BUREAUS AND THE PEOPLE WOULD BE STANDING THERE IN GAS MASKS AND YOU D BE HEARING THE SIRENS AND IT WAS JUST I WAS AMAZED .
UHHUH .
I I DID NT HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE .
I I DO NT HAVE CABLE .
OH .
SO I I M PRETTY MUCH LIMITED TO P B S WHICH .
I THOUGHT I THOUGHT THEY DID A VERY GOOD JOB .
UHHUH .
UM I VE GOT ONE QUESTION FOR YOU .
I .
YOU SAY YOU TAKE THE NEWSPAPER .
UHHUH .
UM I I FOUND THE NEWSPAPER SITUATION IN DALLAS VERY INTERESTING .
WE VE GOT THE ONE FAIRLY WELL RELATIVELY WEAKER PAPER THE TIMES HERALD AND THEN THE MORNING NEWS WHICH HAS A VERY STRONG SUBSCRIPTION .
UHHUH .
DOES SAN ANTONIO HA YOU SAID SAN ANTONIO RIGHT .
UHHUH .
DO YOU HAVE JUST ONE PAPER OR DO YOU HAVE SEVERAL .
NO .
THERE ARE TWO AND THEY RE PRETTY CLOSE .
UH THE ONE THAT I PICKED IS MORE SIMILAR IN FORMAT TO THE NEWSPAPER I GREW UP NEAR HOUSTON .
UHHUH .
AND THERE ARE TWO MAJOR NEWSPAPERS THERE THAT RUN PRETTY MUCH NECK AND NECK AND THE ONE .
I PICKED HERE HAD THE SAME FORMAT AS THE ONE THAT MY PARENTS TOOK AS I WAS GROWING UP .
I MEAN THE SAME TYPE OF TYPEFACE ON THE HEADLINE AND THAT KIND OF STUFF .
UHHUH .
IT S PIDDLY STUFF TO PICK A NEWSPAPER OVER .
AND I ENJOY THE COMICS ARE BETTER IN THIS NEWSPAPER .
THIS NEWSPAPER HAS THE FAR SIDE AND THE COMICS THAT I ENJOY AND THE OTHER ONE HAS SOME WEIRD ONES THAT I VE NEVER HEARD OF .
SO .
I I ACTUALLY TAKE BOTH .
NEWSPAPERS ON THE WEEKENDS .
DO YOU .
I FIGURE I M ONLY TAKING ON THE WEEKEND AND I CAN AFFORD THAT .
YEAH .
I I FIND THE NEWS REPORTING IN THE MORNING NEWS TO BE BETTER BUT I SORT OF HAVE A LIBERAL POLITICAL SLANT AND THE MORNING NEWS JUST HAS AN INCREDIBLY CONSERVATIVE EDITORIAL UM OUTLOOK .
AND MY .
I GET THE TIMES HERALD JUST TO BALANCE THAT OUT A LITTLE BIT .
MY FIANCEE TAKES PROBABLY SIX SUNDAY PAPERS .
HE TAKES BOTH SAN ANTONIO PAPERS AN AUSTIN PAPER BOTH HOUSTON PAPERS I GUESS HE TAKES SEVEN THE SAN MARCOS PAPER AND THE NEW BRAUNSFEL PAPER BUT HE S A FOOTBALL COACH AT SOUTHWEST TEXAS STATE UNIVERSITY SO HE S GETTING ALL THE SPORTS SECTIONS .

I MEAN I CAN GO IN THERE I CAN BE LIKE A FRIDAY AFTERNOON WHEN I M TIRED IT S THE END OF THE WEEK AND I JUST WANT TO GO HOME .
AND I LL MAKE MYSELF GO AND I LL HAVE HEADACHE AND EVERYTHING AND I GET OUT I DO NT HAVE A HEADACHE ANY MORE .
I FEEL GREAT AND I M JUST IT S AMAZING HOW MUCH BETTER I FEEL .
YEAH .
AND THEN JUST IN GENERAL I SLEEP A LOT BETTER .
YEAH THAT S RIGHT .
AND I JUST FEEL MUCH BETTER .
I MEAN I VE BEEN KIND OF DRAGGING THE LAST FEW WEEKS AND I KNOW IF I WOULD JUST GET AROUND TO EXERCISING .
EXACTLY .
I D FEEL BETTER .
IT DOES IT GIVES YOU .
ENERGY .
BUT MY DRAGGINESS IS MY EXCUSE FOR NOT EXERCISING .
YEAH .
WELL I M TOO TIRED OR I HAVE A HEADACHE OR .
WELL I JUST GOT OVER THE FLU AND I M STILL KIND OF DRAGGY SO I BETTER NOT GO .
IT .
S KIND OF A VICIOUS CIRCLE IS NT IT .
YEAH IT REALLY IS .
YEAH I FIND TOO THAT I HAVE MORE ENERGY WHEN I EXERCISE AND YOU KNOW IT S SILLY NOT TO BUT I DO NT KNOW IT S JUST A PUT OFF .
I DO NT KNOW WHY I DO NT DO MORE AND I AND I KNOW THAT IT S GOOD FOR MY HEALTH .
I KNOW YOU KNOW FROM EVERYTHING THAT YOU READ AND YOU SEE ON TELEVISION NOW EXERCISE IS SO IMPORTANT TO GOOD HEALTH .
RIGHT .
SO YOU KNOW YOU NOT ONLY YOU KNOW YOU RE NOT ONLY DOING SOMETHING TO KEEP YOURSELF FIT BUT YOU RE PROBABLY PROLONGING YOUR LIFE .
SO .
RIGHT .
THERE S NO REASON THAT WE SHOULD NT DO IT BUT I DO NT KNOW .
IT S JUST HARD TO MAKE YOURSELF GO .
AND I I THINK ONE THING .
I DO NT LIKE ABOUT AEROBICS IS THAT AFTER I M FINISHED IT S KIND OF LATE AT NIGHT AND I VE BEEN SWEATY AND AND IT YOU KNOW I DO NT REALLY FEEL LIKE GOING IN THE GROCERY STORE ALL SWEATY OR RUNNING ERRANDS .
YEAH .
SO IT .
KIND OF KILLS .
THE EVENING FOR DOING ERRANDS .
SO I THINK A TUESDAY THURSDAY MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT BETTER .
YEAH .
OF COURSE I FEEL LIKE ONCE I VE DONE IT IF I M SWEATY I MIGHT AS WELL DO AN EXTRA THIRTY MINUTES BECAUSE YOU VE ALREADY KIND OF SHOT YOUR NIGHT .
RIGHT .
BUT UM SO I M KIND OF GLAD THEY HAVE A LONGER CLASS ON TUESDAY THURSDAY NOW THAT I CAN JUST KILL TWO NIGHTS AND .
YEAH .
AND UH GET A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF WORKOUT IN .
DOES IT COST THE SAME FOR JUST TWO NIGHTS OR .
NO IT S LESS EXPENSIVE .
WELL THAT S GOOD TOO .
THIS ONE WAS ONLY FORTYFIVE DOLLARS .
BUT I M GLAD IT S NOT TOO TOTALLY CHEAP BECAUSE IF IT WAS TOO CHEAP I WOULD TALK MYSELF OUT OF GOING MORE PROBABLY .
YEAH YEAH .
SINCE IT S MORE EXPENSIVE I THINK OKAY YOU SPENT THAT MUCH MONEY YOU D BETTER GO .
THAT S RIGHT THAT S RIGHT .
SO HOPEFULLY .
WELL DO YOU HAVE A FACILITY RIGHT AT THE WHERE YOU WORK .
YEAH YEAH IT S RIGHT THERE AND IT S THEY HAVE A REALLY NICE FACILITY AT THE T I .
THEY VE GOT TWO DIFFERENT AEROBICS ROOMS THEY HAVE THE MIRRORS .
OF COURSE SOMETIMES YOU DO NT LIKE TO SEE THE MIRRORS ON THE WALL .
NO .
YOU DO NT LIKE TO SEE HOW YOU WORK .
BUT I GUESS SOMETIMES IT .
KIND OF MOTIVATES YOU TO REALLY GET GOING .
BUT .
YEAH AND THEN THEY HIRE PRIVATE INSTRUCTORS .
UHHUH .
OH THAT S GREAT .
AND THEY HAVE CEILING FANS IN THE ROOMS AND IT S IT S A PRETTY NICE SETUP .
UM AND OF COURSE .
IT S REAL CONVENIENT BECAUSE IT IS RIGHT THERE AT WORK .
I THINK IF I HAD TO COME HOME AND THEN GO SOMEWHERE I D NEVER MAKE IT .
YEAH .
AND JUST THE FACT THAT I CAN GO STRAIGHT FROM MY DESK OVER TO THE THE RECREATION CENTER AND DO IT HELPS A LOT .
UHHUH .
YEAH I CAN SEE THAT WOULD BE UH EASY .
THEY MAKE IT AS EASY AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN FOR YOU .
OH YEAH .
WELL UM DO A LOT OF PEOPLE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT .
QUITE A FEW DO .
THEY HAVE PROBABLY OOH I D SAY FIFTEEN DIFFERENT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY DIFFERENT AEROBICS CLASSES .
EACH SESSION .
THAT ARE RUNNING AND THEY HAVE THEM ANYWHERE FROM SIX IN THE MORNING .
UH THEY HAVE SOME DURING DURING LUNCH HOUR .
THAT ARE SHORTER AND I GUESS GUYS CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT .
FOR ME I WOULD NT HAVE TIME TO DO AN HOUR HOUR OF AEROBICS AND THEN TAKE A SHOWER AND GET GET DRESSED AGAIN .
OH YEAH .
BUT THERE S A LOT MORE GUYS .
THAT DO THAT ONE .
UHHUH .
AND UM THEY HAVE THEM YOU KNOW IN THE EVENINGS THEY EVEN HAVE SOME LATE NIGHT ONES FOR PEOPLE .

NOW TO USE .
I MEAN I M JUST NOW FINALLY STARTING TO DO THE AEROBICS THING .
BUT .
WELL DOES IT COST MONEY LIKE TO USE THE TO EXERCISE IN THE WEIGHT ROOM OR TO UH TO TAK TO GO SWIMMING .
DO YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT TOO .

YOU CAN GET A FITNESS MEMBERSHIP .
THAT ALLOWS YOU TO USE THE FACILITIES AND IT S ABOUT EIGHT DOLLARS .
A MONTH .
OH THAT S NOT BAD .
NO NOT AT ALL .
HUHUH .
PRETTY CHEAP .

AND THEN THE AEROBICS COST EXTRA EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE FITNESS MEMBERSHIP BUT I THINK THE AEROBICS CLASSES ARE EVEN PRETTY REASONABLY PRICED FROM WHAT .

IF Y THEY RE BETTER OR WORSE LIKE IF THEY LAST LONGER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
OKAY I M GOING TO LET YOU .
KIND OF LEAD .
THE PACK .
BECAUSE YOU SOUND LIKE YOU RE I LET ME TELL YOU JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MYSELF .
I FOR YEARS I DID ALL THAT SHOPPING AND WHATNOT BUT FOR THE LAST FOUR OR FIVE YEARS I VE HAD EYE PROBLEM .
OH .
AND I VE HAD TWO CORNEA TRANSPLANTS .
SHOPPING IS NO FUN ANYMORE .
I CAN IMAGINE .
WELL SEE I DO NT .

ALL RIGHT .
IT IT LL COME TO US OKAY .
OKAY .
ARE YOU READY .
YEAH .
LAURIE ALL RIGHT .
RIGHT .
ALL RIGHT UH TELL ME ABOUT YOUR COMPUTER LAURIE I THINK THAT SOUNDS FASCINATING .
WELL WE BOUGHT A COMPUTER BECAUSE MY HUSBAND NEEDED TO USE IT TO DO SOME WORK FOR A CONSULTING PROJECT AND WE CALLED UP THE COMPANY AND ASKED THEM DETAILS ON IT .
WE BOUGHT IT SORT OF YOUR NOT A NAME BRAND BECAUSE THE CLONES ARE SO MUCH CHEAPER .
UHHUH .
AND WE CALLED UP THE COMPANY THAT SOMEBODY ELSE WE KNEW HAD DEALT WITH AND THEY WERE VERY HAPPY WITH THE SYSTEM AND THEY FELT THEY VE GOTTEN A GOOD PRICE .
AND WE WENT IN WE EXPLAINED WHAT .
WE NEEDED AND YES WE HAD TO GO ACROSS THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE TO NEW JERSEY TO GET TO MEET THESE PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
AND SO WE WENT THERE WE TOLD THEM ABOUT THE STUFF AND THE GUY SAID UH THAT THE COMPUTER WOULD FIT OUR NEEDS .
AND WE THESE THINGS WO NT MAKE ANY SENSE TO YOU PROBABLY BUT HE TOLD US .
THERE WERE .
UHHUH .
WE NEED USER POSITIONS TO PUT OUR OWN EQUIPMENT IN THE COMPUTER .
OH YES .
AND IT S CALLED A USER BOARDS OR SLOTS IS WHAT .
IT S CALLED .
UHHUH .
AND HE TOLD US .
THERE .
S TWO SIXTEEN BIT SLOTS AND TWO EIGHT BIT SORRY TWO SIX FOUR SIXTEEN BIT SLOTS AND TWO EIGHT BIT SLOTS AVAILABLE FOR THE USER AND WE CAN PUT FULL SIZE CARDS IN THERE .
AND SO WE SAID GREAT YOU KNOW WE LL BUY IT AND WE PUT IN OUR ORDER .
AND A WEEK LATER WE WENT BACK AND PICKED UP THE COMPUTER .
AND THEN WE GOT IT .
HOME AND TRIED TO PUT OUR OWN BOARD IN IT AND THERE S ONLY ONE SLOT .
WE COULD PUT IT IN .
OH LOVELY .
AND AT THIS POINT .
WE ONLY HAVE ONE BOARD SO IT WAS NT SO BAD SO WE USED IT .
A BIT BUT WE TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER WE COULD PUT THREE IN BECAUSE WE REALLY NEED TO BE ABLE TO PUT AT LEAST THREE IN .
HUH .
AND .
OH NO THE COMPUTER WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE TWO .
WELL IT HAS THEM BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT YOU CA NT PUT THE TYPE OF CARD THAT WE NEED TO PUT IN IT IN IT .
OH I SEE .
AND EVEN THOUGH THEY TOLD US IN ADVANCE THAT YOU COULD THEY TOLD US .
THERE WOULD BE NO PROBLEM BECAUSE YOU KNOW .
I SEE .
THE SALESMAN JUST DOES NT REALLY KNOW .
IN SOME WAYS .
IT HAS MORE TO DO WITH THE PEOPLE .
WHO SOLD IT .
THEY PROBABLY DID NT KNOW WHAT .
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT .
RIGHT .
THAT S COMPLETELY IT .
THE SALESMAN DID NT KNOW .
RIGHT .
SO WE WENT BACK IN AND WE STRUCK AN AGREEMENT WITH THE PEOPLE .
WHO SAID CHANGE .
THE CASING .
IT COMES IN SO THAT WE COULD PUT IN EXTRA BOARDS .
HUH .
OKAY .
SO THEY DID THAT .
AND WE SAID ARE YOU .
SURE .
THIS WILL WORK WE DO NT WANT YOU TO GO THROUGH THE WORK AND THEN FIND OUT THAT THIS DOES NT REALLY WORK ANYWAY AND ET CETERA AND THEY RE THEY WERE DOING IT AT THEIR OWN COSTS .
AND SO WE SAID FINE .
AND WE WENT BACK AND WE TALKED TO THE MUMBLEX PERSON .
A SECOND TIME AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND THEN WE COME WE GET THE COMPUTER HOME MY HUSBAND GOES TO PICK IT UP LAST WEEK AND WE COULD NT GO GET IT SOONER BECAUSE I JUST HAD THE BABY AND .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW LIFE S JUST A LITTLE BIT COMPLICATED .
UHHUH .
AND UH HE GOES AND GETS IT BRINGS IT .
HOME FIRST OF ALL .
THEY RE MISSING COMPONENTS OF IT LIKE CABLES SO YOU CA NT REALLY TEST IT OUT .
AND THEN SECOND THING WE STILL CA NT PUT THE BOARDS IN .
OH JEEZ .
BECAUSE THEY HAVE OTHER THINGS BLOCKING WHERE WE NEED TO DO IT .
HUH .
AND SEE NOW WE RE DEALING WITH HAVING TO BRING IT BACK AGAIN AND THEY SAY THEY CAN YOU KNOW DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND CHANGE SOME CONNECTORS AND WE HOPE SO BUT IT S A HASSLE .
YEAH IT REALLY IS .
YOU .
KN YOU KNOW IT S JUST THIS PROBLEM WITH SALES PEOPLE JUST NOT KNOWING WHAT GOES ON .
RIGHT AND AND SO MUCH TIME GOES PAST BEFORE YOU FINALLY GET ANY KIND OF SATISFACTION .
RIGHT .
I THINK THAT S THE WORST PART .
I .
SO WELL ACTUALLY SOME THINGS ARE PRETTY GOOD WITH THAT BECAUSE I PUT IT ON A GOLD CREDIT CARD AND I JUST CALLED THE CREDIT CARD COMPANY AND EXPLAINED TO THEM .
THE SITUATION AND THEY SAID WELL YOU DO NT HAVE TO PAY FOR IT YET .
NOW THAT S AN ADVANTAGE IS NT IT .
YES .
IT REALLY IS .
I THINK UH UH THERE S A LOT NOT TO BE SAID FOR CREDIT BUT THAT S ONE THING TO BE SAID FOR CREDIT .
IT HOW .
YEAH .
IT GETS YOU .
SOME MUSCLE WHERE YOU NEED IT .
RIGHT .
SO AND SO YOU KNOW .
AND I THINK THAT S REALLY IMPORTANT .
WELL BECAUSE THESE GUYS IF THEY UM GIVE US .
A HARD TIME .
WE RE GOING TO SAY YOU LOOK YOU KNOW IF IF YOU CA NT FIX THIS TO OUR SATISFACTION .
YEAH .
WE RE JUST RETURNING THE COMPUTER .
THAT S RIGHT .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND IF WE DO THAT I JUST TELL THE CREDIT CARD COMPANY DO NT PAY THE CHARGE .
THAT S RIGHT .
EVEN THOUGH THEY VE ALREADY PAID IT .
NO .
BUT THEY LL JUST YOU KNOW .
YEAH THEY WILL .
UNDO THE CREDIT THAT THEY DID TO THEM .
THAT S RIGHT .
THEY WILL .
YEAH .
THEY WILL PUT THE KIND OF CLOUT ON THEM THAT YOU CA NT REALLY DO .
RIGHT .
YEAH .
AND .
WE HAL BOUGHT ME UH UH SMALL UH WELL UH UH LITTLE JAM BOX KIND OF THING SO I D MY I HAVE MY NINETYTHREE YEAR OLD MOTHER LIVING WITH US AND SO I SHE DOES NT REMEMBER ANYTHING BUT TO KEEP HER ENTERTAINED MUSIC AND SOME OF THESE THINGS DO HELP .
UHHUH .
AND I THOUGHT WELL IF I HAD UH A NIC A NICE LITTLE UM TAPE RECORDER YOU KNOW SO THAT I COULD PUT SOME GOOD MUSIC ON IN THERE FOR HER .
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE AND THEN ALSO SO THAT I CAN UH UH COPY UH PARTS OFF I I DO SOME MUSICALS AND THINGS LIKE THIS AND IF I CAN COPY SECTIONS OFF THAT I CAN USE SOMEPLACE SO I FIGURED WELL THIS WILL BE GOOD .
UHHUH .
WELL THE FIRST UH UH THE FIRST TIME .
I TURNED IT ON UH I WAS RECORDING AND THE NEXT THING .
I KNEW THE TAPE WAS CHEWED UP IN THE .
OH NO .
THING .
OKAY SO AFTER THAT THEN YOU COULD NT GET A YOU COULD NT GET A TAPE TO PLAY AT THE RIGHT SPEED IN THAT SIDE .
UHHUH .
AND THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE WHEN I WHEN I UH I LOA LOANED IT TO MY DAUGHTER .
THE OTHER DAY TO TAKE IT OVER TO UH TO UH VIDEOTAPING THEY WERE DOING AND SHE SAYS IT S WRONG TOO BECAUSE THE LITTLE THING POKES OUT TOO FAR AND SO YOU CA NT YOU CA NT GET IT TO RUN THE RIGHT THE RIGHT WAY .
UHHUH .
EITHER SO UH .
WHAT BRAND IS IT .
DO YOU KNOW .
YEAH SO I I WISH I COULD TELL YOU .
I REALLY DO NT KNOW WHICH BRAND .
IT IS .
IT S .
BUT I WAS WONDERING LIKE YOU KNOW IN OUR CASE WHERE WE KNEW WE WERE BUYING A COPY .
WE WERE NT BUYING .
YEAH .
ON I B M P C AND I WAS WONDERING IF YOU .
NO I THINK THIS IS A I THINK THIS IS MAYBE A NAME BRAND AND I SUSPECT THAT IT S PROBABLY JUST A FLUKE YOU KNOW .
I HAVE THE PAPERS AND EVERYTHING AND WE RE GOING TO GET JUST TAKE IT BACK BUT UH .
UHHUH .
DO YOU BUY IT AT SOME MAJOR STORE .
YEAH I THINK JUST UH JUST UH ONE OF THE MAJ MAJOR I THINK IT WAS A YOU KNOW I DO NT I THINK IT WAS UH YOU KNOW LIKE A HIGHLANDS OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS .
HIGHLANDS MUMBLEX CHAIN DOWN THERE THAT I DO NT KNOW UP HERE .
DO THEY HAVE HIGHLANDS UP THERE .
NOPE .
DO NT THEY .
WELL THIS IS IS WAS A REGULAR UH ELECTRONICS STORE YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
SO I DO NT THINK I DO NT THINK THERE WILL BE TOO MUCH PROBLEM BUT I I GUESS I M NOT SURE WHETHER I THINK THINGS ARE NOT MADE AS WELL .
I THINK THEY DELIBERATELY SOMETIMES UM .
I THINK A LOT OF THINGS ARE NOT MADE AS WELL .
DO NT YOU .
WHAT WHAT FOR INSTANCE WHAT ARE YOU .
UM OH WEL OF COURSE IT S HARD TO THINK OF AN EXACT EXAMPLE .
YEAH .
BUT I THINK THAT UM .
THAT S GOOD THEY RE GETTING A KIND OF A ATTITUDE OF .
I JUS .
NOT .
YEAH I JUST HAVE WELL I LIKE ELECTRONIC STUFF .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW FOR ONE THING .
I KNOW THEIR WORK YOU KNOW CARS I THINK ARE NOT MADE .
WELL .
AS WELL AS THEY COULD BE .
YEAH .
YEAH .
UM .
I THINK THAT S RIGHT .
THE FACT THAT .
BECAUSE I THEY WANT PEOPLE TO REPLACE IT AFTER .
RIGHT .
A COUPLE OF YEARS .
THE FACT THAT THEY THAT THEY HAVE COMPETITION WITH THE JAPANESE AND WHATNOT SOMETIMES UH DWELLS ON A FACT THAT YOU KNOW UH I VE HAD I VE KNOWN PEOPLE .
WHO HAVE HAD TOYOTAS FOR YEARS .
THAT HAVE HAD ALMOST NO REPAIR WORK TO DO ON THEM .
UHHUH .
WELL THEY MAY COST A LITTLE MORE BUT THEY DO NT HAVE TO TAKE THEM TO THE SHOP .
EVERY OTHER DAY .
YEAH I HAD A TOYOTA AND I LOVED IT .
YEAH .
MY TOYOTA DID .
IT DOES THE .
REALLY WELL .
IT DID A GOOD JOB SO PART OF IT IS THAT WE NEED TO DEVELOP MORE OF A OF A PRIDE IN IN UH THE KINDS OF THINGS WE DO SO WE MAKE THEM BETTER .
GOOD .
YEAH .
AND IT .
KIND OF HAS TO START FROM THE TOP AND AND GO CLEA OR FROM THE BOTTOM MAYBE AND GO CLEAR UP .
PEOPLE .
WELL I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM COMES IN SORT OF SHODDY WORKMANSHIP .
THE PEOPLE JUST DO NT CARE ABOUT .
NO .
WHAT .
THEY RE DOING .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW THE WHOLE NOBODY CARES NO NOBODY S .
YEAH .
REALLY PAYING .
ATTITUDE IS IS JUST GET ME MY DOLLAR SO I CAN GO DO WHAT .
I WANT TO DO AND MUMBLEX ON .
RIGHT GIVE ME MY PAYCHECK SO I CAN GO HOME .
WHAT .
I M DOING RIGHT .
I THINK THAT S TOO BAD .
AND IT S A SHAME TOO BECAUSE UH WHEN YOU GET RIGHT DOWN TO IT MOST THINGS THERE IS NT ANY IF YOU DO A GOOD JOB NOBODY CAN PAY YOU ENOUGH .
THERE IS NT .
YEAH .
ANY WAY TO GET PAID ENOUGH .
BUT IF YOU DO A GOOD JOB YOU FEEL ENOUGH SATISFACTION SO WHATEVER .
YOU RE PAID IS ENOUGH .
YEAH AND ALSO I THINK WELL I DO RESEARCH AND SO I M USED TO SORT OF BEING UNDERPAID FOR WHATEVER WORK GETS DONE .
UHHUH .
BUT AND YOU GET SATISFACTION OUT OF IT .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND .
I THINK THEY UNDERESTIMATE HOW MUCH HOW MUCH VALUE .
THE SATISFACTION IS .
BUT I THINK A LOT OF IT YOU KNOW I THINK THINGS COME BOTH FROM THE UH INDIVIDUAL SIDE AND ALSO FROM THE COMPANY SIDE BECAUSE THE COMPANIES .
THAT LET GIVE THE ATTITUDE THAT WELL YOU KNOW YOU RE THE LAST ONE HIRED SO YOU LL BE THE FIRST ONE FIRED .
YEAH .
AND WE JUST WANT YOU TO DO YOUR DAYS WORK .
YEAH .
AND WE DO NT REALLY CARE ABOUT YOU .
YEAH .
AS AN INDIVIDUAL .
WHEN YOU VE GOT THAT TYPE OF ATTITUDE ON IT THE PEOPLE DO NT CARE .
NO .
ABOUT THEIR WORK .
AND SO .
IT .
PROBAB IT PROBABLY BASICALLY GOES RIGHT BACK INTO THE H HOME THOUGH UNFORTUNATELY .
STARTS WITH THE ONE PERSON THAT YOU KNOW AND SO YOU NEED TO REALLY WORK HARD AT HELPING YOUR KIDS TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS VALUE JUST IN WORK FOR ITSELF WITHOUT ANY PAY YOU KNOW .
LITTLE VALUE JUST IN WHATEVER .
YOU DO .
YEAH .
THE .
DOING A GOOD JOB OF IT .
THE THE THAT THE VALUE IS IN DOING IT WELL AND .
OKAY .
WELL WHAT WHAT DO YOU IS THINK IS THE UH THE MAIN CHANGE IN WHAT GENERATION ARE YOU I M I M THIRTY YEARS OLD .
I M TWENTYNINE .
YOU RE TWENTYNINE OKAY SO WE RE WE RE BOTH CHILDREN OF THE VERY EARLY SIXTIES .
RIGHT AND I HAVE I MEAN I VE SEEN SOME CHANGE LIKE I KNOW UM WHEN I WAS YOUNG MOST MOTHERS PRETTY MUCH WERE HOUSEWIVES .
UM UM .
AND STAYED AT HOME WITH THE KIDS .
UHHUH .
AND TO TO ME IT SEEMS LIKE ITS ALMOST THE OPPOSITE NOW WHERE THE THE WOMAN IS WORKING AND .
UHHUH .
AND THEY YOU KNOW TAKE THE CHILDREN TO CHILD CARE .
UHHUH .
OR MAYBE THEY WORK PARTTIME OR SOMETHING .
UHHUH UHHUH .
SO THAT SEEMS TO BE A PRETTY BIG CHANGE .
YEAH THE FAMILY STRUCTURE IN GENERAL IS BEING REALLY RESTRUCTURED FROM ONE INCOME TO TWO INCOMES WHICH MEANS FROM ONE PARENT TO TWO PARTTIME PARENTS .
UHHUH .
IF YOU RE LUCKY .
YEAH RIGHT .
UM I UH IT IT S FUNNY IT S BOTH OF US THEN WERE REALLY JUST ADOLESCENTS WHEN WHEN I THINK MOST OF THE MAJOR CHANGES FOR ADULT WOMEN WERE GOING ON .
UHHUH .
IN AMERICA I DO NT THINK CHANGES ARE STILL PROGRESSING BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE UH REALLY THE SEVENTIES THE EARLY SEVENTIES WAS A PERIOD OF THE MOST CHANGE .
UHHUH .
AND IF I HAD TO SOMEWHAT ABSTRACT ABOUT IT IT SEEMS TO BE THE MAJOR CHANGE HAS BEEN THAT WOMAN HAVE ACQUIRED MORE CHOICE .
UHHUH OH THAT S TRUE THAT S TRUE .
UH I MEAN THAT S SORT OF THE OVERALL THE META THE META CHANGE AS IT WERE UH WHERE THAT WOMAN REALLY HAVE MORE OF A CHOICE NOW ABOUT WHAT THEY DO .
UHHUH .
UH COURSE THEY FIND THAT THE CHOICE CREATES ITS OWN HARDSHIPS IN A WAY BECAUSE LIFE IS NOT QUITE AS SIMPLE EVEN IF IT IS FOR YOUR YOU KNOW YOU CAN SHARE SOMETHING YOU REALLY WANT WHICH IS A WONDERFUL THING .
UHHUH .
BUT IT DOES SEEM LIKE AN AWFUL LOT OF MY UH MY ADULT WOMEN FRIENDS ARE ANGUISHING OVER OVER SOME OF SOME OF THESE CHOICES UM .
RIGHT WELL I KNOW THE CHOICE TO EITHER WORK OR TO BE A MOTHER IS PROBABLY PRETTY DIFFICULT BECAUSE I THINK WOMEN JUST NATURALLY TEND TO HAVE THOSE INSTINCTS THAT YOU YOU KNOW YOU PROTECTED THE CHILDREN .
UHHUH .
AND YOU WANT TO BE WITH THE CHILDREN YET THERE S SO MANY MATERIAL THINGS TO BE HAD OUT THERE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK OH BUT IF WE BOTH WORK WE CAN GET A REALLY BIG HOUSE .
YES .
AND WE CAN HAVE TWO REALLY NICE CARS WE CAN TAKE A VACATION WE CAN DO THIS .
YES YES .
AND IT S KIND OF ALMOST EXPECTED OF YOU ANYWAY PEOPLE KIND OF LOOK DOWN ON A ON A YOU KNOW THE ROLE OF A WOMAN AS A HOUSEWIFE IT S KIND OF LIKE OH WELL YOU KNOW SHE DID NT GO TO COLLEGE .
RIGHT .
AND SHE S JUST A HOUSEWIFE .
SHE JUST SETTLED FOR THAT YEAH .
RIGHT RIGHT EVEN THOUGH THERE S PROBABLY WOMEN WITH M B A S MAYBE EVEN PH D S THAT ARE STAYING AT HOME WITH THE CHILDREN UM .
WELL I ONLY KNOW I HAVE OF MY FRIENDS WHO HAVE HAVE CHILDREN UH I ONLY KNOW OF ONE WOMAN WHO S DECIDED TO GO THAT QUOTE UNQUOTE TRADITIONAL ROUTE .
UHHUH .
AND I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR HER BECAUSE SHE MADE IT AS A REAL CHOICE .
UHHUH .
SHE REALLY KNEW THAT SHE DID NT HAVE TO DO THAT BUT SHE DECIDED THAT WAS WHAT SHE WANTED TO DO IN HER LIFE .
UHHUH .
AND SHE WANTED THAT ROLE SHE S A MARVELOUS PARENT AND I YOU KNOW I SAY ALL POWER TO HER BECAUSE SHE S AN EXAMPLE TO ME OF SOMEONE WHO REALLY DOES HAVE THE CHOICE .
UHHUH .
I FEEL THAT A LOT OF UH WOMEN DO NT ALL RIGHT I SAID THEY HAVE THE CHOICE BUT THEY DO NT NECESSARILY FEEL THAT THEY DO BECAUSE THEY NO LONGER FEEL LIKE IF THEY WERE JUST TO BE A PARENT RATHER THAN UH YOU KNOW A SORT OF SUPER WOMAN SUCCESS IN THE BUSINESS WORLD AS WELL .
UHHUH .
THEY WOULD SOMEHOW BE PERCEIVED AS A FAILURE .
RIGHT .
IN THEIR OWN EYES OR IN OTHERS AND AND THEN YOU AND THEN IT S NOT A CHOICE ANYMORE .
UHHUH .
UH AND FRANKLY IT S THE WAY THAT MEN ARE UH MEN DO NT HAVE THIS CHOICE .
UHHUH .
THEY DO NT FEEL THIS CHOICE UH IN MOST SUBCULTURES IN AMERICA THAT THAT I VE BEEN EXPOSED TO IF THE MAN WERE TO SAY UH NO I VE DECIDED NOT TO WORK I WANT TO STAY HOME AND DO THE CHILD REARING MY WIFE HAS A GOOD JOB AND I WANT HER TO KEEP THAT .
UHHUH .
AND I I M GOING TO BE THE PRIMARY CARETAKER AND YOU KNOW AND THEN THEN TAKE CARE OF THE CHILDREN BECAUSE WE DO NT WANT TO PUT THEM IN DAY CARE AND THIS AND THAT I THINK MOST AMERICANS WOULD FEEL FUNNY ABOUT THAT .
YEAH .
MAYBE SORT OF FEEL LIKE HE IS NT THAT SUCCESS THAT HE COULD HAVE BEEN .
RIGHT .
SO IT S UM .
THERE S SOME T V SHOW ON NOW AND I I THINK I VE SEEN IT ONCE I DO NT GET TO WATCH MUCH T V BUT UH THERE S A T V SHOW WHERE THE MAN IS THE ONE RAISING THE KIDS .
UHHUH .
AND THE WIFE IS AND I MAYBE THEY BASED IT ON THAT MISTER MOM MOVIE BUT UH .
I DID NT HAPPEN TO SEE THAT .
BUT UH THERE IS A T V SHOW OUT THERE I GUESS THEY RE TRYING TO GAIN MORE PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE OF THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE I KNOW THERE ARE CASES OF WHERE THAT HAPPENS AND .
OH YEAH I KNEW I KNEW PEOPLE WHO DID THAT YEARS AGO .
UHHUH .
BUT THEY WERE VERY APOLOGETIC ABOUT IT BECAUSE YOU COULD TELL THEY WERE USED TO PEOPLE SAYING WHAT ARE YOU DOING THAT FOR YOU KNOW .
RIGHT IT S PROBABLY GETTING MORE AND MORE ACCEPTED TODAY IN FACT IT SEEMS LIKE IT S KIND OF LIKE ANYTHING GOES NOW YOU RE NOT TOO SURPRISED ON MUCH OF ANYTHING WHEN YOU KNOW THE HUSBAND S THE ONE AT HOME RAISING THE CHILDREN .
YEAH .
THE MOTHER WORKS THAT S NOT REAL SURPRISING AND .
YEAH I VE SEEN MORE AND MORE COMPANIES THAT HAVE UH PARENTAL LEAVE NOT JUST MATERNITY LEAVE .
RIGHT .
THEY CAN HAVE PATERNITY LEAVE AS WELL AS MATERNITY LEAVE .
YEAH IN FACT I M PRETTY SURE TI HAS SOMETHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE UH ONE OF THE AREA SUPERVISORS UH IN MY AREA AS A MATTER OF FACT TOOK OFF UM FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS WHEN HIS WIFE HAD THEIR BABY .
UHHUH .
NOW IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN JUST TO TAKE CARE OF HER AND THE BABY .
YEAH .
INSTEAD OF HAVING A YOU KNOW A A NURSE OR SOMEONE COME IN OR .
UHHUH UHHUH .
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR WHATEVER MIDWIFE OR WHATEVER THEY CALL IT THAT THEY HAVE FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF WEEKS .
YEAH .
BUT I DO NT KNOW IF HE TOOK THAT OUT OF HIS VACATION OR IF THEY REALLY DO HAVE A PATERNITY HE PUT PATERNITY LEAVE UP THERE BUT IT MIGHT HAVE JUST BEEN HIM DESCRIBING THE FACT THAT HE WAS TAKING VACATION DAYS TO GO BE A FATHER FOR A LITTLE WHILE .
UHHUH UHHUH UHHUH .
I DO NT KNOW BUT I M NOT REAL SURE HOW THAT GOES .
YEAH THE OTHER BIG CHANGE I SEE IN IN WOMAN S LIVES IS UM TO REMAIN BIOLOGICAL THEY UH WOMEN BECAUSE THEY HAVE CHOICE ARE HAVING CHILDREN MUCH LATER IN LIFE .
RIGHT .
UH I MEAN MY FRIENDS WHO ARE HAVING CHILDREN ARE HAVING THEM AT AGE THIRTY .
UHHUH .
AND UH IF I D BEEN A COUPLE OF GENERATIONS AGO THEY WOULD HAVE HAD KIDS RUNNING AROUND BY THEN .
RIGHT WELL PEOPLE THEY IN GENERAL ARE JUST GETTING MARRIED A LOT LATER I M STILL SINGLE SO I M SURE I LL BE ONE OF THOSE PARENTS THAT S YOU KNOW ONE OF THOSE WOMEN IN HER THIRTIES WHEN WHEN I GET AROUND TO TO EVER GETTING MARRIED AND HAVING KIDS .
YEAH YEAH .
THAT S UH I THINK I THINK THAT S GETTING A LITTLE MORE COMMON TOO .
YEAH I ACTUALLY THINK THAT I M I M SOMEWHAT ENCOURAGED BY THAT TREND BECAUSE AFTER ALL PEOPLE LIVE LONGER LIVES NOW .
UHHUH .
SO IT S NOT LIKE YOU KNOW IT S NOT LIKE YOU RE GOING TO UH YOU KNOW PASS AWAY BEFORE YOUR CHILD IS AN ADULT .
RIGHT .
I MEAN BARRING YOU KNOW UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES AND I THINK MOST PEOPLE MAKE BETTER PARENTS WHEN THEY ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE MATURE .
YEAH I AGREE .
I REALLY DO .
I AGREE I THINK IT ALSO GIVES A WOMAN A CHANCE IF SHE DOES HAVE A JOB AND A CAREER IT GIVES THE MAN AND THE WIFE BOTH THE CHANCE TO BOTH BE WORKING AND MAYBE SAVE UP SOME MONEY AND THEN IT GIVES HER A LITTLE MORE OPTION IF SHE WANTS TO STAY HOME WITH THE CHILDREN WHILE THEY RE YOUNG .
UHHUH .
AND BE A MOTHER FOR AWHILE AND THEN ONCE THEY VE GOTTEN TO SCHOOL AGE MAYBE SHE COULD GO BACK TO WORK SO SHE S KIND OF GOT THAT OPTION .
YEAH .
IF IF THEY WAIT TILL LATER THEY VE SAVED UP SOME MONEY THAT IT S NOT AS DIFFICULT FOR HER TO STAY AT HOME WITH THE KIDS AND LIVE OFF ONE INCOME OR SOMETHING .
YEAH YEAH THAT S TRUE SO I GUESS I I M PRETTY ENCOURAGED .
YEAH .
I REALLY AM BUT THEN I M A PRODUCT OF MY GENERATION I DO NT KNOW IF I HAD BEEN BORN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO AND WERE LOOKING AT THIS TIME I MIGHT NOT LIKE IT BUT IT SURE SEEMS NICE TO ME .
UHHUH .
UH I MEAN I HAVE OTHER THINGS TO COMPLAIN ABOUT BUT IN TERMS OF UH WOMAN S ROLES .
UHHUH .
UM THINGS REALLY SEEM A LOT MORE FLEXIBLE .
I SEEM TO SEE MORE WOMEN IN UH IN LEADERSHIP TYPE ROLES AND MANAGEMENT POSITIONS .
YEAH I MEAN IT S STILL .
IN POLITICS .
IT S STILL A SMALL MINORITY BUT IT S .
YEAH .
BUT IT S AN IMPROVEMENT IT REALLY IS .
LIKE THE MAYOR OF DALLAS IS A WOMAN .
OH REALLY .
AND I M SURE THAT TWENTY YEARS AGO THAT NEVER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED BUT .
UHHUH .
YEAH SHE S I THINK SHE S IN HER SECOND TERM NOW SO SHE S SHE S YEAH THIS IS HER SECOND TERM I THINK SHE S GOING TO GOING TO UH .
UHHUH .
NOT GOING TO RUN AGAIN AFTER THIS BUT BUT UH WE DO AND WE HAVE SEVERAL COUNCIL WOMEN THAT ARE WOMEN BUT .
YEAH .
YOU JUST START HEARING MORE AND MORE IN FACT OH THE THE GOVERNOR OF TEXAS IS A WOMAN TOO .
OH .
WE CA NT FORGET THAT ONE SO .
WHAT S WHAT S HER NAME .
ANN RICHARDS .
NO IT WE DO NT GET MUCH TEXAS POLITICS OUT IN CALIFORNIA TO BE HONEST .
YEAH SHE WAS INAUGURATED IN JANUARY SO .
UHHUH .
SO YOU RE STARTING TO SEE MORE OF THAT AND I KNOW WHEN I WAS YOUNGER IT WAS ALL THE PRESIDENTS AND STILL ALL THE PRESIDENTS ARE MEN BUT I M SURE THAT ONE OF THESE DAYS WELL LOOK AT FERRARO RAN FOR VICEPRESIDENT .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND I GUESS ONE OF THESE DAYS WE LL WE LL EVENTUALLY HAVE .
ALTHOUGH DURING DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES THERE WAS SOME REALLY NASTY PATRONIZING .
UHHUH .
STUFF TOWARD I DO NT KNOW IF YOU SAW THOSE BUT I THOUGHT SHE WAS TREATED BADLY FOR BEING A WOMAN .
UHHUH .
FRANKLY I REALLY DID BY BY UH THE THE THEN VICEPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES .
UHHUH .
UH WHO REALLY I THOUGHT HAD A DEMEANING ATTITUDE TOWARDS HER .
YEAH .
AND UH IT WAS SORT OF IT WAS ACCEPTABLE TO SAY CERTAIN TYPES OF THINGS TO HER THAT SHE COULD NT SAY BACK .
UHHUH .
THAT KIND OF THING WHICH I I I FOUND MYSELF GETTING QUITE ENRAGED ABOUT .
UHHUH .
BUT REALLY THAT S A PREVIOUS GENERATION .
UHHUH .
I DO NT IT S HARDER TO IMAGINE PEOPLE OF OUR AGE DOING THAT .
RIGHT .
AND NOT FEELING REALLY STUPID .
RIGHT RIGHT I AGREE WELL I THINK WE VE WE VE GOTTEN OUR FIVE MINUTES OR .
WELL THEY VE GOTTEN THEIR FIVE MINUTES WORTH OF US I VE ENJOYED TALKING WITH YOU .
IT WAS NICE TALKING TO YOU TOO .
OKAY TAKE CARE .
YOU TOO BYE BYE .
BYE BYE .
OKAY UM I DO NT KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT WHERE I AM WE HAVE A LIKE AN EXTREMELY LAX DRESS POLICY AT WORK AND IT VARIES LIKE EVERY DAY I MEAN FROM JEANS ONE DAY TO BUSINESS SUITS THE NEXT .
IT S PRETTY BAD BUT IT S TRUE YOU KNOW THEY TEND TO TRY TO BE YOU KNOW REAL LAX AND SUPPOSEDLY THE POLICY IS LIKE YOU KNOW WE YOU KNOW WE HIRE THESE WONDERFUL CREATIVE PEOPLE AND WE DO NT WANT TO SMUSH THEIR CREATIVITY YOU KNOW WE WANT TO GO AHEAD AND LET THEM DO WHAT EVER THEY WANT AND YOU KNOW YOU REALLY WILL SEE PEOPLE IN IN JEANS ONE DAY AND BUSINESS SUITS THE NEXT .
WELL I M KIND OF THAT WAY TOO I WORK IN THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT AND WHERE WE ARE NOW WHAT WE RE DOING IS SOME VERY BIG LAWSUITS THAT HAPPEN TO HAVE A HECK OF A LOT OF BOXES OF DOCUMENTS .
YEAH AND I GET TO TOTING AROUND BOXES OF DOCUMENTS SEVERAL TIMES A DAY IT ALWAYS SEEMS LIKE I M DOING THAT AND I CA NT SEE GETTING DRESSED UP AND WEARING HEELS AND STUFF WHEN YOU HAVE TO CARRY YOU KNOW BOXES OF DOCUMENTS AROUND SO IF I M JUST GOING TO BE THERE WORKING IN THE LITIGATION CENTER AND DOING YOU KNOW ODDS AND ENDS AND STUFF WITH THE BOXES OF DOCUMENTS I DRESS DOWN BUT IF WE RE GOING TO HAVE A MEETING WHERE WE RE HAVING THE ATTORNEYS COME IN OR PEOPLE FROM UH OTHER PARTY S ATTORNEYS AND STUFF THEN I NORMALLY DRESS UP YEAH AND I LL WEAR A DRESS AND HOSE AND STUFF .
YEAH YOU KNOW WE RE KIND OF THAT WAY TOO I TRY TO I M THE SAME WAY YOU ARE I KIND OF TRY TO JUDGE FROM DAY TO DAY I KNOW YOU KNOW WHERE I AM WE WORK A LOT WITH THE CUSTOMERS AND WE HAVE A LOT OF GOVERNMENT FOLKS COME IN ALL THE TIME AND .
UHHUH .

UHHUH .
AND IT S JUST MUMBLEX IT S JUST IMPOSSIBLE TO CRAWL DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND DIG THROUGH BOXES IN A DRESS .
THAT S RIGHT THAT S RIGHT .
IT IS AND SO .
AS A MATTER OF FACT I THOUGHT I HAD ONE FUNNY STORY WHEN UH I WAS AT T I THE FIRST YEAR OR SO WE WERE SENT OUT TO OUR RECORD RETENTION FACILITY TO LOOK THROUGH TWO THOUSAND BOXES WE HAD THEM IN THE WAREHOUSE .
UH .
AND AT THAT POINT IT THE WAREHOUSE WAS OVER ACROSS THE ROAD AND IT WAS NT AIR CONDITIONED AND IT WE WERE THERE LIKE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SUMMER IT S UNAIRCONDITIONED IT WAS DUSTY AND DIRTY UH THERE WAS LIKE A FAN AT THE VERY END OF THE ROW AND THAT WAS IT AND SO WE DID NT REALLY KNOW WE WERE NT SUPPOSED TO WE THOUGHT T I DRESS CODE WAS JUST DRESS APPROPRIATE TO YOUR JOB .
UHHUH .
WE WORE SHORTS WE DID NT KNOW THAT WAS A BIG NO NO .
OH NO .
AND THE SUPERVISOR FROM ANOTHER AREA CAME UP TO US AND YOU KNOW THIS AREA WHERE RECORD RETENTION IS THERE S ONLY A FEW PEOPLE THAT WORK THERE AND HE SHO HE KNEW WHO WORKED THERE HE SHOULD HAVE REALIZED THAT WE WERE NT REGULARS IN THE WAREHOUSE THERE AND HE CAME UP TO US AND HE JUST SAID WHO S YOUR SUPERVISOR WELL HE CALLED OUR SUPERVISOR AND OUR SUPERVISOR AND OUR SUPERVISOR S SUPERVISOR AND IT WENT UP ALL THE WAY TO THE HEAD OF FACILITIES .
OH NO .
COMPLAINING THAT WE WERE WEARING SHORTS HE DID NT AT AT LEAST SAY TO US DID YOU KNOW YOU RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THAT THAT COULD HAVE ALLEVIATED A BIG PROBLEM WE ENDED UP GETTING CALLED OUT ON IT .
OH HOW AWFUL IT SOUNDS LIKE MISTER POWER HUNGRY .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW JUST YESTERDAY THOUGH I SAW A GIRL IN THE SPINE OUT HERE AT LEWISVILLE THAT HAD ON A PAIR OF SHORTS .
UHHUH .
AND I DO NT CARE YOU CAN CALL THEM SPLIT SKIRTS AND YOU CAN CALL THEM CULOTTES ALL YOU WANT BUT THESE WERE SHORTS THAT S ALL THEY WERE .
I DO NT CARE WHAT ELSE YOU CALL THEM YOU KNOW IF THEY RE BELOW THE KNEE OKAY MAYBE YOU CAN CALL THEM SPLIT SKIRTS IF THEY RE ABOVE THE KNEE THEY TURN INTO SHORTS YOU KNOW .
AND THESE WERE NT EVEN REALLY FULL ONES I MEAN THEY HAD A PROBLEM OUT HERE WITH IT LAST SUMMER WEARING THESE SHORTS THAT WERE YOU KNOW THE REAL WIDE FULL ONES YOU KNOW AND BECAU THESE WERE NT EVEN THOSE THESE WERE LIKE PRETTY SHORT BLACK AND THEY WERE VERY DRESSY THE WERE BLACK VELVET SHORTS AND SHE HAD ON BLACK HOSE AND BLACK HEELS AND SHE LOOKED VERY VERY NICE .

OH YEAH IT S IT S UH ABSOLUTELY IT S GREAT THE WAY THAT IT S BROKEN OUT AND YOU CAN UH SET UP LITTLE TRIPS AND DAY TRIPS AND THINGS IT S PRETTY PRETTY NEAT UM OH I LIKE PHOTOGRAPHY UM MAGAZINES I DO NT TAKE A SUBSCRIPTION OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT UM THINGS OH BEING AN ENGINEER IN FACILITIES I DO READ A LOT OF A LOT OF UH BUILDING MAGAZINES AND AND AND PLANT ENGINEERING MAGAZINES AND READ UP ON DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO THINGS AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT TYPE OF MAGAZINES AND .
UHHUH .
AND UH KIND OF STRANGE BECAUSE I IT S NOT UNUSUAL TO UH SEE UH AN ENGINEERING MANUAL OR SOMETHING LAYING AROUND THE HOUSE AND THEN I LL SIT UP AND READ JUST TO REFRESH UH YOU KNOW TO KEEP ACTIVE ON IT BUT UH .
UHHUH .
HOW ABOUT YOURSELF .
WELL UM I HAVE AN INTEREST IN ART SO I FREQUENTLY PURCHASE AND READ UH BOOKS MAINLY ON WATER COLOR BECAUSE THAT S MY BIG INTEREST AT THE MOMENT .
OH THAT S GREAT .
AND UH OH I GUESS I LIKE A VARIETY OF THINGS UH LOTS OF FICTION UH TYPE BOOKS UH RIGHT NOW I M OCCASIONALLY READING ON A BOOK ABOUT UH THE MARDI GRAS IN NEW ORLEANS AND ITS HISTORY .
UHHUH .
THAT S FAIRLY INTERESTING .
I BET THAT WOULD BE RATHER INTERESTING UH THAT S UH SELF IMPROVEMENT THAT S THAT S ALWA WELL THAT S KIND OF A HOBBY BUT IT IS SELF IMPROVEMENT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF PROBABLY RELAXING UH .
YEAH I DO NT KNOW THAT I READ ANYTHING STRICTLY LABELED SELF IMPROVEMENT HOW ABOUT YOU .
UM WELL I HATE TO YES I DO .
WE UH WE HAVE THESE CLASSES WE ATTEND UH MANAGEMENT CLASSES AND AND THEY GIVE YOU BOOKS AND AND THE LAST BOOK UH MATTER OF FACT I READ WAS AT AMERICA S SERVICE BY CARL ALBRECHT IT TALKS ABOUT UH WHO THE CUSTOMER IS AND BEING CUSTOMER ORIENTED UH WHICH FALLS IN LINE WITH THE T I CULTURE HERE AT TEXAS INSTRUMENTS .
YEAH .
UH ONE OF IT S GREAT SLOGANS IS IF YOU RE NOT SERVING THE CUSTOMER YOU BETTER BE SERVING SOMEONE WHO IS .
UHHUH .
UH SO THAT S ALL IN SELF IMPROVEMENT TO STAY FOCUSED ON WHO THE CUSTOMER IS AND AS YOU PROBABLY WELL KNOW ALL OF US ARE OUR OWN CUSTOMER YOUR MY CUSTOMER I M YOUR CUSTOMER SORT OF THING .
RIGHT .
UM EVERY NOW AND THEN I M LOANED A TAPE I CAN STICK IN THE UH IN THE CAR CASSETTE SET ON THE WAY HOME TO MAKE THE DRIVE MORE ENJOYABLE TALKING ABOUT UH BETTER OUTLOOKS ON THINGS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF OF PAT HAGERTY AND THESE KIND OF UH MIND STIMULATING PHILOSOPHY TYPE .
YEAH .
WHICH ALL YOU KNOW BETTERS YOURSELF .
YEAH YEAH WELL UH MAYBE I AM INTO SOME THINGS OCCASIONALLY THAT I DO NT THINK OF IN TERMS OF SELF IMPROVEMENT .
UHHUH .
I MEAN THEY ARE BUT I DO NT LABEL IT AS SUCH .
LIKE WHAT FOR EXAMPLE .
WELL I DO NT KNOW UM I UH HAVE ATTENDED SOME SEMINARS THAT HAD SOME TAPES THAT WENT WITH THEM BUT UH I GUESS NOT SO MUCH BOOKS ALTHOUGH THEY SOMETIMES HAVE MANUALS AND THINGS BUT UH THEY WOULD BE THINGS ON LIKE HOW TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND SORT OF TALKING TO YOURSELF YOU KNOW GE GETTING YOUR YOURSELF IN GEAR TO UH SORT OF PULL YOURSELF UP BY YOUR BOOT STRAPS AND DO WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO DO .
SURE .
CONVINCING YOU THAT YOU NEED TO GET ON WITH IT .
SURE HOW ABOUT ITEMS LIKE UM THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER WHICH USED TO BE A BIG OKAY .
YES .
SO THOSE ARE SELF IMPROVEMENTS .
SURE .
UM OUR SUPERVISOR UH SUBTLY BOUGHT ALL OF US A BOOK CALLED WHAT EVERY SUPERVISOR SHOULD KNOW .
UM .
BY A MAN MAN NAMED DOCTOR BITTEL B I T T E L AND IT S A VERY LAYMAN S UH UH APPROACH TOWARDS MANAGING DIFFERENT TYPES OF PEOPLE AND THE VERY LAST CHAPTER AND I HAVE NT FIGURED OUT WHY THAT ONE WAS LAST IS HOW TO MANAGE ENGINEERS .
SO IT S IT S VER IT S INTERESTING HERE AGAIN IT S IT S CASUAL READING AND IT S NOT EATEN UP WITH A LOT OF UH MECHANICAL STUFF AND IT S REALLY EXCELLENT FAST READING AND UH BUT AS YOU SAY IT S IT S SOMETIMES IT S DIFFICULT TO TO KNOW IF IT S YOU KNOW I THINK IF SOMEBODY WOULD SAY HEY READ THESE TEN BOOKS BECAUSE THESE ARE SELFIMPROVEMENTS I WOULD PROBABLY BE TURNED OFF TO THEM .
YEAH YEAH .
IF HE CASUALLY JUST WALKED INTO IT AND UH PUT DOWN A STEPHEN KING BOOK AND I PICKED UP ONE OF THEM I MIGHT BE A LITTLE MORE INTERESTED .
I DO NT KNOW I M NOT SURE I COULD TAKE TOO MUCH OF STEPHEN KING THAT S A LITTLE LITTLE HEAVY FOR ME .
YEAH THEY RE UH QUITE UH THEY RE HARD TO SET DOWN BECAUSE IT S SO INTERESTING AND OF COURSE THEY RE ALL JUST A LITTLE SPOOKIER THAN THE MOVIES BUT UH .
YEAH .
IT S ALWAYS THEY RE ALWAYS CHALLENGING TO GET THROUGH ONE OF THEM I HAVE A HARD TIME FINISHING BOOKS .
WELL I GUESS I ALSO HAVE BEEN READING UH A LOT OF THINGS ON UH QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AND THAT TYPE OF THING BECAUSE THAT S WHAT I M INVOLVED IN A LOT AT WORK .
UHHUH IN QUALITY ESPECIALLY NOW DAYS UH THAT S ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT COMES ACROSS THE THE THE AIRWAYS MUMBLEX .
OH YEAH YOU COULD ALMOST LABEL EVERYTHING QUALITY IN SOME SENSE OR OTHER BUT UH .
EXACTLY EXACTLY RIGHT .
I THINK SOMETIMES THE WORD IS A LITTLE OVER USED BUT .
YEAH WE WE HAVE I THINK WE WE NAME DROP IT A LITTLE TOO MUCH AND AND DO NT FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT IT IS WE RE SAYING I THINK IT S JUST FOCUSING IN ON THE ISSUE AND WALKING YOUR TALK AND AND ALL THAT KIND OF ROLLS IN TOGETHER THERE .
YEAH .
BUT UH THAT S JUST KIND OF PART OF IT .
OKAY WELL ANY OTHER COMMENTS .
UH NOT THAT I CAN THINK OF UM I THINK I M UNDER MY QUOTA A LITTLE BIT I NEED TO PROBABLY MAKE A PHONE CALL OR TWO .
WELL WE JUST STARTED RIGHT .
UH THIS IS TRUE I VE ENJOYED IT .
WELL YOU TOO AND UH GOODBYE .
HAVE A GOOD DAY .
GOODBYE .
BYEBYE .
WELL WAYNE I UH FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT PARENTS DOING THINGS WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND MAKING TIME AVAILABLE EVEN SOMETIMES WHEN TIME IS NT AVAILABLE HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IT .
WELL YEAH I FEEL MUCH THE SAME WAY I VE UH TWO KIDS RIGHT NOW .
YEAH .
ONE IS TWO AND A HALF AND ONE S NINE MONTHS AND UH THAT AGE OF COURSE EVERYTHING YOU DO THEY RE TRYING TO LEARN TO DO AND SO UH IT S IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO SPEND TIME DOING THE THINGS THAT YOU WANT THEM TO LEARN YOU KNOW THAT THAT THEY NEED TO LEARN AT THE AGE YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
READING AND UH READING AND PLAYING NICE WITH OTHERS AND THAT SORT OF THING .
YEAH WE WENT THROUGH THIS WITH OUR CHILDREN AND NOW WITH OUR GRANDCHILDREN AND I VE ALWAYS TRIED TO DO THINGS WITH THEM UH LIKE WHEN YOU RE AT THE LITTLE LEAGUE HELPING OUT EVEN THOUGH I M NOT A GOOD ATHLETE MYSELF I WAS ABLE TO HELP THE COACH IN IN JUST CONTROLLING THE KIDS IF NOTHING ELSE AND WE VE ALWAYS UH OH TRIED TO TAKE OUR CHILDREN AND NO NOW AT THIS AGE OUR GRANDCHILDREN TO SEE AND DO THINGS THAT OTHERWISE THEY MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO I THINK THAT S JUST PART OF THEIR OVERALL EDUCATIONAL PROCESS IS TO GET OUT AND SEE AND DO THINGS .
RIGHT UHHUH .
YEAH YEAH AND SO IT S UH WE HAVE UH LIVED SEVERAL PLACES AROUND THE U S AND WE HAVE WHERE WE VE LIVED WE VE TAKEN THEM TO SEE AND DO THINGS OF INTEREST AND OF HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE IN THE AREA LIKE WHEN WE LIVED IN TENNESSEE WE WE TOOK THEM TO WASHINGTON D C TO SEE ALL THE CAPITOL AND AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHEN THEY WERE SMALL AND IT S JUST UH IT S HELPS I THINK THE CHILDREN TO WHEN THEY RE LEARNING IN SCHOOL TO SAY WELL I VE BEEN THERE AND I VE SEEN THAT .
RIGHT .
YEAH .
UHHUH .
YEAH SO UH THAT S THE TYPE .
YEAH IT CERTAINLY DOES BECAUSE UH YOU KNOW THE THINGS IN THE BOOKS SEEM SO DEAD TO THE KIDS YOU KNOW UNLESS THEY VE ACTUALLY BEEN THERE OR WHATEVER BECAUSE I REMEMBER OUR FAMILY WELL WE WE WE WENT EVERYWHERE AND UH SEEING NEW ENGLAND AND UH BEING ON PLYMOUTH ROCK AND STUFF LIKE THAT WAS .

YEAH WE VE UH .
GONE THROUGH THAT UH I REMEMBER MY PARENTS DID NT DO ALL THOSE TYPE THINGS AND SO I MADE A SPECIAL EFFORT WITH MY CHILDREN TO DO THINGS LIKE THAT AND EVEN NOW WITH MY GRANDCHILDREN I FEEL IT S A VERY IMPORTANT THING TO BE DONE RIGHT BECAUSE IF UH KIDS DO NT LOOK UP TO YOU OR OR CA CA NT FEEL THEY CAN SPEND TIME WITH YOU THEY RE GOING TO FIND SOMEONE ELSE .
YEAH .
AND UH YOU KNOW NOWADAYS THERE S A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT YOU DO NT WANT YOUR KID TO EMULATING OR WHATEVER .
YEAH WELL I CAN REMEMBER ONE OF THE THINGS I M MOST PROUD OF IS UH WHEN MY SON WAS I THINK IT WAS IN THE SIXTH GRADE THEY HAD TO WRITE A A LITTLE BRIEF AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF THEMSELVES AND ABOUT WHAT THEY HAD DONE AND WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO AND I WAS VERY PROUD WHEN MY SON WROTE THAT HE WANTED TO UH HAVE A FAMILY AND BE ABLE TO HELP COACH LITTLE LEAGUE AND DO THINGS LIKE HIS DAD HAD DONE WITH HIM .
A REAL POINT OF PRIDE WITH ME .
YEAH THAT IS NICE .
YEAH EXCUSE ME IT SOUNDS LIKE WE BOTH HAVE COLDS .

ALL WEEKEND BECAUSE UH THE WALLPAPER GETTING IT OFF I HAD TO WET THE WALLS DOWN AND THAT HAD TO DRY .
AND THEN THE SPACKLING HAD TO DRY A DAY AND THEN THE PAINTING TOOK ANOTHER DAY .
YOU DID NT TRY RE REWALLPAPERING .

IT WAS UH JUST A REAL DARK UH WOOD GRAIN TYPE PANELING .
UHHUH .
AND IT WAS SMOOTH AND UH AND WE WOULD WE PUT THIS STUFF ON AND AND IT SUPPOSEDLY TEXTURED IT OR DID SOMETHING TO IT AND BUT BECAUSE OF THE B DARK BEHIND IT IT WAS REALLY HARD TO COVER AND .

THEY GIVE YOU IS UH THE JOB WAS CONSIDERABLY TOUGHER THAN WE THOUGHT .
YEAH .
UH PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU TRY TO I WAS TALKING TO SOMEBODY ELSE WHO WHO HAD A LOT OF WOOD PANELLING AND UH THEY HAD GOTTEN SOMEBODY TO COME IN WITH AN ESTIMATE AND IT SEEMED LIKE THERE WAS IT WAS A GOOD SIZED DEN WITH A LOT PANELLING AND THE PEOPLE QUOTED THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO PAINT IT OR SOMETHING .
OH MY GOODNESS THAT S AN AWFUL LOT .
HAVE YOU HAVE YOU TRIED GETTING OUTSIDE ESTIMATES TO SEE WHAT .
IT COSTS TO HAVE SOMETHING PAINTED .

WE HAVE A BRICK HOUSE BUT ALL THE TRIM .
YEAH .
AROUND THE HOUSE WAS UH IF I REMEMBER RIGHT IT WAS LIKE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS .
OH THAT S QUITE REASONABLE .
YEAH .

MUMBLEX .
SO THAT WAS NT TOO BAD .

UHHUH .
UM FROM I FORGOTTEN THIS IS SHERWIN WILLIAMS PAINT OR SOMETHING BUT ANYWAY .
IT S IT S REMARKABLE .
THAT S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THOUGH WHEN YOU START PAINTING TO TRY TO GET THE YOU KNOW YOU WANT THIS YOU WANT THIS TO LOOK LIKE THIS AND YOU WANT THAT TO LOOK LIKE THAT AND .
UHHUH .
OF COURSE IF IT S ALL WHITE YOU RE ALL RIGHT BUT WHEN YOU START GETTING INTO COLORS HAVE YOU HAD PROBLEMS GETTING COLORS TO MATCH .

HOW ABOUT YOU .
WELL I I CERTAINLY HOPE SO .
WE HAVE A A CLASSIC RANCH UP IN DENTON .
RANCH STYLE HOME I SHOU I WOULD HATE TO THINK THAT ANYBODY THOUGHT UH THE LOT .
WE LIVE ON AS A RANCH .
UH IT S IN A SUBDIVISION AND ONE STORY .
IT STARTED OUT LIFE AS A THREE BEDROOM HOUSE AND NOW HAS NO TWO CAR GARAGE AND HAS UH THE TWO EXTRA ROOMS ENCLOSED .
I SUPPOSE WE STILL ONLY HAVE THREE EFFECTIVE BEDROOMS BUT WE GAINED A PLAYROOM FOR THE KIDS AND AN OFFICE OUT OF ENCLOSING THE GARAGE .
ARE MOST OF THE HOUSES IN YOUR AREA THREE BEDROOM TWO BATH .
ALMOST A HUNDRED PERCENT .
I I CA NT THINK OF ANY FOUR BEDROOM HOUSES IN THE SUBDIVISION .
OURS IS PROBABLY THE CLOSEST TO IT .
YOU KNOW HOW REALTORS ARE THEY LL SAY OH THIS COULD BE FIVE BEDROOMS .
YEAH IF YOU HAD TWO PEOPLE .
THAT DO NT HAVE ANY CLOTHES .
IT COULD BE A FIVE BEDROOM HOUSE .
YEAH TO .
DO NT NEED A CLOSET .
THE ONLY THING ABOUT MINE UM I THINK THERE S PROBABLY ABOUT OH WHEN I GO DOWN THE STREET .
I CAN JUST PICK OUT HOUSES .
THAT ARE THAT ARE IDENTICAL TO MINE AND USUALLY THEY ARE THE FOUR BEDROOM UM BUT THEY RE SPACED OUT OH I D SAY MAYBE THREE ON A TWO BLOCK PERIOD .
BECAUSE IT S ALL DIFFERENT BUILDERS UP HERE .
SO IT S KIND OF HARD AT THAT POINT TO YOU KNOW CLASSIFY SOME OF THE BUILDERS .
BUT MOST OF THE BUILDERS ALL BUILT THREE TWO .
BUT THE ONE THING MY HOUSE IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT AND I CAN PICK IT OUT AGAIN BECAUSE IT S NOT TYPICAL IS I VE GOT THE OH WHAT DO YOU CALL A UH DOUBLE CEILING DOUBLE HIGH IN ONE .
HALF OF THE HOUSE .
SO LIKE THE DEN AND THE LIVING ROOM ARE ALL DOUBLE CATHEDRAL CEILINGS .
UH CATHEDRAL CEILINGS .
AND UH THE KITCHEN IS NORM AND THE BEDROOMS ARE NORM .
SO IT JUST GOES DOWN THE DINING ROOM THE FAMILY ROOM AND THE LIVING ROOM .
THAT WAY .
AND I LOVE THE SPACE .
IT JUST IT S UH LUCKILY I CAME FROM A HOUSE IN COLORADO .
WHICH HAD THE CATHEDRAL CEILING AND I JUST LUCKED OUT AND WALKED INTO THIS ONE AND OF COURSE .
I FELT THE SAME AIRY FEELING WHICH .
I LIKED IT REAL WELL SO IT S A NICE THING TO MOVE INTO BUT AGAIN IT S NOT TYPICAL IN THIS AREA .
YOU CAN JUST SPOT THEM BECAUSE THE CE THE ROOF IS SO HI MUCH HIGHER .
BUT UH .
WELL I HAD NT THOUGHT ABOUT IT IN THAT SENSE OF THE HIGH ROOFS .
WE HAVE CATHEDRAL CEILINGS IN UH TWO ROOMS .
IN THE UH FAMILY ROOM AND IN THE MASTER BEDROOM AND THOSE ARE ARE PLEASANT .
YEAH .
WELL IT .
S LIKE WHEN MY SON GOES UP INTO THE UP INTO THE FURNACE AREA OVER THE GARAGE .
YEAH .
HE CAN WALK AND HE S SIX FOOT .
AND HE SAYS OH COME ON UP MOM .
I M NOT GOING UP THERE .
I M NOT GOING UP THERE BUT HE SAYS THERE S PLENTY OF ROOM UP THERE FOR A ROOM .
SO THAT MEANS IF I KNOCK OUT THE WALL IN MY FAMILY ROOM I COULD MAKE ANOTHER ROOM OVERLOOKING MY FAMILY ROOM FROM UPSTAIRS WITH NO PROBLEM .
BUT UM I M NOT THAT AMBITIOUS .
I TOL MAYBE SOMEDAY WHEN I FEEL REALLY AMBITIOUS AND AN GET ANGRY I LL START POKING HOLES UP THERE BUT UNTIL THAT TIME .
BUT UH I VE NOTICED THE HOUSES AROUND HERE ARE BASICALLY IT S ONE STORY AND THEY RE ALL BASICALLY TWO UH BATH TWO UH WITH THREE BEDROOMS .
AND WE RE NINETY I WOULD SAY ABOUT OH ABOUT NINETYFIVE PERCENT NO I GUESS MAY PROBABLY A HUNDRED PERCENT OF THEM .
ALL ARE MOSTLY BRICK UH WITH SOME WOOD .
RIGHT .
BUT IT S IT S BASICALLY ALL BRICK .
THE NEXT SUBDIVISION OVER FROM ME IS TOTAL BRICK AND THE ONE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF ME IS ABOUT THE SAME AS MINE .
BUT UH THE ONE ON OPPOSITE THE STREET NOW THEY RE TOTAL BRICK AND THEY RE BASICALLY ALMOST ALL THREE TWO .
THEY RE ALL THREE TWO .
BUT OF COURSE .
THEY HAVE A LITTLE RIVER GOING DOWN THEIR AREA TOO WHICH IS KIND OF NICE .
IF IT S THE KIND OF RIVER .
I M THINKING OF BETTER THEM THAN THAN US YOU KNOW .
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT A A REAL RIVER CREEK .
NO IT S A CREEK THEY VE PUT LITTLE FOUNTAINS IN AND SUCH .
WELL THAT S NICE .
UH I CAME FROM MISSISSIPPI RECENTLY AND THE RIVERS THAT WE HAD THERE WERE THE ONES .
THAT CAME WITH THE RAINS AND THEY DID NT PAY ANY ANY ATTENTION TO BANKS AND THAT KIND OF STUFF .
OH .
SO YOU RE JUST AS LIKELY TO FL WAKE UP AND DISCOVER YOU RE IN TWO INCHES OF WATER .
DO YOU HAVE A LOT OF PROPERTY I MEAN A LOT OF YARD AROUND YOUR HOUSE NOW IN DENTON .
UH IT S A THIRD OF AN ACRE .
I DO NT THINK THAT S A LOT UH IN FACT I HAVE BEEN REAL DISAPPOINTED IN THE SIX YEARS THAT I VE LIVED OUT HERE ABOUT LOT SIZES .
I M MORE ACCUSTOMED TO A ONE ACRE LOT BEING A STANDARD AND THE TWO ACRE BEING WHAT .
MOST PEOPLE HAVE .
YEAH WHEN YOU GET DOWN CLOSER IN TO THE NEWER TRACT HOMES YOU FIND ALMOST LIKE THERE S NO LOT LINE AT ALL .
THEY RE BUILT PRACTICALLY ON TOP OF EACH OTHER .
THAT S TRUE .
I KNOW I WAS .
AN AND WHILE WHILE THERE ARE SOME ADVANTAGES TO THAT THERE .
S LESS TIME SPENT OUTSIDE MAKING IT LOOK NICE AND TAKING CARE OF THINGS .
UH I JUST FEEL HEMMED IN BY THAT .
IT S NOT AS COMFORTABLE A LIVING FOR ME .
UHHUH .
WELL THIS SUBDIVISION HERE HAS GOT OH THERE S ENOUGH TO PUT OH I D SAY UH WHAT TWELVE FEET BETWEEN EACH HOUSE ON EACH SIDE .
WELL I VE GOT MORE ON ONE SIDE THAN I VE GOT ON THE OTHER BUT I M LIKE YOU I CAME DOWN FROM COLORADO AND THERE WAS MORE LAND UP THERE AROUND A YARD WITH A BIG FULL BACK YARD WHICH HERE I LOOK OUT MY BACK YARD AND I CAN SEE THE GATE .
I MEAN THE FENCE IS RIGHT THERE I MEAN JUST DO NT RUN TOO FAST OR YOU LL HIT IT AND I M NOT USED TO THAT EITHER .
I MEAN I COULD SEE PEOPLE PUTTING SWIMMING POOLS IN THE BACK YARD .
ALL AROUND ME BUT TO ME YOU PUT THE SWIMMING POOL IN YOUR BACK YARD AND YOU VE LOST YOUR BACK YARD .
ENTIRELY .
I MEAN UH SURE I MEAN YOU VE GOT A LITTLE PLACE ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER BUT UH TO ME THEIR NOT THAT BIG ENOUGH FOR A POOL BUT YOU KNOW THEY RE GOING UP SO .
BUT IT S UH IT S GREAT FOR MOWING .
FRO FROM THAT ASPECT YOU RE RIGHT .
AND AND IT DOES NT TAKE NEARLY AS LONG TO GET OUT THERE AND WEED IT BY HAND AND THAT KIND OF STUFF .
BUT YES I M USED TO UH WALKING OUT THE BACK YARD AND YOU CAN PLAY CATCH ACROSS THE BACK YARD AND YOU VE GOT PLENTY OF ROOM TO EVEN PLAY A SMALL GAME OF BASEBALL BUT DO NT DO IT AROUND HERE .
NO THE ONE THAT S SORT OF WHAT DROVE ME TO DENTON .
WHEN I FIRST CAME OUT HERE IN EIGHTYFIVE .
I STARTED LOOKING AND IT SEEMED LIKE THE FURTHER I GOT AWAY FROM DALLAS CENTER UH THE MORE LOT CAME WITH THE HOUSE AND AND THE LOWER THE PRICE AT THE SAME TIME .
AND IT JUST SEEMED LIKE THERE WAS A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR DROP FOR EACH CITY .
I HAD NT THOUGHT ABOUT IT .
THAT WAY .
S SO MOVING UP THIRTYFIVE I STOPPED WHEN I GOT TO DENTON .
UH .
IT .
JU WELL SEE NOW WITH OUR JOBS MAINLY HITTING DOWNTOWN DALLAS WE COULD NT GO TOO MUCH FURTHER BUT WE .
PRA WE WENT THAT WAY .
IT WAS THE SCHOOLS AND THE COST OF HOUSES SO WE KEPT GOING OUT UNTIL WE FIGURED WE HIT A POINT WHERE WE NEED THE TRAFFIC TIME TO GET INTO WORK AND THAT S WHERE WE STOPPED .
IT WAS THE THAM SAME PROBLEM .
BUT I THINK PLANO S .
YOU .
ALL .
BOTH YOU .
ALL .
BOTH WORK DOWNTOWN .
I GOT LAYED OFF BY T I .
OH WELL THIS IS A WONDERFUL THING THAT THAT YOU RE DOING HERE STILL HELPING THEM OUT .
OH I YE .
UH BUT YOU WERE WORKING DOWNTOWN .
NO I WAS WORKING AT THE DALLAS SITE .
MY EXHUSBAND WAS WORKING DOWNTOWN .
OH .
BUT I HAVE UH NO T I AS FAR AS I CONCERNED THEY VE BEEN GREAT AS FAR AS LAYOFFS IS CONCERNED SO I HAVE NO PROBLEMS .
BUT AS FAR AS THE HOUSING I WOULD LIKE PERSONALLY I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE OUT OF A FOUR BEDROOM HOUSE AND GO WITH SOMETHING SMALLER .
BUT PRICES IN PLANO THERE IS NT UM THERE IS NT A SECTION IN PLANO YOU CAN REALLY MOVE TO WITHOUT GETTING CAUGHT AND UH IT MY PRICE RIGHT NOW FOR WHAT .
I PAY .
OKAY WHAT KIND OF CRAFTS AND HOBBIES DO YOU HAVE .
OH NOT VERY MANY OF THOSE AT UH SOMETIMES I I PLAY THE TRUMPET AND SOMETIMES I WORK ON TRUMPET MOUTHPIECES .

BUT OUTSIDE OF OUTSIDE OF ART CLASS IN IN SCHOOL I I STOPPED DOING MOST OF THAT UNLESS I I MEAN LIKE HE HAS A COMPUTER AND I USE UM THE GRAPHICS .

UM SOFTWARE ON THAT TO UH TO DO FIGURES AND TO LOOK AT THINGS YOU KNOW SEE HOW THEY WORK .
RIGHT THAT SOUNDS INTERESTING .
UHHUH .
UM DOES DOES HE EVER UH REFINISH FURNITURE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT .
OH YEAH SOMETIMES BUT IT S NOT ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS ESPECIALLY FROM THE VAPORS AND WE HAD UH AN ENTERTAINMENT CENTER WE DID LAST YEAR UH WE BOUGHT IT AT AN UNFINISHED UH FURNITURE PLACE .
UHHUH .
AND SANDED IT DOWN AND UH STAINED IT AND THEN LACQUERED OVER IT .
PRETTY TIME CONSUMING IS NT IT .
OH YEAH .
BUT IT S G IT S NICE TO HAVE IT WHEN YOU RE DONE I MEAN LOOKS PRETTY .
UHHUH SURE IS .
SO I VE DONE THAT ONCE BUT IT DID NT COME OUT THAT WELL .
DID YOU USE A DID YOU USE A ZAR STAIN .
UH I DO NT REMEMBER IT WAS I HAD MY PARENTS BUY EVERYTHING AND I ENDED UP IT WAS THEIR TABLE THEIR KITCHEN TABLE IT CAME OUT REALLY DARK .
UM THEY HAD A UM WELL I SAW THE COMMERCIAL ON T V AND THEY AND UH AND THE PEOPLE AT THE UNFINISHED STORE RECOMMENDED IT THAT S CALLED IT S Z .
A R .
UHHUH .
AND UH IT SPREADS REAL EVENLY AND IT DOES NT DRY TOO FAST SO IT S IF YOU GET TOO MUCH IN ONE SPOT YOU CAN SMOOTH IT OUT .
YEAH .
AND UH WE .
PUT WE PUT TUNG OIL ON IT KIND OF MADE IT STICKY FOR A WHILE BUT AFTER IT DRIED OUT IT WAS YOU KNOW IT WAS REAL HARD AND IT WAS ALL RIGHT .
I REMEMBER IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME IT TOOK ME LIKE SEVERAL MONTHS OR SEVERAL WEEKS TO DO IT DURING THE SUMMER AND THEN AFTER I GOT IT DONE IT WAS PRETTY DARK AND ENDED UP NOT BEING REAL SMOOTH LOOKING SINCE I VE MOVED AWAY THEY VE HAD IT REDONE SO I KIND OF KIND OF GAVE THAT HOBBY UP REAL QUICK .
YEAH .
BUT I DO NT KNOW LIKE I SAID I LIKE DOING A LOT OF OUTDOOR STUFF SO BUT DURING FOUR H I MEAN THEY REALLY ENCOURAGED TO DO ALL KINDS OF CRAFTY STUFF WHICH IS IN INTERESTING I LIKE THAT .
UHHUH WERE YOU IN A WERE YOU THE GIRL SCOUTS TOO OR .

OF YEARS EXCUSE ME SO UH ANYWAY IT WAS NICE TALKING TO YOU DUDLEY .
WELL IT WAS NICE TALKING TO YOU .
HAVE A GOOD DAY NOW .
OKAY YOU TOO .
BYE .
BYEBYE .
WELL ON THIS SUBJECT OF INVASION OF PRIVACY YES IT S VERY EASY FOR ANYBODY TO FIND OUT ABOUT YOU .
YOUR .
WELL I DO NT REALLY LIKE THAT VERY MUCH .
YEAH UH THE SPECIAL ON CHANNEL THIRTEEN .
THAT WAS BROADCAST I THINK LAST WEEK OR SO AGO IT DETAILED HOW THIS ONE PERSON WENT ABOUT FINDING OUT THIS PARTICULAR PERS FROM THIS PARTICULAR PERSON HIS HOME MORTGAGE HOW MUCH .
HE PAYS FOR IT WHAT .
HIS PAYMENTS ARE UH HIS UH SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER DRIVER S LICENSE ANY KIND OF RECORDS .
HE MAY HAVE .
UH THEIR CREDIT CARD AND THE STATUS OF THEIR CREDIT .
WHAT WAS THE REASON WHY SOMEBODY WAS TRYING TO FIND OUT ALL THAT STUFF .
IT WAS JUST AS A DEMONSTRATION TO SHOW .
OH .
THOSE .
WHO WERE WATCHING IT HOW EASILY OBTAINABLE INFORMATION IS ON ANY SINGLE PERSON .
AND IT WAS MOSTLY IT DEALT WITH UH MARKETING COMPANIES THESE UH DIRECT MARKETING .
OH YEAH .
ASSOCIATIONS .
UHHUH .
THAT WAS THE PRIMARY SUBJECT .
THAT S HOW THEY OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS OF SOCIETY AND GROUP .
THEM INTO AGE BRACKETS UH THEIR HABITS THEIR HOBBIES THEIR INCOME .
UM .
AND THEY RE ABLE TO DO THAT THROUGH ALL THE MANIPULATIONS OF THE COMPUTER .
WELL THAT THAT S NOT REALLY GOOD .
I DO NT KNOW I GUESS THAT S AN INVASION OF PRIVACY .
I M NOT SURE THAT THAT S AN EVERYDAY THING THOUGH AT LEAST NOT FOR YOU KNOW AN INDIVIDUAL .
UHHUH .
SOMETHING THAT I FEEL IS A IS A PRETTY MUCH AN INVASION OF PRIVACY IS SOMETHING .
THAT S REALLY SO COMMON THAT IT S ACCEPTED AS THE NORM NOW IS THE OP THE OPEN OFFICE CONCEPT .
THE OPEN OFFICE .
UHHUH WHERE THEY HAVE THE YOU KNOW THE LITTLE PARTITION DIVIDERS .
YEAH .
THROUGHOUT A A LARGE ROOM AND AND PEOPLE HAVE LITTLE CUBICLES .
WELL THAT S ALL FINE AND GOOD BUT YOU DO NT REALLY HAVE ANY PRIVACY AT ALL .
NOT INSOFAR AS MAYBE MAKING CONVERSATION WITH SOMEBODY I SUPPOSE BECAUSE IT YOU CAN EASILY BE OVERHEAR OVERHEARD .
RIGHT .
AND THEY GET I SUPPOSE ANY ITEMS THAT YOU HAVE LAYING OUT CAN BE EASILY SEEN .
YEAH .
YEAH THERE S THERE IS .
AND AND IT S NOT IT S NOT JUST THAT IT S UH THE WHOLE THING ABOUT YOU KNOW IF IF YOU RE TRYING TO CONCENTRATE WELL IT S RATHER HARD SOMETIMES IT S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DO .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE UM YOU KNOW YOU RE UH YOU RE TIME YOU RE SPACE IS IS NOT YOUR OWN SPACE .
UHHUH .
AND I WORK IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT AND I I REALLY KIND OF HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT .
DO YOU WORK WITH UH MIXED COMPANY MALE AND FEMALE OR .
OH YEAH .
IS THERE ANYBODY .
WHO DOES NT .
WELL THERE ARE A FEW OUT THERE .
UM .
IT S I SUPPOSE IT DEPENDS ON WHO .
YOU RE WORKING FOR AND WHERE AT .
YEAH .
BUT UM MY OWN ENVIRONMENT IS OPEN TOTALLY .
THERE ARE NO CUBICLES .
THERE S NOTHING TO BLOCK ANYTHING .
UM .
SO YEAH BUT UM I GUESS WE RE CHANGING EVER SO RAPIDLY IN THE DEVICES OF COMMUNICATIONS THAT ANYTHING CAN BE OBTAINED FROM ANYBODY .
S RECORD .
YEAH .
OR THE COMPUTERS THE THE BIG ADVENT OF THAT I BELIEVE BECAUSE IT THEY CAN ALL HOLD SUCH LARGE DATA BASES ON ANYBODY THAT ALL .
YOU HAVE TO DO IS TOUCH A BUTTON AND IT APPEARS .
UHHUH .
IN FRONT OF THEM AND YOU DO NT HAVE TO I I KNOW THE GOVERNMENT SELLS INFORMATION TO PRIVATE COMPANIES ABOUT INDIVIDUALS OR FAMILIES .
UHHUH .
THAT S NO SECRET AND IT SHOULD NT BE THAT WAY .
I DO NT THINK .
YEAH I DO NT I DO NT THINK THAT S THAT S QUITE RIGHT EITHER .
I MEAN IT S NOT REALLY GOVERNMENT FOR THE PEOPLE AND BY THE PEOPLE I LL TELL YOU .
THAT .
YEAH .
SO .
HUM WHAT DO YOU THINK COULD BE DONE ABOUT IT .
UH THE ONLY WAY .
IT CAN CHANGE IS UM IF IF EVERYBODY BANDS TOGETHER .
IT S JUST LIKE WE NEED TO GET RID OF THESE CLOWNS .
THAT S SERVING IN THE OFFICE .
THE ONLY THING REALLY THAT CAN BE CHANGED IS FOR US TO EVERYBODY TO SAY WE VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU OUT YOU GO .
BUT UH I DO NT SEE ANYTHING LIKE THAT TO OCCUR UNLESS EVERYBODY BANDS TOGETHER TO DO THAT .
UHHUH .
IT HAS TO BE ONE COMMON IDEAL GOAL FOR THAT TO BE DONE .
UM I DO NT KNOW IT S IT S STILL A A FREE I SUPPOSE COUNTRY INSOFAR AS WE RE WE RE ABLE TO OBTAIN INFORMATION .
AND I WOULD NT BE FOR TOTAL BANNING OF UH ALL INFORMATION OR IT S MOSTLY THE PRIVATE INFORMATION THAT WE RE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT .
BUT IT S IT S HARD TO DEFINE .
YEAH .
UH A LOT OF THOSE BOUNDARIES .
IT REALLY IS .
IT .
S .
SOMETHING THAT SOMETHING THAT I VE JUST HAD A A DEALING WITH IS LIKE A CREDIT BUREAU .
UHHUH .
WELL THEY TAKE THEY TAKE MY NAME WHICH IS A VERY COMMON NAME AND MY LAST NAME IS EVEN MORE COMMON .
UHHUH .
AND THEY .
THEY CHECK THAT NAME AGAINST UH THEIR LIST AND THEY FIND SEVERAL .
AND WITHOUT EVEN BOTHERING TO TRY TO MATCH UP ANY OTHER INFORMATION AT ALL THEY JUST REPORT EVERYTHING UNDER THAT NAME .
SO YOU VE RECEIVED A LOT OF UH FLACK .
THEY DO NT THEY DO NT EVEN CHECK MY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER .
UM .
AND COMPANIES ARE PAYING THEM GOOD MONEY TO REPORT ACCURATELY AND THEY RE NOT THEY RE SO LAZY .
THEY RE JUST NOT DOING IT .
I MEAN THEY JUST FIND YOUR NAME AND THEY MATCH IT UP .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND THAT JUST DRIVES ME CRAZY BECAUSE THEY RE AND THEN THEY WANT THEN YOU KNOW TO GET IT REMOVED THEY SAY WELL YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO WRITE THIS WRITE THIS LONG DETAILED LETTER AND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT TO THEM YOU KNOW AND THEN IT TAKES THREE WEEKS AND ALL .
AND I M LIKE BALONEY .
UHHUH .
YOU MESSED IT UP YOU FIX IT .
IS THAT USUALLY WHAT .
YOU TELL THEM IN THE LETTER .
NO WHAT .
I VE TAKEN TO DOING LATELY IS CALLING THE COMPANY THAT THEY REPORT .
UHHUH .
LIKE UH UH RECENTLY I WAS REPORTED AS HAVING J C PENNEY ACCOUNTS AND I DO NT .
SO I CALLED J C PENNEY AND I SAID UH I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THE CREDIT AGENCY .
YOU RE USING IS INCORRECTLY REPORTING THE INFORMATION THAT YOU RE PROVIDING TO THEM .
AND THEY SAY UHHUH BECAUSE THEY REALLY DO NT WANT TO PAY FOR A SERVICE .
THAT S NOT BEING DONE PROPERLY EITHER .
UHHUH .
SO THEN THEY CAN CALL THE CREDIT BUREAU AND SAY HEY YOU KNOW WE RE PAYING YOU GOOD MONEY TO REPORT THIS PROPERLY AND YOU RE NOT DOING YOUR JOB .
GOOD IDEA .
SO THAT S WHAT .
I VE TAKEN TO DOING LATELY AND IT SEEMS TO WORK PRETTY WELL SO FAR .
UHHUH .
WELL THAT S GOOD .
UH ANY OTHER PROBLEMS .
NOT THAT I CAN THINK OF .
YEAH I I GUESS I VE JUST ABOUT RUN OUT OF .
YEAH .
I I CAN PROBABLY GO ON BUT IT S IT S UH I M CLOUDING UP RIGHT NOW .
OH YEAH I PROBABLY BETTER LET YOU GET BACK TO WORK .
WELL IT S NICE TALKING TO YOU .
OKAY .
MAYBE AGAIN .

REAL PROBLEM THE LAST FEW DAYS ONE OF THEIR UH YOUNG HOPELESS STARS HAS APPARENTLY RUINED HIS KNEE FOR THIS SEASON IT WAS A CATCHER .
UHHUH .
AND THEY REALLY DO NT HAVE AN EXCESS OF CATCHERS AND IT S REALLY KIND OF KIND OF LATE TO YOU KNOW TO START BE TRYING TO TRADE FOR SOMEBODY ESPECIALLY WITH THE SALARY CAP THAT THE RANGERS HAVE .

YEAH NOW NOW THEY HAVE THE UH KNITTING MACHINES THAT WILL DO IT FOR YOU .
FAST .
MY PROBLEM I GUESS IS TIME YOU KNOW I I TALK TO MY HUSBAND WE KIND OF PLANNING FOR THE TIME EVENTUALLY WHEN YOU KNOW MAYBE I CAN QUIT WORK WHILE MY KIDS BECAUSE I MY KIDS ARE YOUNG I HAVE A THREE AND A HALF AND A TWO YEAR OLD .
UM .
AND HE SAYS BUT BEV I THINK YOU LL BE SO BORED BECAUSE YOU KNOW ALL YOU VE EVER DONE IS WORK AND I SAID BUT THERE S SO MANY THINGS I WANT TO DO I D LIKE TO START SEWING AGAIN I D LIKE TO LEARN HOW TO DO THIS CROSS STITCH AND THESE YOU KNOW KNIT THESE THINGS AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE FASCINATING HE KIND OF LAUGHS .
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH WHAT A SERGER IS UH THE SERGER SEWING MACHINE .
I DO NT THINK SO .
WELL YOU KNOW IN WHEN WE USED TO SEW WE D SEW THE SEAM AND THEN WE D FINISH THE EDGES .
SURE .
AND WE WE WOULD UH TRIM THE SEAMS AND FINISH THE EDGES .
UHHUH .
WELL THIS MACHINE DOES IT ALL IN ONE STEP .
YOU RE KIDDING SO LIKE AS YOU RE SEWING THE SEAM IT S FINISHING OFF THE INSIDE EDGE .
RIGHT AND IT S CUTTING OFF THE UH THE THERE THERE ARE TWO KNIVES AND IT CUTS OFF THE UH YOU KNOW EXCESS SEAM ALLOWANCE .
WELL THAT TAKES ALL THE WORK OUT OF IT .
RIGHT .
AND UH IT IT REALLY MAKES IT LOOK PROFESSIONAL .
WELL HOW NEAT .
ESPECIALLY ON YOU KNOW I MEAN FROM THE INSIDE YOU KNOW HOW YOU LOOK UNDER UNDER SOMETHING THAT YOU VE MADE AND IT DOES NT REALLY .
UHHUH .
BUT UH THE SERGER REALLY MAKES IT LOOK PROFESSIONAL .
WELL THAT S NEAT .
THEY RE PRETTY EXPENSIVE I LIKE I PAID LIKE ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR MINE .
FOR THE MACHINE .
UHHUH .
YEAH .
SO SINCE I BOUGHT IT AND PAID THAT MUCH FOR IT I GUESS I D BE MIGHT AS WELL GET SOME USE OUT OF IT .
YOU HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO DO IT THAT S RIGHT .
YES I M GOING TO HAVE TO DO IT .
OTHERWISE THEY HOLD IT OVER YOUR HEAD FOREVER RIGHT .
RIGHT .
NOW I BOUGHT YOU THAT MACHINE .
WELL THAT SOUNDS REALLY GOOD .
YEAH .
DO YOU PAINT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT .
NO .
NEVER .
NO I I PLAY THE PIANO .
OH SO DO I .
OH YOU DO .
EXC BE WELL I HAVE ONE HERE IT S THE ONE THAT I GREW UP WITH .
UHHUH .
AND MY FOLKS GAVE IT TO ME AND UH A COUPLE YEARS AGO WHEN THEY THEY SAIL AND SO THEY SOLD THEIR HOME AND THEY THEY VE BEEN SAILING AND UH SO IT S HERE BUT I HAVE NT TOUCHED ONE LIKE SINCE COLLEGE SO I KIND OF AM PICKING IT ALL OUT AGAIN AND TRYING TO REMEMBER HOW TO DO IT AGAIN AND OF COURSE MY KIDS JUMP IN THE MIDDLE OF IT AND WANT TO POUND ON IT AND I D LOVE TO TEACH THEM TO PLAY TOO .
YEAH .
SO I M NOT GREAT BUT I REMEMBER IT .
UHHUH WELL I M NOT THAT GREAT EITHER I USED TO BE A LOT BETTER THAN I AM NOW I I HAVE PLAYED FOR UH THE CHURCH CHOIR AND UH .
YEAH .
I PLAYED FOR THE CHORAL CLUB IN HIGH SCHOOL AND BUT I YOU KNOW I DO NT PRACTICE A LOT ANYMORE AND UH YOU KNOW YOU GET RUSTY YOU REALLY .
YOU DO YOU DO .
I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD GET RUSTY BUT I M RUSTY NOW .
WELL I I FIGURE IT TAKES PRACTICE AND I I DO NT I SAY I DO NT HAVE THE TIME THAT S NOT TRUE .
UHHUH .
BY THE TIME I PUT MY KIDS IN BED AT NIGHT I DO NT WANT TO DO ANYTHING .
YEAH .
I YOU KNOW I VE WORKED ALL DAY AND I COME HOME AND I DO THAT I AND YOU KNOW EVEN HOBBIES AND CRAFTS AND SEWING THINGS LIKE THAT I I THINK GEE I COULD DO THIS OR THAT I HAVE AN HOUR HERE .
UHHUH .
I DO NT WANT TO DO THEM SOMETIMES I M TOO TIRED .
YEAH RIGHT .
SO I TRY TO SAVE THAT FOR THE WEEKEND I NEED TO GET BETTER AT IT THOUGH .
WELL SEWING DOES TAKE UP TAKE AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME TAKES AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME .
NOW THE PART ABOUT SEWING THAT I NEVER LIKED WAS LAYING OUT THE MATERIAL AND THE PATTERN AND CUTTING IT OUT IF IF SOMEBODY WOULD LAY IT OUT FOR ME THEN I DID NT MIND CUTTING IT OUT AND SEWING IT .
I COULD DO THAT ALL DAY LONG AND I I CAN REMEMBER ONCE IN HIGH SCHOOL I WANTED SOME EXTRA MONEY .
YEAH .
AND MY MOM WANTED SOME PANTS SO SHE LAID OUT THE MATERIAL AND I CUT IT AND SEWED IT AND SHE PAID ME I THINK LIKE TWO DOLLARS A PAIR TO MAKE HER SOME PANTS .
YEAH .
BUT I I HATE LAYING OUT MATERIAL AND TRYING TO GET THE MOST OUT OF THE MATERIAL AND .
YEAH ON THE ON THE .
MAKE SURE IT S ON THE RIGHT LINES AND NOT ON THE BIAS .
RIGHT ON THE STRAIGHT GRAIN .
YES ON THE GRAIN OF THE FABRIC .
AND ALL THAT STUFF UHHUH .
IT DRIVES ME CRAZY .
YEAH THAT THAT S THAT S THE PART THAT I DO NT LIKE TOO .
YEAH .
YEAH I I LIKE SEWING SEWING UP THE GARMENT ITSELF I REALLY LIKE TO DO THAT BUT THE THE CUTTING AND THE ALL THE EVEN THE CUTTING I DO NT LIKE .
WELL WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER FEATURES ON THIS MACHINE IT SOUNDS WONDERFUL .
WELL THAT S ABOUT IT REALLY IT S IT HAS FOUR UH FOUR THREADS INSTEAD OF THE THE REGULAR BASIC TWO THREADS .
OH OKAY .
AND UH IT .
IS THAT FOR DESIGNS OR IS THAT FOR THE REGULAR SEAM IN THE FABRIC OR .
NO YOU YOU CAN EITHER USE THREE OR FOUR OF THE THREADS .
OH OKAY .
UH IT S KIND OF IT THE STITCH IS KIND OF LIKE A KNITTING MACHINE LIKE THE THEY RE LOOPERS UNDER THE BOTTOM AND THEN THE THERE S A SEAM STITCH AND IT S THE LOOPERS THAT FORM THE THE EDGE YOU KNOW THAT EDGE FINISH .
UHHUH .
AND UH THAT S WHAT REALLY MAKES IT LOOK PROFESSIONAL YOU CAN DO A LOT WITH THE SERGER THOUGH YOU CAN MAKE UH PIPING AND CORDING AND UH YOU CAN USE ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT UH TEXTURES OF THREAD .
SO IT HAS THE ABILITY TO DO JUST ABOUT ANY TYPE OF SEWING YOU WANT TO DO .
WELL YES BUT YOU YOU HAVE TO USE IT IN COMBINATION WITH A SEWING MACHINE YOU CA NT THROW YOUR SEWING MACHINE AWAY Y YOU YOU NEED IT TO DO THINGS LIKE BUTTON HOLES .
UHHUH .
AND UH SEAMS THAT NEED TO BE REALLY STRONG NEED TO BE DONE ON THE SEWING MACHINE .
SO THE SERGER IS NOT A SEWING MACHINE ITSELF IT S SOMETHING THAT GOES WITH IT .
IT S UH .
LIKE AN ATTACHMENT OR .
NO IT S IT S A IT S A IT S A MACHINE IT S NOT EXACTLY A SEWING MACHINE BUT IT DO IT DOES SEW THE SEAM AND TRIM THE EDGES AND ALL THAT STUFF BUT THERE ARE OTH ARE OTHER THINGS THAT A REGULAR SEWING MACHINE DOES THAT IT DOES NT DO LIKE YOU CA NT TOP STITCH WITH IT .
OH OKAY .
YOU KNOW YOU CA NT DO TOP STITCHING OR UM THERE S THERE S A F FEW THINGS THAT YOU JUST CA NT DO WITH IT IT WILL ALSO DO A ROLLED EDGE UM .
UHHUH .
GEE IT S JUST SO VERSATILE I REM UH .
WELL I M GOING TO HAVE TO GO CHECK IT OUT THAT S JUST SOMETHING I HAD NT HEARD OF BUT IT .
YEAH THE QUESTION WAS UH WHAT KIND OF BOOKS DO YOU READ FOR ENTERTAINMENT UH UH I GUESS .
OH I JUST READ FOR ESCAPE .
OKAY .
WELL I MEAN IT S .
WITH TWO LITTLE KIDS I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT .
YES .
IT .

OF THE CIVIL WAR AND IT S NOT A STORY OF THE CIVIL WAR IT S A STORY OF ALL THE POLITICS AND UH LOBBYING AND JUST BASICALLY STATE BY STATE EVENTS .
UHHUH .
THAT LEAD TO THE EVENTS .
THAT BROUGHT ABOUT THE CIVIL WAR .
AND IT S FASCINATING BECAUSE I HAD ALWAYS YOU KNOW BEEN RAISED ON THIS YOU KNOW EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION WITH THE CIVIL WAR .
UHHUH .
THERE WAS A LOT MORE TO IT THAN THAT WERE NT THERE .
THERE WAS A LOT MORE TO IT THAN THAT .
AS A MATTER OF FACT .
THAT WAS A VERY MINOR PART .
THAT KIND OF BECOME LIKE AN AFTERTHOUGHT .
YEAH WELL IT WAS A POLITICAL MOVE .
OH YEAH .
IT WAS MADE TO PLACATE SOME OF THE NORTHERN SUPPORT BUT NOT COMPLETELY ALIENATE ALL THE SOUTHERN SUPPORT BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT WAS UH IF YOU READ IT IT ONLY EMANCIPATED THOSE .
WHO WERE IN AREAS UH IN REBELLION AGAINST THE UNITED STATES .
ALL THE OTHER AREAS .
WHICH WOULD I THINK AT THAT TIME WOULD HAVE INCLUDED WEST VIRGINIA AND OH MAY HAVE BEEN KENTUCKY A FEW STATES YOU KNOW THAT WERE NOT PART OF THE SOUTH BUT STILL HAD SLAVES .

WELL YOU KNOW WHY THEY ACTUALLY HELD THEM OFF .
NONE OF THE YANKEES WANTED TO LISTEN TO THEIR KIND OF LUTED GRAMMAR .
THAT COULD BE IT COULD BE IT .
NOW YOU DID NT HEAR ME SAY THAT .
OUTSIDE OF UH .
AND THEN THE LAST CIVIL WAR BATTLE WAS FOUGHT AT VAL VERDE YOU KNOW OVER THERE ON THE TEXAS BORDER .

UH WELL THERE THERE S TWO THINGS UH THE ONE I M INTERESTED THE MOST I GUESS MYSELF UH WOULD BE THE THE FREONS I MEAN FOR AIR COND THE ONE I GUESS THAT S THE ONE I M MOST CURIOUS ABOUT IS HOW THEY RE GOING TO REPLACE THE FREONS IN AIRCONDITIONING THAT SEEMED TO BE THE BIGGEST SURPRISE TO ME AND WHETHER WHEN THEY REPLACE IT YOU KNOW THEY RE GOING TO REALLY COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT IS NOT JUST AS BAD .
WELL THE YOU KNOW THAT THAT S ANOTHER ARGUABLE ISSUE AND I I VE SEEN THE UH UH UH ASSUMING YOU CAN BUY INTO GLOBAL WARMING I BI .
YEAH I UH WAS UH YOU KNOW WHERE THEY WERE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT THAT BUT THAT THAT IT SEEMS TO BE .
WELL DID YOU SEE CARL SAGAN ON SIXTY MINUTES ON UH WHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT WHEN IF IF THE IF THE WAR STARTED IN IN KUWAIT AND THEY D SET THOSE UH ALL TH .
NO I HEARD ABOUT IT THOUGH .
UH IT WAS IT WAS IT WAS INTERESTING BUT UH I M JUST CURIOUS WHAT HE HAS TO SAY NOW THAT THEY VE GOT THEM ALL LIT .
WAS THAT BEFORE I DID NT SEE IT WAS THAT BEFORE THEY ACTUALLY DID THAT OR IT WAS W .
YES AND HIS ARGUMENT WAS UH WAS THAT THAT YOU WOULD SEE A UH A YEAR WITH NO SUMMER .
BECAUSE OF THAT .
WHICH ACTUALLY HAPPENED .
YOU KNOW .
AND IT IT AC YES IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED UH IT WAS A VOLCANO ERUPTED AND IT WAS HIGH ENOUGH UP BUT UH THEY HAD SOME PEOPLE FROM THE NATIONAL METEOROLOGICAL CENTER I THINK IT WAS MUMBLEX WHICH IS THE NATIONAL ANYWAY RESEARCH PEOPLE AND THEY SAID THAT THE UH THAT THE POLLUTION WOULD NOT GO HIGH ENOUGH AND IT S GOING TO BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF CARL SAGAN AND HIS BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF STARS .
RIGHT .
MAY HAVE ONCE MADE A MISTAKE BUT TH TH TH THE THE COM THE GENERAL THE OPINION AMONG AMONG THE UH METEOROLOGISTS AT UH I M UH MEMBER OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY AND AN .
ARE YOU D YOU DID NT WORK AT T I .
YEAH I DO .
OH OKAY .
BUT I M UH I TH I DID THAT IN MY MUMBLEX .

NO I M A PLANNER A PRODUCTION PLANNER .
OH OKAY .
BUT I I I M IN THE ACTIVE RESERVES AS A WEATHERMAN SO .
OH OKAY YEAH .
UH I I KEEP UP FROM TIME TO TIME BUT WHAT THE THE ARGUMENT IS THAT UH THAT UH MAYBE THERE IS NT GLOBAL WARMING AND MAYBE THERE IS BUT UM IF THERE IS UH WE PROBABLY COULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT NOW .
YEAH .
AND IF THERE IS NT IF THERE IS NT AND WE DO SOME THE RIGHT THINGS I THINK HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT ABOUT ALL THIS SMOG AND TH STUFF ON CARS .
UH WELL I M KIND OF A CAR BUFF MYSELF I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU ANOTHER QUESTION BUT UH I I LL DO THAT IN A MINUTE I I THINK THAT THE CHANGING YOU KNOW FROM LEADED FUEL WAS A TREMENDOUS ADVANTAGE YOU KNOW NO NOT USING .

I THINK YOU CAN USE THE YOU CAN USE HIGH YOU KNOW THE NINETYTWO PERCENT UH NINETYTWO OCTANE I DO NT THINK YOU LL HAVE ANY TROUBLE .
I M NOT HAVING ANY PROBLEM IT S A SEVENTY .
OH YEAH YEAH .
AND THE .
NO I I THINK UH I UH WORK ON MY OWN CARS AND UH I DO NT THINK THAT S A PROBLEM I THOUGHT I M SAYING I WAS GLAD TO GET RID OF LEADED GASOLINE N .
BUT DID YOU HAVE ANOTHER QUES YOU SAID YOU HAD ANOTHER QUEST .
UH OH YE I THE SAME THING ABOUT THE WAR UH OR RELATED TO THE WAR ON I WAS WATCHING C N N AND I CAN NOT REMEMBER WHAT STATION IT WAS WHAT DID YOU SEE THE ADVERTISEMENTS UH WHERE THEY TALKED ABOUT NUCLEAR WAR WHAT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE IN CHANGING THE ATMOSPHERE IT IS SO SCARY THAT I HOPE THAT EVERY ONE OF THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS SAW THAT BECAUSE IT WAS JUST TOTAL DISASTER YOU KNOW .
UH E .
DID YOU SEE ANY OF THOSE UH I IT WAS .
NO I DID NT SEE THAT THAT I KNOW THAT THE UH THAT S .
IT MUST HAVE BEEN CHANNEL THIRTEEN I DO NT RECALL ALTHOUGH I THOUGHT IT WAS ON C N N OH I .
WELL THAT THEY CALLED NUCLEAR WINNER AND AND I SUPPOSE THAT S THAT S THE ULTIMATE UH POLLUTION PROBLEM .
IT WAS A SOMEWHAT OF A COMMERCIAL BECAUSE IT C I SAW IT REGULARLY AND IT SHOWED THAT AND IT WAS REALLY DEVASTATING AND IT WOULD UH .
WELL IT .
HOW MUCH ASH WOULD FALL AND AND HOW IT WOULD ESSENTIALLY LITERALLY DESTROY THE WORLD YOU KNOW .
WELL MUMBLEX THE CHERNOBYL ACCIDENT UH ACTUALLY UM BECAUSE THE CIRCULATION BUDGET AS HIGH AS IT WENT UH COVERED UH A FAIRLY REMARKABLE AMOUNT THEY DID SOME TRACERS AND THEY I I THINK IT S DRAWN IN UH I THINK GETS IN THERE MUMBLEX I CA NT THINK OF THE OTHER TRACE BUT I SAW A A PRESENTATION ON ON THAT AND THEY IT WENT QUITE A LONG WAYS BUT I I I GUESS I CAN BE A LITTLE SYMPATHETIC BUT YOU KNOW THERE S SOME ARGUMENT THAT IN IN IN THE BLUE GRASS OF KENTUCKY THAT THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS THAT THAT S THE UH THE PINE TREES GIVING OFF POLLUTION AND .
OH REALLY YEAH THERE THERE S PROBABLY A LOT OF NATURAL THINGS UH .

IS THAT IS THAT POLLUTION .
UH IT I GUESS IT S GOT TO BE REALLY I DO NT KNOW I DO NT KNOW IF IT S AIR POLLUTION IT S UH IT S DUST POLLUTION WHETHER IT S NATURAL OR NOT I DO NT KNOW .
WELL IT THAT S THE THING IS THAT I THINK I THINK DALLAS REALLY DOES HAVE A PROBLEM IN THIS THE IDEA IF WE COULD GET SOME CLEANER FUEL BURNING FUEL THE PROBLEM IS IS IT S LIKE LOS ANGELES PEOPLE DO NT PEOPLE DO NT WANT TO USE MASS TRANSIT SO .
YEAH OH YEAH WELL I LIVE IN ARLINGTON AND THERE THERE THERE ARE NO BUSES I MEAN THERE THERE IS THE ONLY SCHOOL BUS THE ONLY BUSES YOU SEE ARE SCHOOL BUSES SO .

UHHUH .

UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THESE ARE ALL EQUIVALENT TO THE MONTHLY BUDGET THINGS SOME OF THEM ARE THERE TO PACIFY SITUATIONS AND SOME OF THEM ARE THERE TO PREVENT THINGS FROM HAPPENING .
UHHUH .
BUT UH I GUESS WE KIND OF GOT AWAY FROM ABOUT THE LAST SIXTEEN MONTHS AS FAR AS SAYING TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR FOOD AND THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THIS AND TWO HUNDRED FOR THAT BECAUSE WE HAD A CHILD WHICH IS ABOUT A YEAR OLD AND THEN .
UHHUH .
UH WE VE JUST BEEN KIND OF WORKING ON I VE BEEN DEVELOPING IT BUT IT S KIND OF HARD DIAPER PRICES ARE GOING UP YOU KNOW AND FORMULA AND STUFF YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
THAT S FUNNY YEAH WE HAVE A WE RE TWENTY EIGHT AND HE S BEEN WORKING AT T I FOR FIVE YEARS AND THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH HIS FIRST REAL REALLY MAJOR JOB OF ANY YOU KNOW PROFESSIONAL BECAUSE HE HAD WORKED YOU KNOW PART TIME DURING SCHOOL AND WHAT NOT AND UH HE WAS A LITTLE LATE GRADUATING SO WE RE YOU KNOW UH AND WE HAVE A NINE AND A HALF YEAR OLD SON AND IT S BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE WERE EIGHTEEN WHEN WE HAD HIM SO WE RE WE RE KIND OF LOOKING AT THIS FROM THE OTHER ASPECT OF .

BUT WE RE IN A THIRTY YEAR OLD HOUSE THAT WOULD PROBABLY SELL FOR FORTYFIVE THOUSAND .
UHHUH .
SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE TRADEOFFS SO WE RE MORE WE HAVE A MONTHLY BUDGET WITH THIS THIS THIS THIS BUT WE HAVE NO SAVINGS WHICH IS NT REAL WISE BUT WE JUST WE DO NT HAVE THE INCOME AT THIS TIME REALLY TO HAVE ANY BECAUSE WE HAVE THREE DEBTS THAT WE RE TRYING TO PAY OFF FROM BOTH OF OUR STUDENT LOANS WE RE STILL PAYING .
UHHUH .
TRYING TO PAY THOSE OFF AND WE HAVE ONE CAR PAYMENT THAT WE DO NT I THINK WE HAVE ABOUT THIRTEEN MONTHS LEFT ON IT .
UHHUH .
AND AFTER THAT WE EITHER WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS BEGIN DOUBLING UP OUR CAR PAYMENT UM THEY LL PAY OUR CAR PAYMENT IS EQUIVALENT TO BOTH OF OUR STUDENT LOANS SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS NEXT YEAR KEEP DRIVING THE SAME CARS AND UM PAY ON THE STUDENT LOANS SPLIT THAT CAR PAYMENT IN HALF AND PAY YOU KNOW DOUBLE UP PAYMENTS ON BOTH OUR LOANS AND IT LL WORK OUT PERFECT .
DO YOU HAVE YOUR UH LOANS THROUGH THE TEXAS CREDIT UNION .
NO WE DO NT .
OKAY THING ABOUT THE CREDIT UNION IS IT S THE WAY IT S SET UP IS IF YOU HAVE TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS LEFT LET S SAY ON ON THE LOAN .
UHHUH .
IF YOU GO UP THERE AND WRITE THEM A TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR CHECK IT DOES NT ALL GO TOWARDS PRINCIPAL .
UHHUH .
THEY TAKE OUT FOR THE FOR THE FINANCES .

YEAH I I SEEM TO REMEMBER WHEN I WAS YOUNG THAT WAS A PROBLEM .
NO NO CAR WAS BIG ENOUGH FOR THAT .
WELL UH I VE KIND OF BEEN LEANING TOWARDS A CARAVAN .
UHHUH .
UH NOW I KNOW THAT THAT UH THEY VE GOTTEN QUITE PRICEY IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS BUT UH I LIKE THE DODGE PRODUCTS AND UH BEEN UH COUPLE TIMES I VE HAD A OPPORTUNITY TO RENT ONE .
UHHUH .
UH I VE BEEN REALLY PLEASED WITH ITS PERFORMANCE AND WITH THE SIZE AND BECAUSE IF YOU GET THE SEVEN PASSENGER VERSION YOU CAN PUT SOME SPACE BETWEEN THE KIDS .
YEAH YEAH .
AND UH I THINK THAT WOULD THAT WOULD SERVE US WELL PLUS IT S GOT UH GOOD STORAGE CAPACITY IN IT FOR YOU KNOW TAKING THINGS ALONG .
UHHUH .
GOING TO THE STORE .
WHICH IS THE ONE THAT HAS MODULAR TYPE SEATS YOU KNOW WHICH ONE I M TALKING ABOUT THEY HAVE THE COMMERCIAL ON TV WHERE YOU CAN YOU CAN PULL SOME SEATS OUT .
UHHUH .
AND YOU CAN MOVE AROUND .
EXACTLY CORRECT YEAH IF YOU WANT .
IS THAT IS THAT THE DODGE CARAVAN .
YES .
THAT DOES THAT OR .
YEAH IT UH THE DODGE CARAVANS WILL DO THAT UH YOU CAN TAKE THE UH UH USUALLY THERE S A UH A DOUBLE SEAT BEHIND THE UH FRONT BUCKETS .
UHHUH .
AND THEN IF YOU GET THE AND THEN THERE S A THREE SEAT THAT GOES OR THREE PERSON SEAT THAT GOES IN THE BACK NOW WHAT YOU CAN DO IS YOU COULD TAKE THAT MIDDLE SEAT OUT AND JUST HAVE THE THREE SEATS IN THE BACK .
UHHUH .
AND THE TWO SEATS UP FRONT OR YOU CAN TAKE THE UH THREE SEAT OUT AND JUST USE THE TWO SEAT OR YOU CAN TAKE THE TWO SEAT AND MOVE THE TWO SEAT TO THE BACK SO IT S VERY VERSATILE YOU CAN MOVE .
YEAH .
THE SEATS ALL AROUND ABOUT THE ONLY THING YOU CA NT DO IS TAKE THAT THREE PERSON ACROSS SEAT .
UHHUH .
AND MOVE IT FORWARD .
WELL THE ONE THAT I CA NT REMEMBER ONE IT IS IF IT S THE IT IT S THE TOYOTA OR OR ONE OF THE OTHER ONES I DO NT KNOW IF IT S ONE OF THE AMERICANS OR THE IMPORT ONES WHERE UH THEY ACTUALLY HAVE LIKE UH SOME BUCKET SEATS IN THE BACK BUT YOU CAN ACTUALLY PULL THEM OUT I MEAN THEY RE REALLY EASY TO PULL OUT .
UHHUH .
UH AND YOU CAN UH MOVE THEM AROUND AND STUFF AND IT IT TO ME THAT THAT WOULD BE REAL GOOD FOR US UH MY HUSBAND AND I UH LIKE TO GO CAMPING AND STUFF .
UHHUH .
AND RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A VAN WHICH IS IT S AN OLDER VAN AND WE RE WE RE THINKING ABOUT BUYING ANOTHER SEDAN UH PROBABLY NEXT YEAR UH RIGHT NOW MOTORCYCLES TAKES PRECEDENCE .
YEAH .
SINCE THAT THAT S WHAT MY HUSBAND REALLY WANTS RIGHT NOW BUT UH NEXT YEAR WE LL PROBABLY BUY A NEW CAR AND WE RE LOOKING AT UH POSSIBLY THE HONDA ACCORD UH THAT S KIND OF UH AS FAR AS FAR AS THE INTERIOR IT S GOT THE LUXURY INTERIOR BUT D IT DOES NT REALLY HAVE THE LUXURY PRICE TAG THAT A LOT OF THE OTHER CARS HAVE WHICH IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW FINDING SOMETHING THAT S THAT S FAIRLY AFFORDABLE BUT YET HAS ALL THE NICE LUXURY ITEMS THAT WE WANT .
YEAH I THINK THAT S GETTING TO BE KIND OF IMPORTANT NOW THAT UH THE PRICE IS BECOMING THE DRIVING FACTOR .
YEAH .
AND THEN YOU LOOK AT ONCE YOU REALIZE HOW MUCH MONEY YOU VE GOT TO SPEND THEN YOU START LOOKING AROUND AT AT WHAT YOU CAN BUY WITH IT WHERE BEFORE I THINK YOU YOU LOOKED AT THE CAR YOU WANTED AND THEN YOU LOOKED TO SEE HOW WELL YOU COULD AFFORD IT .
UHHUH YEAH .
OR HOW YOU COULD AFFORD IT .
WELL I THINK IT S GOING TO BE A LOT EASIER NOW I JUST HEARD THAT THEY LOWERED THE PRIME LENDING RATE SO I THINK IT S GOING TO BE A LOT EASIER TO TO BE ABLE TO GET A CAR NOW .
YEAH .
AND FINANCE IT I THINK BANKS ARE GOING TO BE A LOT MORE A LITTLE BIT MORE LENIENT .
YEAH I KNOW THEY RE TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO UH END THE RECESSION .
YEAH .
AND DROPPING THE PRIME IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE THINGS I JUST BOUGHT A NEW HOUSE SO I GOT A A UH NINE AND A HALF PERCENT INTEREST RATE .
UHHUH .
I M NOT SURE I COULD DO MUCH BETTER TODAY BUT UH THAT IS ALSO EFFECTING BUYING A NEW CAR .
YEAH I CAN IMAGINE YOU GOT TO KIND OF WORK WORK THAT INTO YOUR BUDGET .
WELL THAT AND THAT .
BALANCE THAT AND THE HOUSE PAYMENT AND OF COURSE UH IS IF YOU BUY A NEW CAR YOU RE GOING TO ARE ANY OF YOUR KIDS DRIVING AGE YET .
UH TWO FOURTEEN YEAR OLDS WILL BE UH FIFTEEN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY SO .
ARE S ARE THEY TWINS .
YEAH THEY RE TWINS BORN ON THE BICENTENNIAL .
OH WOW .
YOU RE GOING TO HAVE TWINS HAVE THEM ON THE BICENTENNIAL IS OUR MOTTO JULY FOURTH SEVENTYSIX .
SO UH UH I VE STILL GOT ANOTHER FULL YEAR AND THREE MONTHS BEFORE THEY RE GOING TO BE BEHIND THE WHEEL .
UHHUH .
OF A CAR SO AMERICA S SAFE FOR ANOTHER FIFTEEN M AND UH AFTER THAT NOW I MAY KEEP THE UH ONE OR BOTH OF THE TWO CARS I I CURRENTLY HAVE FOR THEM TO DRIVE YOU KNOW THEY RE THEY RE THEY RE SMALL ENOUGH THAT A FIRST TIME DRIVER COULD HANDLE IT YET BIG ENOUGH THAT I FEEL S FEEL SAFE THAT .
UHHUH .
IF THEY WERE IN AN ACCIDENT THEY WOULD SURVIVE .
UHHUH .
KNOW WHAT I MEAN IT I DO NT GET THAT KIND OF FEELING WITH THE KIND OF CAR LIKE YOU TALKED ABOUT THE HONDA THEY RE JUST .
WELL THE THE HONDA S HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN VERY SAFE .
UHHUH .
IN IN ACCIDENTS UH MORE SO THAT A LOT OF THE AMERICAN CARS .
IS THAT RIGHT .
MATTER OF FACT I JUST HEARD SOMETHING TODAY ON ON THE NEWS ABOUT THOSE UH .
UHHUH .
AUTOMATIC SEAT BELTS THAT ARE ATTACHED TO THE DOOR .
RIGHT .
UH THEY RE QUESTIONING THE SAFETY OF THOSE NOW SAYING THAT AND THEY SHOWED UH A SIMULATION WHERE THERE W THEY HAD A DUMMY IN THE CAR AND THE DOOR OPENED AND THE DUMMY ACTUALLY FELL OUT OF THE CAR AND THE CAR ROLLED OUT ON TOP OF HIM .
JEEZ .
SO THEY RE SAYING THEY RE NOT AS SAFE AS THEY GIVE THE APPEARANCE OF BEING SAFE BUT THEY RE REALLY NOT AS SAFE AS THEY AS THEY UH APPEAR TO BE SO UH I M KIND OF CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AS FAR AS YOU KNOW W THE SEAT BELTS .
WELL .
UH I DO NT KNOW IF MARYLAND HAS A UH A SEAT BELT LAW BUT THEY DO HAVE ONE IN TEXAS .
YES .
AND YOU RE .
DEFINITELY .
YOU RE REQUIRED TO WEAR THEM .
THE THING IS THAT THEY RE I THINK IT S A TWO PART SEAT BELT THOUGH THERE S THE UH DOOR BELT AND THEN THERE S ONE .
EXACTLY .
A LAP BELT .
BUT NINETY UH PROBABLY ABOUT WELL I DO NT KNOW ABOUT NINETY BUT PROBABLY FIFTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THOSE PROBABLY DO NT WEAR THE LAP PORTION OF IT I KNOW MY BROTHER DOES NT AND HE HAS ONE IN HIS CAR .
MAKE SURE YOU SMACK HIM AROUND THEN .
SO I MEAN IT IT KIND OF GIVES YOU A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY YOU THINK OH I VE GOT ONE PORTION OF MY SEAT BELT ON UH BUT IF YOUR DOOR COMES OPEN YOU KNOW IT S NOT GOING TO DO YOU ANY GOOD .
YEAH .
SO THAT THAT THAT S A CONCERN OF MINE AS FAR AS UH WHAT I LL BE LOOKING AT WITH BUYING A NEW CAR UH I M NOT REALLY SURE IF I WOULD WANT THE SEAT BELTS ATTACHED TO THE DOOR I THINK I WOULD FEEL BETTER WITH THEM ATTACHED TO THE ACTUAL CAR THE INSIDE WHERE THEY RE NORMALLY ATTACHED TO .
YEAH .
LIKE BEHIND THE DOOR .
YEAH THE UH THE SUPPORTS UH A GOOD SOURCE OF INFORMATION I VE FOUND HAS ALWAYS BEEN THESE UH USED CAR MANUALS .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE YOU CAN FLIP THROUGH THE USED CAR MANUALS AND THEY LL GIVE YOU A LIST OF ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT THE CAR S HAD IN THE PAST .
UM .
AND YOU CAN LOOK AT THE UH THE TRACK RECORD ON .
YEAH .
A CAR OVER THE YEAR AND YOU USUALLY NOTICE UH A LOT OF PROBLEMS AT THE BEGINNING AND THEN THINGS KIND OF IRON OUT .
YEAH .
TO WHERE .
YEAH .
THERE S FEWER PROBLEMS AND YOU GET AN IDEA ON HOW WELL THE THE NEXT CAR S GOING TO BE NOW AS LONG AS THEY ARE NT CHANGING THE MODEL YOU KNOW LIKE WHEN THE UH PONTIAC GRAND PRIX WENT FROM BEING A HUGE CAR TO A SMALL CAR THEY HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS .
YEAH .
WITH THE SMALLER CAR AS LONG AS THEY ARE NT .
YEAH THE THE LE MANS IS LIKE THAT TOO UH WE USED TO HAVE A LE MANS WHEN I WAS IN IN HIGH SCHOOL UH AND IT WAS A BIG CAR I MEAN IT WAS LIKE THE UH THE GRAND PRIX .
UHHUH .
AND IN I THINK AROUND NINETEEN EIGHTY UH THEY CHANGED THE MODEL AND IT LIKE WENT TO HALF THE SIZE .
YEAH SURE .
LITERALLY I MEAN IT GOT CHOPPED IN HALF AND IT WAS NT EVEN THE SAME CAR ANYMORE DID NT EVEN REMOTELY RESEMBLE THE OLD CAR .
UHHUH YEAH I REMEMBER WHEN THAT HAPPENED SO UNLESS THEY RE REALLY CHANGING THE MODEL UH YEAH CHANCES ARE THAT IT S PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE THE THE FEWER MISTAKES THAN IT HAD THE YEAR BEFORE .
YEAH WELL EVERYBODY THAT I VE TALKED TO WHO S EVER HAD A HONDA .
UHHUH .
LOVES THEM AND MY HUSBAND HAD A HONDA UH AND IT WAS A LEASE CAR AND HE HAD TO TURN BACK IN UH A YEAR AND A HALF AGO UH AND HE HAD IT FOR FOUR YEARS AND NEVER HAD A SINGLE PROBLEM WITH IT AND IT WAS GREAT UH AND THE ONLY REASON WHY WE ENDED UP NOT BUYING IT WAS BECAUSE WE DID NT FEEL THE AT THE TIME THE RESIDUAL WAS LIKE SIXTYFIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND IT WAS A FOUR YEAR OLD CAR WITH SEVENTY THOUSAND MILES ON IT AND WE THOUGHT THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH TO PAY FOR .
YEAH .
UH A FOUR YEAR OLD CAR .
YEAH I AGREE .
SO SO WE ENDED UP JUST WENT JUST WENT AHEAD AND JUST TURNED THE KEYS BACK IN AND AND GOT OUT OF THE LEASE UH ONE THING THAT I THAT I AM CURIOUS ABOUT IS UH READING INFORMATION ON AIR BAGS DO SOME OF THE VANS I THINK I DO NT KNOW ABOUT THE DODGE CARAVAN BUT SOME OF THE VANS NOW HAVE DRIVER SIDE AIR BAGS .
UHHUH .
WHICH I THINK IS A GOOD IDEA .
YEAH .
WELL WHAT KIND OF GARDEN DO YOU HAVE .

OH .
WE HAD TO PUT SO MUCH POISON OUT ON EVERYTHING THAT WE THOUGHT WHO D WANT TO EAT THAT STUFF .
UHHUH UHHUH .
YOU KNOW SO WE HAVE REALLY BEEN FRUSTRATED BY OUR GARDENING ATTEMPTS HERE AND UH IF YOU REALLY WATER A LOT YOU CAN DO IT BUT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR WATER IT REALLY GETS TO BE AN ANNOYANCE TO HAVE TO WATER CONSTANTLY .
UHHUH .
SO RIGHT NOW WE RE JUST .

WE HAVE A PEACH TREE THAT S THE EXTENT OF OUR UM CONTRIBUTING TO OUR FOOD SUPPLY BUT THAT S NICE TO HAVE BUT .

THAT S WHAT I REMEMBER FROM LIVING UP NORTH IS THAT YOU D GET EVERYTHING SET AND THEN YOU D HAVE A FROST AND HALF THE STUFF WOULD GET FROSTBITTEN AND YOU D HAVE TO .
WELL THAT S IT LAST YEAR I THINK IT WAS YOU KNOW MY PEONIES WERE WERE BUDDING IN JANUARY AND YOU KNOW THERE WAS NO WAY THAT WAS GOING TO MAKE IT AND SURE ENOUGH YOU KNOW WE D HAD REALLY MILD WEATHER UNTIL .

THAT HAVE GONE TO BE MISSIONARIES AND THAT S ONLY BECAUSE I WENT TO BAYLOR AND A LOT OF STUDENTS FROM BAYLOR GO AND AND SERVE AS MISSIONARIES DURING THE SUMMER .

THAT S LIKE FORCING SOMEONE TO DONATE TO A CHARITY .

I HAVE THIS THING AGAINST BUGS TOO .
AND SEEMS TO ME LIKE THE PEACE CORPS THEY SEND YOU SOMEPLACE THAT THERE S A LOT OF BUGS MUMBLEX .
YEAH AFRICA .
YEAH HAVE TO LIVE IN A SHACK WITH NO AIR CONDITIONING AND NO MEDICINE AND NO ANYTHING .
I D PROBABLY CATCH A TERRIBLE DISEASE AND DIE .
YEAH WELL .
I DOUBT THAT BUT .
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS MUMBLEX .
W I I MEAN IT WOULD IT WOULD HAVE TO BE TOUGH GOING SOMEWHERE YOU DO NT KNOW THE CULTURE USUALLY I GUESS .
YEAH .
I THINK THAT MAYBE THAT S WHY SOME PEOPLE DO IT IS UH TO SEE THE OTHER CULTURES OR YOU KNOW AND SOME OF THAT .
UHHUH .
BUT UH TO DO THAT I DO NT KNOW I D HAVE TO BE I DO NT KNOW .
OH I DO NT KNOW EITHER .
MUMBLEX GROWING UP ALL .
I KNEW WAS YOU GO TO HIGH SCHOOL YOU YOU KNOW YOU WORK YOU GO TO COLLEGE YOU GET OUT OF COLLEGE AND YOU GET A GOOD JOB AND YOU WORK .

UHHUH .
AND THEY RE ALLOWED TO TAKE THAT TIME OFF AND THEN COME BACK WHERE THEY LEFT OFF .
OH .
SO IT IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK UH YOU KNOW EVEN THE LARGER ORGANIZATIONS WILL SUPPORT .
UH IT S IT S REALLY FOR THE COMMUNITY TO GIVE YOU KNOW TO TO GIVE BACK TO THE COMMUNITY TYPE OF THING .
MUMBLEX .
I DO NT KNOW IT S FOR I THINK AT THE SAME .
IT S FOR SOME PEOPLE TO YOU KNOW HELP THEM GROW IN OTHER AREAS .
KIND OF LIKE JOINING THE MILITARY .

A LOT OF PEOPLE JOIN THE MILITARY TO TO GROW UP .
YEAH M .
AND TO DECIDE WHAT .
THEY WANT TO DO AND THE PEACE CORPS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS PROBABLY USEFUL AS AS THAT KIND OF A TIME .
YEAH MAYBE A LITTLE BIT IN THAT PERSPECTIVE BUT UH AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE GONE IN THE MILITARY I MEAN YOU KNOW WHEN THEY RE IN THE COLLEGE .
SOMETIMES IT S TO SUP HELP SUPPORT COLLEGE YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
THE MONEY .
UH OTHERS PEOPLE DO NT KNOW WHAT .
THEY WANT TO DO .
BUT AS FAR AS UH YOU KNOW THE PEACE CORPS .
I GUESS I SUPPOSE THERE S A FEW PEOPLE .
THAT HAVE DONE IT AT THAT POINT IN THEIR LIVES .
BUT I THINK A LOT OF IT S YOU KNOW WHEN THE PEOPLE GET OLDER THEY LL DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
I D PROBABLY HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE IF I ACTUALLY KNEW SOMEONE .
THAT HAD GONE INTO THE PEACE CORPS .
YEAH .
BUT I DO NT .
I I I DO NT .
AND NONE OF MY .
DID NT MEAN TO CUT YOU OFF THERE .
OH THAT S OKAY .

IF YOU GET FOUR MILK CARTONS AND THAT FILLS UP TRASH BAG YOU KNOW PRETTY EASILY SO .
YOU KNOW .
I GUESS WE .
KIND OF STARTED RECYCLING AFTER I MOVED HERE ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO .
OH REALLY .
WE WERE USING BABY FOOD AND THERE WAS SO MANY BABY FOOD JARS .
YEAH .
KIND OF WHAT STARTED IT .
YEAH .
SOME OF OUR NEIGHBORS WERE DOING IT AND SO YOU KNOW WHEN I FOUND OUT SOME PLACES TO TAKE IT AND UM LIKE UM THEY ALSO TAKE SOME THINGS AT THE FLOWER MOUND DUMP BEHIND THE FIRE STATION THERE AND I KNOW THAT THEY RE GOING TO USE YOU KNOW THE MONEY FOR THAT TO BUILD SOME KIND OF MULTIPURPOSE FIELD AND THAT TYPE OF THING .
OH THAT WILL BE GOOD .
PUT LIGHTS AND STUFF SO YOU KNOW IF I M NOT GOING TO GET THE MONEY FOR ALUMINUM I WOULD JUST ASSUME GIVE IT TO THE CITY OF FLOWER MOUND .
SURE .
TO DO SOMETHING WITH YOU KNOW .
LET SOMEBODY GET SOMETHING OUT OF IT .
YEAH .
THAT S TRUE .
AND THEY WO NT RAISE OUR TAXES .
YEAH .
YEAH .
HAHA .
WELL I WAS KIND OF HOPING WITH YOU KNOW DO YOU WORK FOR T I .
NO I DO NT .
I HAVE A FRIEND .

OF MINE TOLD ME ABOUT THIS PROGRAM IS THE REASON THAT I M .
YEAH .
THERE WAS A T I HAS GOT THIS ORGANIZATION CALLED T .
A D .
WHICH IS T IERS AGAINST DRUGS .
AND YOU KNOW WE RE RECYCLING ALUMINUM CANS UP HERE AND UH JUST WHAT .
YOU WOULD BUY OUT OF THE MACHINES AND DRINK HERE AND THERE WAS CRUSHERS OUT IN ALL OF THE HALLWAYS YOU KNOW AND THAT S THEY USE THE MONEY FROM THAT TO FUND THIS T IERS AGAINST DRUGS PROGRAM .
IT S YOU KNOW T I DOES NT GIVE THEM .
ANY MONEY ALL EVERYTHING IS MADE FROM THAT .
AND THEY HAD TALKED ABOUT HAVING A THING LIKE ONE SATURDAY .
A MONTH YOU COULD COME AND DROP YOUR ALUMINUM CANS OFF FROM HOME YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
AND I M KIND OF LIKE YEAH .
I SHALL THEY WOULD DO THAT BECAUSE AT LEAST .
SOMEBODY WAS GETTING THE MONEY OUT OF IT YOU KNOW .
THAT WAS GOING TO USE IT FOR GOOD SO .
SORRY .
SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE A LITTLE ONE JUST LIKE I DO .
SHE LL BE TWO IN JULY .
YEAH .
MINE WAS TWO IN DECEMBER .
OH .
WELL IT WAS GOOD TO TALK TO YOU .
WELL IT WAS NICE TO TALK TO YOU .
I KNOW THEY VE STARTED OVER IN RICHARDSON WHERE MY DAD LIVES .
THEY PICK UP NEWSPAPERS I THINK .
OH DO THEY REALLY .
CURBSIDE PICK UP .
YEAH .
I REALLY HOPE THEY DO THAT IN LOUISVILLE .
IT WOULD MAKE IT .
A LOT EASIER ON ALL OF US .
MUMBLEX .
TALK TO YOU LATER .
OKAY .
BYEBYE .
OKAY .
SO UH WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT .
WELL UM I GUESS I I M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY THAN I AM ABOUT THE UM THE CONCERN FOR THE PRIVATE UH THE IDEA OF .
PRIVACY .
PRESERVING PRIVACY FOR .
RIGHT .
THE INDIVIDUAL UM BECAUSE I CA NT REALLY SEE WHY ANYONE UM WHO HAS NOTHING TO HIDE WOULD OBJECT .
WELL THERE IS ALWAYS THE UH THE POSSIBILITY EVEN REMOTE AS IT IS OF UH OF MISTAKEN UH OF .
THAT S OF COURSE THAT IS CERTAINLY TRUE .
YEAH .
YEAH .
AND SEE THAT BOTHERS ME .
I M I M A I MEAN I M I M VERY MUCH FOR DRUG TESTING .
UHHUH .
UH I REALLY AM .
I MEAN I M GOING I M GOING TO TAKE THE NEGATIVE SIDE JUST FOR A SECOND .
SURE .
JUST TO DO IT .
UM SEE I HAVE TO TAKE UH MEDICATION FOR A UH FOR FOR KIDNEY TRANSPLANT .
UHHUH .
AND I M GOING TO BE TAKING THAT THE REST OF MY LIFE .
NOW YOU .
SURE .
I DO NT KNOW HOW THAT S GOING TO AFFECT UH .
IF YOU HAD TO HAVE A DRUG TEST .
RIGHT .
YEAH .
I MEAN I HAVE NT HAD ONE YET .
UM T I I WORK FOR TEXAS INSTRUMENTS .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND AND UH WE YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE THE RANDOM DRUG TESTING BUT I VE MISSED IT SO FAR .
BUT I MEAN IT IN THE BACK OF MY MIND IT ALWAYS BOTHERS ME .
AND WHAT HAPPENS IF IT YOU KNOW IF IT IF THEY CATCH IT THEY THINK THAT I M YOU KNOW I M ON DRUGS AND THEY SEND ME AND AND HAVE ME UH YOU KNOW GO THROUGH THIS THIS .
CHECKED OUT OR WHATEVER .
THING YOU KNOW YEAH .
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE ARE WAYS TO ACCOMMODATE THAT .
UM I AGREE THAT THAT SOME INNOCENT PERSON MIGHT BE VICTIMIZED .
UHHUH .
BY A FALSE TEST BUT I WOULD THINK THAT UM THAT SOME GUIDELINES COULD BE SET UP TO AVOID THAT .
FOR EXAMPLE THAT ONE UH POSITIVE WOULD NOT BE UH ACCEPTED AS AN AUTOMATIC UM REASON FOR WHATEVER .
THEY MIGHT BE GOING .
RIGHT .
TO DO IF THEY FOUND A POSITIVE UH DISMISSAL OR TREATMENT OR WHATEVER BUT THAT THAT WHAT .
IT WOULD DO IS IT WOULD TRIGGER PERHAPS UH ONE OR TWO MORE STAGES WHERE FURTHER TESTS COULD BE TA UH DONE .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE UM THERE ARE THERE MUST BE PEOPLE LIKE YOU OR IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT COULD COME UP WITH WITH UH FALSE POSITIVES FOR CERTAIN KIND OF DRUGS .
ON THE OTHER HAND UM I THINK THERE S CERTAINLY SOME PROFESSIONS .
THAT OUGHT TO BE TESTED .
OH YEAH .
BECAUSE OF THE OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PUBLIC WELFARE AND CERTAINLY PEOPLE IN UH INDUSTRIES WELL THE TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY .
UHHUH .
FOR SPE UH YOU KNOW SPECIFICALLY .
OH YEAH .
BUT UM IN MANY MANY CASES WHETHER OR NOT AN INDIVIDUAL HAS A PROBLEM WITH DRUGS IT S NOT EVEN GOING TO EFFECT ANYBODY BUT HIS UH YOU KNOW HIMSELF AND HIS OWN FAMILY PERHAPS UM DEPENDING ON THE KIND OF DRUG .
HE MIGHT BE ON .
RIGHT .
BUT UM AND EVENTUALLY THAT S GOING TO SHOW UP ANYWAY IN THE WAY .
HE WORKS .
UHHUH .
AND SO ON .
BUT THERE S SO MANY THINGS THAT IT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE .
I GUESS I I UH I WOULD NOT WANT TO HAVE ANYONE IN MY FAMILY UH VICTIMIZED BY SOMEONE .
WHO YOU KNOW A A BUS DRIVER OR A TRAIN ENGINEER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHO UM YOU KNOW HAD NT BEEN TESTED .
RIGHT .
WELL I YOU KNOW I M LIKE I SAID I M I M VERY MUCH PRO TESTING UM AND AND THIS IS WHY .
YEAH .
UH NUMBER ONE IS I I M I M KIND OF I KNOW THIS SOUNDS LIKE A SLOGAN FOR THE GOVERNMENT BUT I YOU KNOW WE ARE IN A WAR AGAINST .
YEAH .
DRUGS .
I MEAN .
SURE .
IT S IT S HORRIBLE .
I MEAN YOU DO NT KNOW WHETHER THE PERSON SITTING NEXT TO YOU .
UHHUH .
ANYWHERE IS ON DRUGS OR NOT .
UHHUH .
AND IT TAKES SOME DRASTIC STEPS AT THIS POINT .
AND I THINK PERSONALLY THE DRASTIC STEP HAS TO BE THAT UM THAT YOU CA NT WORK IF YOU CONTINUE TAKING DRUGS .
YEAH .
I MEAN IT S AS SIMPLE AS THAT .
I MEAN MAKE IT SO .
MAKE IT DIFFICULT ENOUGH .
WELL MAKE IT UH MA NOT NECESSARILY DIFFICULT BUT MAKE IT SO THAT IT S NOT GLAMOROUS .
YEAH YEAH .
I MEAN IT S GLAMOROUS TAKING DRUGS OR AT LEAST .
IT SEEMS THAT WAY .
YEAH ACCORDING TO WHAT .
YOU .
YEAH .
YOU HEAR .
THE PEOPLE .
WHO UM HAVE SERIOUS PROBLEMS I MEAN WE HAVE UM REALLY I GUESS WE RE KIND OF LUCKY .
WE REALLY ONLY KNOW OF ONE UH YOUNG MAN .
WHO UH WHO S A FAM THEY GO TO OUR CHURCH .
UHHUH .
AND IT S THE SON AND SO ON AND HE WAS FRIENDS WITH MY CHILDREN UM AND HE S REALLY THE ONLY ONE THAT I KNOW OF PERSONALLY WHO GOT HIMSELF REALLY MESSED UP UM HA HAVING BEEN INVOLVED WITH DRUGS .
BUT I KNOW OF A NUMBER OF OTHER PEOPLE .
WHO HAVE YOU KNOW GOTTEN ALL MESSED UP .
UHHUH .
MOST OF THESE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE .
I WORK IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM AND SO I HAVE A LITTLE MORE CONTACT WITH THAT .
BUT UM THE EFFECT THAT IT S HAD ON THIS YOUNG MAN S LIFE IS SO DRAMATIC THAT IT S HEARTBREAKING .
UHHUH .
AND HE MAY NEVER REALLY BE A PRODUCTIVE MEMBER OF SOCIETY .
BUT SADDER THAN THAT HE MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO HAVE A NORMAL HAPPY LIFE BECAUSE IT HAS STRUNG HIM OUT SO THAT HE HAS ANXIETIES NOW THAT ARE ARE ALMOST UNCONTROLLABLE .
I MEAN HE HE PUTS HIMSELF IN THE HOSPITAL FAIRLY REGULARLY THINKING THAT YOU KNOW HE HE S NOT SURE IF HE S GOING TRY TO COMMIT SUICIDE OR NOT .
HUH .
I MEAN HE S YOU KNOW HE S SO MESSED UP .
RIGHT .
AND UM THIS WAS A NICE SWEET YOUNG MAN .
WHO TEENAGER YOU KNOW AND HE S NOW A YOUNG MAN ABOUT TWENTY I GUESS WHO UM JUST GOT REALLY DOWN THE WRONG PATH .
RIGHT .
AND UH YOU KNOW I DO NT KNOW THAT THAT HIS PROBLEM WOULD EVER HAVE BEEN DETECTED BY DRUG TESTING .
BUT SEEING WHAT DRUGS DID TO HIM MAKES ME SEE MAKES ME REALIZE WHAT .
IT COULD DO TO PEOPLE YOU KNOW IN THE WORK FORCE AS WELL .
UHHUH .
UM IT S HORRIBLE .
WELL THEN LET S LET S ANSWER THE SECOND .
HALF OF THE QUESTION .
WHAT LIMITS OUGHT TO BE PUT ON IT DO YOU THINK .
WELL THE LIMITS UH UH WOULD I THINK HAVE TO DO WITH WHAT .
I D ALLUDED TO BEFORE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A FURTHER UM THAT THAT ONE POSITIVE ON A DRUG TEST .
UHHUH .
WOULD NOT CONSTITUTE UH DISMISSAL OR GROUNDS FOR WHATEVER .
THE COMPANY OR AGENCY MIGHT UH HAVE SET UP FOR THOSE .
WHO GENUINELY HAVE A PROBLEM .
UHHUH .
IN OTHER WORDS THERE NEEDS TO BE UM MORE THAN .
TREATMENT BEFORE FOR DISMISSAL TYPE THING .
PARD YES RIGHT .
YEAH .
THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE THAN ONE TEST AND THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME SOME MEASURE OF UH CERTAINTY BEFORE ANYTHING .
DRASTIC HAPPENS .
UHHUH .
THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS .
THAT ARE INVOLVED THERE UM SUCH AS PERHAPS INSURANCE .
UHHUH .
UH YOU KNOW DENIAL OF INSURANCE FOR SOMEONE UM AND UNDOUBTEDLY THERE ARE PEOPLE .
WHO WOULD BE VICTIMIZED BY THIS UM THAT WOULD THAT YOU KNOW IT WOULD BE UNFAIR AND PEOPLE .
WHO ARE ON MEDICATION FOR EXAMPLE OR UM EVEN PEOPLE .
WHO MIGHT BE OF THE GAY COMMUNITY AND I M NOT AN ADVOCATE FOR THAT PARTICULAR SEGMENT OF SOCIETY BUT UM I THINK THAT THERE DOES NT NEED TO BE FUEL TO THE FIRE FOR DISCRIMINATION .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE IT MAKES A BIGGER PROBLEM .
UM SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT UM THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME GROUND YOU KNOW SOME RULES .
UHHUH .
THAT PROTECT .
I M NOT SURE THOUGH WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHAT RULES IF ANY THAT WE SHOULD SAY WELL CERTAIN SEGMENTS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE TESTED .
I REALLY DO NT SEE WHY .
PERSONALLY I THINK THAT S WHAT .
I WAS ABOUT TO SAY .
AND YEAH .
IS THAT EVERYONE NEEDS TO BE TESTED .
YEAH .
I DO NT .
IT YOU KNOW .
I DO NT KNOW WHY IT WOULD BE YOU KNOW UH BAD TO TEST JUST EVERY AND IT MAY BE YOU KNOW IT S NOT FEASIBLE TO DO EVERYONE BUT CERTAINLY RANDOM TESTING THE FACT THAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT THAT THEY .
THAT IT COULD HAPPEN .
YEAH .
UHHUH .
WOULD BE SOME MEASURE OF PROTECTION .
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THAT IF IF YOU RE GOING TO STAY CLEAN AND STRAIGHT THEN UM YOU RE YOU RE GOING TO DO THAT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO .
RIGHT .
REALLY .
WELL THERE S YEAH THERE THERE S GOING TO BE SOME MEASURE OF INCENTIVE UH REWARD OR WHATEVER BUT THE REWARD ULTIMATELY COMES DOWN TO WHAT .
YOU WANT .
YEAH .
SO I I VE GOT TO AGREE WITH THAT .
SO UM .
THAT S VERY TRUE .
UM .
WELL IT SOUNDS LIKE WE AGREE ANYWAY .
YEAH I THINK SO .
I THINK WE I THINK WE DID PRETTY GOOD .
YEAH .
WELL ALL RIGHT WELL UH I GUESS THAT S ABOUT IT .
I GUESS IF THAT S ALL .
WE VE DONE AND I GUESS WE VE TALKED LONG ENOUGH .
ALL RIGHT .
IT WAS NICE TALKING TO YOU .

OH HOW AWFUL .
IT WAS TRUE IT WAS TRULY AWFUL .
IT WAS NOT ONE THAT I PICKED BUT UH UH IT IT DID SHOW SOME SOME UH SOME INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT THE F B I BECAUSE THEY WERE THE THE UH THE CHARACTERS TRYING TRYING TO GET HIM WERE F B I .
PEOPLE AND UH UH OF THE OF THE FEW GOOD THINGS .
THAT WERE IN IT IT DID SHOW UH A LOT ABOUT THE F B I .
ABOUT THE TRAINING AND AND HOW THEY GO THROUGH TRAINING AND HOW THEY TRY TO TO DEVELOP UH UH A MENTAL PICTURE OF WHO .
THEY RE LOOKING FOR BEFORE THEY GO OUT AND DO IT AND ALL THE DIFFERENT WAYS THEY GO ABOUT DOING THAT .
AND IT WAS UH UH IT WAS PRETTY TELLING ABOUT THE THE THE F B I AND THEIR PROCEDURES .
I WONDER HOW TRUTHFUL ALL OF THAT WAS OR WHETHER THERE WAS FICTION .

YES UH OH THAT WAS THAT WAS UH WHAT .
THE MUCH OF THE HYPE WAS THAT TOM CRUISE LEARNED SO MUCH FROM DUSTIN HOFFMAN .
YEAH IT MUST HAVE BEEN GREAT JUST BEING WITH HIM ON ON A DAILY BASIS AND SEEING HOW HE PREPARES FOR HIS FOR HIS LINES AND ALL THAT STUFF .

YES .
ONLY AN AND THEN THEY BALANCED IT WITH THE WONDERFULNESS OF IT YOU KNOW AND AND AND YOU NEED TO TO WORK WITH IT UH YOU KNOW CERTAINLY ON ON A DAILY BASIS BUT THEN AG THEN AGAIN WORK WITH IT TOWARD A GOOD END .

I WAS IN A UH TRENTON NEW JERSEY SO AND IT WAS A SUBURB OF TRENTON SO I REALLY HAD MIXTURE OF SUBURB .
UHHUH .
AND URBAN LIVING .
I SEE I SEE WELL LIT LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT .
YEAH .
I THINK THOUGH IT WAS MUCH SLOWER AND UH MUCH MORE SELFCONTAINED .
I THINK YOU RE RIGHT .
IT S INTERESTING I M UM I WORK IN A HIGH SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
SO UH I M COMPARING MY LIFE WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL THIRTY YEARS AGO TO WHAT .
I SEE THESE CHILDREN DOING .
YES .
AND THE PRESSURES ON THE CHILDREN UH YOU KNOW YOU HEAR THIS AS AN EXCUSE BUT IT S TRUE THEY ARE SO MUCH GREATER .
UNREAL UNREAL BY COMPARISON .
OH I CAN NOT BELIEVE UH WHAT .
THEY RE DOING UH ACADEMICALLY THE DEMANDS ON THEM AND UH AND I CAN SEE WHY CHILDREN DO DROP OUT .
YEAH I THINK THAT S RIGHT .
I CAN SEE I CAN SEE THE UH YOU KNOW .
I I CAN REMEMBER AS A CHILD YOU KNOW NOBODY EVER WORRIED ABOUT ME WONDERING OUT AT NIGHT AND GOING WHERE I WANTED TO GO .
UHHUH UHHUH .
IT .
WAS NT IT DID NT OCCUR TO NOBODY TO WORRY THAT ANYTHING WOULD HAPPEN TO ME .
THEY WERE .
AND YOU YOU DID NT YOU DID NT HAVE TO LOCK YOUR DOOR .
NO NO .
AND UH A LO SOME OF THESE ARE URBAN WORRIES BUT UH IT S UH IT S A LOT DIFFERENT ALL THOUGH I GUESS TWENTY YEARS .
A GO NOW IN THIS AREA THINGS WERE UM SIMILAR BECAUSE TWENTY YEARS AGO LET S SEE IT WAS AFTER .
IT S NOT ALL THAT LONG AGO IS IT .
YEAH TO TWENTY TWENTYFIVE YEARS AGO IS WHEN WE HAD THE WASHINGTON RIOTS .
UHHUH UHHUH .
THE FIRST RIGHTS WE VE BEEN HAVING SOME PROBLEM NOW AND IT REMINDED ME OF THAT .
YEAH WE WERE LIVING IN NEW JERSEY .
UHHUH .
UH IN TWENTY YEARS AGO .
WHEREABOUTS .
IN ALLENDALE .
UHHUH .
AND UH I USE TO HAVE TO GO OVER TO PATTERSON WHEN THOSE RIOTS WERE GOING ON .
UHHUH .
AT SOMETIMES .
UM I DO NT KNOW THOUGH IT S IT S KIND OF HARD TO REALLY KNOW BECAUSE OF THOUGH THE NEWS MEDIA HAD THOSE RIOTS UH KIND OF BLOWN UP OUT OF PROPORTION .
UHHUH WELL .
BECAUSE I WENT THERE MANY TIMES AND .
THE WASHINGTON RIOTS WERE NT BECAUSE .
I NEVER I NEVER SAW A RIOT .
THE WASHINGTON RIOTS WERE NT BECAUSE I LIVED RIGHT DOWNTOWN .
DID YOU .
WASHINGTON AND UH AND WHAT .
YOU SAW IS WAS WHAT .
YOU GOT .
I M TELLING YOU .
THAT S WHAT YEAH WELL .
YEAH BUT YOU KNOW IT S IT IS INTERESTING UH THEY RE SO MANY MOR THEY RE DIFFERENT KIND OF DANGERS .
THAT FACE YOUNG PEOPLE NOW AND SOCIAL PRESSURES UH THE PRESSURES OF DRUG IS SO MUCH THE PREVALENCE IS SO MUCH GREATER .
UHHUH .
THE THE KINDS OF DISEASES THAT YOU VE GOT OUT THE UH UM .
UHHUH .
I MEAN THE CONSEQUENCES IS SO MUCH OF WHAT S GOING ON .
I THINK THAT S TRUE I THINK THAT S TRUE .
IS SO MUCH MORE SERIOUS THEN WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER .
I THINK THE OTHER THING IS THAT UH WE HAVE TAKEN SOME RATHER DRASTIC TURNS IN OUR IN OUR EDUCATION AND THE WAY .
WE APPROACH THINGS AS OF MAYBE STARTING BACK WHEN WHEN I M NUMBER ONE YOU KNOW AND UH UH UH WORRYING ABOUT SELF AND NOT UH SEEING THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE DISINTEGRATION OF THE FAMILY .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND UH AND THERE HAVE BEEN MANY THINGS .
THAT HAVE HAPPENED THAT HAVE NOT ENCOURAGED CLOSENESS OF FAMILIES AND UH SUPPORT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE THAT THE KIND OF SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED .
YES AND .
TO HELP THEM TAKE CARE OF THE THINGS IF YOU DO NT HAVE SOME KIND OF OF BASIC BELIEVE OR SOMETHING DOWN INSIDE OF YOU .
UHHUH .
THEN IT S VERY DIFFICULT TO UH HAVE ANYTHING TO TURN TO .
THAT S TRUE .
WHEN YOU GOT WHEN YOU VE GOT SOMETHING FACING YOU LIKE THAT .
I ALSO BEING INVOLVED IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM SEE SO MANY OF THE PROBLEM CHILDREN COMING FROM THEIR PARENTS UM CHILDREN .
WHO WILL LIE AND CHEAT AND YOU APPROACH THEIR PARENTS AND THEIR PARENTS ARE CONSTANTLY JUSTIFY THEM RATHER THEN TO .
UHHUH .
UH YOU KNOW THEY RE CONSTANTLY .
LIKE MUMBLEX .
EXCUSING THEIR .
RIGHT .
CHILD AND YOU CAN SEE EXACTLY .
YEAH EXACTLY .
WHY THE CHILD IS THAT WAY .
YOU CAN AS A TEACHER CA NT HOLD A CHILD ACCOUNTABLE .
YEAH .
IF YOU RE NOT GOING TO GET REINFORCED BY .
THAT S RIGHT .
THAT AT HOME .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND YOU CA NT MAKE UP IN A CLASSROOM OF ONE HOUR .
A DAY .
NO .
WHAT S NOT BEEN DONE FOR .
THAT S RIGHT .
FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN YEARS AT HOME .
OH .
AND YOU RE YOU GET MIXED SIGNALS SO IT S IT S NOT ALWAYS THE SCHOOL S SYSTEMS I THINK A LOT OF IT IS THE FAMILIES .
NO THERE S SO MUCH MORE THEN THAT IT STARTS .
THE WAY .
YOU WERE MENTIONING YEAH .
VERY MUCH DEEPER THEN THAT I THINK THAT TOO .
I SEE SOME FLICKERS OF OF UH OF GOOD DIRECTIONS TURNING .
NO .
BUT WHETHER THEY RE SOON ENOUGH AND FAST ENOUGH I DO NT KNOW IT S JUST .
OF COURSE LIFE IS A LOT MORE COMPLICATED TOO IN WAYS UM THE KINDS OF JOBS THAT PEOPLE NEED TO BE TRAINED .
RIGHT .
FOR NOW .
UH YOU KNOW WITH FARMING BEING SO MECHANIZED .
UHHUH .
UH PEOPLE WORKING ON THE FAMILY FARM .
WHICH WAS A TRADITIONAL AMERICAN WAY .
THAT BECOMES LESS AND LESS LIKELY FACTORY JOBS ARE SO MUCH MORE UM UH SOPHISTICATED .
YEAH THAT S RIGHT .
AND THE KINDS OF KNOWLEDGE THAT UH YOU KNOW IT IT S REQUIRING AN INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED LABOR FORCE AND .
RIGHT .
SOME PEOPLE JUST DO NT HAVE IT .
AND THERE S SO MUCH SO SO MANY PEOPLE ON THE LOWER END OF THOSE .
WHO WHO ARE GOING TO BE THE THE DROP OUTS AND THE .
AND YOU WORRY WHEN .
AND THE POOR AND THE HOMELESS AND WHATNOT .
YOU KNOW THESE .
THE SEX AND DRUGS ON THE YOUNG CHILDREN AND THE UNBORN CHILDREN .
YEAH THAT S JUST ANOTHER .
UH IN TERMS OF WHAT .
IT S GOING TO MEAN TO A SOCIETY .
YEAH .
IN THE FUTURE .
IT S A .
SOME WAYS .
IT S RATHER FRIGHTENING .
IT REALLY IS IT S JUST IT JUST IS ALMOST OVERWHELMING SOMETIMES WHEN YOU THINK .
IT CERTAINLY IS .
OF OF THE JOBS .
THAT IS OUT THERE TO BE DONE .
WELL IT SURE IS .
IN ORDER TO FLIP THINGS BACK AROUND THE WAY .
THEY NEEDED TO BE .
IT SURE IS .
UH NOT THAT I REALLY THINK THAT THEY WERE PERFECT TEN TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS AGO BUT .
IT WAS A LITTLE EASIER THOUGH WAS NT IT .
UH YEAH JUST THE VOLUME MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE .
YES .
I THINK AS UH AS UH MOTHER .
YOU KNOW I USE TO THINK SOMETIMES IT S NOT SO MUCH UH IT S NOT SO MUCH THE KIDS IT S JUST THE VOLUME OF IT .
YEAH .
TO TRY TO KEEP ALL WASH DONE AND ALL THE THINGS DONE AND YOU KNOW AND EVERYTHING .
AND ALL THE THINGS DEMANDED OF THE MOTHER TOO I MEAN .
RIGHT .
UH I LOOK AT MY MOTHER S LIFE .
I MEAN SHE SHE DID NT WORK UM UM FOR A LONG TIME WHE WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG SHE DID NT DRIVE .
UH SHE LEARNED TO DRIVE I THINK WHEN I WAS UM A TEENAGER AND HER LIFE WAS A LOT SIMPLER .
RIGHT AND .
AND I SIT HERE .
AND CHILDREN S LIVES WERE SIMPLER BECAUSE MOTHER WAS THERE SOMEBODY WAS THERE .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND AND WHEN THERE S NOBODY THERE .
THAT S RIGHT THAT S RIGHT .
I ALWAYS THOUGHT TOO THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE WORRYING ABOUT GOING TO WORK WHEN THEIR CHILD WHEN THEIR CHILDREN ARE LITTLE AND I AND I THINK THAT S SAD IF THEY HAVE TO BECAUSE THEY MISS SO MUCH BUT I I BELIEVED AFTER HAVING A FEW TEENAGERS THAT THE WORST TIME .
YOU COULD GO .
THEY NEED YOU MORE AS A TEENAGER .
TO GO WORK WAS WHEN THEY WERE TEENAGERS .
IS NT THAT TRUE .
THAT S WHY I M WORKING IN A SCHOOL SYSTEM SO THAT I M HOME WHEN THEY RE HOME .
UM .
RIGHT IT S NOT SO MUCH THAT THEY COME TO YOU .
EVERY MINUTE BUT IT S THAT YOU ARE THERE WHEN THEY NEED YOU .
THAT S EXAC IS NT THAT THAT S SO TRUE .
YEAH .
UH UH I FIND WORKING IN A HIGH SCHOOL IS VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE IT LET S .
ME BE A LITTLE MORE TOLERANT AND UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT PEOPLE DO .
YEAH .
AND IT KEEPS ME FROM BEING THE OLD FOGY SO BUT AT THE SAME TIME .
IT ALSO IT PREVENTS KIDS FROM TRY TO GO PULL THE WOOL OVER YOUR EYES .
YES I THINK THAT S TRUE .
AS TO WHAT S COM BUT THAT S THE SAME I M HOME IN THE SUMMERS I M HOME WITH THE HOLIDAYS .
YEAH THAT S .
I M HOME AT THREE O CLOCK WHEN THE CHILDREN ARE AT HOME OR WHERE HOME .
YEAH .
ONE IS NOW A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL AND THE OTHER S IN COLLEGE .
WELL .
AND UH .
BUT THAT HELPS A LOT .
IT .
S UH IT UH IT DOES .
I HAVE A DAUGHTER .
WHO JUST HAD A SECOND JOB SHE NEEDED TO WORK AND HE OPTED TO GO INTO A DAY CARE CENTER WHERE SHE COULD HAVE HER CHILDREN WITH HER .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND UH AND LOOKED A LONG TIME BEFORE SHE FOUND ONE .
THAT WAS LAID BACK ENOUGH SO THEY .
SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO INTERACT WITH THEM .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND UH AND SO I MUMBLEX YOU KNOW GOOD KIND OF EXPERIENCE AS WELL BUT UH .
WELL I .
I THINK THAT S REALLY IMPORTANT I DO NT THINK PEOPLE REALIZE HOW .
IMPORTANT .
IT IS .

UHHUH I M SURE YOU RE RIGHT I DO NT I DO NT I DO NT PARTICIPATE IN THAT BUT YOU KNOW A LOT OF FOLKS DO .
UHHUH .
YEAH AT LEAST WITH THE UH GASOLINE COMPANY CREDIT CARDS YOU HAVE YOU KNOW UP TO THIRTY TWENTYFIVE THIRTY DAYS YOU KNOW INTEREST FREE FOR IT .

BUT YOU KNOW THE INSTANT THING MAY BE MAY MAY BE THE WAY OF THE FUTURE TO YOU KNOW TO REPLACE CHECKS AND EVERY OTHER THING .

YEAH .
COURSE IT ELIMINATES ANY WAITING PERIOD .
IT CERTAINLY DOES .
GOD HELP THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO FLOAT CHECKS OCCASIONALLY .
ABSOLUTELY .
BECAUSE YOU WO NT BE ABLE TO WITH THAT .
THAT S RIGHT DO YOU GET ANY SORT OF DISCOUNT WHEN YOU USE A CARD LIKE THAT .
NO .
I SEE .
OH IT WAS WELL THEY CONSIDER IT TO BE THE SAME AS CASH .
I SEE I SEE .
WELL CAUSE IT ACTUALLY IS .
IT CERTAINLY IS YEAH .
YEAH IT S BETTER THAN CASH .
UHHUH .
THEY DO NT EVEN HAVE TO DEPOSIT IT IT JUST GOES STRAIGHT IN THERE .
THAT S RIGHT NO RETURNED CHECKS OR ANYTHING .
RIGHT .
YEAH NO I I UNDERSTAND IT S BECOMING YOU KNOW THE POPULAR THING TO DO WE RE NOT PARTICIPATING IN THAT PARTICULAR PROGRAM AT THE MOMENT AND I DO NT REALLY PERCEIVE DOING IT UNLESS WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO .
UHHUH .
BUT UH I HAVE IN TIMES PAST GOTTEN INTO A BIT OF TROUBLE WITH CREDIT CARDS IT S JUST YOU KNOW TOO EASY TO DO .
YEAH BUT I M SO GLAD HE TOLD ME THAT WHEN THAT THEY THEY GOT TO SUCH A POINT WITH THEIR CREDIT CARDS THEY DID NT WANT TO CUT THEM UP BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID SOMETIME THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY NEED THEM .
THAT S RIGHT .
THEY PAID THEM OFF AND THEN THEY STUCK THEM IN A THING OF WATER AND FROZE THEM .
SHE SAID AT LEAST BEFORE SHE COULD USE THEM SHE D HAVE TO THAW THEM OUT I MEAN THAT S FUNNY .
WELL THAT S A NOVEL IDEA YEAH THAT WOULD CAUSE YOU THINK A LITTLE WHILE WOULD NT IT .
THAT MAY NOT BE A BAD IDEA .
BUT I M KIND OF GETTING A LITTLE MORE LEERY OF CREDIT CARDS YOU KNOW AS TIME GOES BY UNLESS YOU JUST ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO NOW THERE ARE TIMES WHEN YOU D .
YEAH .
AT LEAST THINK YOU DO ANYWAY .
YEAH I I WANT TO STILL HAVE JUST ONE .

THAT S RIGHT MY WIFE AND I REALLY I GUESS ARE FORTUNATE WE RE REALLY NOT COMPULSIVE SHOPPERS YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
WE WE PLAN PURCHASES YOU KNOW PRETTY WELL YOU KNOW WATCH FOR THE BEST BUYS THINGS LIKE THAT BUT UH SOME PEOPLE HAVE A REAL PROBLEM WITH IT .

UHHUH .
AND UH SO THAT S THAT S ONE THING THAT S GOOD .
SURE ABSOLUTELY YEAH .
OH I VE GOT ANOTHER CALL .
OH I M SORRY WAS NICE TALKING TO YOU .
OKAY .
TAKE CARE .
ALL RIGHT BYEBYE .
BYEBYE .
ALL RIGHT .
UM THERE WAS A CRIME HERE IN MCKINNEY .
UHHUH .
UH A RATHER HEINOUS MURDER .
THERE WAS NO UM REMORSE SHOWN BY UH AT LEAST ONE OF THE PERPETRATORS .
UHHUH .
AND YET FOR WHATEVER REASON UM HIS CRIME WAS NOT CONSIDERED A CAPITAL CRIME .
UHHUH .
AN AND QUITE HONESTLY I I FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT THE MAN HA THE HAS NO REDEEMING SOCIAL VALUES AND IF IF AND WHEN HE COMES GETS FREE AGAIN .
UHHUH .
HE WILL HAVE NO COMPUNCTION BUT TO COMPLETE THAT THAT SAME KIND OF LIFESTYLE I MEAN CONTINUE THAT SAME KIND OF LIFESTYLE .
AND PERHAPS DO THE SAME THING AGAIN .
SO IT REALLY BOTHERS ME THAT THERE S NOT A WAY OF GETTING HIM OUT OF THE WAY FOREVER .
REALLY I THINK THAT I DO NT KNOW I DON I DO NT THINK OUR PRISON SYSTEM IS NT SET UP .
WHERE WE UM REHABILITATE OR YOU KNOW RESTORE ANYBODY .
I THINK IT LL ONLY MAKE THEM WORSE BUT I I BELIEVE THAT GOD CAN COME IN AND CHANGE A PERSON S HEART AND GENUINELY CHANGE IT BUT THAT DOES NT NEGATE THAT YOU DO REAP WHAT .
YOU SOW .
AND IF YOU DO KILL A PERSON AND IT IS YOU KNOW YOU RE FOUND TO BE GUILTY I BELIEVE GOD ESTABLISHES THE AUTHORITY OF OUR COURT SYSTEM AND I BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW THAT I DO BELIEVE THAT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS UH ALTERNATIVE .
EVEN YOU KNOW GOD CAN STILL CHANGE YOUR HEART BUT THAT DOES NT MEAN LIKE THE ALCOHOLIC THAT CHARGES UP ALL THE BILLS ON THE CREDIT CARD OR THE SHOPAHOLIC YOU KNOW YOU GET YOUR LIFE RIGHT WITH GOD BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO PAY YOUR VISA BILL .
THAT S THAT S RIGHT .
YOU STILL HAVE TO YOU KNOW SO BUT GOD SENT US HIS GRACE AND THEY GIVE PARDONS BUT I BELIEVE IF IT S A GENUINE CONVERSION THERE S A GENUINE AND THOSE PRISON PEOPLE KNOW THEY KNOW A GENUINE TURNAROUND IN A PERSON S CHARACTER THEY SEE THAT .
BUT YEAH .
AND I I WORKED IN A PRISON IN FORT WORTH .
DID YOU .
YEAH I HAVE A DEGREE IN SOCIAL WORK .
YOU SEE IT YOU KNOW THE ONES .
THAT HAVE A GENUINE CHARACTER CHANGE .
UHHUH .
IT IS OBVIOUS .
AND THEY KNOW THAT .
THEY RE THEY RE NOT GOING TO PARDON SOMEONE FROM THE GOVERNOR YOU KNOW WHAT .
I M SAYING THEY RE NOT GOING TO GO WITHOUT GOING THROUGH EVERY CHANNEL OF AUTHORITY IN THE PRISON .
SO I FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW THAT S IS THERE IS OCCASIONS WHERE THERE ARE THEY DO SPARE LIVES AND YOU KNOW I LEAVE THAT WITH THE GOVERNOR WHO OF COURSE IS GOING TO GO THROUGH EVERY AUTHORITY BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE BE REELECTED SO .
YES BUT MY CONCERN IS .
FIRST OF ALL THAT NOT ALL ALL PERSONS .
WHO .
I THINK SHOULD BE RECEIVING CAPITAL UH .
UHHUH .
WHATEVER CAPITAL UH THA UH TH UH HUM .
PUNISHMENT .
PUNISHMENT THANK YOU I M SORRY I JUST GOT HOME FROM WORK AND I M JUST KIND OF SPACED OUT A LITTLE BIT .
YEAH THAT S OKAY .
UH THAT NOT ALL OF THEM ARE BEING CONVICTED OF IT THAT THAT THE THE THEY RE NOT EVEN BEING CHARGED WITH THAT APPROPR I AGREE WITH YOU THAT THAT .
UHHUH .
A PERSON S HEART CAN BE CHANGED BUT THE SAME GOD .
THAT CAN WORK THAT MIRACLE ALSO ESTABLISHED THE LAWS .
THAT SAID UM FOR CERTAIN KINDS OF SIN CERTAIN KINDS OF OF UH BREAKING OF THE LAW THERE WOULD BE A CAPITAL PUNISHMENT .
UHHUH .
RIGHT THEN IT WAS IT WAS UH ALMOST IMMEDIATE .
UHHUH .
AS SOON AS AS THE TRIAL WAS OVER THEN IT WAS STONING .
RIGHT BUT IN IN THE OLD TESTAMENT .
WE DO NT HAVE A SPEEDY TRIAL WE DO NT HAVE SPEEDY UM PUNISHMENT AND SO IT .
KIND OF LOSES ITS MEANING .
UHHUH YEAH .
IF YOU SIT ON DEATH ROW FOR MONTHS AND YEARS AND SO FORTH .
RIGHT WE DO NT WELL YEAH WE DEFINITELY HAVE LOST THE JUDEOCHRISTIAN ETHIC OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM FOR SURE BUT THE BA THE BASE IS STILL THERE THE FOUNDATION IS STILL THERE THOUGH BU OF THE SYSTEM BUT I KNOW WHAT .
YOU RE SAYING UH BUT ALSO THEY RE UNDER A LAW BECAUSE WE HAVE NT BEEN REMOVED FROM THE LAW .
WE VE JUST BEEN TAKEN OUT FROM UNDER UNDER A LAW .
BECAUSE UNDER THE LAW IF YOUR CHILD MO BACK TALKS YOU .
HE WOULD BE STONED .
THAT S CORRECT .
HE UNDER THE LAW .
HE WOULD BE STONED SO WE VE BEEN REMOVED FROM THE LAW OF UN FROM BEING UNDER THE LAW BUT WE RE STILL YOU KNOW WE RE STILL ACCOUNTABLE TO IT .
WE DO NT NEED TO BACK TALK BUT YOU KNOW IT S LIKE GOD CHANGES YOUR HEART TO NOT DO THAT .
HE CHANGES YOUR HEART NOT TO LOOK UPON A WOMAN IN LUST .
BECAUSE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT THEY COULD LOOK ALL .
THEY WANTED JUST COULD NT DO IT .
BUT IN THE NEW HE S LOOKING AT YOUR HEART AND SO I GUESS THAT S WHAT WHAT .
I MEAN BY THEIR CHARACTER CHANGES AND YOU KNOW WHAT .
I MEAN IT S LIKE LOOKING BEYOND WHAT .
THEY RE DOING AND LOOKING AT A HEART AND SEEING WHAT IS THE HEART WHAT S THE CHARACTER SHOWING ME HERE .
AND THOSE AND THEN ANY OF IF I DO NT THINK SEE IF I DO NT BELIEVE THAT THERE S NOT A CHARACTER CHANGE AND THE AUTHORITIES AGREE THAT THIS PERSON NEEDS TO BE EXCUSED I BELIEVE FOR MURDER UH RAPE I EVEN BELIEVE INCEST THINGS .
UHHUH .
THAT WILL PERMANENTLY DAMAGE UH THE CHARACTER OF THE CHILD .
I BELIEVE CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN SHOULD BE PUNISHED BU BY BY DEATH .
I BELIEVE .
I TEND TO AGREE ON THAT VERY STRONGLY .
SEXUAL CRIMES UNLESS THERE S A TRUE CHANGE OF CHARACTER .
AND THAT S WHERE WE JUST HAVE TO TO TRUST THE AUTHORITIES .
AND THEY RE NOT GOING TO EXCUSE PEOPLE IF IT WAS WAS RUN LIKE THAT I DO NT THERE WOULD PROBABLY BE VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS TO THAT AND IF IT WAS DONE QUICKLY AND DONE SWIFTLY AND BUT IT S NOT BECAUSE THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM HAS REJECTED THEY VE REJECTED THE ANSWER TO ALL THESE PROBLEMS THEY HAVE PRETTY MUCH .
PLUS THE ALL THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS OVERLOADED WITH .
RIGHT .
ALL KINDS OF UM PROBLEMS AND CRIMES AND SO FORTH AND THEN ALL OF THE UM CIVIL THINGS .
THAT CLOG THE COURTS .
UHHUH .
AND HAVING SAT ON BOTH UH UH CRIMINAL AND A CIVIL UH JURY .
UHHUH .
SOME OF WHAT GOES THROUGH OUR COURTS IS A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME .
YEAH .
BECAUSE WE RE SUIT HAPPY .
YEAH .
BUT BUT BACK TO THE TO THE CAPITAL SITUATION SOUNDS LIKE YOU AND I HAVE A LOT OF OF OF UH COMMON GROUND AT LEAST AS AS FAR AS AS CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS CONCERNED .
YEAH .
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME SOME KIND OF REFORM OR SOME KIND OF STREAMLINING SO THAT IF A PERSON IS UM CONVICTED .
UHHUH .
AND SENTENCED TO TO DEATH THAT THAT AUTOMATIC APPEAL .
WHICH GOES IN COULD BE MORE QUICKLY DEALT WITH .
UHHUH YEAH .
AND AND GO AHEAD AND GET THE PUNISHMENT PHASE OUT OF THE WAY BECAUSE IT DOES NT DO THE CRIMINAL OR THE VICTIM S FAMILY .
YEAH .
ANYBODY YEAH .
R R ANY OF US THE TAXPAYER ANY GOOD TO HAVE HIM SITTING AROUND FOR MONTHS AND YEARS .
YEAH .
AN AN BU HIM COULD BE A HER .
RIGHT .
BUT .
I KNOW IN JAMAICA UH IT THINK IT S JAMAICA I THINK IT S JAMAICA I KNOW THAT THEY HAVE YOU KNOW CRIMES PUNISHABLE BY DEATH AND I M SURE THEY HIT A FEW EVERY NOW AND THEN AND I WOULD NT WANT TO BE ONE OF THEM THAT ARE NOT GUILTY .
BUT I KNOW THAT THEY HAVE LIKE UH THEIR CRIME RATE IT S NOT JAMAICA I DO NT THINK I CA NT REMEMBER WHICH IT S UH ONE OF THE CARIBBEAN ISLANDS AND AND THEY SINGAPORE IS IT LIKE THAT .
MY HUSBAND S GOING SINGAPORE .
AND THEY DO NT HAVE A LOT OF THE CRIME BECAUSE THERE IS A LAW AND THE LAW IS ENFORCED .
AND THAT S WHAT WH WHEN YOU HAVE LAWLESSNESS I MEAN THE LAW S NOT BEING ENFORCED AND ALL THAT DOES IS LAWLESSNESS .
WE WERE WE WENT ON A MISSION TRIP TO MANHATTAN AND TO THE BRONX AND STUFF TWO YEARS AGO AND ALL THESE KIDS WERE UP ON THERE GETTING ARRESTED FOR CRACK AND EVERYONE WAS OUT UH WE WERE ACROSS FROM THAT BIG BUS STATION I FORGET WHAT .
YOU CALL IT BUT ANYWAY AND EVERYONE THEY HAD LIKE FIFTEEN PEOPLE LINED UP ON THE FENCE AND WITHIN TWO HOURS THERE WERE FIFTEEN BOYS SITTING THERE DOING THE SAME THING .
UM .
AND YOU D SEE THE SAME KID .
WHO WERE BACK OUT THERE IN TWO DAYS .
THAT S SAD .
BECAUSE THERE S NO THE ANSWER IS NOT BEING GIVEN TO THEM IN THE COURT SYSTEM AND I THINK INITIALLY WHEN OUR COUNTRY WAS SET UP IT WAS SET UP WITH GOD AND IT WAS REALLY AN INTEGRAL PART AND NO YOU CA NT YOU CA NT FORCE PEOPLE BUT I THINK PEOPLE ARE HURTING AND THEY RE OUT DOING CRACK SITTING ON THE STREET .
THEY WERE THE KIND OF PEOPLE .
THAT I THINK MOSTLY WE WOULD WANT TO RECEIVE IT .
IF IT WAS PRESENTED TO SEE .
I DO NT KNOW I GUESS I M KIND OF FRUSTRATED THAT YOU KNOW WE VE GOTTEN AWAY FROM THE CHRISTIAN BASIS THAT OUR COURT SYSTEM WAS FOUNDED UPON .
I MEAN IT REEKS OF THE BIBLE JUST THE WHOLE THING THE WHOLE SYSTEM .
AND SO I FEEL LIKE IF THAT WAS PRESENTED MORE OPENLY AND NOT JUST RELYING UPON AND PARACHURCH MINISTRY TO COME IN AND DO IT THAT THAT THE SYSTEM .
ITSELF YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT .
I MEAN .
YEAH .
I FEEL LIKE THAT MIGHT BE BETTER IF IT WAS RUN ON A MORE SCRIPTURAL BASIS WHICH WOULD INCLUDE YOU KNOW YOU KNOW AND EXPEDITING THE PENALTIES AND JUST GETTING IT OVER WITH .
HOWEVER CERTAIN UH VERY LIBERAL MINDED GROUPS .
WHO DO NOT UM SUBSCRIBE TO THE SAME ETHICAL SYSTEM THAT YOU AND I DO .
SUCH AS THE UH CIVIL LIBERTIES UNIONS AND SO FORTH .
RIGHT .
WILL LOBBY AGAINST THAT AND HOLD THAT OUT AS LONG AS THEY HAVE BREATH .
RIGHT .
WHICH IS MOST UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE WE .
ALL LOSE OUT .
YEAH .
WHEN PEOPLE GO SO FAR OUT TO THE EXTREME ON EITHER SIDE .
YEAH .
BECAUSE TOO TOO OFTEN THEY RE CAN BE EXTREMISM THAT THAT HURTS FROM FROM ANY DIRECTION .
YEAH .
REGARDLESS OF WHA WHATEVER .
YOU RE ARGUING OR CONCERNED ABOUT .
RIGHT .
YEAH I KNOW YOU RE RIGHT THEY WOULD LOBBY THAT AND AND I SEE THAT AND THAT S WHY YOU KNOW I M LIKE OKAY WHAT S MY ROLE IN THIS THING YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
WHAT S MY PART BECAUSE I DO NT THINK THE SYSTEM IS GOING TO GET FIXED .
I THINK IT S CRIPPLED .
WELL DO YOU THINK UH I MEAN I WONDER THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT IT IS A PROBLEM UH AND I VE NEVER ACTUALLY HAD TOO MANY PEOPLE EXPLAIN TO ME WHY IT S A PROBLEM THOUGH I HAVE THE SAME INSTINCTUAL FEELING THAT IT S A PROBLEM AND UH BUT IT S NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT IT IS .
UH BO .
UM IT S A PROBLEM IF THOSE VOTING DO NT REPRESENT THE POPULATION DEMOGRAPHICALLY OR IN TERMS OF THEIR OPINIONS .
BUT IF THOSE .
WHO DO NT VOTE IF YOU MADE THEM VOTE AND IT .
THOSE .
WHO DO NT VOTE WOULD HAVE VOTED EXACTLY THE SAME WAY YOU KNOW IN OTHER WORDS IF FORTY PERCENT HAD VOTED FOR THAT PERSON AND SIXTY PERCENT FOR THE OTHER JUST LIKE EVERYONE .
WHO DID VOTE IT S NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT IT IS REALLY A PROBLEM UM .
UM THAT S THAT S INTERESTING BECAUSE I HAD THOUGHT I HA FEEL THAT IT S A PROBLEM ALSO BUT I SEE YOUR POINT ON THAT .
I MEAN I I ASSUME THAT THOSE .
WHO DO NT VOTE I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT THE BREAK DOWN OF THOSE .
WHO DO NT VOTE THEY TEND TO BE YOU KNOW POOR BLACKS FOR EXAMPLE VOTE VERY LITTLE AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND I ASSUME THAT THEY WOULD VOTE DIFFERENTLY IF THEY WERE VOTING THAN YOUR AVERAGE VOTER .
BUT I DO NT KNOW IF THAT S THE CASE .
UH .
IN FACT .
I VE HEARD OF STUDIES .
THAT SUGGEST THAT THAT IS NT .
APPARENTLY THEY DO NT THINK IT S A PROBLEM .
UH I GUESS NOT I M I I VOTE RELIGIOUSLY I REALLY DO .
UM I GUESS I GUESS I M A FAN OF DEMOCRACY AND UH WISH I COULD VOTE ON MORE THINGS FRANKLY .
THAT S RIGHT UM .
BUT IT S FUNNY BECAUSE HERE IN CALIFORNIA THINGS ARE GETTING UH INCREASINGLY DEMOCRATICALLY ORIENTED IN IN THE SENSE OF PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO VOTE FOR THINGS .
I MEAN WE HAVE THESE INITIATIVES STATE INITIATIVES NOW .
OH .
THE FIRST REALLY POPULAR YOU KNOW WIDE SPREAD ONE WAS UH PROPOSITION THIRTEEN .
WHICH WAS A UH TAX REVOLT .
RIGHT I R .
AGAINST PROPERTY TAXES .
UH AND YOU KNOW NOW WE RE AND THAT WAS WHATEVER TEN YEARS AGO AND NOW WE RE UP TO PROPOSITION A HUNDRED AND FIFTY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
I MEAN WE VE JUST THERE WERE APPARENTLY VOTERS .
WHO JUST THREW UP THEIR HANDS AFTER THE LAST VOTERS PAMPHLET BECAUSE THEY WERE ASKED BEING ASKED TO MAKE DECISIONS ON TOPICS .
THAT WOULD HAVE THREE DIFFERENT COMPETING PROPOSALS AND YOU HAD TO VOTE FOR YOU KNOW YES OR NO ON EACH OF THEM AND NO ONE COULD MAKE HEADS OR TAILS OUT OF SOME OF THEM AND IT WAS INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT .
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE REVOLTED AGAINST THAT THEY SAID WE DO NT WANT TO HAVE TO DECIDE ALL THESE THINGS .
YOU KNOW THAT S THAT S THAT S WHY WE HIRE PEOPLE .
WHO UH YOU KNOW TO TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS FOR US .
I I .
KIND OF FEEL THE OPPOSITE THOUGH .
YEAH .
I WISH WE WERE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE ON MORE THINGS .
I DO T .
I THINK OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS SAY THEY ARE SPEAKING FOR US BUT THEY RE NOT SPEAKING FOR ME .
UHHUH UHHUH .
YEAH I WOULD NT MIND HAVING OH MORE VOTES THAN I GET TO HAVE FRANKLY .
THAT S TRUE .
ANYONE .
WHO DOES NT VOTE IT S FINE WITH ME AS LONG AS I CAN HAVE THEIR VOTE .
THAT WOULD MAKE ME HAPPY THOUGH .
MAYBE NOT IN A IN A DEEP PHILOSOPHICAL SENSE BUT IN A SELFISH SENSE IT PROBABLY WOULD .
I DO NT KNOW IT S INTERESTING UH SOME COUNTRIES VOTING IS OBLIGATORY .
WELL .
UH IT IS IN AUSTRALIA FOR EXAMPLE .
IS THAT TRUE .
YEAH YEAH .
I DID NT KNOW THAT I WAS THINK THAT IS ONE SOLUTION TO IT .
I DO NT KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT THAT .
BUT I DO NT THAT S NOT REALLY DEMOCRATIC .
NOT WHAT .
I D CONSIDER TRULY DEMOCRATIC .
WELL AUSTRALIA CONSIDERS ITSELF .
EVERY BIT AS MUCH A DEMOCRACY AS THE UNITED STATES .
AS UHHUH .
AND IT S NOT FOR ME TO SAY THAT THEY RE NOT .
UHHUH .
UM THEY THEY FEEL I MEAN HERE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE AND THEY SIMPLY DEFINE IT AS A DUTY THERE .
YOU KNOW WE HAVE JUST AS WE HAVE A R A DUTY TO PAY TAXES YOU KNOW IS THAT DEMOCRATIC .
I MEAN WE DO NT HAVE THE RIGHT TO PAY TAXES IN THIS COUNTRY WE HAVE THE DUTY TO PAY TAXES .
IT S A DUTY RIGHT .
AND IN THAT COUNTRY .
IT S A DUTY TO PAY TAXES AND IT S A DUTY TO VOTE ON HOW THOSE TAXES ARE SPENT .
AND IT S NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT THAT S SO MUCH LESS DEMOCRATIC .
UM .
UHHUH .
I DO NT KNOW BUT PART OF ME REBELS AGAINST THAT .
I IT S THAT S .
BUT THEN I M AN AMERICAN .
IT .
S COMPLEX QUESTION WHEN YOU START THINKING ABOUT IT IS NT IT .
YEAH .
AND SOME PEOPLE DO NT VOTE I MEAN THERE IS LIKE THREE OR FOUR PERCENT OF AUSTRALIANS DO NT VOTE AND I THINK THEY RE EL ELIGIBLE FOR A FINE .
I DO NT KNOW IF THEY ACTUALLY ARE FINED OR OR WHAT HAPPENS BUT YOU RE ELIGIBLE FOR SOME SORT OF FINE IF YOU DO NT VOTE .
UHHUH .
THAT S INTERESTING .
I HAVE PEOPLE HERE THAT I KNOW THAT HAVE NEVER REGISTERED TO VOTE .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK I THINK THEY FEEL THEY CAN CRITICIZE IF THEY DO NT .
YEAH I WAS SORT OF S .
I TOLD THEM IF THEY DO NT VOTE THEY DO NT HAVE THE RIGHT TO CRITICIZE .
WELL I THAT S HOW I FEEL .
I MEAN IF YO IF YOU VOTE AND YOUR GUY LOOSES WELL YOU LEAS YOU .
LEAST TRIED AND YOU CAN SAY SOMETHING BUT IF YOU DO NT VOTE I SORT OF FEEL LIKE PART OF ME AND IT S KIND OF A NASTY PART OF ME FEELS LIKE WELL IF YOU DID NT VOTE YOU GET WHAT S COMING TO YOU YOU KNOW .
THAT S RIGHT I FEEL TH .
AND CERTAINLY THAT S TRUE IN THE OVERALL I MEAN NO ONE INDIVIDUAL .
THAT S TRUE FOR BUT FOR THE POPULATION AS A WHOLE I SORT OF FEEL THAT WAY .
WHEN THEY ESPECIALLY WHEN SOMEONE THEY THEY DO NT VOTE FOR SOMEONE BECAUSE THEY DO NT LIKE ANY OF THEM AND THEN THE PERSON GETS IN AND THEY DO NT LIKE HIM AND HE TURNS OUT TO HAVE BEEN WORSE THAN HER THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE VOTED FOR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
AND YOU KNOW I SAY WELL YOU KNOW VOTING FOR THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS IS STILL IMPORTANT .
I THINK IT IS TOO .
SOMETIMES IT IS A DIFFICULT CHOICE .
YOU DO NT FEEL AS THOUGH YOU HAVE MUCH OF A CHOICE BUT .
YEAH YEAH I MEAN YOU I MEAN IT S IT S FUNNY BECAUSE TECHNICALLY YOU DO .
I MEAN YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO A WRITE IN CANDIDATE .
BUT OF COURSE .
THAT S THAT S NOT REALLY A VOTE .
UM .
IT DOES NT REALLY GAIN ANYTHING .
YES IT .
REA REALLY DOES NT AND SO IT S IT S A COMPLICATED SITUATION BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE I DO NT KNOW I I I M I M THINKING OF ACTUALLY MOVING TO AUSTRALIA AND .
IS THAT GOIN .
AND PERHA PERHAPS I LL CALL YOU BACK AND LET YOU KNOW WHAT HOW THE AUSTRALIAN SYSTEM WORKS .
I MEAN NOT BECAUSE OF THE VO I MEAN I M NOT THINKING OF MOVING THERE BECAUSE OF THE VOTING .
NOT BE .
BUT JUST BECAUSE OF A JOB OPPORTUNITY .
OH I SEE .
AND UH I .
I M INTE ARE YOU .
A T I .
EMPLOYEE I M INTERESTED .
NO I M NOT .
NOT OKAY I JUST WONDERED .
AND UH SO I M I M REALLY QUITE QUITE CURIOUS HOW THAT WOULD WORK TO HAVE BOTH I MEAN YOU KNOW AND I BELIEVE IN THE IN A CERTAIN UH SOVIET BLOC COUNTRIES YOU ARE ARE OBLIGED TO VOTE TOO .
IN FACT IT WAS EVEN PRETTY MUCH SPELLED OUT WHO .
YOU DID VOTE FOR UP UNTIL FAIRLY RECENTLY AND THAT S WHAT .
I THINK OF WHEN I THINK OF YOU RE OBLIGED TO VOTE .
BUT WHEN YOU ACTUALLY REALLY ARE GIVEN AS MUCH CHOICE AS YOU ARE IN THIS COUNTRY WITH ITS TWO PARTY SYSTEM UM I DO NT KNOW I .
KIND OF PART OF ME IS WARY AND PART OF ME LIKES THE IDEA OF HAVING IT BE MORE OF A DUTY UM .
WELL UH MAYBE THEY SHOULD PERHAPS THAT WOULD BE A SOLUTION IF THEY WERE REQUIRED TO VOTE AT LEAST FOR THEIR FIRST THREE OR FOUR YEARS AFTER THEY BECOME OF VOTING AGE .
UHHUH UHHUH UHHUH .
REQUIRED TO REGISTER AND VOTE FOR FOUR YEARS AND PERHAPS THEY WOULD BE INDOCTRINATED THAT THIS IS THEIR DUTY .
UHHUH UHHUH .
WELL THAT S A THOUGHT OR CERTAIN PRIVILEGES COME FROM VOTING WHICH ARE NT THAT IMPORTANT BUT ARE NICE TO HAVE I DO NT KNOW .
THE RIGHT TO WRITE YOUR .
MAYBE IT SHOULD GO WITH A DRIVERS LICENSE .
YEAH THAT S SEE THAT S AN EXAMPLE OF A RIGHT NOT A NOT A ACTUALLY THAT S CONSIDERED A PRIVILEGE NOT A RIGHT .
THAT IS A PRIVILEGE RIGHT THA .
YEAH BUT TECHNICALLY PEOPLE MOST PEOPLE TECHNICALLY IT S A PRIVILEGE BUT MOST PEOPLE THINK OF IT AS A RIGHT .
I MEAN IN OTHER WORDS IF THE GOVERNMENT DENIES YOU DRIVING DENIES YOU .
A DRIVERS LICENSE PEOPLE GET VERY UPSET .
BUT ACTUALLY IT S A PRIVILEGE .
IT IS .
WHICH IS ALLOWED TO BE REVOKED .
THAT S CORRECT .
AND FORTUNATELY VOTING IS NT THAT .
MAYBE IT SHOULD MAYBE IT SHOULD BE .
EXCEPT WELL EXCEPT IF YOU RE A FELON IF YOU RE A FELON .
IT IS TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU .
UHHUH .
I MEAN MUMBLEX THEY WILL TAKE AWAY YOUR RIGHT TO VOTE UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES .
THAT S RIGHT .
UM SO GOSH SO WE DO NT HAVE A GREAT SOLUTION YET DO WE .
DO NT HAVE A GREAT I I THINK I CHECKED THAT AS A QUESTION .
I D BE WILLING TO DISCUSS TOO .
OH .
BUT I I ALSO I ALSO I DO NT KNOW IF YOU VE UH READ ANY OF THE UM OH WHAT DO THEY CALL THOSE .
THE UH THE EARLY REPUBLICAN UH REPUBLIC DOCUMENTS UH WHEN THEY WERE ARGUING THROUGH CONSTITUTIONAL LAW WRITTEN BY HAMILTON AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE .
NO NO I HAVE NT .
UM OH HAMILT I THINK IT WAS HAMILTON .
WHO WROTE NUMBER TEN OR SOMETHING WHERE HE WAS ARGUING FOR A REPUBLICAN NOT IN THE SENSE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY NOW .
RIGHT .
VERSUS A DEMOCRATIC UH GOVERNMENT AND ARGUING SUCCESSFULLY WHY THE UNITED STATES SHOULD BE A REPUBLIC NOT A DEMOCRACY .
WHICH INDEED IT REALLY IS A REPUBLIC NOT A DEMOCRACY .
WHERE HE DEFINES DEP DEMOCRACY AS EVERYONE VOTES FOR THE ISSUES AND REPUBLIC IS PEOPLE .
WHO VOTE FOR SOMEONE .
WHO THEN IN TURN VOTES FOR THE ISSUES .
IN OTHER WORDS YOU VOTE FOR REPRESENTATIVES .
UHHUH .
AND THE WHOLE IDEA WAS UM PRESUMABLY THOSE .
WHO GET VOTED IN WOULD BE WISER THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON AND AND A SPECIALIST AND ABLE TO MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS AND CAN PROTECT AGAINST THE TYRANNY OF DEMOCRACY .
BECAUSE JUST AS YOU CAN HAVE A TYRANNY OF A SINGLE UM YOU KNOW BAD RULER OR SOMETHING YOU CAN HAVE A TYRANNY OF THE MAJORITY .
UHHUH .
AND UH HE MAKES A VERY UH PASSIONATE GOOD ARGUMENT FOR WHY YOU DO NT WANT SOME THINGS DECIDED BY DEMOCRATIC PROCESS BECAUSE ANYTIME YOU HAVE A MAJORITY UM THEY CAN CHANGE THE LAW IN A DEMOC A FULLY DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND THERE ARE CASES WHEN YOU DO NT WANT THAT TO BE THE CASE .
UM OH YOU KNOW A CANDI IF THERE S SOME MINORITY THAT PEOPLE DO NT LIKE BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW RACIAL HATRED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THE MAJORITY CAN JUST SIMPLY VOTE AGAIN VOTE AGAINST THEM .
RIGHT .
AND CASES LIKE THAT HE ARGUES NEED TO BE CONSTRAINED AND AND ACTUALLY I AGREE EXCEPT THAT I DO NT TRUST THE PEOPLE .
WHO ARE APPOINTED TO VOTE .
SOMETIMES I THINK WE HAVE THAT RIGHT NOW WITH CONGRESS .
YEAH WELL I I MEAN I FEEL THAT I FEEL THAT WA .
I THINK THEY RE LOOKING AFTER THEIR OWN SELF PRESERVATION MORE THAN THEY RE ACTUALLY LOOKING AFTER THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY .
YEAH WELL THEIR JOB IS TO BE REELECTED BY IN LARGE AND SO THEY WORK ON THAT JOB .
AND THERE S ALSO AN ANTIGOVERNMENT MOOD IN THE COUNTRY YOU KNOW WHERE GOVERNMENT IS MISSPENDING YOUR DOLLARS AND AND THEY RE ALL FOOLS AND YOU KNOW THROW THROW THE BASTARDS OUT THAT KIND OF THING .
RIGHT .
AND THERE S A NOTION THAT SOMEHOW IF SOMEONE IS NT AS MUCH AS A GOVERNMENT PERSON THEY RE LESS CORRUPT AND THEY RE MORE LIKELY TO BE GOOD WHICH IS REALLY STRANGE BECAUSE I MEAN IF I M HIRING A PLUMBER I WANT A REAL PLUMBER I WANT SOMEONE TRAINED IN .
SO .
OKAY DO YOU REC EXERCISE REGULARLY .
YEAH I SURE DO .
WHAT DO YOU DO .
UH I RIDE A BICYCLE QUITE A BIT AND UH WORK OUT WITH FREE WEIGHTS .

OKAY I UH I HAVE FIVE CHILDREN ALL TOGETHER .
OH UHHUH .
UH MY OLDEST TWO ARE ALREADY OUT AND ABOUT IN THE WORLD AND I UH HAVE A SET OF TWINS THAT ARE FOURTEEN .
OH .
AND UH MY YOUNGEST IS TWELVE .
THAT S GREAT I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT D BE GREAT TO HAVE TWINS .
UH YEAH IF YOU LIKE DOING EVERYTHING TWICE .
WELL YEAH .
UH AT ANY RATE UM MY FIRST TWO CHILDREN UH I DID NT SPEND A WHOLE LOT OF TIME WITH THEM .
UHHUH .
UM AND YOU KNOW WAS A A PROBLEM WITH HAVING FIVE CHILDREN NEEDING TO WORK A UH A FULLTIME JOB THAT .
UHHUH .
WAS MORE THAN A FULLTIME JOB I .
UHHUH .
WORKED ABOUT FIFTYONE HOURS A WEEK BECAUSE I WORKED EVERY WORKED ELEVEN HOURS EVERY SUNDAY .
UHHUH .
AND UH SO I DID NT GET TO SPEND AS MUCH TIME WITH THEM AS I AS I SHOULD HAVE AS I REALLY WANTED TO .
YOUR FIRST ONES YOU MEAN IT .
YEAH THE .
WAS THIS WAY .
YEAH THE F WELL IT WAS WITH ALL OF THEM .
UHHUH .
BUT IT WAS UH MORE AN IMPACT I THINK ON THE OLDEST TWO .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE UM OH ABOUT THE TIME I GOT OUT OF WORKING THAT LONG HOURS WAS WHEN THE UH WHEN THE TWINS WERE ABOUT THREE YEARS OLD AND UH THEY NEVER YOU KNOW I DO NT THINK THEY NOTICED I WAS NT AROUND THAT MUCH .
OH .
YOU KNOW WITH ALL THE CHILDREN AROUND THE HOUSE IT S .
RIGHT .
KIND OF HARD TO NOTICE THAT DAD IS NT AROUND .
VERY MUCH UM SO WHAT I VE TRIED TO DO UH NOW THAT I VE UH FI WENT BACK TO SCHOOL AND GOT MY DEGREE WHEN I WAS THIRTY YEARS OLD .
UHHUH .
AND UH SO THEN I CAME OUT AND WAS MAKING AS MUCH MONEY FORTY HOURS A WEEK AS I DID FIFTYONE HOURS .
UHHUH .
A WEEK SO I VE TRIED TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH UH THE CHILDREN SINCE THEN .
UHHUH .
UM WHAT I M CURRENTLY DOING IS UH TAKING A LOT OF TIME I M HELPING THE KIDS MORE WITH THEIR HOMEWORK IN THE EVENINGS UM WE JUST STARTED A THING WHERE EVERY OTHER WEEK WE GO TO UH MOVIES THERE S A MOVIE THEATER THAT OFFERS DOLLAR MOVIES ON WEDNESDAY NIGHTS .
UHHUH .
AND SO EVERY COUPLE OF WEEKS WE WILL GO TO THE MOVIES BECAUSE THAT S HOW OFTEN THEY CHANGE THE .
UHHUH .
MOVIES AND IT S WORKING OUT PRETTY WELL UM WE RE SPENDING MORE TIME TOGETHER I FEEL LIKE I M A LOT CLOSER TO THE THREE THAT ARE STILL LIVING AT HOME THAN I EVER WAS TO THE TWO THAT WERE LIVING THERE BEFORE .
UHHUH .
UM IN FACT I FOUND THAT I M A LOT CLOSER WITH UH I HAVE ONE SON WHO S GONE AND I DO NT EVEN KNOW WHERE HE S AT .
HUH .
UM HE S TAKEN OFF FOR PARTS UNKNOWN .
THAT S DIFFICULT .
BUT UH YEAH .
YEAH .
A AND UH MY DAUGHTER IS UM HAS MOVED OUT OF THE HOUSE HER AND I GET ALONG A LOT BETTER NOW THAT SHE S MOVED OUT OF THE HOUSE .
UHHUH IT HAPPENS THAT WAY .
AND UH SO IT S IT S IT S IT S BEEN DIFFICULT TO TRY TO FIND THE TIME AND I THINK IT S IMPORTANT THAT WE DO BECAUSE UH I NOTICE THAT UH WHEN I HAD SPENT TWO YEARS DOWN IN DALLAS DOWN THERE THEY ALL HAVE A UH A ME KIND OF ATTITUDE .
UHHUH .
AND I NOTICED PARENTS NOT SPENDING TIME WITH THEIR .
UHHUH .
CHILDREN AND AND GOING OUT AND DOING THINGS AND YOU KNOW I KNEW LIKE THE KIDS NEXT DOOR WERE ALL INTO COCAINE AND .
UM UHHUH .
YOU KNOW IT JUST YOU KNOW I SAW THE FAMILY FALLING APART DOWN .
TEXAS IS .
THERE .
MUCH WORST FOR THE DRUGS I MEAN IT WAS BAD ENOUGH EVERY PLACE ELSE BUT DRUGS IS IN TEXAS ARE EXTREMELY BAD .
YEAH AND SO I THINK IT S KIND OF IMPORTANT THAT I THAT I YOU KNOW NURTURE THE RELATIONSHIP I HAVE WITH MY CHILDREN NOW .
UHHUH .
AND I M DOING MY BEST .
UHHUH .
TO KEEP THAT UP .
WELL THAT S ALL YOU CAN DO .
YEAH WHAT S YOUR BEEN YOUR EXPERIENCE .
WELL I I WAS GOING TO ASK TOO DOES YOUR WIFE WORK .
UM SHE DID NT UP UNTIL THE LAST OH SIX MONTHS .
UHHUH .
UM .
SHE JUST RECENTLY STARTED WORKING THEN .
SHE JUST RECENTLY .
UHHUH .
STARTED WORKING UH SHE WORKED A JOB UNTIL WE MOVED TO OUR NEW HOUSE AND UH SHE QUIT THAT JOB BECAUSE IT WAS TOO INCONVENIENT AND .
UHHUH .
UH SHE STARTS A NEW JOB TOMORROW WHICH SHOULD TAKE HER OUT OF THE HOUSE ABOUT FOUR DAYS A WEEK .
OH UHHUH UHHUH SO THAT SOUNDS GREAT WELL UH WE ALSO HAVE FIVE CHILDREN .
HUH .
AND BUT OURS ARE ALL OUT OF THE NEST .
SO UH AS WHEN THEY WERE GROWING UP I PROBABLY WE HAD A LOT OF SIMILAR THINGS L LIKE YOU HAD YOU KNOW HAVING THE TIME WHEN YOU HAVE YOUNGER ONES TO TAKE CARE OF YOU MAYBE SOMETIMES DO NOT TAKE AS MUCH TIME FOR THE OLDER ONES .
YEAH .
BUT UH WE WERE WE RE VERY ACTIVE OF COURSE AT CHURCH AND UH BOY SCOUTING AND GIRL SCOUTS FOUR H UH AND THOSE ACTIVITIES HELPED A LOT IN .
UHHUH .
GIVING US THINGS TO DO WITH THE CHILDREN AND UH WE TRY TO TAKE A VACATION WITH THEM EVERY YEAR CAMPING OF SOME SORT SOMETHING THAT WAS NT EXPENSIVE AND UH OUR YOUNGEST IS UH EXPECTING HER FIRST BABY SO THEY RE THEY RE ALL OUT AND ON THEIR OWN THEY RE AND WE HAVE ONE TO GET MARRIED YET AND THEY LL ALL BE MARRIED UH AND THEY RE THEY RE ALL DOING PRETTY GOOD THEY UH T LIVES IN PITTSBURGH YOU PROBABLY DO NT KNOW WHERE THAT IS .
CERTAINLY DO .
OKAY TWO OF OUR CHILDREN LIVE THERE UH ONE I LIKE I SAID LIVES NEAR MARYL IN IN AROUND MARYLAND D C HE WORKS RIGHT ON THE BORDER OF D C .
UHHUH .
AND ONE LIVES IN CONNECTICUT AND OUR BABY LIVES JUST A MILE OVER THE HILL .
SO WE LL GET TO SEE HER A LITTLE MORE THAN UH WHAT WE DO THE OTHER ONES .
YEAH THAT SOUNDS GREAT I VE I VE NOTICED UH ANOTHER THING UM WHEN I WAS YOUNGER MY FATHER WAS ALWAYS WORKING .
UHHUH WELL .
AND .
THEY HAVE TO .
YEAH .
YEAH .
AND UH YOU KNOW HE UH HE WORKED A FULLTIME JOB AND A PARTTIME JOB .
UHHUH .
AND I NEVER SAW HIM .
UHHUH .
SO I DID NT HAVE MUCH OF A ROLE MODEL TO GO BY .
TO GO TO FOLLOW .
YOU .
UHHUH .
KNOW TO LEARN HOW TO BE A A FATHER AND .
UHHUH .
A PARENT AND THAT KIND OF THING BECAUSE .
YEAH .
I I CA NT EVER REMEMBER PLAYING BALL WITH MY DAD OR .
UHHUH .
CATCH WITH MY DAD OR DOING ANYTHING WITH MY DAD .
AND THAT DOES MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE .
YEAH AND IT IF YOU DO NT HAVE I DO NT I IT S MY FEELING THAT IF YOU DO NT HAVE A ROLE MODEL TO FOLLOW .
UHHUH .
THEN IT S KIND OF TOUGH .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW EVERYBODY S NOT FATHER KNOWS BEST .
UHHUH .
YEAH .
THAT S .
BUT .
THAT S WELL NONE OF US ARE LET S FACE IT .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW WE RE NOT NONE OF US LIKE THEY PRO PORTRAY IT ON THOSE SHOWS I MEAN .
YEAH .
LIFE S MUCH MORE DIFFICULT THAN THAT .
YEAH I .
AND UH .
MEAN THE THE THE CAPABILITY TO UH CREATE CHILDREN DOES NT NECESSARILY MEAN YOU HAVE THE UH THE MENTAL CAPACITY TO RAISE THEM .
RIGHT RIGHT .
AND .
NOW OUR DAUGHTER OUR WELL SHE S OUR SECOND OLDEST SHE HAS SHE S THE ONLY THAT OTHER ONE THAT HAS CHILDREN SHE HAS TWO BOYS AND SHE WORKS FULL TIME AND I HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT THAT SHE S ABLE TO DO THAT AND I DO NT KNOW IF SHE D BE HAPPY TO STAY AT HOME BUT YET ON THE OTHER HAND I I VE GOT THE MIXED FEELINGS THAT I THINK YOU SHOULD BE AT HOME WITH YOUR CHILDREN I M KIND OF OLD FASHIONED I GUESS THAT WAY .
YES .
BUT THEY SEEM TO THEY SEEM TO GIVE UH QUALITY TIME TO THOSE CHILDREN WHEN THEY ARE TOGETHER AND AND SO IT SEEMS IT SEEMS FOR THEM THAT IT WORKS OUT ALL RIGHT SO I DO NT KNOW I I DO NT THINK I EVER WOULD HAVE HAD WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO WORK FULL TIME AND RAISE A FAMILY SO .

OH I SEE .
BUT IT KIND OF CONFUSES PEOPLE BUT UH UH I ENJOY UH UH A LOT OF DIFFERENT COMEDIES UM I THINK IT S MAINLY FOR AN ESCAPE UM YOU KNOW YOU UH MY JOB IS NOT THE MOST THRILLING IN THE WORLD AND UH I ENJOY LAUGHING AND UH SOME OF THE SHOWS THAT UH ARE ON THE AIR SOME ARE JUST PURELY YOU KNOW BRAIN DRAINERS .
UHHUH .
AND THEN THERE S OTHER ONES THAT UH DEAL WITH UH IN A FUNNY MANNER UH SOCIALLY RELEVANT THINGS AND UH ONE SHOW THAT COMES TO MIND IS LIKE DESIGNING WOMEN UH .

YEAH WE VE BEEN DOING THAT TOO WE RE TRYING TO RETIRE IN OUR FIFTIES .
YEAH THIS IS A VERY APPROPRIATE TOPIC FOR OUR UH CONVERSATION TODAY BECAUSE WHAT I M FIGURING OUT IS THAT I M GOING TO HAVE TO PUT IN A LOT MORE MONEY THAN WHAT I M MAKING .
GOOD LUCK ON THAT ONE THEN .
WHAT IS THAT .
I SAID GOOD LUCK ON THAT ONE THEN .
WELL WE VE GOT A PRETTY GOOD SITUATION MY WIFE AND I SINCE OUR PROPERTY IS ALREADY PAID FOR YOU KNOW THE MAIN THINGS THAT I LIKE ABOUT THE UH THE JOB BENEFITS .
HUHUH .
WOULD BE THE UH THE AVAILABILITY OF THE HEALTH INSURANCE AND THE AVAILABILITY OF UH YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO TRANSFER AROUND INSIDE THE ORGANIZATION WITHOUT HAVING YOU KNOW WHEN THEY CUT OFF A SYSTEM AND THEY DO NT JUST CAN EVERYBODY THAT IS WORKING ON IT LIKE SOME COMPANIES I KNOW OF YOU KNOW THEY GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO EITHER TRANSFER INTO AN ON GOING ON GOING PROJECT .
SO YOU WORK FOR IT T I THEN YOU CA NT SAY .
YEAH .
YEAH .
WHAT .
YES YOU DO WELL I WORK FOR D I S D AND I DO NT KNOW WHAT YOUR TALKING ABOUT WHEN YOU SAY HEALTH INSURANCE BUT DALLAS DOES NT PAY IT PAYS MOST OF MINE YOU KNOW NOW AFTER YOU WORK I THINK FIVE YEARS THEY BEGIN TO PAY MOST OF IT BUT THEN FOR THE THE FAMILY YOU KNOW I PUT MY KIDS ON MY POLICY IT S LIKE TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS .
HUHUH .
AND IT S GONE UP QUITE A BIT AND THEY PREDICT YOU KNOW OF COURSE IT S GOING TO KEEP GOING UP I WISH THEY COULD GO ON AND PAY FOR ALL OF OUR COVERAGE AT SOME POINT AND BENEFITS YOU KNOW I D LIKE TO SEE CHILD CARE PAID FOR OR ONSITE CHILD CARE SOMETIME I THINK THAT WOULD BE A MUMBLEX .
HUHUH .
AND IT WOULD MAKE WOMEN GO TO WORK SOMETIME IF THEY KNEW THEIR KIDS WERE BEING TAKEN CARE OF THEY COULD GO VISIT THEM DURING THE DAY WHAT .
YEAH THAT S UH SOMETHING I HAD NT REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT BECAUSE WE DO NT HAVE CHILDREN BUT I CAN SEE HOW IT WOULD BE A A REAL BENEFIT YES I DO .
WELL WE KEEP A SHELTER ALSO MONIES THAT WE RE GOING TO PAY IN FOR CHILD CARE TOO YOU KNOW GO ON AND PAY A LUMP SUM AND AS LONG AS YOU PAY THAT AMOUNT YOU RE OKAY BUT IF YOU PAID IN MORE THAN YOU ACTUALLY USED AND THE SAME THING FOR INSURANCE WHAT YOU PREDICT YOUR GOING TO BE PAYING FOR INSURANCE AS LONG AS YOU PAY ACTUALLY PAY OUT THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU RE OKAY BUT IF YOU PAY OUT LESS THEN YOU LOSE THAT MONEY .
UM .
I DO NT LIKE THAT PART BUT YOU DO NT HAVE TO DO THAT OPTION IF YOU DO NT WANT TO .
WELL THAT COULD BE I COULD SEE WHERE THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT .
AND THEN WE GOT THAT CAFETERIA PLAN DO YOU HAVE THAT .
NO .
NO .
I DO NT KNOW WHAT IT S ABOUT .
YOU CAN UH WELL YOU LET S SEE IT IT SHELTERS YOU RE MONEY THAT YOU PAY FOR FOR INSURANCE IT TAKES IT OUT OF YOUR SALARY BEFORE TAXES .
OH OKAY YEAH YEAH WE GOT THAT .
OKAY .
PRETAX INSURANCE .
YEAH .
YEAH .
BUT WE CALL IT THE CAFETERIA PLAN I WONDER WHY .
UM .
I SAID I WONDER WHY .
OH IT S PROBABLY WHAT THE FIRST GUY WHO DID IT CALLED IT .
CAFETERIA .
YEAH HE WAS PROBABLY IN THE CAFETERIA WHEN HE THOUGHT OF IT .
MAYBE SO LET S SEE WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO CHANGES .
I LL TELL YOU WHAT WE COULD DO .
WHAT .
WE COULD PROHIBIT PEOPLE FROM BEING HIRED THAT ARE HISTORICALLY GOING TO COST THE COMPANY MONEY YOU KNOW DO A LITTLE BIT BETTER RESEARCH ON WHO GETS HIRED .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE YOU KNOW .
YOU MEAN LIKE FOR HEALTH INSURANCE .
WELL NOT ONLY JUST HEALTH INSURANCE I MEAN FOR THE WHOLE BENEFIT OF THE COMPANY SEE I LOOK AT IT THIS WAY IF THE COMPANY FOLDS I GOT TO GO FIND A JOB .
YEAH .
OKAY NOW IF WE GOT SOMEBODY IN A POSITION TO AFFECT THE WAY THE COMPANY PERFORMS JUST ABOUT ANYBODY IN THE COMPANY AND THEY RE NOT DOING THEIR JOB OR THEY RE NOT CAPABLE OF DOING THEIR JOB THEN WE SHOULD FIND A A PLACE TO PUT THEM OR B YOU KNOW BOOT THEM OUT .
WELL THAT S EASIER DONE IN A COMPANY THAN IT IS IN UH SCHOOL TEACHING .
WELL FRANKLY I THINK SCHOOL TEACHERS OUGHT TO GET ABOUT TEN TIMES WHAT THEY RE GETTING PAID .
THANK YOU .
WHAT .
I SAID THANK YOU .
OH .
WE RE BOTH SCHOOL TEACHERS .
OH I M I M .
BUT IT S HARD TO GET RID OF A TEACHER IF THEY RE NOT GOOD .
I KNOW .
IT S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE .
WELL THERE S TWO SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT ON THAT YOU KNOW I I M LOOKING AT TRYING TO GET INTO A UNIVERSITY JOB POSITION AS A A PROFESSOR .
HUHUH .
I GOT ABOUT EIGHT YEARS OF EDUCATION AHEAD OF ME BEFORE I CAN DO THAT .
UM .
BUT ONCE YOU GET THAT JOB WITH THE UNIVERSITY YOU VE GOT TEN YEARS OF PROBATION .
HUHUH .
THEN YOU HAVE TENURE AND THEY CA NT FIRE YOU .
HUHUH .
WELL YOU KNOW IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT I DO NT KNOW IF THAT S GOOD OR BAD I DO KNOW THAT I VE HAD TENURED PROFESSORS THAT WERE JUST SORRY .
RIGHT .
AND I VE ALSO HAD TENURED PROFESSORS THAT WERE THE BEST THINGS ON TWO LEGS .
WELL THEY DID AWAY WITH TENURE IN TEACHING ALONG TIME AGO YOU KNOW IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS .
BUT IN ADDITION .
IT MAKES YOU MORE AT EASE YOU KNOW YOU KNEW YOU WERE NT GOING TO LOSE YOUR JOB UNLESS YOU REALLY DID SOMETHING HORRENDOUS .
WELL THEY THEY REALLY CA NT FIRE YOU WITHOUT CAUSE YOU KNOW THE GOVERNMENTS TAKEN CARE OF THAT BUT UM WHAT I M LOOKING AT IS YOU KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF TEACHERS THAT ARE NT GETTING PAID WHAT THEY NEED TO BE GETTING PAID AND THERE ARE SOME TEACHERS OUT THERE THAT ARE NT WORTH HAVING AROUND AS JANITORS .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW AND I COULD SEE A POINT PROTECTING SOMEONE S POSITION BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I DO NT THINK IT YOU KNOW THAT SOMEONE THAT TEACHES UH SAY SHOP FOR INSTANCE SHOULD HAVE TO HAVE DEGREE AT ALL .
WELL THEY DO NT .
WELL .
IN SOME PLACES THEY DO NT .
IN SOME PLACES THAT DO NT .
DO THEY .
BUT YOU KNOW YOU YOU GET SPECIALIZED EDUCATION NOW FOR INSTANCE TAKE COMPUTER SCIENCE WE VE GOT KIDS TWENTY YEARS OLD RIGHT NOW THAT COULD BEAT ANY COMPUTER PROFESSOR AT MICRO COMPUTER APPLICATIONS I KNOW WE COULD AND THESE PEOPLE CA NT EVEN GET JOBS DOING ANYTHING BESIDES DIGGING DITCHES BECAUSE THERE S NO COMPREHENSIVE TEST THAT THEY CAN TAKE THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO TO STEP INTO THAT POSITION WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH THE RIGAMAROLE OF COLLEGE .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW I WENT TO COLLEGE LATE ON IN LIFE AND I REALIZE THAT HEY IT S NOTHING BUT FOUR YEARS OF ENDURANCE AND YOU MIGHT BE TEACHABLE YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN .
YEAH .
I MEAN MY AGREE IS ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS .
IT S MY EXPERIENCE AND AND MY KNOWLEDGE THAT THAT IS BENEFICIAL BUT THEN YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID I CAME IN BACKWARDS .
WHAT DID YOU GET YOUR DEGREE AT .
INDUSTRIAL MARKETING .
AND WHAT S YOUR JOB NOW .
WELL ACTUALLY I M SELLING COMPUTER SOFTWARE BUT THE TWO ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE BECAUSE THE THE EXPERIENCE THAT GOT ME THE JOB THAT I GOT NOW WAS MY EXPERIENCE IN THE CONSTRUCTION FIELD PRIOR TO GOING TO COLLEGE .
HUHUH .
NOT MY DEGREE WHICH IS I THINK KIND OF BIZARRE .
MAYBE ALL RIGHT WHAT ELSE COULD WE CHANGE OH I D LIKE TO SEE FLEXIBLE HOURS AND TEACHING .
WELL UH .
SHARED JOB SHARING .
WE VE .
MORE OF THAT .
WE VE WE VE ALREADY GOT THAT .
WELL SEE WE VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF IT BUT NOT MUCH IT WOULD BE NICE IF YOU HAD FULL INSURANCE COVERAGE IF YOU WERE DOING JOB SHARING WHAT ELSE I D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO TO EVALUATE YOUR BOSS AND IT REALLY CARRY SOME WEIGHT AND YOU GET TO CHOOSE YOUR BOSS .
WELL YEAH SUPERVISOR EVALUATIONS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A TOUGH ONE ESPECIALLY IN MY LINE BECAUSE YOU KNOW MY SUPERVISOR HAS NOTHING TO WITH MY JOB EXCEPT TO MAKE SURE I GET MY CHECK .
HUHUH .
WELL SO YOU GET TO EVALUATE HIM THOUGH .
WELL NOT REALLY YOU KNOW I MEAN THERE S WHAT S TO EVALUATE ABOUT HIM YOU KNOW I MEAN MY MY SUPERVISOR LEVEL IS LIKE PRACTICALLY ZERO I RUN THE WHOLE SHOW AND WHEN I NEED SOMETHING I TELL MY BOSS AND HE GETS IT FOR ME BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT I KNOW WHAT I M DOING .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW AND UH THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK NEEDS TO BE EXPANDED ON SPECIALLY IN THE LARGE MARKET PLACE YOU KNOW THE MAJOR CORPORATION BECAUSE SO OFTEN YOU KNOW YOU GET A GUY WHO S GOT EIGHT OR NINE OR TEN PEOPLE WORKING FOR HIM IN SEPARATE AREAS .
YEAH .
SO TO SPEAK YOU KNOW IT S IT S HARD FOR ME TO YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY SINCE I M IN MARKETING SALES YOU KNOW I MAKE MORE THAN MY BOSS BECAUSE HE S SALARY AND I M NOT I MAKE AS MUCH AS I EARN YOU KNOW IF I DO NT MAKE A SALE I DO NT MAKE ANYTHING .
HUHUH .
YEAH WELL IT S TOUGH BUT UH YOU KNOW THERE ARE REQUIREMENTS AND QUOTAS WHAT NOT FOR ME TO MAKE BUT UM THE BOTTOM LINE ON ON THAT KIND OF THING IS YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE ESPECIALLY IN MAJOR CORPORATIONS WHO ARE NT DOING A DAMN THING THEY RE JUST THERE YOU KNOW THE WORK THEY DO COULD BE TOTALLY ELIMINATED AND NOT THAT THEY ARE NT WORTH OR NOT THAT THEY ARE NT TRYING OR ANYTHING BUT IT S JUST THAT THEIR JOBS ARE USELESS TAKE FOR INSTANCE UM A LARGE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY I USED TO WORK FOR ED SWAMPERS SWAMPERS IS A GUY WHO S IN THE UNION HE S A LABORER AND HE S ASSIGNED TO .
PERHAPS THIS CONNECTION NO IT STILL ECHOES .
OKAY UM .
DO YOU LIKE TO COOK .
I LOVE IT .

WELL RIGHT NOW THE PLACE WHERE I M LIVING THE YARD WAS BASICALLY NEGLECTED FOR ABOUT THE LAST TWENTYFIVE YEARS SO I VE BEEN TRYING TO REBUILD AND REESTABLISH THE ENTIRE LAWN AND AFTER THREE YEARS OF WORKING AT IT I VE I VE BEEN AMAZED AT JUST WHAT .
A LITTLE BIT OF DOING HELP OUT THINGS TO THE LAWN HAS REALLY BROUGHT IT BACK .
INSTEAD OF MOWING IN THE SAME DIRECTION .
EVERY TIME CHANGING ONE DAY .
YOU LL OR ONE TIME .
YOU LL CUT IT CUT THE LAWN .
THE LONG WAY THEN YOU LL GO THE OPPOSITE WAY INSTEAD OF GOING LENGTHWAYS YOU GO WIDTH AND IT HELPS THE GRASS COME BACK .
OH DOES IT REALLY .
I DID NT KNOW THAT .
DID UM YOU VE BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR THREE YEARS .
THR F FOR THREE YEARS .
REALLY .
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE .
KILLING LOTS OF FIRE ANTS .
I WAS FIRMLY CONVINCED THE ENTIRE .
FRONT YARD WAS NOTHING BUT ONE .
GIGANTIC ANT MOUND .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE IT WAS LIKE YOU COULD YOU COULD NT EVEN STAND STILL OUT THERE .
YOU KNOW I CAN BARELY HEAR YOU .
IS THIS BETTER .
YEAH A LITTLE BIT YEAH .
IT WAS LIKE YOU D GO OUT IN THE YARD TO WATER SOMETHING YOU D JUST BE STANDING STILL .
UHHUH .
AND THE ANTS WOULD START CRAWLING UP YOUR LEGS .
IT .
S LIKE I M NOT STANDING IN A MOUND THOUGH .
OH WOW .
HOW DID YOU GET RID OF THEM .
UH DURSBAN TWO .
PARDON .
A CHEMICAL CALLED DURSBAN TWO .

EVEN THE AREA OF THE GRASS .

YEAH .
IT DID NT KILL IT .
REALLY .
WELL THAT S PRETTY WILD .
YEAH WE USED IT FOR FLEAS .
WE HAD FLEAS IN OUR YARD .

WE RE ALMOST THEY WERE SO BAD LAST YEAR EVEN TICKS .

OH YEAH .
IN SOME OF THE BAYS OR UH OR OY FOR OYSTERS .
THAT WOULD BE FUN .
AND UH THAT I WAS ABLE TO DO WHEN I COULD GO IN AND GO DOWN AND ACTUALLY PICK THEM OFF THE BOTTOM .
RIGHT .
HAND PICKED .
THAT RIGHT .
THE WEIRDEST FISHING EXPERIENCE .
I EVER HAD .
PEOPLE TO THIS DAY ARE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF I REALLY CAUGHT WHAT .
I THINK I CAUGHT .
WE WERE IN UH ROCKPORT WHICH IS CLOSE TO CORPUS .
UHHUH .
AND WE HAD BEEN FISHING IN A CANAL THEY HAD ALL THESE CANALS UP THROUGH THIS ONE LITTLE RETIREMENT AREA AND UH WE D BEEN FISHING IN THE CANALS AND ALL .
WE WERE CATCHING WERE CATFISH AND WE WERE PRETTY BORED WITH THAT .
SO WE THOUGHT WELL MAYBE THERE ARE SOME CRAB IN HERE WE LL TRY TO CATCH SOME CRAB .
SO I GOT MY CHICKEN MUMBLEX AND ALL MY LITTLE NET AND EVERYTHING AND SOMETHING I HAD A ROCK TO WEIGHT .
IT DOWN SOMETHING .
GRABS AND JUST RUNS WITH IT .
AND OF COURSE .
THERE S NO HOOK SO IT CA NT BE A FISH .
UHHUH .
I M SURE IT S NOT A FISH RIGHT .
AND CRAB THEY DO NT BITE LIKE THAT THEY DO NT JUST RUN WITH YOUR FOOD .
SO I NETTED IT AND IT WAS THE UGLIEST FISH .
I VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE .
IT HAD REAL TEETH LIKE HUMAN TEETH AND IT LOOKED ARCHAIC .
I I HAD NO IDEA .
WHAT .
IT WAS .
I CALLED MY FATHER LONG DISTANCE JUST TO DESCRIBE THE THING AND IT HAD THE ROCK IN IT .
S MOUTH NOT THE CHICKEN BUT THE ROCK .
ITSELF .
UM .
IS WHAT .
IT HAD GRABBED .
THEY SAY IT S A DOG FISH FROM EVERYTHING .
I VE DESCRIBED IT WAS BROWN WITH THESE LITTLE WHITE DOTS .
UHHUH .
AND IT MADE A LOUD ALMOST A CROAKING NOISE LIKE A CROAKER DOES .
UHHUH .
IT IT WAS THE STRANGEST THING .
OH I LL NEVER GET OVER THAT .
TO THIS DAY .
I DO NT WANT TO GET IN THE WATER .
ANYWHERE AROUND SALT WATER BECAUSE I M SURE ONE OF THOSE FISH ARE THERE .
WELL WE USED TO I GUESS THE WEIRDEST THING .
I VE EVER CAUGHT IS UH IN SOME OF THE INLETS AND THE RIVERS AROUND MUMBLEX DELAWARE .
UHHUH .
THEY HAVE A FISH .
THAT S CALLED AN OYSTER CRACKER .
I DO NT KNOW IF YOU VE EVER HEARD OF IT .
I VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT ONE .
AND IT HAS A HUGE STRONG MOUTH AND THEY ACTUALLY UH USE THEIR TEETH TO OPEN OYSTERS .
THAT S WHERE IT GETS ITS NAME OBVIOUSLY HUH .
UHHUH AND THIS IS THE UGLIEST .
FISH .
I HAVE EVER SEEN AND I MEAN AND THEY COME IN ALL SI YOU KNOW I VE I VE CAUGHT THEM FROM YOU KNOW THREE OR FOUR INCHES LONG .
UHHUH .
UP TO UH I GUESS THE LARGEST ONE .
I EVER CAUGHT WAS PROBABLY EIGHT OR TEN INCHES LONG BUT JUST HUGE UGLY THINGS .
HUH .
JUST TERRIBLE .
CAN YOU EAT THEM .
NO NO .
OOH .
I I DO NT THINK I D WANT TO EVEN IF YOU COULD IF THEY RE THAT UGLY BUT .
THEY JUST THEY JUST LOOK AS THOUGH YOU DO NOT WANT TO DO ANYTHING WITH THEM .
THAT S LIKE THIS DOG FISH IT WAS IT SCARED ME TO DEATH .
UHHUH .
IT WAS U IT REALLY IT DID NT LOOK LIKE IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS SOMETHING OUT OF THE DARK AGES THAT JUST NEVER DIED .
WELL THE FIRST TIME .
I WENT SURF FISHING WAS IN MUMBLEX AND I THREW MY LINE OUT AND THE FIRST THING .
I CAUGHT WAS A SAND SHARK WHICH WAS PROBABLY A FOOT .
AND A HALF OR UH TWO FEET LONG AND SCARED ME TO DEATH .
OH .
I HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING AND THEN I WAS FI FISHED FOR ANOTHER .
HALF HOUR OR FORTYFIVE MINUTES CAUGHT A FEW WHITE FISH AND SO FORTH AND THEN I FELT SOMETHING RELATIVELY HEAVY AND I THOUGHT OH REALLY HERE I M REALLY GOING TO GET ONE .
AND I .
OKAY HAVE YOU EVER SERVED AS A JUROR .
NEVER I VE NEVER BEEN SERVED ON THE JURY NEVER BEEN CALLED UP IN A JURY ALTHOUGH SOME OF MY FRIENDS HAVE BEEN JURORS .
UHHUH I NEVER HAVE EITHER .
YOU HAVE NT HUH IF YOU WERE UH WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF A TRIAL BY YOUR PEERS .
WELL I THINK IT S A GOOD IDEA I THINK OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM NEEDS A MAJOR OVERHAUL AND I M NOT SURE WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO FIX IT BUT I THINK THEY VE GOT A LOT OF PROBLEMS .
I THINK THE MAJOR THING THEY NEED TO CORRECT IS HOW LONG IT TAKES SOMETHING TO GET TO JURY AND TO GET TO TRIAL .
TRUE .
AND I DO NT KNOW IF THAT S JUST A PURE VOLUMES NUMBER OR OR WHAT BUT UH SOMETIMES I THINK THE JURY IS IGNORANT IN THE FACTS OF LAW AND HOW THINGS SHOULD BE DETERMINED AND THEY RE TOO EASILY SWAYED BY THEIR EMOTION .
YEAH I THINK THAT S TRUE .
HENCE IS POSSIBLE ERROR AS YOU CAN SEE IN ALL THE IRONSIDES .
T V SHOWS .
YEAH DO WOULD YOU PREFER ALL TRIALS BY A JUDGE .
NO I THINK THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT UH THE JURY CAN DETERMINE AS FAR AS UH GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY BUT AS FAR AS THE AF AF AFFIXING OF PUNISHMENT AND FINES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE I DO NT KNOW IF THAT IS BEST LEFT UP TO THE JURY TO DE TO AWARD YOU KNOW TWO POINT TWO MILLION DOLLAR KIND OF SETTLEMENT VERSUS A JUDGE KNOWING YOU KNOW IT S TRUE THAT YOU KNOW THIS MAY BE SAD AND ALL THAT THING BUT UH THE JURY I THINK IS BEST IN MOST CASES SUITED FOR DETERMINATION OF GUILT AND INNOCENCE BUT NOT THE AWARD OF OF PENALTIES AND FINES AND PUNISHMENT .
YEAH I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT I THINK YOU RE RIGH I THINK THEY SOMETIMES GET CARRIED AWAY BY THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND MAKE HUGE SETTLEMENTS THINKING WELL IT S ONLY GOING TO COST THE INSURANCE COMPANY AND .
UHHUH THAT S TRUE BUT UH I DO LIKE THE IDEA OF THE JURY BEING THE THE PEOPLE WHO DECIDE IN THE MATTER OF UH IF IT S A JAIL TERM VERSUS LIFE AND DEATH .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THE DEATH PENALTY AND SUCH .
IF THEY GIVE THEM ALL THE INFORMATION I DO NT KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO SENTENCING PHASE I GUESS THEY TELL THEM IF A GUY IF THE PERSON HAS A PREVIOUS RECORD AND STUFF .
UHHUH .
SOMETIMES IT SEEMS LIKE DURING THE TRIAL PART THE JURY S NOT YOU KNOW MISSES SOME OF THE BEST EVIDENCE BECAUSE THEY MAKE THEM LEAVE AND .
RIGHT .
THE JUDGE DECIDES WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD HEAR IT .
YEAH UH IT IT IT S KIND OF DIFFICULT AND I GUESS THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS SET UP TO RATHER LET UH SOME GUILTY PEOPLE GO FREE THAN TO PUT AN INNOCENT PERSON IN IN JAIL .
RIGHT .
ALTHOUGH YOU STILL HEAR ABOUT THOSE OCCASIONALLY .
YEAH DO YOU THINK THE VERDICT SHOULD BE COMPLETELY UNANIMOUS BY THE JURY .
UM I DO NT KNOW I YOU KNOW I HEARD A VERY INTERESTING AND MAYBE IT S JUST THE T V SHOW OR MOVIE I WAS WATCHING THEY WERE GOING THROUGH A TRIAL AND I THINK IT WAS LIKE ON ONE OF THE THE DOCUMENTARY T V SHOWS WHERE THEY ASK FOR THE THE VERDICT BY THE JURY .
UHHUH .
AND THEY WENT BY EACH ONE SAYING GUILTY OR INNOCENT GUILTY OR INNOCENT .
UHHUH .
AND THEY TOOK IT MORE AS JUST LIKE A MAJORITY .
OH .
SO I I .
SOME OF THEM DISAGREE I MEAN SOME OF THEM SAID ONE WAY AND SOME THE OTHER .
EXACTLY BUT THEY TOOK YOU KNOW WHATEVER THE MAJORITY WAS SO I DID NT KNOW IF THAT WAS JUST SOMETHING FOR DRAMA OR THAT S TRULY THE WAY IT IS I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT HAD TO BE UNANIMOUS .
I THINK IT DOES HAVE TO BE UNANIMOUS .
BUT UH RATHER INTERESTING .
I KNOW THEY CAN POLL A JURY MAKE SURE EVERYBODY AGREES WITH WHAT THEY SAID THE VERDICT WAS BUT I THOUGHT THAT THEY ALL HAD TO AGREE OR ELSE THEY IT WAS A HUNG JURY .
UHHUH .
AND .
I DID I DID ALSO .
YEAH I THI I DO NT KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT THAT I THINK MAYBE UH MAJORITY MIGHT BE SUFFICIENT .
UHHUH .
IT S HARD TO SAY THOUGH .
WHAT ABOUT IN INTERNATIONAL TRIALS DO YOU THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE A JURY THERE .
OH .
I THINK THAT WOULD BE KIND OF INTERESTING .
YEAH I HAD NT THOUGHT ABOUT INTERNATIONAL TRIALS AT ALL .
I GUESS THE THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THERE S NO TRUE AUTHORITY IN ANY KIND OF INTERNATIONAL VERDICTS .
RIGHT .
LIKE YOU KNOW THE OLD DAY WITH THE RACK WE THEY RE GOING TO SAY OKAY YOU RE GUILTY AND YOU HAVE TO PAY KUWAIT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS WELL WHOSE GOING TO REALLY MAKE THEM .
YEAH .
NOBODY .
YEAH .
SO BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE KIND OF INTERESTING TO INCORPORATE THAT CONCEPT OF YOU KNOW PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES UH IN AS INTERNATIONAL LAW ALSO .
YEAH I THINK MAYBE THEY D NEED TO BE MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE THOUGH THAN JUST YOUR AVERAGE JOE OFF THE STREET .
UHHUH .
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE OF THE CULTURAL DIFFERENCES .
RIGHT .
THINGS LIKE THAT .
I DO NT KNOW HOW WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO BE COME UP WITH A TRUE PERFECT SYSTEM OR IF ONE EXISTS BUT .
YEAH WHAT ABOUT UNIFORM SENTENCING .
UH IS THAT THE CRIME AND IT S ALREADY MUMBLEX SOME CHART AND DETERMINE THE PUNISHMENT OR .
RIGHT YEAH LIKE IF YOU RE CONVICTED OF A CERTAIN CRIME YOU AUTOMATICALLY GET SO MANY YEARS IT S NOT A DISCRETIONARY THING .
UHHUH I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A CORE MINIMUM THAT THEY GET .
UHHUH .
BUT UH I GUESS THERE SHOULD BE SOME FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE EVERY SITUATION MAY BE UNIQUE THAT THE JUDGE CAN EITHER INCREASE THAT OR KEEP IT JUST AT ITS MINIMUM THINGS OF THAT NATURE BUT .
YEAH I WISH THAT WHEN THEY SENTENCE SOMEONE IF THEY RE GOING TO SENTENCE HIM TO FIVE YEARS THEN MAKE HIM SERVE FIVE YEARS .
YEAH THAT SERVES A KIND OF IF THEY RE I GUESS UH IF YOU SENTENCE SOMEONE TO LIFE LIFE IS ONLY FORTYNINE YEARS SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
YEAH I .
AND I GUESS YOU RE ELIGIBLE AFTER TWENTYSEVEN FOR PAROLE EVEN THOUGH YOU RE IN FOR LIFE .
YEAH AND SOMETIMES THOSE PEOPLE ARE ARE YOUNG ENOUGH THEY CAN STILL GET OUT AND CAUSE A LOT OF TROUBLE .
YEAH ALTHOUGH I GUESS IT S YOU YOU WANT THEM TO REHABILITATE AND BECOME BETTER RATHER THAN SITTING IN THERE AND BEING A DRAIN ALL THE TIME .
YEAH I DO NT BELIEVE THAT VERY OFTEN HAPPENS .
NO BECAUSE UH INSIDE THE JAIL THERE I DO NT THINK THERE S NO REAL REHABILITATION .
I DO NT THINK SO EITHER IN FACT I THINK THEY END UP WORSE BECAUSE THE CONDITIONS ARE SO BAD .
YEAH IT S ANOTHER WAR ZONE .
YEAH .
BUT WHO KNOWS .
I THINK I THINK MAYBE THEY OUGHT TO JUST BE PUNISHED WITH SOME SOME KIND OF REAL PUNISHMENT LIKE HARD LABOR FOR A SHORTER LENGTH OF TIME YOU KNOW .
I AGREE GET THEM OUT THERE .
ACTUALLY MAKE THEM DO SOMETHING THAT S NOT PLEASANT AND DO IT AND GET IT OVER WITH AND GET BACK IN THE YOU KNOW WORLD AND NOT SPEND SO MUCH TIME SITTING AROUND LETTING THE BAD INFLUENCES OF THE OTHER ONES RUB OFF ON THEM AND .
SURE THEY SHOULD HAVE THEM GO OUT AND DOING STUFF .
YEAH .
CLEANING UP OR PICKING UP DIRT OR WEEDS OR WHO KNOWS WHAT SOMETHING FOR THE FOR THE STATE SINCE THE STATE IS PAYING FOR THEM THEY SHOULD GET SOME KIND OF KIND OF WORK OUT OF THEM .
YEAH SOMETHING BESIDES LICENSE PLATES AND TIDDLYWINKS .
EXACTLY .
YEAH .
TRADING THEIR LIVES FOR CIGARETTES .
YEAH .
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS WELL GOOD .
WELL I THINK THAT COVERS IT .
I THINK SO .
NICE TALKING TO YOU .
NICE TALKING TO YOU ALSO .
BYE .
HAVE A WONDERFUL EASTER .

YEAH .
BUT UM SOMETHING THAT STILL HAS A LOTS OF AMENITIES AND YOU KNOW GADGETS AND THINGS .
OH YOU DO WANT A LOT OF THAT STUFF .
YEAH WELL YEAH I LIKE I LIKE SOME OF THOSE THINGS THEY COME IN REALLY HANDY .
WHAT KIND OF UH THINGS ARE YOU GOING TO CONSIDER YOU KNOW WHAT UH YOU SAID SOMETHING ABOUT THE ABOUT THE WELL WHAT DO YOU CALL THEM YOU SAID AMENITIES .
AMENITIES .
THAT THEY HAVE BUT WHAT ABOUT UM THEIR REPUTATION OF THE COMPANY OR THE PRICE .
YEAH WELL OF COURSE I GUESS UH PRICE IS ALWAYS THE BIG CONSIDERATION BUT .
IT IS FOR ME OTHER PEOPLE .
YEAH .
DO NT SEEM TO HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM .
WELL THAT S THAT S A BIG ONE IN MY BOOK .
YEAH .
BUT UH UM I HAVE PREFERENCES FOR UH FOR SOME UH MAKERS OVER OTHERS UM AND I WOULD SORT OF LIKE TO BUY AMERICAN .
YEAH .
BUT YOU KNOW I M NOT SO TOTALLY HUNG UP ON THAT THAT I WOULD NT BUY SOMETHING ELSE HOW ABOUT YOU .
WELL UM THE LAST CAR WE BOUGHT WAS AMERICAN BECAUSE OF BECAUSE OF THAT REASON BUT HAVE NOT BEEN ENTIRELY HAPPY WITH UH SEVERAL THINGS ABOUT THE CAR IT DOES NT SEEM LIKE THE QUALITY IS QUITE AS HIGH AS I EXPECTED IT TO BE .
OH REALLY .
BECAUSE SEVERAL THINGS MINOR THINGS SORT OF BUT STILL THEY COST US MONEY UM THAT WE DID NT FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD HAVE HAD TO PAY ON A CAR THAT THAT WAS THAT NEW .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW WE BOUGHT THE CAR NEW AND AFTER UM WELL WELL WELL UNDER TWO YEARS WE HAD TO REPLACE THE CLUTCH .
OH .
AND THEY JUST SAID WELL YOU KNOW CLUTCHES ARE DISPOSABLE AND I SAID SINCE WHEN .
YEAH .
BRAKE PADS ARE DISPOSABLE .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT BUT I NEVER THOUGHT A CLUTCH WAS DISPOSABLE .
YEAH I WOULD NT HAVE THOUGHT SO EITHER .
YEAH SO THAT WAS THAT WAS KIND OF A SHOCK .
OH YEAH I I GUESS THERE S A LOT TO TO THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU RE TRYING TO MAKE THAT DECISION .
YEAH YOU KNOW THE LESS ACTUALLY THE LESS YOU SPEND ON A CAR IT SEEMS LIKE LUXURY CARS THEY RE CALLED LUXURY CARS EVEN THOUGH THEY RE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE LIKE LIKE UH UH A MERCEDES BENZ THEY DO NT HAVE THE HISTORY OF BREAKING DOWN OR THINGS LIKE THAT THAT WOULD GO WRONG WOULD DEFINITELY NOT BE CONSIDERED DISPOSABLE .
RIGHT .
YOU WOULD NEVER THINK OF HAVING TO REPLACE THE CLUTCH IN A MERCEDES .
NO BUT THEN .
ESPECIALLY NOT AFTER TWO YEARS .
NO BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I GUESS TOO UH WHENEVER YOU DO HAVE TO HAVE SOME MAJOR WORK DONE ON ONE OF THOSE IT COSTS A FORTUNE .
REALLY OH I DO NT KNOW .
YEAH I VE UH WORKED WITH A COUPLE OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE OWNED UH VARIOUS YEARS UH .
UHHUH .
MERCEDES AND EVEN THOUGH THEY DO A LOT OF THE WORK THEMSELF THEN JUST BUYING THE PARTS AND EVERYTHING IS IS PRETTY EXPENSIVE BUT FOR THEM IT S IT S SORT OF A HOBBY TOO .
YEAH .
TO OWN THEM MUMBLEX .
WHAT KIND OF WHAT BRAND OF CAR ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT BUYING OR LIKE WHAT THINGS ARE YOU LOOKING AT .
WELL I HAVE NT RE REALLY GOTTEN THAT FAR WITH IT UM I VE ALWAYS SORT OF LIKED GENERAL MOTORS .

A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN SOME OF THE OTHERS BUT UH OH I GUESS I REALLY DO NT KNOW .
HOW COME MUMBLEX I VE BEEN KIND OF UM I GUESS THE COMMERCIALS ARE GETTING TO ME THE TOYOTA COMMERCIALS .
YEAH .
AND I KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE I VE I VE KNOWN THAT HAVE HAD TOYOTAS HAVE BEEN JUST EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH THEM THAT HARDLY HAD ANY PROBLEMS AT ALL .
YEAH THAT I THINK THAT S .
I THINK THEY HAVE A REALLY GOOD UH QUALITY .
UHHUH MY UH DAUGHTER HAS OWNED TWO DIFFERENT ONES AND UH YOU KNOW WE VE HAD SOME WORK DONE ON THEM BUT IT S NOT TOO BAD AND THE REASON ONE OF THE REASONS WE UM BOUGHT THE FIRST ONE WAS BECAUSE A FRIEND OF OURS HAD A TOYOTA THAT HE JUST REALLY DROVE FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS AND HE LIVED WAY OUT IN THE COUNTRY SO HE PUT A LOT OF MILES ON IT .
UHHUH .
AND YOU KNEW IT HAD HAD BEEN THROUGH A WHOLE LOT .
UHHUH .
AND YET YOU KNOW IT IT HELD UP PRETTY DOGGONE GOOD SO .

SO I DO NT KNOW I M I M NOT READY TO BUY A NEW CAR YET BUT I DO NT KNOW IF IF THE NEXT TIME I M GOING TO TRY TO TO STAY WITH BUYING SOMETHING AMERICAN OR IF I M GOING TO GO FOR A LITTLE MORE WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER TO BE A LONGTERM INVESTMENT .
YEAH WELL AND I GUESS YOU KNOW YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THINGS LIKE YOUR GAS MILEAGE AND STUFF LIKE THAT YOU KNOW YOU .
OH IT S EASY TO GET GAS MILEAGE IN THIS CAR .

BUT ALONG HERE IT S UH VERY VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE TEXAS TYPE WEATHER .
WHAT S IT LIKE DOWN THERE .
WELL RIGHT NOW WE RE WE RE HAVING THE LITTLE BIT OF SPRING THAT WE HAVE .
OH REALLY WELL AT LEAST YOU VE GOT SOME .
WE DO NT HAVE MANY SEASONS HERE .
IT GOES FROM WINTER TO SUMMER USUALLY .
UHHUH .
SPRING USUALLY CONSISTS OF A LOT OF RAIN .
ESPECIALLY THUNDERSTORMS .
WE VE GOT WE HAD ONE OF THOSE BLOW THROUGH TONIGHT .
OH WELL THAT S GOOD .
AND I THINK WE GOT THE SAME THING IN THE FORECAST FOR THE NEXT TWO OR THREE DAYS .
UHHUH .
SO .
HAVE YALL .
BEEN HAVING ANY HEAT WAVES OR LIKE THE NINETY DEGREE .
IT S GOTTEN UP TO UH NINETY .
A COUPLE OF TIMES .
UHHUH .
BUT BASICALLY IT S BEEN IN THE LOW SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES .
UHHUH .
WOMEN THAT S GOOD .
FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR .
YEAH .
IT S NOT REALLY BEEN TOO BAD .
UHHUH .
USUALLY IT SNEAKS ON INTO THE NINETIES .
A LITTLE EARLIER .
UHHUH .
SO DO YALL HAVE MANY BLUEBONNETS AND STUFF THIS YEAR .
YEAH QUITE A BIT .
OH UHHUH .
WELL THE SEASON IS JUST ABOUT OVER FOR THAT UH IN FACT .
WE DROVE DOWN TO CORPUS LAST WEEK .
UHHUH .
AND UH THERE WERE STILL SOME PAINT BRUSHES AND BLUEBONNETS DOWN ALONG THE WAY .
OH I MISS THAT .
MUMBLEX DROVE THROUGH SAN ANTONIO AND I SPOKE TO SOMEBODY ELSE THIS MORNING FROM SAN ANTONIO AND WERE THEY HAD AND WE CAME BACK .
WHAT DAY WAS THAT SUNDAY EVENING AND THEY HAD A BIG RAINSTORM COME THROUGH THERE PART OF THE SAME THING .
WE RE GETTING NOW I GUESS .
OH .
OH WELL THAT S REAL NICE BECAUSE I CAN REMEMBER TWO YEARS AGO THAT IN ABOUT FEBRUARY .
THE HUNDRED DEGREE WEATHER STARTED IN SAN ANTONIO AND JUST CONTINUED .
AT LEAST YALL ARE GETTING SOME RAIN UP IN DALLAS .
I M GLAD TO HEAR THAT .
YEAH .
THAT S THE SECOND OR THIRD YEAR IN A ROW THAT WE VE HAD A REAL RAINY SPRING .
UHHUH .
WE HAD A PRETTY RAINY FALL LAST YEAR AS WELL .
YALL WERE NT GETTING ANY OF THE STRINGS OF THE TORNADOES AND STUFF WERE YOU .
UM WE VE HAD A FEW DOWN HERE BUT NOT ANYTHING LIKE KANSAS .
UHHUH .
BUT THIS IS THE SEASON FOR THAT .
OH GOSH .
THEY DO THEY DO POP UP OCCASIONALLY .
UHHUH .
AROUND HERE .
OH .
YEAH .
I REALLY DO NT MISS ALL THE HEAT THERE .
YEAH .
I M GETTING ACCLIMATED TO HAVE THE COOL EVENINGS SO WE GET A BIT OF A RELIEF .
YEAH .
I M FROM HERE ORIGINALLY SO WHEN IT .
S JULY AND AUGUST I M PRETTY WELL USED TO THE .
UHHUH .
HUNDRED DEGREE TEMPERATURES .
UHHUH .
YEAH .
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH WITH THE WEATHER AND THE RAIN IN THIS AREA IS THE SOIL .
IT .
S THAT BLACK CLAY SOIL .
OH .
IS THAT WHAT .
DALLAS IS OKAY .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW IT S NOT SANDY LIKE MOST OF THE STATE IS SO IT DOES NT ABSORB THE WATER REAL WELL .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW ONCE IT RAINS A LITTLE BIT IT S IT S FILLED UP AND EVERYTHING ELSE JUST RUNS OFF .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
SAN ANTONIO HAS THAT SAME PROBLEM WHEN THE RAINS COME .
IT S IT S A COMPLETE MESS EVERYTHING FLOODS ALL THE UNDER PASSES .
YEAH .
I DID NT REALIZE THAT DALLAS HAD THAT SAME PROBLEM .
YEAH .
WE HAVE IT ESPECIALLY AS RAINY AS IT S BEEN IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS .
AND THERE S A SECTION IN SOUTH DALLAS .
THAT S HAD A WHOLE LOT OF FLOODING PROBLEMS BECAUSE OF THE RAIN .
UHHUH .
WELL WE COULD USE SOME RAIN UP HERE .
WE RE LIKE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE FOURTH YEAR OF DROUGHT .
REALLY .
UP HERE AND THEY HAD A PRETTY GOOD EARLY SPRING AND WE GOT QUITE A BIT OF RAIN BUT IT .
WAS NT ENOUGH TO OFFSET WHAT .
THEY LOST OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS .
UHHUH .
AND UH SO THEY RE STILL TALKING WATER RATIONING THIS SUMMER SO IT WOULD SEEM STRANGE BECAUSE IN SAN ANTONIO WE HAD LIVED OUT UM WEST OF SAN ANTONIO IN CASTROVILLE .
UHHUH .
AND THE WATER IN MEDINA LAKE AND THAT AREA WAS REALLY GOING DOWN THAT THEY WERE CONSIDERING THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE TO DO WATER RATIONING AND I THOUGHT OH GEE I M SO GLAD TO GET OUT OF THERE AND GET UP HERE TO THE CALIFORNIA PACIFIC COAST WHERE IT RAINS AND EVERYTHING HAS FLOWERS AND THERE S NO PROBLEM WITH WATER .
AND THEN I CAME HERE AND FOUND OUT THEY WERE IN THE YOU KNOW FOUR YEAR DRAUGHT .
UHHUH .
SO I SAID WELL GEE THIS IS PRETTY MUCH LIKE TEXAS .
AND IT PRETTY MUCH IS IN THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER .
THEY HAVE ROLLING HILLS AROUND HERE BUT .
UHHUH .
UM THEY TURN TO GOLDEN DEAD GRASS .
UHHUH .
FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE SUMMER JUST BECAUSE THERE IS NO WATER TO KEEP THEM GREEN .
YEAH .
BUT UM IT S A REALLY NICE AREA .
IT S JUST IT S JUST SUCH A CHANGE FROM UH TEXAS BECAUSE I HAD GROWN UP WITH UH THE HEAT .
UHHUH .
AND USED TO ESSENTIALLY LIKE YOU SAID YOU HAVE THE COLD WINTER AND THEN YOU HAVE THE HOT SUMMER SPRING .
UHHUH .
AND UH TO COME HERE IT S KIND OF THE TEMPERATE WEATHER .
ALL YEAR ROUND .
IT .
S KIND OF LIKE UH SPRING I GUESS IF YOU YEAR ROUND EXCEPT AND THEN IN THE WINTER AND THEN IT SEEMS SORT OF LIKE A SAN ANTONIO EARLY WINTER OR FALL .
UHHUH .
YEARROUND .
SO IT SEEMS LIKE WE ONLY HAVE TWO SPRINGS .
WHICH IS OR TWO SEASONS AND THAT WOULD BE SPRING AND FALL .
YEAH .
WE NEVER REALLY GET ANY OF THE OTHER ONES .
UHHUH .
BUT IT S A REALLY NICE UH CHANGE OF PACE .
I GUESS I D PREFER THAT .
YEAH .

OH YEAH .
I THINK WHEN YOU RE IN COLLEGE .
YOU .
KIND OF YOU HAVE MORE OF A REGULAR SCHEDULE .
UHHUH .
IN TERMS OF YOU CAN WATCH EVERY WEEK .
YEAH THAT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE .
SO YEAH I I USED TO WHEN MY KIDS WERE REAL LITTLE AND I WAS HOME I WATCHED WHERE I WAS HOME WHERE I WATCHED THINGS ON A MORE REGULAR BASIS .
BUT RIGHT NOW THE LAST THINGS I WATCHED REGULARLY WAS THIRTY SOMETHING WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT .
OKAY .
DID YOU .
ALL EVER WATCH THAT .
I YEAH I STARTED TOO AND UH .
YEAH .
KIND OF KIND OF WORKED AWAY FROM THAT .
YEAH .
I I HAVE A HARD TIME STICKING WITH SOMETHING .
YEAH .
LIKE LIKE ON T V BECAUSE IT LIKE IT GETS REAL AGGRAVATING IF YOU MISS IT FOR A WEEK OR TWO .
YOU FEEL KIND OF LEFT OUT .
RIGHT RIGHT .
BUT UM RIGHT .
I KNOW BUT I TELL YOU .
WHAT UM WE RE REALLY STRICT WITH OUR KIDS ABOUT TELEVISION AND ONE NIGHT COUPLE WEEKS AGO IT WAS JUST HAPPENED THAT WE WERE EXHAUSTED AND THEY WANTED TO WATCH AND WE SAID OKAY WELL WE LL SIT DOWN AND WE LL YOU KNOW LOOK AT WHAT .
YOU WANT TO SEE .
LET S JUST TURN IT ON AND SEE WHAT S ON .
WE COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING .
THAT HAD ANY KIND OF REDEEMING VALUE IN IT .
I BELIEVE THAT .
SO YOU KNOW IT WAS PRIME TIME IT WAS WHAT SEVEN THIRTY EIGHT OCLOCK ON A WEEK NIGHT .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND WE HAVE CABLE AND THERE WAS NT ANYTHING ON ANY CHANNEL AND THE STUFF .
THAT WAS ON THE PRIME THE NETWORKS YOU KNOW A B C N B C C B S WAS IT WAS JUST UM DRIBBLE .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW I MEAN IT .
WAS NT EVEN FUNNY .
THAT S RIGHT .
IT WAS NT CREATIVE IT IT WAS THE WORST I VE SEEN .
I MEAN I HAVE NOT WATCHED PRIME TIME WEEK NIGHT T V I GUESS IN A REAL LONG TIME .
YEAH .
BECAUSE I WAS SHOCKED .
I KNOW EXACTLY HOW YOU FEEL .
YOU KNOW WHAT .
I M SAYING .
THAT S RIGHT .
I UH WHEN I FIRST MOVED DOWN HERE MOVED INTO THE APARTMENT AND GOT CABLE AND I GUESS I SORT OF KIND OF BECAME NUMB .
UHHUH .
NOTHING SURPRISED ME .
ANY MORE SEEING IT ON THE T V YOU KNOW .
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN I STARTED PAYING PAYING ATTENTION TO NETWORK T V AGAIN ONCE IN A WHILE .
RIGHT .
RIGHT NOW WE DO NT HAVE CABLE .
RIGHT .
AND IT S SURPRISING HOW MUCH .
IT S CHANGED .
UHHUH .
THE WHOLE MORAL SITUATION EVERYTHING IS JUST GONE ONE WHOLE COMPLETE DIRECTION DIFFERENT .
AND WE DO NT HAVE ANY KIDS YET BUT I FEEL THE SAME WAY .
IT S REALLY TOUGH TO FIND SOMETHING .
THAT S .
RIGHT .
GOING TO BE GOOD AND INTERESTING FOR THE KIDS .
EVEN EVEN CARTOONS UM .
OH .
YOU KNOW YOU WATCH SOME OF THE CARTOONS AND KIDS .
YEAH .
ARE NT ARE NT EVEN GOING TO UNDERSTAND HALF THE HUMOR .
THAT S IN THERE .
IT S NONE OF IT S PROBABLY DAMAGING LOT OF TIMES .
RIGHT IT S JUST IT S JUST UH LIKE A NECESSARY EVIL .
I MEAN WHEN WE WHEN OUR CHILDREN WERE YOUNGER WHEN THEY WERE LIKE FOUR YEARS OLD THREE YEARS OLD FIVE YEARS OLD WE JUST HAD SESAME STREET AND THAT WAS ABOUT IT YOU KNOW .
RIGHT RIGHT .
BUT NOW IN ORDER TO SEEM YOU KNOW HUMANE AND NORMAL WE DO ALLOW THEM TO WATCH CARTOONS AND STUFF .
OH YEAH YEAH .
BUT IT S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO SHUT YOUR EYES OR NOT LISTEN OR SOMETHING BECAUSE THOSE DRIVE YOU CRAZY IF YOU RE IF YOU RE IN THE ROOM .
SO .
THAT S RIGHT .
BUT IT S SUCH A SHAME BECAUSE IT COULD BE SO GOOD .
I DO NT UNDERSTAND WHY FIRST OF ALL THE PUBLIC PUTS UP WITH IT .
WELL THAT S TRUE .
SECOND OF ALL WHY THE NETWORKS THINK THAT YOU KNOW WE ENJOY THAT KIND OF STUFF .
IT S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT NOBODY CAN BE ANY MORE CREATIVE THAN THAT .
THAT CA NT BE THE PROBLEM .
UHHUH .
IT MUST BE THE MARKETING PRESSURES AND YOU KNOW THEIR DEMOGRAPHIC STUDIES THAT THEY DO THAT SHOW YOU KNOW THAT EVERYBODY S I Q HAS DROPPED DRAMATICALLY OR SOMETHING .
I M GLAD YOU SAID IT AND I DID NT HAVE TO .
BUT THAT THAT THAT S THE I FEEL THE EXACT SAME WAY .
I SIT I SIT AND WATCH SOME SHOWS AND I M EMBARRASSED FOR THE PEOPLE .
THAT ARE EVEN INVOLVED IN THE SHOW .
I KNOW .
YOU KNOW WHY DO YOU DO THIS TO YOURSELF .
WHY DO YOU DO THIS .
YEAH .
I KNOW I M TRYING TO THINK IF THERE S ANYTHING .
I DO YOU LIKE UH I LIKE STUFF .
THAT S ON GREAT PERFORMANCES AND I WE USED TO WATCH MYSTERY QUITE A BIT .
OKAY .

RIGHT .
AS A MATTER OF FACT YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS A KID EXCUSE ME MY PARENTS USED TO HAVE WE HAD THIS RULE IN OUR HOUSE FOR EVERY HOUR OF REGULAR T V THAT WE WATCHED WE HAD TO WATCH AN HOUR OF PUBLIC T V .
NOW THERE S AN IDEA .
THAT WAS JUST THE RULE .
AND IF THEY SAW US WATCHING THE SOMETHING THEY D SAY ALL RIGHT WHAT DID YOU SEE ON WHAT S NEW OR THERE WAS SOME OTHER THE CHILDREN S PROGRAM .
I THINK AT THE TIME WAS CALLED WHAT S NEW .
OKAY YEAH .
SO WE HAD TO GIVE A LITTLE ORAL REPORT BEFORE WE COULD WATCH OUR PROGRAM .

DO YOU DO YOU WATCH SPORTS ON T V .
ARE YOU .
A SPORTS FAN .
I CA NT HANDLE IT VERY LONG .
YEAH .
I I MEAN I M I M A SPORTS FAN BUT IT S WELL IT S KIND OF IT S KIND OF LIKE READING MAGAZINES ANY MORE .

RIGHT YEAH .
BUT UH IT IT S YOU RE MISSING AN AWFUL LOT .
YEAH .
I D RATHER PERSONALLY RATHER WATCH SEE A GAME ON T V THAN FIGHT THE CROWDS AT THE STADIUM .
BUT UH .
YEAH THAT S TRUE THE TRAFFIC .
BUT UH NO .
UH .
I DO NT SIT DOWN I LL SIT DOWN FOR THE BIG GAMES THE SUPER BOWL AND THE CHAMPIONSHIP .

YOU KNOW WHAT .
I DID .
THERE WAS A TIME THERE WHERE I COULD TAPE THINGS AND THEN I D FAST FORWARD THROUGH THE .
UHHUH .
COMMERCIALS .
SAVED A LOT OF TIME .
THAT WAY .
YEAH IT WORKS YOU BET YEAH .
BUT THAT TAKES TOO MUCH PLANNING .
YEAH NO I DO NT KNOW IF THERE S ANY ANY SERIES THAT I PAY ATTENTION TO I TRY TO WATCH CHEERS ONCE IN A WHILE .
NOW THAT YEAH IS THAT STILL REAL GOOD .
IT USED TO BE REAL GOOD .
BUT .
YEAH IT IS .
IS IT .
IN FACT IT S I THINK IT S ON TONIGHT .
OH .
I JUST GOT IN FROM OUTSIDE SO I .
OH OKAY .
SO I M KIND OF OUT OF IT .
THINGS LIKE THAT AND I CONSIDER THAT FAIRLY INTELLIGENT HUMOR .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .

IT S GETTING HARDER AND HARDER .
TEN YEARS AGO WAS NT SO HARD TO STAY UP .
YEAH YOU KNOW IT WAS IT WAS JUST AUTOMATIC TOO NO MATTER WHERE YOU WERE YOU STOPPED AND SAT DOWN AND WATCHED IT .
I THINK IT S COME AROUND AGAIN .
IT S GONE THROUGH CYCLES .
YEAH IT WAS WE STOPPED WATCHING FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS IN THE MIDDLE THERE BUT WE STARTED WATCHING AGAIN .
UHHUH .

THAN WHAT .
IT USED TO BE .
THAT S RIGHT .
BUT YOU CA NT BE SO CA NT BE OUTRAGEOUS .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW IF YOU KEEP THAT SAME FORMAT .
THERE S ONLY SO LONG THAT YOU CAN BE OUTRAGEOUS .
SO .
YEAH THAT S FOR SURE THAT IS FOR SURE .
WELL I GUESS THERE ARE A FEW THINGS AROUND STILL BUT .
YEAH BUT YOU HAVE TO HUNT HARD FOR THEM .
SOUNDS LIKE YOU PRETTY MUCH AGREE .
YEAH I GUESS SO .
WELL .
WELL .
BEEN UH GOOD TALKING TO YOU .
YEAH GOOD TALKING TO YOU .
OKAY .
TAKE CARE .
YOU TOO .
BYE .
BYE .
THERE WE GO .
OKAY WELL UH WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT TAXES DO YOU THINK WE RE PAYING TOO MUCH .
YES AND NO INCOME TAX NO I UH I LOOK AT IT THIS WAY UH YOU VE GOT TO PAY FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF LIVING HERE .
UHHUH .
BUT UH BEING A UH A REC VEHICLE OWNER WELL IN FACT I LIVE IN A MOTOR HOME I M A FUL WHAT THEY CALL A FULL TIMER AND UH IT BURNS GAS LIKE CRAZY I ONLY GET SEVEN MILES TO THE GALLON I REALLY RESENT THIS FACT THAT THEY KEEP ADDING ON GASOLINE TAXES AND THEY CALL IT UH UH WHAT S THE WORD THEY USE ANYWAY A A LUXURY TAX .
YEAH .
THEY GA ADD IT ON ON TO TIRES AND GASOLINE CIGARETTES LIQUOR IT DOES NT BOTHER ME ANY BECAUSE I VE QUIT DRINKING AND I QUIT SMOKING SO THAT DOES NT BOTHER ME BUT I DO NT THINK IT S FAIR .
YEAH .
IT S TOO UM UM IT S ATTACKING JUST CERTAIN PEOPLE .
HOW TRUE .
EVEN WITH THE GASOLINE TAX .
YEAH WELL GASOLINE ESPECIALLY IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY WE ALL USE IT ALL THE TIME YOU KNOW IT S THAT S NOT WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER A LUXURY .
NO UH FIFTY YEARS AGO THE AUTOMOBILE WAS A LUXURY BUT IT S A NECESSITY TODAY AND UH AS HARD AS THEY TRY TO GET THESE PUBLIC TRANSIT THINGS GOING I HAVE NEVER SEEN NOR HEARD OF ONE THAT REALLY GOT OF THE GROUND .
YEAH .
OR THAT ACCOMPLISH WHAT THEY SET OUT TO COM TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT ARE YOUR FEELINGS ON IT .
WELL UM I I THINK THAT WE PROBABLY ARE PAYING A LITTLE TOO MUCH TAX CONSIDERING WHAT WE RE GETTING FOR IT AND HOW IT S BEING MANAGED AND SO FORTH I MEAN I I THINK THERE COULD BE A BETTER SYSTEM AND WE WOULD GET MORE FOR OUR MONEY IT S TOTALLY OUT OF OUR HANDS SO WE DO NT WE CA NT REALLY DO A WHOLE LOT ABOUT HOW THAT MONEY IS SPENT AND WHERE IT GOES AND UH .
YEAH THAT THAT S THAT S SO TRUE I MEAN THEY SAY WELL YOU VOICE YOUR OPINION UH UH UH ON ELECTION DAY .
BUT NOT REALLY .
NO YOU DO NT LOOK WHAT HAPPENED ON THE LAST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION READ MY LIPS .
AND WHAT HAPPENED THEY TURNED AROUND AND DOUBLE CROSSED US .
YEAH .
SO UH I MEAN YOU CA NT BELIEVE WHAT YOU HEAR .
WELL I THINK TOO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT RUBS ME THE WRONG WAY THE MOST IS THOSE PROGRAMS THAT ARE FUNDED BY CONGRESS AND UH THAT DO NT SEEM TO HAVE ANY VALIDITY AT ALL I MEAN THEY RE ALWAYS FAR OUT AND UH YOU KNOW THEY RE STUDYING SOME OBSCURE BUG YOU KNOW .
OH .
IN SOME OTHER PART OF THE WORLD OR SOME SUCH THING .
UH YES .
AND OUR TAX MONEY PAYS FOR THOSE THINGS AND I THINK THAT S WRONG I .
I AGREE AND AND UH I I ALSO THINK WE EXTEND TOO MUCH HELP TO OTHER UH COUNTRIES WE NEED ENOUGH HELP HERE IN THIS COUNTRY .
THAT S RIGHT .
THEY RE STILL PEOPLE STARVING PEOPLE HERE WHY SHOULD WE HELP STARVING PEOPLE SOMEWHERE ELSE .
YEAH AND I THINK HERE LATELY THEY VE BEEN SAYING QUITE OFTEN AND MAYBE SOMEBODY S COMING TO REALIZE WE RE THE NATION IN TROUBLE .
ABSOLUTELY NOW I CA NT WAIT FOR UH I I COULD JUST PICTURE WHA WHAT S GOING TO HAPPEN HERE IN THE NOT TO DISTANT FUTURE WE KEEP HEARING WELL WE RE GOING TO RECEIVE UH EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS FROM JAPAN FOR THE UH UHHUH THE THE THE BIG .
THE WAR .
WAR OVER THERE IN THE MIDEAST .
UHHUH .
AND UH SO MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS HERE AND THERE AND EVERYTHING AND UH THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW WE LL BE TURNING AROUND JUST LIKE WE DID TO POLAND AND SAY WELL JUST FORGET IT .
YEAH AND I THINK THAT S A MISTAKE .
OH DEFINITELY .
SOMEWHERE YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO REALIZE THAT WE CA NT JUST KEEP GIVING IT AWAY .
WELL ANOTHER THING NOW THEY KEEP DECONTROLLING DIFFERENT THINGS FIRST IT WAS THE AIRLINES THEN IT WAS BANKS AND AND UH UM SAVINGS ASSOCIATION .
AND WHATNOT .
WE KNOW WHAT TROUBLE THEY GOT INTO .
EXACTLY AND THE SAME WITH THE AIRLINES BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN THEY WERE UH CONTROLLED AND AND UH TRANSCONTINENTAL OR UM UM INTERSTATE UH TRUCKING I MEAN AS SOON AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GAVE UP CONTROL ON ALL THAT THEY JUST WENT TO HELL IN A HAND BASKET .
YEAH .
PRICES WENT SKY HIGH THEN IN IN THE CASE OF AIRLINES OF COURSE THEY BECAME HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND THEY CUT EACH OTHERS THROATS UNTIL THEY RE THEY REACH THE POINT WHERE THEY RE CUTTING THEIR OWN THROAT AND UH WELL OF COURSE THAT S GETTING AWAY FROM TAXES IS NT IT TH THAT S GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED BUT UH .
WELL I I THINK ANOTHER THING TOO THAT UM I VE HAD A LITTLE CONTACTED WITH UH IN REGARD TO TAXES LET S SAY THAT UH YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT THE I R S DISAGREES WITH OR YOU KNOW SAYS HEY WE RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW THAT WELL I THINK THEY RE VERY UNFAIR IN THE AMOUNT OF PENALTIES AND INTEREST THAT THEY CAN ATTACH TO THAT BECAUSE YOU YOU WILL NOT ONLY PAYBACK THAT THAT YOU WROTE OFF BUT YOU WILL AT LEAST DOUBLE THAT AMOUNT AND .
OH BY THE TIME YOU GET THROUGH WITH THE UH .
YES AND THAT S TO ME THERE S SOMETHING WRONG THERE YOU KNOW .
THE PENALTIES .
YEAH I MEAN I CAN SEE PAYING THE INTEREST AND SOME SMALL PENALTY BUT THEY REALLY STICK IT TO YOU BIG TIME .
UH I AGREE I THINK THE I R S IS UH JUST TOO POWERFUL THERE SHOULD BE SOME SORT OF A CONTROL ON IT AND THEY SHOULD BE A LITTLE MORE HUMANE .
UHHUH ABSOLUTELY .
UH THE UH TYPICAL BUREAUCRATIC I GUESS THAT S THAT S ONE OF MY PET PEEVES I CAME UP WITH A BRILLIANT IDEA HOW WE COULD REDUCE THE THE BUDGET .
UHHUH .
VERY SIMPLE GIVE UH UH UH GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF UH HOLIDAYS AS THE UH .
PRIVATE INDUSTRY .
YEAH .
I MEAN YOU THINK ABOUT IT NOW THEY THEY GET ABOUT SIXTEEN HOLIDAYS A YEAR .
THAT S A LOT .
IT SURE IS AND I THINK HERE AT TI WE GET WHAT IS IT NINE OR TEN .
WELL I HAVE NT COUNTED I I WOULD HAVE GUESSED EIGHT EVEN BUT YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT I DO NT HAVE ANY IDEA .
WELL I REMEMBER UH UH THINKING I THINK IT WAS THE LAST TIME I DID HEAR THAT WE GET ABOUT THE AVERAGE MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE MORE A DAY OR SO MORE THAN THE AVERAGE .
YEAH .
BUT UH GOVERNMENT IS RIDICULOUS .
WOW .
JUST THINK OF THE MONEY THEY COULD SAVE I MEAN THEY RE THEY RE PAYING OUT THIS MONEY ANYWAY .
YEAH .
WHY NOT GET THE WORK OUT OF THE PEOPLE .
YEAH .
AND WELL ANYWAY THAT WOULD OF COURSE EVENTUALLY COME BACK TO TAXES BUT UH AS FAR AS INCOME TAX IS CONCERNED I CA NT COMPLAIN TOO MUCH ABOUT IT UH I M SINGLE I HAVE NO UH DEPENDENTS OR ANYTHING MY CHILDREN ARE ALL GROWN AND THEY RE OUT WORRYING ABOUT THEIR OWN INCOME TAXES .
YEAH WELL I I HAVE ANOTHER THING THAT I THOUGHT ABOUT TOO FOR INSTANCE WHEN YOU TRY TO SAVE MONEY AND YOU EARN INTEREST ON WHATEVER YOUR INVESTMENT IS AND YOU KNOW WE RE NOT TYPICALLY TALKING ABOUT BIG DOLLARS BUT HERE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU VE YOU VE DONE SOMETHING GOOD YOU VE YOU VE EARNED YOUR INTEREST AND THEN YOU HAVE TO GO BACK AND PAY TAXES ON IT SO THE REAL AMOUNT OF YOUR SAVINGS ON THAT IS IS NOT MUCH .
UH VERY TRUE THAT S .
YOU KNOW IT S KIND OF A VICIOUS CIRCLE THERE .
AND THEN THEY TELL YOU TO UH WELL INVEST IT IN UH IS IT I R A S OR SOMETHING AND AND .
AND THEN .
WHEN YOU TURN .
AT A TOOK THAT AWAY AS FAR AS BEING .
WHEN YOU TURN SIXTYFIVE WHY THEN YOU PAY THE TAX ON IT AND THE TAX IS A LOT LESS .
YEAH .
BUT IN THE MEAN TIME YOU VE GOT YOUR MONEY TIDE UP IN A LOW RELATIVELY LOW INTEREST BEARING INVESTMENT I MEAN IT S NOT MAKING TEN FIFTEEN PERCENT LIKE A BUSINESS IS TODAY .
HUHUH .
UH ME I M A FIRM BELIEVER IN THAT IF YOU GOT IT SPEND IT .
WELL YOU CAN COME OVER TO MY HOUSE AND SPEND IT .
WELL YOU .
I WISH I HAD SOME TO SPEND .
WELL DO YOU DO YOU NEED SOME HELP SPENDING YOURS .
NO NO I JUST DO NT HAVE ANY .
OH UHHUH WELL THAT S MY PROBLEM TOO I M I M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT FROM ONE PAYDAY TO THE NEXT WHOSE GOING TO BE THE LUCKY ONE THIS MONTH THAT S GOING TO GET PAID .
YEAH THAT S THE WAY IT GOES WELL I GUESS WE PROBABLY TALKED JUST ABOUT LONG ENOUGH .
UHHUH .
YEAH .
UH LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING DID YOU GET A CATALOG OR SOMETHING FROM THESE PEOPLE .

AS LONG AS IT S NOT IN NOT TO THE POINT OF WHERE IT S UH NEEDS TO BE SCRAPED AND BL PEELING .
RIGHT .
AND OUR HOUSE IS NOT BUT IT S STARTING TO BLEED THROUGH AND BURN THROUGH BECAUSE THE PAINT S REAL CHEAP AND IT S JUST A HASSLE TO GO THROUGH IT SO I M LOOKING FOR THE EASY WAY OUT .
YEAH UH I KNOW .
DI IS EASY TO FIND PA UH PAINTERS TO DO THIS FOR YOU .
IT S EASIER TO FIND PAINTERS BUT YOU HAVE TO BE YOU HAVE TO BE AWARE OF WHAT UH HOW MESSY THEY CAN GET AND ARE THEY GOING TO PUT ON A GOOD A GOOD TWO COATS AND ARE THEY .
RI ARE YOU TALKING .

EXTERIOR YEAH .

UH INTERIOR S NOT SO BAD BECAUSE IT S MORE FUN IT S MORE C BUT YEAH .
YEAH .
OUTSIDE YOU HAVE HIGH PEEKS .
YEAH .
AND THOSE KIND OF THINGS IT CAN BE A REAL ISSUE .
WELL WHEN WE VE PAINTED UM RIGHT NOW OUR HOUSE DOES NT HAVE TO HAVE THE SAME KIND OF EXTERIOR PAINTING THERE IT S MORE TRIM BECAUSE IT HAS SOME OF THE OLD ASBESTOS SHINGLES .
UHHUH .
ON THE BACK AND THERE S SOME SORT OF STONE OR SOMETHING IN THE FRONT SO THERE IS NT AS MUCH WOOD .
THAT HAS TO BE PAINTED .
UM BUT I IT THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT HITS THE SUN HITS IT .
SO PREPARING IS A REAL PROBLEM .
UHHUH .
YOU VE GOT TO PREPARE IT WELL OR ELSE IT WILL FLAKE .
UHHUH .
UM .
HERE THEY SOME OF THE HOME BUILDERS ARE THEY DO NT PUT BRICK ON THE SIDE OF YOUR HOUSE JUST TO SAVE MONEY SO THEY PUT UP UH A QUARTER INCH MASONITE BASICALLY AND THEY PAINTED IT .
KIND OF LIKE A SPUN OF A SORTS SO IT S REAL CHEAP .
AND UH UH I VE HAD THIRTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR BID AND I AS LOW AS FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS SO IT S .
WOW .
JUST A MATTER OF IT S .
THAT S QUITE A RANGE .
OH THERE ONE GUY BRAGS ABOUT HIS PIECE OF EQUIPMENT .
HE S USING AND THE DROP CLOTHS AND ALL THAT KIND CRAP AND I M SO MUCH WORRIED ABOUT THAT AS WHAT .
YEAH .
I DO NT WANT IT .
ALL OVER THE BRICK AND WINDOWS AND .

OH SURE .
YEAH ABSOLUTELY .
SO YALL YOU HAVE NT HAD ANY ANY JOBS PAINTED IN YOUR HOUSE OR RECENTLY MUMBLEX .
NO WE VE HAVE UH DONE A LITTLE PAINTING OURSELVES UM WE PAINTED THE BEDROOM UH WELL WITHIN THE LAST T COUPLE OF MONTHS .
THAT S FUN .
AND WE HAVE WE HAVE SOME .
MORE .
THAT NEED TO BE DONE .
UHHUH .
BUT THE THE PROBLEM THAT WE VE WE VE OWNED THIS HOUSE ALMOST FIVE YEARS NOW AND UM WHEN WE BOUGHT IT .
THE UM IT HAD BEEN VACANT FOR A WHILE BECAUSE THE FAMILY WILL RETIRED MUMBLEX BUT THE DAUGHTER WAS A REAL ESTATE AGENT AND SHE WAS SELLING IT AND IT S BEEN LIVED IN BRIEFLY BY HER BEFORE SHE BOUGHT HER TOWN HOUSE .
SO SHE TOLD US THAT THE HOUSE HAD BEEN UH PROFESSIONALLY PAINTED RECENTLY .
AND IT LOOKED PRETTY GOOD YOU KNOW THE UH THE INTERIOR WALLS ALL BASICALLY WHITE BUT THEY OBVIOUSLY HAD BEEN DONE WITHOUT TO MUCH UH WEAR AFTERWARD .
THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS WHEN WE STARTED HAVING THE MOVERS MOVE THE FURNITURE IN WE IDENTIFIED VARIOUS ROOMS BY PIECES OF MASKING TAPE ON THE WOOD UH THE DOOR FRAMES .
UHHUH .
WHEN WE TOOK THE MASKING TAPE OFF HALF THE PAINTED CAME WITH IT .
UH THAT S NOT VERY .
BIG LONG STRIPS .
SO WHAT HAD HAPPENED IS THAT PROFESSIONAL PAINTERS HAD NOT PREPARED THE SURFACE PROPERLY .
AND SOME OF STILL HAS TO BE REDONE .
OH THEY JUST PAINTED OVER VARNISHED WOOD .
YEAH .
OH MY .
WELL NO ACTUALLY IT HAD BEEN UH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IT HAD BEEN A REPAINT JOB .
UM .
BUT THEY HAD NOT EITHER THEY HAD PAINTED WITH THE WRONG KIND OF PAINT OVER TOP OR THEY HAD NT REALLY ROUGHED IT UP OR WHATEVER .
THEY BECAUSE IT WAS WOODWORK SO IT LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN PAINTED .
UHHUH .
CORRECTLY WITH YOU KNOW UH AN ENAMEL OR SOMETHING BUT UM IT HAD NOT EITHER THAT OR IT HAD NOT BEEN PREPARED UNDERNEATH AND IT WAS GREASY OR SOMETHING .
SURE .
IT COMES OFF IN STRIPS I MEAN NOT EVEN LITTLE BIT .
SO WE STILL HAVE SOME OF THAT TRIM WORK TO DO BECAUSE WE PUT IT OFF ALL THIS TIME .
OH NO .
WE KNOW WHAT .
A JOB .
IT S GOING TO BE BECAUSE YOU ALMOST HAVE TO STRIP THE WHOLE THING .
UM .
IN ORDER TO DO IT AGAIN .
I WISH YOU GOOD LUCK .
OKAY .
THANK YOU VERY MUCH .
THANK YOU .
BYEBYE .

I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THAT METHOD .
OKAY .
UH IF .
WELL THAT S SOMETHING THAT THAT S WORTHWHILE CHECKING INTO THEN .
CAUSE I .
IF YOU CAN RENT A STEAMER IF IT S MODERN WALLPAPER .
IT SHOULD COME OFF WITHOUT TOO MUCH TROUBLE .
IF IT S REALLY OLD YOU DO NT KNOW WHAT .
IT S PUT ON WITH .
IT IT S HARD TO TELL IT S THE PATTERNS LOOK LIKE THEY RE NINETEEN SIXTIES STYLE .
YEAH .
AND I KNOW THE HOUSE UM WAS BUILT AROUND THE MID FIFTIES .
UHHUH .
SO IT MAY BE THE ORIGINAL WALLPAPER .
COULD BE YEAH .
UM IF IT S VINYL .
IT SHOULD BE EASIER TO STRIP TOO .
IF IT S PAPER .
IT WILL PROBABLY SHRED .
UM IN ONE BATHROOM .
IT S UM IT S PROBABLY PAPER UH IT S SILVER SILVER AND YELLOW .
UM UHHUH .
AND WHITE .
WELL THE WALLPAPER THAT I WAS TRYING TO REMOVE WAS BLACK I THIS WAS IN A BATHROOM TOO .
AND THE THE TILES WERE SORT OF A MOTTLED GREY AND HAD A LITTLE TRIM STRIP OF MAROON AND WHITE AND THE THE WALLPAPER IN THAT BATHROOM HAD A BLACK BACKGROUND AND THEN IT HAD VIVID UH ALMOST NEON COLORS OF HOT PINK AND TURQUOISE AND LIME GREEN AND SILVER AND UH A LITTLE BIT OF YELLOW .
THAT LOOKED LIKE CORAL SANDS AND SEA HORSES AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
UM THAT S KIND OF AN ODD COLOR FOR A BATHROOM .
OH IT WAS AWFUL IT WAS ABSOLUTELY HIDEOUS AND AND WE HAD A DINNER PARTY BEFORE WE STARTED RENOVATING IT AND A A GUEST WENT IN THERE AND HE SAID IT S A GOOD THING .
I WENT TO THE BATHROOM BEFORE DINNER BECAUSE IF I HAD HAD SOMETHING TO DRINK AND WENT IN THERE I WOULD THINK I WAS HAVING HALLUCINATIONS .
REALLY .
WELL I I VE ALSO BEEN THINKING ABOUT AFTER LOOKING AT ALL THESE MAGAZINES UM THESE DESIGN MAGAZINES AND STUFF I M THINKING ABOUT MAYBE PAINTING THE BEDROOM WALLS TOO IN A COLOR .
THAT WILL KIND OF UM TIE IN OUR UM OUR UM OUR UH COMFORTER .
UHHUH .
WITH A COLOR .
THAT S KIND OF A UM BURGUNDY AND GREEN AND YELLOW AND BLUE AND BEIGE FLORAL DESIGN .
UHHUH .
UM AND I M NOT REALLY QUITE SURE I DO NT KNOW IF MAYBE I M BITING OFF MORE THAN I CAN CHEW .
WELL I D SAY TACKLE ONE PROJECT FIRST AND SEE HOW IT GOES AND IF YOU DISCOVER YOU LIKE IT THEN YOU CAN ALWAYS UPSCALE .
YEAH WELL THE BEDROOM WOULD PROBABLY BE THE EASIER OF THE TWO BECAUSE IT WOULD BE JUST PLAIN PAINTING .
SURE .
IT WOULD NT BE ANY KIND OF SPECIAL UM SPECIAL EFFECTS TYPE THING .
YEAH .
IT WOULD BE JUST PLAIN PAINT .
WELL IT S NOT HARD TO DO IF YOU GET EVERYTHING PREPARED AHEAD OF TIME .
BECAUSE IF YOU UH USE DROP CLOTHS TO COVER EVERYTHING AND YOU USE MASKING TAPE TO TRIM OUT UH ALL THE PARTS THAT YOU DO NT WANT TO SLOP OVER ONTO YOU DO NT HAVE TO BE QUITE AS PRECISE ABOUT HOW YOU DO IT AND IT CAN BE DONE A WHOLE LOT FASTER .
UM OKAY .
AND WITH ROLLERS AND UH MODERN LATEX PAINTS YOU CAN WASH UP EASILY BECAUSE THEY RE WATER SOLUBLE .
UHHUH .
AND THEY DRY FAST SO YOU REALLY DO NT HAVE TO BE DISRUPTED FOR MORE THAN ABOUT A WEEKEND .
IF YOU HAVE SOME HELP .
UM .
AND THEN IF THAT IF YOU DISCOVER THE LITTLE TRICKS AND TIPS ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW YOU GET THROUGH CORNERS AND HOW YOU DO TRIM AND UH HOW LONG TO LEAVE THE MASKING TAPE DOWN BECAUSE IF YOU LEAVE IT TOO LONG AND IT DRIES IT CAN FLAKE WHEN IT WHEN YOU PULL IT UP .
IT IT PEELS THE PAINT OFF WHEN YOU TAKE IT OFF YEAH .
WELL NOT I IF YOU LEAVE IT ON FOR WEEKS IT WILL DO THAT .
IF YOU TAKE IT UP THE NEXT DAY .
IT SHOULD BE FINE .
YOU WANT IT TO GET DRY BUT NOT UH JUST REAL HARD .
YEAH OKAY .
YOU DO NT WANT THE GUM ON THE BACK OF THE MASKING TAPE TO GET DRIED TO HARD .
THAT S THE PROBLEM .
YEAH .
IT WILL COME UP A LOT EASIER IF YOU DO NT WAIT TOO LONG .
AND I VE I WAS TOLD I ALWAYS USED THE NICE WIDE MASKING TAPE BUT I VE HEARD FROM PEOPLE .
WHO TRIED TO GET BY AND SKIMP ON NARROW MASKING TAPE THAT IT WAS MORE TROUBLE THAN IT WAS WORTH .
OH REALLY OKAY .
BECAUSE IT IT RIPS AS YOU PULL IT OFF FOR ONE THING AND THEN YOU END UP TEDIOUSLY SCRAPING THESE TINY LITTLE SHREDS OF MASKING TAPE .
UM .
AND THE WHOLE POINT OF USING IT IS TO SAVE YOURSELF .
WORK .
YOU CAN DO A LITTLE FASTER PAINTING AND MUCH EASIER CLEAN UP IF YOU USE THE MASKING TAPE .
BUT USE USE GOOD UH STUFF AND BUY IT AT A PAINT STORE WHERE THEY HAVE THE RIGHT BRANDS .
OKAY .
THAT WILL GO DOWN AND COME UP EASILY .
WELL I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE HELPFUL TIPS I THINK YOU ARE JUST MADE MY PROJECT .
A LOT EASIER .
WELL I WISH YOU .
VERY GOOD LUCK WITH IT AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT I HAVE RETIRED FROM THE PAINTING BUSINESS .
THE LAST TIME .
I HAD SOMETHING DONE WAS MY KITCHEN CABINETS AND I DECIDED THAT WAS TOO MUCH TO TACKLE I D HIRE A PROFESSIONAL .

I THINK THAT COULD GIVE IT .
A REALLY A .

WELL I WAS IT WAS FAVORABLE I I JUST I THINK THE SANCTIONS WOULD HAVE WORKED BUT IT WOULD OF TAKEN LONGER AND UH NOW WITH ALL THIS STUFF COMING OUT WITH WOODWARD S BOOK AND EVERYTHING UH AND THEN I SAW A NIGHTLINE PROGRAM LAST NIGHT ABOUT ALL THE FUNDING OF HUSSEIN S UH BACK AS EARLY AS NINETEEN EIGHTYSIX SO UH MUMBLEX BEEN A DIFFERENT TURN AND THEN I DO NT THINK WE PROJECTED WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AFTER THE WAR .
HUHUH .
IT GOT OVER SO FAST SO UH .
WHAT IS THE WOODWARD BOOK YOU ARE REFERRING TO .
WELL IT JUST CAME OUT I GUESS YESTERDAY IT S CALLED THE COMMANDERS AND IT S UH IT SAYS BIG STORY IN THE PAPER ABOUT IT TODAY BUSH TRYING TO COMMENT ON IT THAT COLIN POWELL WAS AGAINST THE UH UH AN EARLY UH HE WAS FOR SANCTIONS .
HUHUH .
AND SO IT SEEMS LIKE THERE S YOU KNOW ALWAYS SOME BODY DIGGING THINGS LIKE THAT BUT I M NOT FOR SURE WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WHAT ALL HAPPENED IN THAT SITUATION .
HUHUH .
SO WE WERE SO UH FAST TO GET OVER THE VIETNAM WHATEVER THE VIETNAM SYNDROME IS THAT NOW WE VE TIED OURSELVES UP THERE IN THE MIDDLE EAST FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME .
RIGHT THAT WAS MY FEELING I WAS I WAS VERY AGAINST OUR INVOLVEMENT SO QUICKLY .
YEAH I JUST THINK I THINK IF WE HAD BEEN VERY I MEAN IF WE HAD THAT GOOD OF A CORRELATION THROUGH THE UNITED NATIONS THEN THEY COULD HAVE UH THEY COULD HAVE MADE SANCTIONS WORK I M PRETTY SURE .
HUHUH HUHUH .
WITH THAT MUCH SUPPORT YOU WOULD HAVE JUST PENALIZED ANY NATION THAT BROKE THE EMBARGO .
RIGHT I THINK WE RE VERY NAIVE AS FAR AS THAT PART OF THE WORLD IS CONCERNED .
WE ARE WE ARE I THINK YOU KNOW IN IN WE VE JUST MISREAD ALMOST EVERYTHING IN THAT WE ALWAYS SEEM TO BE GETTING IN BAD WITH THE WRONG FELLOW FOR THE NEXT NEXT TENURE FOR THE NEXT THING DOWN THE ROAD AND UH THEN WE CAN AND WE DO NT TEND TO READ ISRAEL CORRECTLY SO UH I DO NT KNOW IT SHOULD BE A MESS IT S UH NOT GOING TO BE ANYTHING WE RE GOING TO GET OUT OF VERY SOON .
RIGHT RIGHT IN SPITE OF ALL THE PROMISES .
RIGHT THEY CAN TALK A GOOD GAME BUT UH BEING A HISTORIAN IT S YOU KNOW YOU READ ALL THAT CLEAR BACK AT LEAST TO THE TURN OF THE CENTURY WITH ALL THE MESS AFTER THE FIRST WORLD WAR .
HUHUH HUHUH .
AND WE JUST WE RE STILL I I YOU RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT TOO NAIVE WE JUST IF WE DO FIND SOCALLED EXPERTS IN ANY AREA OF THE WORLD WE DO NT LISTEN TO THEM SO .
HUHUH HUHUH .
UM I DO NT KNOW BE BE INTERESTING TO KEEP WATCHING I GUESS BUT I M JUST AFRAID IT S GOING IT S GOING .
HUHUH HUHUH .
TO BREAK US .
AND I M NOT SURE WE RE SENSITIVE TO TO OTHER CULTURES .
NOT VERY MUCH IN OUR COLLEGES WE RE TRYING WE RE I HAPPEN TO TEACH AT A COLLEGE WITH A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS AND AND CULTURAL DIVERSITY IS JUST SOMETHING WE REALLY DO NT UNDERSTAND AND IT NEEDS TO BE UH TAUGHT FROM THE EARLIEST GRADES .
HUHUH .
WITH OUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS IN SUCH DISARRAY I DO NT KNOW IF THAT IT DOES NT LOOK TERRIBLY HOPEFUL .
HUHUH BUT I M NOT SURE IT S SOMETHING YOU CAN TEACH I MEAN .
WELL YOU CAN AT LEAST UH .
AWARENESS .
GIVE THEM THE AWARENESS OF THE DIFFERENT CULTURES AND UH YOU KNOW HAVE ALL SORTS OF UM AT LEAST YOU KNOW LET THEM KNOW WHAT THAT THAT OTHER PEOPLE DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY THAN THAN THAN MAYBE IN THEIR OWN NEIGHBORHOOD .
HUHUH .
SO AND WHEN WHEN WHEN THOSE PEOPLE ARE AROUND AND YOU CAN GET THEM TO MEET AND WE RE ALL PRETTY MUCH ALIKE .
THAT S TRUE THAT S TRUE .
SO UH .
YEAH .
BUT IT S UH IT S SOMETHING AS YOU KNOW AS I SAID WO NT GO AWAY SO IT WILL BE A GOOD TOPIC FOR ME IN THE CLASS FOR ALONG TIME .
BECAUSE I TEACH HISTORY SO .
RIGHT RIGHT AND UM WHAT ABOUT THE WHOLE SITUATION WITH THE REFUGEES THE KURDS .
WELL I WOULD JUST THINK IF BUSH WAS SO SUCCESSFUL IN LINING UP THE CORRELATION TO PROSECUTE A WAR THEN HE SHOULD BE EQUALLY SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING THAT SAME CORRELATION TO PUSH THE UNITED NATIONS TO UH UH SOMEHOW PERSUADE THOSE NATIONS TO GIVE THE KURDS A HOMELAND THEY WERE PROMISED THAT MUMBLEX .
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE PALESTINIANS .
WELL THAT S THE SAME THING THEY UH THEY HAVE NT BEEN WAITING QUITE AS LONG EVEN THOUGH THEY VE BEEN WAITING SINCE FORTYEIGHT .
RIGHT RIGHT .
UH THAT THAT BECOMES A DIFFERENT MATTER SIMPLY BECAUSE YOUR DEALING WITH ISRAEL AND THEY SEEM TO BE MORE INTRACTABLE THAN EVER .
HUHUH .
UH THAT SHAMIR CA NT CA NT RETAIN HIS LEADERSHIP IF HE IF HE BACKS DOWN THE SLIGHTEST BIT SO UH I JUST DO NT SEE US I DO NT THINK THERE S ANYBODY OF OF MAJOR STATURE ON THE SCENE OF LIKE THE GREAT STATESMAN OF THE PAST .
HUHUH HUHUH .
OR AT LEAST WE THOUGHT THEY WERE I M NOT FOR SURE THAT THEY WERE THEY SEEM TO HAVE GOTTEN US INTO SOME OF THESE MESSES .
HUHUH WELL DO YOU THINK THE U S SHOULD EVEN BE INVOLVED I MEAN AS THE WORLD LEADER IN THE SENSE TRYING TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES OR SHOULD WE HAVE JUST STAYED OUT OF IT .
WELL I WISH WE COULD STAY OUT OF IT BUT THE OIL IS NOT GOING TO ALLOW US TO WE ABSOLUTELY NEED THAT OIL THAT S THE MAJOR THING IF WE DID NT NEED THE OIL AND IF WE DID NT HAVE THE TIES WITH THE ISRAELIS WE COULD PROBABLY STAY OUT OF IT .
RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT .
BUT I M NOT FOR SURE THAT WE RE NOT DESTINED AT LEAST FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE AS LONG AS WE CAN KEEP OUR HEAD OUR OWN HEAD ABOVE WATER TO BE THE WORLD LEADER SO I BUSH IS PROBABLY IF HE CAN KEEP THAT CORRELATION TOGETHER ESPECIALLY THE FRENCH AND THE BRITISH AND THE GERMANS AND BE SURE THAT THE JAPANESE CAN KICK IN SOME OF THEIR MONEY THEY MAY JUST HAVE TO I DO NT KNOW WHAT TYPE OF PRESSURE THEY CAN PUT ON ALL THE NATIONS THERE TOO BECAUSE NOW THAT THE WAR IS OVER SOCIETIES HAVE JUST ABOUT GONE BACK TO THEIR OWN .
HUHUH .
UH UH COLD SELVES AND I WOULD NT HAVE NECESSARILY FOUGHT FOR THE KUWAITIS THEY UH THEY RE NOBODY LIKES THEM IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD BUT UH IT S JUST SUCH A VOLATILE AREA I MEAN THERE S JUST NO STABILITY PERIOD .
RIGHT BUT IN A SENSE I DO NT KNOW THAT I WOULD SAY IT S GOOD IN A SENSE I M GLAD THAT SAUDI WAS NT MORE CHANGED BY BY THE SITUATION BECAUSE .
HUHUH .
I MEAN WE REALLY DO NT I MEAN I DO NT THINK IT S OUR WORLD TO WESTERNIZE THE WHOLE WORLD .
ABSOLUTELY .
SO THE FACT THAT THE SAUDI COULD JUST SORT OF PULL BACK AND UH REMAIN YOU KNOW CULTURALLY SORT OF CLEAN IS INTERESTING .
YEAH I THINK YOU RE RIGHT I IT S NOT OUR UH ROLE TO MAKE EVERYBODY LIKE US .
HUHUH .
BUT IT S JUST UH FOR THOSE WHO HAVE MAY HAVE WANTED TO TRAVEL IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD THAT ARE UP IN THE AGE I AM IT S GOING TO ELIMINATE THAT FOR AWHILE .
RIGHT RIGHT .
I THINK IT S GOING TO BE TOO DANGEROUS TO BE ANY PLACE IN THERE .
WELL YOU KNOW I MEAN I ACTUALLY LIVED IN BEIRUT FROM SIXTYEIGHT TO EIGHTYFOUR .
OH DID YOU .
AND SO I MEAN IT S BEEN MUMBLEX DANGEROUS FOR SOMETIME .
YES .
I M NOT SURE THAT IT S CHANGED THAT MUCH .
YEAH WELL I I HAVE NT BEEN TO BEIRUT BUT I VE HEARD WHAT A WONDERFUL CITY THAT IT S JUST TOTALLY GONE TO UH .
WELL SEE THAT S IT IT REALLY HAS NT .
IT HAS NT MUMBLEX .
EXACTLY IT DEPENDS ON WHETHER ONE TALKS PHYSICAL OR OR SORT OF CULTURAL CULTURALLY I MEAN IT S OBVIOUSLY CHANGED A LOT BECAUSE IT S MORE OF A SURVIVAL CITY BUT THE BUILDINGS ARE STILL INTACT AND STILL BEAUTIFUL YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THERE WAS GARBAGE ON THE CORNER WHEN I GOT THERE AND THERE S GARBAGE WHEN I LEFT BUT I MEAN IT S JUST A DIFFERENT CULTURAL ASPECT I MEAN THE TRUCKS DO NT COME DAILY AND YOU REALLY DO NT WANT THE GARBAGE IN YOUR HOUSE SO AND I MEAN I TRAVELED IN THE AREA TOO AND UM SO THAT MANY OF THE COUNTRIES TURKEY AND SYRIA ARE THE SAME AS THEY WERE FOR TRAVELING .
THAT S ONE PART OF THE WORLD I VE BEEN TO NORTH AFRICA A LOT BUT NOT UM I HAVE NT BEEN TO BEIRUT OR SYRIA OR BAGHDAD .
YEAH I WAS NEVER ABLE TO GO TO BAGHDAD IT WAS I NEVER COULD GET A VISA SO EVEN BEFORE SO EVEN WHEN THINGS WERE GOOD IN THE MIDDLE EAST AMERICANS WERE NT REALLY GIVEN VISAS TO GO INTO BAGHDAD .
RIGHT .
AND UM BUT IT S IT S A VERY BEAUTIFUL PART VERY INTERESTING HISTORICALLY OF COURSE WHICH WAS MY INTEREST MUMBLEX ART HISTORY .
SURE .
SO UH .
WELL I THINK WE VE DONE THEM A GOOD JOB TODAY THEN .
FOR THIS LITTLE PROJECT THEY RE DOING .
RIGHT RIGHT .
IN FACT I JUST TALKED TO THE DIRECTOR AWHILE AGO SO UH HE WAS CHECKING TO SEE IF I WAS GOING TO STAY IN BECAUSE I VE BEEN SO BUSY WITH THIS PRESIDENTIAL SEARCH I HAVE NT HAD A CHANCE TO .
HUHUH .
REALLY DO ANY CALLING MYSELF .
HUHUH I SEE I SEE .
SO UH .
THEN GREAT AND UM YOU KNOW HAVE A GOOD BUSINESS TRIP .
THANK YOU AND YOU CONTINUE MUMBLEX .
OKAY THANK YOU .
BYEBYE .
BYEBYE .
OKAY SO I THINK I THINK WHAT WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT IS UH THE WAR .
OKAY .
THE WAR THAT JUST WENT ON SEE I I DO NT AGREE WITH IT FIRST OF ALL I DO NT BELIEVE IN WAR .
UHHUH .
AND THEN THE UNITED STATES HAS THIS ATTITUDE BY SAYING YOU KNOW THANK YOU FOR KEEPING US OUR FREEDOM AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND I THINK IT S ALL INDEPENDENT BECAUSE IT S IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE UNITED STATES YOU DID NT GAIN ANYTHING FROM IT .
UHHUH .
AND IT WAS NT OUR FREEDOM THAT YOU WERE SAVING IT WAS JUST THE THING THE THING THAT THAT THAT I SAW WAS OKAY IRAQ WANTS TO RAISE OIL PRICES .
UHHUH .
KUWAIT WANTS TO TAKE IRAQ OUT OF THE WHOLE SYSTEM .
UHHUH .
BY LEAVING THEM INDEPENDENT .
UHHUH .
AND SO WHEN IRAQ YOU KNOW SAW THIS THEY SAID LET S TAKE OVER THE COUNTRY WHICH IS A GOOD IDEA RIGHT .
UHHUH .
THEN THE UNITED STATES SAYS OKAY OUR OUR OIL PRICES ARE GOING TO GO UP AND LIKE FOR EXAMPLE SEE OKAY LIKE LITH LITHUANIA RIGHT THEY DECLARED THEMSELVES AN INDEPENDENT COUNTRY WITH A PRESIDENT RIGHT .
UHHUH .
RUSSIA GOES IN THERE WELL THE MAIN GOVERNMENT IN MOSCOW GOES IN THERE AND THEY KICK EVERYBODY S ASS AND THE UNITED STATES DOES NT GO IN THERE AND SAY LISTEN THEY WERE YOU KNOW NAMED AN INDEPENDENT YOU KNOW STATE WITH A PRESIDENT AND EVERYTHING BUT WE RE NOT GOING TO GO INTO YOUR COUNTRY .
UHHUH .
BUT THESE COUNTRIES HERE WHICH YOU KNOW ARE YOU KNOW LIKE IN NINETEEN EIGHTYFOUR HAVE YOU EVER READ THAT BOOK .
NO HUHUH .
OKAY NINETEEN EIGHTYFOUR THERE ARE LIKE THREE BIG CONTINENTS AND UH THERE S JUST THIS AREA LIKE AROUND EGYPT AND STUFF .
UHHUH .
THAT EVERYBODY S FIGHTING OVER NOW THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT NOBODY S GOING TO INVADE ANYBODY ELSE S BOUNDARIES .
UHHUH .
RIGHT LIKE THEIR IMMEDIATE BOUNDARIES LIKE YOU RE NOT GOING TO GO YOU KNOW IT S LIKE THE ARMY S NOT GOING TO GO STRAIGHT INTO RUSSIA BECAUSE THERE YOU RE YOU RE INVADING THEIR BORDER RIGHT .
UHHUH .
BUT ALL THE OTHER COUNTRIES YOU CAN FIGHT ABOUT .
UHHUH .
AND SO THE THING IS IS THAT YOU RE WASTING SO MUCH MONEY TO SEND YOU KNOW IT S LIKE HOW MUCH MONEY DID THE U S SPEND WHEN THEY COULD HAVE PAID SO MUCH MONEY FOR EACH BARREL OF OIL THAT WAS BEING .
WE LL PROBABLY NEVER KNOW HOW MUCH IT ACTUALLY COST .
AND YOU KNOW IT S IT WAS BASICALLY ALL BASED ON OIL BECAUSE NOBODY ACTUALLY LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IF UH LET S SAY IF YOU KNOW BRAZIL TOOK OVER YOU KNOW SURINAM .
UHHUH .
I DO NT THINK ANYBODY WOULD CARE .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW AND UH THAT S SOMETHING THAT THAT HAS BEEN YOU KNOW VERY BECAUSE SEE THE THING IS IS LIKE EVERY TIME THAT I SEE A WAR I SEE MYSELF ON THE FRONT LINE AND ON THE OTHER SIDE I SEE MYSELF AGAIN AND I VE GOT TO SHOOT MYSELF YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
I GOT TO SHOOT SOMEBODY THAT S GOT THE SAME FAMILY THAT I DO YOU KNOW THE SAME RELATIONSHIPS THAT I DO .
UHHUH .
AND JUST BECAUSE I WAS BORN HERE I VE GOT TO SHOOT THEM DOWN .
UHHUH OH IT S NEVER A PLEASANT THING THAT S TRUE .
AND UH BUT AT LEAST IT WAS IT WAS OVER QUICK AND THERE WERE NT THAT MANY DEATHS .
YES THAT S .
NOW THE ONLY PROBLEM IS IS THE AFTERMATH .
YES .
THAT YOU RE HAVING SO MANY DEATHS IN THE BORDER WITH UH TURKEY .
YES THAT S REALLY UNFORTUNATE IT REALLY IS I DO NT KNOW IF WE STOPPED TOO SOON I DO NT I DO NT I REALLY DO NT KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO ABOUT THAT .
WELL THE THERE S SOMETHING THAT THAT THE U S DID RIGHT WHICH IS SAY SAY YOU KNOW OKAY LET S KICK HIM OUT OF KUWAIT WHICH WAS OUR BASIC GOAL .
UHHUH .
AND UH NOW INDIRECTLY LET S TRY TO OVERTHROW HIM YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
AND THEY RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT DIRECTLY BUT THE THING IS IS THAT THEY THEY DID NT GO INTO INTO IRAQ AND SAY YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE FORCE TO GO IN THERE AND SAY GET OUT OF THE COUNTRY .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW YOU CAN SEEK SEEK ASYLUM HERE .
YEAH .
AND YOU CAN GO THERE BUT NO WAY ARE YOU GOING TO RULE EVER AGAIN .
UHHUH I VE BEEN HEARING SOME TALK TOO OF TRYING TO BRING HUSSEIN UP ON YOU KNOW CRIMINAL CHARGES I DO NT KNOW IF THAT WILL EVER HAPPEN OR NOT .
WELL THE THING IS IS THAT FIRST OF ALL THEY GOT TO THEY GO THEY HAVE TO GET HIM .
UHHUH WHICH IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DO .
AND AND THERE S NO WAY THAT YOU CAN GET THEM UNLESS IT S BY FORCE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND THEN YOU CAN PUT HIM ON TRIAL .
OBVIOUSLY HE S NOT GOING TO TURN HIMSELF IN .
NO NO I THINK I THINK HE D RATHER COMMIT SUICIDE THAN TURN HIMSELF IN .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE THERE S I MEAN THERE S LIKE IT S LIKE THERE S NO HOPE YOU KNOW LIKE WHAT HITLER DID YOU KNOW YOU KNOW LIKE IF YOU WERE GOING TO PUT ON TRIAL YOU GET TO LIVE THE REST OF YOUR LIFE BUT WHERE .
TRUE YEAH UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND SO UM THE THING IS IS THAT ONCE YOU VE DONE SOMETHING WRONG WHICH IS NATIO .

BUT IT S JUST IT S JUST THAT UH YOU KNOW I YOU KNOW LIKE THE WE JUST PUT OUR GOALS IN DIFFERENT YOU KNOW LEVELS IS LIKE SAYING YOU KNOW IT S LIKE YEAH SURE WE NEED OIL YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
AND WE NEED IT DESPERATELY .
YEAH .
BUT THE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT YOU KNOW THAT HAVE OIL BUT NOT AS BIG YOU KNOW LIKE THEY SAY YOU KNOW LIKE WHEN THE PRICES WENT UP AND THEN THEY WENT DOWN .
UHHUH .
WHEN THEY TOOK THAT BIG DIP IT WAS BECAUSE THEY DISCOVERED ANOTHER BIG OIL WELL SOMEWHERE IN SAUDI ARABIA .

UHHUH .
YOU KNOW IT S LIKE YOU RE SAYING OKAY I CAN BRING MY PRICES UP TO A DOLLAR FIFTY A GALLON AND I M NOT GOING TO BRING THEM BACK DOWN TO YOU KNOW NINETYNINE CENTS .

THAT S TRUE .
TO SHOOT UP IN THAT WAY .

I END UP HAVING TO QUIT FOR A WHILE .
BUT I GET BLISTERS ON MY TOES ON THE BOTTOM BECAUSE .
OH WOW .

I WISH THAT I COULD MAKE MYSELF EXERCISE EVERY DAY .
BUT I DO FORCE MYSELF TO DO IT AT LEAST THREE TIMES .
A WEEK .
WHICH .
I DO NT FEEL LIKE IS ENOUGH BUT I IT S IT S AT LEAST .
SOMETHING .
YOU KNOW IT IT I JUST FORCE I HAVE TO FORCE MYSELF TO DO IT LIKE I SAID BECAUSE TO ME I REALLY DO NT ENJOY IT .
BUT I KNOW THAT I HAVE TO DO IT .
I MEAN IT S JUST IT S IT S NOT A QUESTION OF WHETHER I WANT TO YOU KNOW .
WELL .
BUT .
WHEN I WAS WORKING UP AT UH THE SUMMIT .

HERE IN PLANO I D LEAVE THERE AND I D BE AT THE SWIMMING POOL BY FOUR OCLOCK .
OH THAT S .
OH ACTUALLY ABOUT FOUR THIRTY BECAUSE THEY START AT FIVE TO SIX SO I WAS THERE BY FOUR THIRTY EVERY NIGHT .
AND THE ONLY THING .
THAT EVER BOTHERED ME WAS MY HAIR GETTING WET .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE NO MATTER .
WHAT .
I DID OR HOW I DID IT I INVARIABLY GOT MYSELF WET .
UHHUH .
BUT THE WATER ONLY COMES UP BASICALLY TO YOUR ANYWHERE FROM YOUR WAIST TO YOUR OH CHEST I D SAY .

IT S GOING TO BOTHER ME .
UM .
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU RE ON CEMENT OR ANYTHING .
THAT S HARD IT WILL BOTHER ME .
THEN THAT WOULD YEAH .
IT WILL BOTHER ME .
I GUESS THEN THE WATER AEROBICS WOULD BE PROBABLY THE BEST THING FOR YOU WOULD NT IT .
WELL THAT WHAT PUSHED ME .
THAT WAY THOUGH WAS BASICALLY WAS THE FACT THAT WHEN I WENT IN THERE IS WAS NT FOR THE WATER AEROBICS .
I WENT IN THERE STRICTLY TO STRENGTHEN MY BACK MUSCLES .
OH .
AND UH SHE SAID HEY GO FOR THE SWIMMING POOL .
SHE SAYS YOU GET JUST AS MUCH IF YOU DID THE AEROBICS ON THE FLOOR .
SHE SAYS IN FACT .
YOU GET MORE .
WOW .
I SAID OKAY BECAUSE I M NOT A SWIMMER .
UHHUH .
I LIKE WATER .
I M NOT SCARED OF IT .
BUT I COULD NT I GUESS I COULD SWIM ACROSS THE POOL BUT I M NO SWIMMER PER SE .
YEAH .
BUT I FOUND THAT THIS WORKED REALLY WELL .
AND I CAME OUT OF THERE AND I SAW MY STOMACH GOING DOWN WELL .
OH .
I DROPPED OH I D SAY ALMOST TWENTY POUNDS .
WOW .
JUST BY WATCHING WHAT .
I ATE .
AND THEY FIX YOU UP WITH A DIET WHICH WORKED REAL GOOD .
WHAT IF YOU RE ALREADY ON ONE .
I MEAN .
WHAT .
A DIET .

AND THE V I P GIVES YOU UH OH GIVES YOU .
A DIET A COMPUTERIZED DIET .
AND THEY GO OVER ALL YOUR HEALTH AND ALL YOUR HISTORY AND THEY SHOW YOU HOW EVERYTHING TO DO AND HOW TO DO IT AND THE WHOLE NINE YARDS .
SO IT BECAME PART OF THE PACKAGE SO I WENT THROUGH IT .
IT WORKED OUT WELL .
BUT THEY HAVE PACKAGES WHERE THEY JUST OFFER THE EXERCISE PROGRAM .
IS THAT WHAT .
YOU RE SAYING .
OH YEAH .
YOU CAN JUST GO IN THERE AND JOIN JUST LIKE ANYWHERE ELSE TOO .
I SEE OKAY .
I JUST WENT AND TOOK THE BECAUSE THEY WERE OFFERING IT AS AN OPENING BENEFIT SO IT WAS IT S LESS THAN WHAT .
YOU PAY NOW FOR GOING IN THERE .

AFTER ALL THIS TIME .
SO IT .
S LIKE WHEN I GOT LAID OFF I WENT BACK IN THERE AND START ALL OVER AGAIN BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN A WHILE SINCE I D DONE IT .
UM .
SO I GET ALL THE SAME TREATMENT AGAIN .
SO IT S KIND OF NICE .
WOW .
THAT S .
LIKE I SAID I LIKE IT .
I LIKE THE HEAT .
I LIKE THE I JUMP OUT OF THE SWIMMING POOL AND I GO INTO THE HOT TUB .
OH .
AND I LOVE IT .
YEAH .
THAT WOULD BE REALLY NICE .
BECAUSE I HAVE N I HAVE NEVER LET ME REWORD THAT I THINK I HAVE GONE HOME MAYBE ONCE OR TWICE SLIGHTLY SORE .
BUT THAT S BECAUSE OF MY PHYSICAL CONDITION AND NOTHING TO DO WHAT .
THEY DID .
UHHUH .
THAT S I KNEW I WAS PUSHING TOO FAR .
UHHUH .
BUT USUALLY WHEN I GO INTO THE HOT TUB BEFORE I GO SWIMMING OR WHEN I COME OUT I M TOTALLY RELAXED WHEN I GO HOME .
IT S NO BIG DEAL .
SO YOU REALLY DO ENJOY YOUR EXERCISE THEN SINCE YOUR .

I MEAN I DO NT KNOW IF IT WOULD REALLY DO ANY GOOD HAVING BOTH OF THEM .
WHICH .
ONE DO YOU FEEL IS BETTER SINCE YOU USE THEM .

LIKE YOU SAID YOU CAN SIT AND DO IT AND WATCH THE T V AND NOT EVEN REALLY BE CONSCIOUS OF WHAT .
YOU ARE DOING .
UHHUH .
WITH THE STEPPER YOU ARE CONSCIOUS OF WHAT .

OKA OKAY BYEBYE .

WELL WHAT ARE YOUR DID YOU LIKE DO YOU USE CREDIT CARDS .
UH NOT VERY OFTEN I USUALLY UH THE ONES WE USE IS LIKE VISA AND WE ALWAYS TRY TO PAY IT BACK AT THE END OF THE MONTH .
HUHUH .
I HAVE UH UH .
SO IT DOES NT GET UH UH THE CREDIT UH .
RIGHT .
THE INTEREST RATE IS SO HIGH THAT YOU RE REALLY IF YOU RE GOING TO USE CREDIT CARDS YOU NEED TO USE THAT POLICY I THINK DO NT YOU .
YEAH .
OTHERWISE YOU END UP PAYING SO MUCH MORE FOR YOUR MERCHANDISE THAT IT S HARDLY .
THAT S RIGHT .
UH IT S NOT A VERY GOOD IDEA .
DO YOU HAVE A LOT OF CREDIT CARDS .
WELL I HAVE A LOT OF THEM BUT I DO NT USE THEM VERY MUCH THOUGH .
RIGHT .
I USE THEM MOSTLY FOR BIG THINGS LIKE MAYBE SOMETIMES UH TUITION IF IT S YOU KNOW IF I M SHORT TO GO AHEAD AND GET IT AND THEN TRY TO GET IT SAVED BACK AS QUICK AS I CAN THE OTHER THING I I THINK IF YOU DO GET OVEREXTENDED A LITTLE BIT YOU NEED TO BE SURE AND PAY IT OFF UH MORE THAN ONE AT A TIME BECAUSE I THINK YOU COULD RUN FOREVER PAYING WHAT THEY REQUIRE .
OH YEAH .
JUST GOES ON AND ON .
WHICH IS WHAT THEY WANT .
YEAH .
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE GO IN DEBT BECAUSE THEY THINK OH YOU KNOW I CAN JUST CHARGE IT BUT REALLY I MEAN IF THEY DO NT HAVE THE MONEY THEN THEY ARE NT GOING TO HAVE IT IN A MONTH SO .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
THEY UH MAKE THE MISTAKE OF .
THERE ARE TIMES .
PUSHING ALL THEIR CARDS .
WHEN IT S WHEN IT S VERY USEFUL .
YEAH .
LIKE UH EMERGENCY TRIP .
YEAH .
OR SOMETHING SOMETIMES WHEN YOU WHEN YOU THE MONEY WILL BE AVAILABLE BUT IT S YOU KNOW NOT IMMEDIATELY HANDY I THINK UH THEY RE VERY HELPFUL PLUS THE FACT THAT IT S HELPFUL NOT TO HAVE TO CARRY A LOT OF MONEY SOMETIMES .
RIGHT .
BUT UH I YOU REALLY DO NEED TO BE VERY UM OH RESPONSIBLE ABOUT IT OR YOU END UP IN DEEP TROUBLE .
YEAH I MADE THAT MISTAKE WHEN I FIRST GOT A JOB AND THAT S KIND OF LIKE IT TOOK ME QUITE A WHILE TO PAY THEM OFF .
UHHUH .
SO AF AFTER THAT I DECIDED WELL I M NOT GOING TO USE THEM AT ALL AND JUST TRY TO PAY CASH FOR EVERYTHING AND THAT WORKED FOR A WHILE AND THEN WE GOT MARRIED SO WE DECIDED TO YOU KNOW IF WE USED THEM WE WOULD PAY THEM OFF AS WE GO .
RIGHT .
SO .
RIGHT THAT CAN BE VERY HANDY UNDER THOSE KIND OF CIRCUMSTANCES THE OTHER THING ABOUT THEM IS TOO IF YOU REALLY DO NT YOU REALLY NEED TO GET SOME AND USE THEM BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE NEVER USED THEM AND DEVELOPED AND HAVE NT DEVELOPED A CREDIT THING IT STOPS YOU FROM DOING A LOT OF THINGS IF YOU .
RIGHT .
IF YOU PAY FOR EVERYTHING BY CASH UH THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WILL NOT GIVE YOU CREDIT WHEN YOU NEED SOMETHING LIKE A HOUSE OR .
THAT S TRUE YEAH .
A CAR SO SO THEY THEY HAVE BECOME A VERY VITAL PART OF OUR OF OUR MONETARY SYSTEM .
UHHUH .
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS BUT UH IT S TRUE YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL OR YOU END UP UH GOING IN THE DEEP END AND UH AND AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE ARE IN TROUBLE .
UHHUH .
WE HAVE A BOY LIVING WITH US WHO WORKS FOR A CREDIT CARD UH COMPANY THAT AND HE MAKES CALLS TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE PROBLEMS YOU KNOW CREDIT PROBLEMS .
HUHUH .
THAT ARE TRYING TO WORK OUT AND UH POOR THING HE COMES HOME VERY DEPRESSED EVERY NIGHT .
OH .
BECAUSE THE WORLD HAS SO MANY PROBLEMS OF THAT SORT SO IT S .
YEAH .
IT S UH IT S UH IT S A REALLY BIG PROBLEM I THINK AND UM TAKES MATURE PEOPLE TO TO TREAT IT UH SO THAT IT S SO THAT IT S A REAL ADVANTAGE TO YOU INSTEAD OF A DISADVANTAGE .
RIGHT I THINK UM THE WAY THE TAX SYSTEM WAS THEY ENCOURAGED PEOPLE TO USE CREDIT CARDS YOU KNOW WITH A BIG WRITE OFF AT THE END OF THE YEAR .
YEAH .
BUT NOW IT S LIKE IT S PUNCH MONEY BECAUSE .
RIGHT IT DID NT DO YOU ANY GOOD NOW DOES IT .
YOU CAN NOT RIGHT YOU CAN NOT WRITE OFF YOUR INTEREST .
EVEN BEFORE IT PROBABLY WAS NT THOUGH BECAUSE YOU DID NT GET ANYWHERE NEAR AS MUCH AS WHAT IT .
YEAH .
YOU DID NT GET TO CLAIM ANYWHERE NEAR WHAT YOU ENDED UP PAYING SO WELL I M NOT OTHER THAN THAT I DO NT HAVE TOO MUCH ON CREDIT CARDS BUT .
IT S GOOD TO TALK TO YOU .
YEAH YOU TOO THANKS FOR CALLING .
UHHUH BYE NOW .
BYE .
OKAY .
WHAT UH GO AHEAD AND TELL ME ABOUT YOUR HOME .
WELL MY HOME AT THE MOMENT IS AN APARTMENT .
OH IS THAT RIGHT .
YEAH .
I WORK HERE IN GERMANTOWN BUT I LIVE IN PENSACOLA FLORIDA .
OH THAT S INTERESTING .
SO I OWN A HOME IN PENSACOLA AND UH LET S SEE WE ARE TO COMPARE HOMES .
CORRECT .
OKAY .
YEAH .
UH MY HOME IS WELL IS TYPICAL FOR THE AREA .
I LIVE IN A DEVELOPMENT UH IT S A RELATIVELY I WOULD SAY WELL GOD IT SOUNDS LIKE SOUNDS LIKE I M BRAGGING .
NO THAT S OKAY .
BUT IT S UPPER MIDDLE CLASS .
OKAY .
UH KIND OF AN ENVIRONMENT .
IT S A TWO STORY COLONIAL WHICH .
MY WIFE AND I DESIGNED .
OH THAT S NEAT .
UH IT HAS AROUND THIRTYTWO HUNDRED SQUARE FEET .
WOW THAT S LARGE .
UH FIVE BEDROOMS AND SO FORTH AND SO ON AND IT IS I WOULD IMAGINE IN TERMS OF OF SIZE AND SO FORTH IT S RELATIVELY TYPICAL FOR THE AREA .
IT MIGHT BE I WOULD SAY IT S PROBABLY MIDSIZED FOR THE AREA .
THERE ARE SOME SMALLER AND THERE ARE S YOU KNOW SEVERAL LARGER .
UHHUH .
AND UH .
BUT BASED YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW IN IN PENSACOLA IN THAT AREA OF FLORIDA IT UH IT S WHAT NOW IT IS UH PROBABLY TEN YEARS OLD .
OH WELL THAT S NOT TOO BAD .
YEAH .
THAT S STILL FAIRLY NEW .
AND SO IT S IN TERMS OF COST AND AND AND SIZE AND SO FORTH IT UH THE HOU YOU KNOW HOUSING THERE IS EXTREMELY AFFORDABLE AND UH COMPARED TO OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY YOU KNOW LET S SAY COMPARED TO MARYLAND .
WELL .
THAT SAME HOUSE HERE WOULD PROBABLY COST THREEQUARTERS OF A MILLION DOLLARS BUT .
OH YOU RE KIDDING .
WELL DO YOU MIND IF I ASK WHAT .
IT S WORTH DOWN THERE I MEAN WHAT .
IT S .
I REALLY HAVE NT I REALLY HAVE NT UH WHEN WE BUILT IT .
TEN YEARS AGO IT WAS IT RAN AROUND A HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS .
OKAY .
SO I I WOULD HAVE REALLY I HAVE NT REALLY PRICED YOU KNOW IN THE MARKET .
SO I .
IT IT SOUNDS LIKE I MEAN FROM THE WAY .
YOU DESCRIBED IT .
A HOME LIKE THAT HERE WOULD BE AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND .
UHHUH .
I MEAN DALLAS IS A VERY MARKED UP AREA ALTHOUGH RIGHT NOW IT S A LOT LOWER .
UHHUH .
UM BECAUSE OF ALL THE LAYOFFS AND EVERYTHING THE ECONOMY AROUND HERE IS REAL POOR .
I THOUGHT THAT WAS ON THE UPSWING AGAIN NOW .
WELL NO NOT REALLY .
UHHUH .
UM THE AREA .
ITSELF UH THE FORT WORTH DALLAS AREA UM HAS BECOME KIND OF DEPRESSED BECAUSE THERE S BEEN SO MANY LAYOFFS WITH BIG COMPANIES INCLUDING TEXAS INSTRUMENTS .
YES .
UM THERE S BEEN TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF OF UH LAYOFFS SO REALLY HOUSING IS REAL BAD .
THE ECONOMY .
ITSELF AROUND HERE IS NOT TOO TERRIBLY BAD BUT HOUSING IS STILL REAL BAD .
UHHUH .
YEAH .
WELL PENSACOLA HAS IT S REALLY IS A BUYER S MARKET THERE NOW .
YEAH .
THIS IS .
AND IT IS NT BECAUSE OF THE WELL THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF SPECULATIVE BUILDING .
OH .
UH I DO NT KNOW PERHAPS NOT IN DALLAS BUT UH I M SURE PEOPLE IN UH YOU KNOW IN UH GALVESTON AND SO FORTH WOULD BE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT IT UH PENSACOLA IS A NAVY TOWN .
UHHUH .
AND HOME PORTING WAS A POSSIBILITY .
A FEW YEARS AGO .
OH .
THEY WERE EXPECTING AN INFLUX OF SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE OR MORE FROM THE NAVY .
WOW .
MUMBLEX A NEW CARRIER WAS COMING IN AND UH THE UH ATTENDANT UH SUPPORT VESSELS .
WELL THAT S NO LONGER .
SO DO YOU THINK .
THE CASE .
IT WAS OVERDEVELOPED THEN .
OH IT S IT IS .
I MEAN THE THE NUMBER OF SINGLE FAMILY UNITS ON SALE IS PHENOMENAL COMPARED TO THE POPULATION .
WOW .
AND SO I OVERBUILDING IS I HAS BEEN A REAL PROBLEM THERE .
UM .
SO YOU CAN STILL GET A GET A A GOOD HOUSE FOR A VERY VERY REASONABLE PRICE .
AND I MEAN GOOD I WOULD LET S SAY TYPICAL SAY THREE BEDROOM UH TWO AND A HALF BATHS ON A HALF ACRE OR SO OF LAND UH REASONABLE CONSTRUCTION WOULD PROBABLY RUN YOU UH RIGHT NOW ANYWHERE BETWEEN SOMEWHERE BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND A HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS .
UM .
AND PROBABLY PERHAPS .
YEAH .
CHEAPER DEPENDING UPON THE NEIGHBORHOOD .
YEAH .
WHAT ABOUT YOUR HOME .
WELL RIGHT NOW WE RE JUST RENTING BUT IT IS A HOME .
UM .
UHHUH .
IT S A FOUR BEDROOM HOME .
IT HAS ABOUT I GUESS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED SQUARE FEET .
IT S ON ONE FLOOR .
UHHUH .
UH WE HAVE NO BASEMENT .
I DO NT KNOW .
NOR DO WE BUT .
OKAY .
I WAS NT SURE .
MOST OF THE ONES .
YOU KNOW UP NORTH AND EVERYTHING DO BUT UM ANYWAY IT S UH IT S PRETTY ALSO PRETTY TYPICAL FOR THE AREA .
MOST OF THIS AREA WAS DEVELOPED THIS HOUSE WAS BUILT IN SEVENTYFOUR .
UHHUH .
SO MOST OF THE IT S ALMOST TWENTY YEARS OLD AND MOST OF THE HOUSES AROUND HERE WERE BUILT PRETTY MUCH THE SAME STYLE .
UH WE HAVE A FRIEND .
THAT LIVES TWO BLOCKS OVER AND HIS HOUSE IS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO US EXCEPT HIS IS THREE BEDROOMS AND OURS IS FOUR .
UHHUH .
BUT OTHERWISE THE LAYOUT IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME .
SO I I THINK MOST OF THEM ARE THERE WAS IT LIKE MOST AREAS .
THAT ARE BUILT UM THERE WERE PROBABLY LIKE TWO OR THREE STYLES YOU COULD CHOOSE FROM .
RIGHT .
AND AND UH THAT S PRETTY MUCH ALL THE HOUSES IN THE AREA FOR PROBABLY A SQUARE MILE I D SAY AT LEAST MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THAT .
WELL THE HOUSING HERE IN MARYLAND IS JUST ATROCIOUS .
AND IN IN THE ENTIRE D C AREA .
I M I M ONLY ABOUT UH TWELVE MILES OR SO FROM THE UH BORDER OF WASHINGTON D C AND MONTGOMERY COUNTY MARYLAND IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE .
WHERE ARE YOU IN RELATION TO SEVREN .
PLACES TO .
ARE YOU CLOSE TO SEVREN .
NO WE ARE WEST .
OKAY .
SEVREN IS EAST NEAR THE EASTERN SHORE .
WELL I JUST .
IF I HAD .
I HAVE A SISTER .
THAT USED TO LIVE IN SEVREN .
UHHUH .
AND THEY BOUGHT THEIR HOME IN I I WANT TO SAY LIKE AROUND NINETEEN SEVENTYFIVE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND THEY PAID LIKE THEY THEY HAD IT BUILT FROM YOU KNOW THEY THEY DESIGNED IT AND EVERYTHING AND TO HAVE IT BUILT THEY ONLY PAID FORTY THOUSAND FOR IT AND WHEN THEY LEFT THE AREA .
THEY SOLD IT FOR A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND .
OH THAT S NOT UNUSUAL YEAH .
YEAH SO I JUST WONDERED YOU KNOW IF THE WHOLE AREA WAS LIKE THAT OR .
WELL THAT S THAT AREA OVER THERE IS NOT AS EXPENSIVE AS IN THE THE IMMEDIATE YOU KNOW WASHINGTON AREA .
UHHUH .
AND SO WE UH I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR EXAMPLE .
THERE IS A UH CONDOMINIUM COMPLEX NEXT TO THE APARTMENT COMPLEX WHERE I LIVE AND I WAS OVER THERE RECENTLY LOOKING AT THE POSSIBILITY OF BUYING A TWO BEDROOM CONDOMINIUM .
AND NINETYTWO THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A TWO BEDROOM WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY A TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT .
UM .
NOW IT WAS VERY NICELY DONE .
YEAH .
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT .
SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY THOUGH .
YES .
I .
SURE .
I CA NT I CA NT ENVISION SPENDING THAT MUCH MONEY AND ON ON SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES .
YEAH .
SO YOU KNOW IT S Y I GUESS YOU PAY THE PIPER BUT .
RIGHT .
PLUS THE THE THE TAXES AROUND HERE ARE PHENOMENALLY .
OH YEAH .
HIGH .
UH FOR THE AND SO YOU ON THAT IT S NOT UNUSUAL FOR EXAMPLE FOR SOMEWHERE AROUND HERE ON A ON A ON A WHAT .
WE WOULD YOU KNOW WHAT .
YOU DESCRIBED AS YOUR HOUSE AND WHAT .
I WOULD DESCRIBE AS MY HOUSE SAY FOR EXAMPLE IN PENSACOLA FLORIDA ON THAT HOUSE WITH THE HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION AND SO FORTH AND SO ON MIGHT PAY THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS .
A YEAR TAXES .
WOW .
MAY .
YEAH .
MAYBE YOU KNOW MAYBE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN THAT NOW BUT THAT SAME HOUSE HERE YOU D PAY ALMOST SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS .
A YEAR .
TAXES ON IT .
WOW .
WOW THAT S .
SO IT S UH .
SO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER TO BUY HERE OR MOVE TO ANOTHER COUNTY SAY DRIVE TWENTY MORE MILES NORTH BUY A CONDOMINIUM FOR APPROXIMATELY UH THE SAME PRICE MAYBE A LITTLE LOWER BUT THE TAXES WOULD BE YOU KNOW PERHAPS MAYBE ONETHIRD .
REALLY .
UH OF .
THAT MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE .
OH ABSOLUTELY .
WOW .
YEAH SO .
IT S IT S REALLY SAD .
YEAH .
THIS IS ONE THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST HIGHLY TAXED AREAS IN THE COUNTRY .
WOW .
WHY IS THAT .
DO YOU KNOW .
I MEAN .
WELL THEY IT THE THEIR THEY DO HAVE AN EXTREMELY GOOD SUCH THINGS AS EXTREMELY GOOD SCHOOL SYSTEMS FOR EXAMPLE .
IT HAS ONE OF THE BEST SCHOOL SYSTEMS IN THE COUNTRY .
UHHUH .
UH AND BECAUSE THE COST OF LIVING AROUND HERE IS SO HIGH .
OH .
PUBLIC EMPLOYEES MAKE GREAT SALARIES AROUND HERE .
OH .
I WAS READING JUST RECENTLY WHERE THE TYPICAL ADMINISTRATOR IN THE .
MONTGOMERY COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLS MAKES A AN AND I M NOT THIS IS UH THE FIGURE HE MAKES EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS .
A YEAR .
MY GOODNESS .
THAT S .
WOW .
AND I BY ADMINISTRATOR .
I I THINK I MEAN I THEY DID NT THEY DID NOT DEFINE IT BUT FOR EXAMPLE A CURRICULUM SUPERVISOR OR PRINCIPAL OR SOMEONE YOU KNOW IN THAT UH IN THAT RANGE .
WELL THERE S BEEN A LOT OF PUBLICITY LATELY ABOUT THAT NEW NANCY REAGAN BOOK OUT BY UH KITTY KELLY THE UNAUTHORIZED BIOGRAPHY ARE YOU INTERESTED IN THAT AT ALL .
NOT REALLY I M NOT MUCH OF A FAN OF NANCY REAGAN SO I I DO NT PARTICULARLY READ UM BIOGRAPHIES OR AUTOBIOGRAPHIES .
UHHUH .
I HAVE NT READ TOO MANY I I M MORE OF A FICTION AND NONFICTION READER THAT N N NOT OF THAT NATURE THOUGH .
UHHUH WELL I THE REASON WHY I WAS THINKING ABOUT LOOKING AT IT IS BECAUSE IT S SUPPOSED TO I M NOT A FAN OF NANCY REAGAN AND SO IT S SUPPOSED TO HAVE A LOT OF UNFLATTERING THINGS IN IT AND I THOUGHT JUST PURELY FOR ENTERTAINMENT I MIGHT ENJOY THAT BUT I I WOULD NT WANT TO GO OUT AND BUY IT LIKE YOU KNOW THE HARD BACK COPY OF IT .
YEAH .
BUT I MIGHT CHECK .
IF THEY IF THEY HAD IT I DO NT EVEN KNOW THAT I D PROBABLY READ IT EVEN IF IT WAS AT THE LIBRARY THOUGH .
REALLY .
I I JUST YOU KNOW I M JUST NOT REALLY INTERESTED IN READING ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE S LIVES TO THAT DEGREE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW UNLESS MAYBE THEY LIVED A LONG LONG TIME AGO FOR ME IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO FIND OUT WHAT LIFE WAS UH L LIKE YOU KNOW IN THAT PERIOD BUT .
UHHUH .
NOT NOT REALLY INTERESTED .
IN BIOGRAPHIES WELL I UH .
MUMBLEX .
I HAVE READ SOME BIOGRAPHIES I PREFER TO READ IF I READ A BIOGRAPHY IT S MOSTLY BECAUSE MAYBE I HAVE TO UH YOU KNOW BACK WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL I HAD TO HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT PERSON OR UM PREPARING SOME KIND OF LESSON AND I NEED TO HAVE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT PEOPLE BUT I I DO LIKE TO READ SOME BIOGRAPHIES BUT THAT ONE JUST SOUNDED LIKE GOSSIPY AND I WOULD NT WANT TO SIT DOWN AND JUST READ IT COVER TO COVER BUT FLIP THROUGH JUST FOR JUST TO GET A GOOD LAUGH .
YEAH I THINK THE LAST BIOGRAPHY THAT I READ I M NOT I THINK IT WAS IT WAS UM ON LADY RANDOLPH CHURCHILL .
UHHUH .
CHURCHILL S MOTHER AND THAT WAS EXCELLENT .
WAS IT .
UM YEAH IT WAS IT S IN TWO PARTS I THINK THE FIRST ONE IS CALLED JENNY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT UH BECAUSE THAT WAS HER NAME AND UM .
UHHUH .
I ONLY GOT TO READ ONE PART OF IT AND I VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU KNOW THE OTHER HALF OF IT AND READ THE I READ THAT HALF WHERE SHE WAS IN HER LATER YEARS AND IT WAS ABSOLUTELY EXCELLENT AND IT WAS VERY DESCRIPTIVE OF OF PEOPLE WITH MONEY BACK THEN AND UH AFFLUENTS IN ENGLAND UH THAT YOU KNOW WERE ASSOCIATED TO THE KING AND ALL AND IT WAS .
UHHUH .
REALLY PRETTY FASCINATING AND I AND THAT WAS ACTUALLY A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO SO .
UHHUH .
IT S IT S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I VE READ .
A WHILE .
ANY BIOGRAPHIES UH I LOVE TO READ I MEAN I M CONSTANTLY READING I READ I LIKE UH MYSTERIES AND I LIKE UM AS FAR AS IMPROVING MYSELF UH I HAVE NT READ ANY LATELY BUT I WAS READING CLASSICAL WORKS THAT I HAD NT READ BEFORE .
UHHUM .
YOU KNOW THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE NEEDED TO READ IN SCHOOL BUT THAT I JUST DID NT READ FOR SOME REASON OR ANOTHER ANOTHER OR THAT YOU KNOW THAT YOU CAN ONLY READ SO MANY IN SCHOOL THAT THEY MAKE A REQUIREMENT OF .
RIGHT .
AND YOU HAVE SO MANY OUT THERE THAT UH THAT YOU YOU KNOW YOU NEVER GET A CHANCE TO READ AND SO I SAID WELL I THINK IT WAS BECAUSE I READ UM DICKENS A TALE OF TWO CITIES .
UHHUH .
AND I JUST UM THAT EVEN WHEN I READ IT NOW IT STILL MAKES ME CRY THE ENDING OF IT .
AND I COULD NT BELIEVE I I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT IT TOOK ME SO LONG TO READ SUCH A GOOD BOOK .
UHHUH .
I D READ SOME DICKENS BEFORE BUT I HAD NT READ THAT ONE AND I I WAS LIKE I THOUGHT TO MYSELF YOU KNOW WHAT OTHER THINGS ARE OUT THERE THAT ARE THAT ARE CLASSICS .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THAT HAVE WITHSTOOD TIME AND THAT ARE JUST EXCELLENT SOMETHING S EXCELLENT ABOUT THEM WHETHER IT S THE WAY THEY WERE WRITTEN OR WHETHER IT WAS THE MATERIAL THEY WERE WRITTEN YOU KNOW THAT WAS WRITTEN ABOUT AND UM SO I STARTED READING I HAD THIS LIKE YOU KNOW I HAD A BINGE OF BO MY MOTHER UH I WAS LIVING IN BERMUDA AT THE TIME WITH MY HUSBAND BUT MY UH MOTHER SENT ME YOU KNOW LIKE BOOKL YOU KNOW UH BOXES FULL OF DIFFERENT BOOKS .
OH .
AND UH SHE JUST WOULD GET THEM REAL CHEAP AND STUFF AND SEND THEM OVER BUT SHE SHE IS CONSTANTLY WAS I GUESS BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE UH OLDER PEOPLE HAVE MUCH BETTER UH IN THEIR SCHOOLING THEY THEY GOT MORE OF THE CLASSICS THAN I DID .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND SHE KNOWS SO MUCH MORE OF THEM THAN I DO I WOULD NT EVEN KNOW YOU KNOW TO GO LOOK FOR THAT AUTHOR OR THAT BOOK .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW .
WELL I LIKE THE CLASSICS TOO UH I THINK THAT THERE S A LOT OF BOOKS OUT NOW THAT ARE KIND OF GARBAGE BOOKS AND I WELL I DO NT PREFER TO READ A LOT OF THE THINGS LIKE YOU MIGHT FIND AT UH WELL LIKE AT A TARGET OR A SUPERMARKET OR SOMETHING WHERE THEY HAVE A BUNCH OF BOOKS OUT PAPERBACK TYPE BOOKS USUALLY I I M GOING TO THE BOOK STORE FOR A PARTICULAR REASON UH .
PRO PROBABLY YOU READ A BOOK REVIEW OR SOMETHING .
YES .
A REVIEW ON IT .
YES AND AND UH I BUY SOME OF THE NOT SELFIMPROVEMENT BOOKS BUT UH SELFHELP BOOKS LIKE WE JUST BOUGHT A NEW HOUSE SO I BOUGHT A COUPLE OF BOOKS ABOUT HOW TO BUY A HOUSE AND WHAT TO LOOK FOR YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
AND OR HOW TO REPAIR THIS OR REPAIR THAT IN YOUR OWN HOME I BOUGHT THAT FOR MY HUSBAND AND OR HOW TO HOW TO DO SOMETHING BOOKS YOU KNOW FOR REFERENCE AND UH AND THOSE ARE REALLY HELPFUL I THINK IN HELPING UM WELL YOU KNOW LIKE SOME W SYMPTOMS MEDICAL SYMPTOMS LIKE WHEN HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN TO TAKE YOUR CHILD TO THE DOCTOR OR NOT .
YEAH .
TYPE BOOKS WHICH I USE AS REFERENCE AND HAVE BEEN REAL HANDY BUT PURELY JUST FOR ENJOYMENT I I HAD A MAJOR IN ENGLISH AND LINGUISTICS AND SO I HA HAVE A LOT OF BOOKS IN MY HOME THAT I CAN READ FROM THE CLASSICS AND I DO ENJOY THOSE QUITE A BIT AND UM SO I TEND TO FOR READING JUST DAY TO DAY UH YOU KNOW I HAVE A PARTICULAR BOOK I M LOOKING FOR OR I JUST ENJOY UH YOU KNOW THE NEWSPAPER MAGAZINE .
YEAH .
IT S HANDY .
WELL WHAT I DO IS I USUALLY HAVE TWO BOOKS AT ONE TIME I HAVE A CLASSIC WHICH I HAVE TO WORK ON BASICALLY .
YOU KNOW UH JUST DEPENDING WELL SOME AUTHORS I CAN JUST YOU KNOW BASICALLY DRINK IN .
UHHUH .
BUT OTHERS EH I REALLY DO HAVE TO WORK AT THEM AND THEN UM WHETHER YOU KNOW THEY RE A FOREIGN AUTHOR OR WHATEVER UM OR IF IT S THEIR STYLE OR OR JUST UNDERSTANDING THE MATERIAL AND THEN I YOU KNOW I SOME OF THOSE IT S LIKE I SAID IT S LIKE SCHOOL YOU HAVE TO WORK AT IT .
RIGHT .
BUT TO ME IT S WORTHWHILE IN THE END I FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT AND I USUALLY REMEMBER THOSE A LONG TIME LATER AND THEN I HAVE BOOKS THAT I READ JUST PURELY FOR ENJOYMENT .
LIGHT READING .
YOU KNOW I MEAN YEAH JUST LIGHT READING THAT ARE I PARTICULARLY LIKE DICK FRANCIS BOOKS AND JUST SOME OF THE THE AUTHORS THAT ARE UH FOR MYSTERIES JUST YOU KNOW JUST UH PURELY FOR ENTERTAINMENT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THAT S IT I M NOT REALLY EXPECTING TO GET ANYTHING OUT OF IT .
UHHUH .
EXCEPT TO BE MOMENTARILY PLEASED YOU KNOW BECAUSE I DO NT I CAN NEVER REMEMBER .
THE PLOTS OR ANYTHING .
RIGHT .
LATER ON THOSE BOOKS .
WELL I THINK THAT S GOOD BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE TO USE YOUR MIND AND IMAGINE UP THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND THINGS IT S NOT LIKE UH MOST TELEVISION WHERE YOU YOU KNOW YOU JUST YOU CAN SIT THERE AND NOT EVEN PAY ATTENTION VERY MUCH BUT .
YEAH .
STILL UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON .
YEAH THAT TELEVISION IT GIVES YOU EVERYTHING .
UHHUH .
SO IT S BER BASICALLY MINDLESS I MEAN ALL YOUR Y THE ONLY REALLY THING YOU ARE HAVING TO USE IS CONNECTING THE THINGS THAT THEY GIVE YOU YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
WHAT YOU RE HEARING AND YOUR YOUR SI UH YOUR SIGHT BUT THEY GIVE YOU EVERYTHING ELSE .
RIGHT .
AND IT S USUALLY THE TELEVISION THAT WE SEE NOWADAYS SEEMS LIKE THAT IT S IT S IT DOES NT EVEN HAVE SOME OF THE UNDERLYING UH THINGS TO IT YOU KNOW THAT MAYBE THE OLD MOVIES AND THINGS HAD YOU KNOW THE UNDERLYING THEMES AND STUFF THAT MAYBE YOU HAD TO KIND OF FIGURE OUT .
UHHUH .
OR YOU KNOW LIKE WITH HITCHCOCK OR SOMETHING WHERE YOU RE YOU RE YOU RE EITHER EXPECTING SOMETHING OR W I I DO NT KNOW IT JUST I DO NT REALLY CARE MUCH FOR T V AT ALL I JUST .
I MEAN I SOMETIMES GET HOOKED INTO IT BUT I REALLY I REALLY GET MAD AT MYSELF WHEN I DO BECAUSE I R I REALIZE FULLY THERE S NO REALLY REDEEMING VALUE FOR .
NOT TOO MUCH .
T V NO .
NOT TOO MUCH WELL THAT S RIGHT WELL I THINK IT IS GOOD TO TO READ BOOKS AND AND BECAUSE EVEN IF IT S LIKE YOU SAY IT S LIGHT READING YOU ARE STILL GETTING SOME UH MENTAL EXERCISE .
YEAH YOU RE DEVELOPING YOUR IMAGINATION .
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU DEVELOP YOUR IMAGINATION THAT CAN TAKE YOU INTO A LOT OF OTHER AREAS BECAUSE YOU VE DEVELOPED UH YOUR YOUR YOUR MIND IN IN SEEING THINGS YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
EVEN IF IT S YOUR OWN SET WAY YOU KNOW IT S YOU RE YOU RE TAKING WORDS AND DEVELOPING A PICTURE IN YOUR MIND .
THAT S RIGHT .
SO I MEAN .
THAT S GOOD .
IT S IT S EXCELLENT I I M WE HAVE NT GOT CHILDREN YET BUT I HOPE TO UH SET AN EXAMPLE FOR OURS THAT YOU KNOW THAT READING IS CAN IT CAN BE YOUR BEST FRIEND .
UHHUH .
BASICALLY I MEAN EVEN IF YOU HAVE NT GOT A A F A HUMAN FRIEND AROUND YOU CAN PI PICK UP A BOOK AND AND .
RIGHT .
BE WITH SOMEBODY BASICALLY .
UHHUH I THINK SO WELL I GUESS I D BETTER CLOSE NOW SO I CAN .
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR KIDS ARE DOING STUFF OR ARE YOU A TEACHER .
UH .
I GATHERED YOU MIGHT BE A TEACHER .
WELL I I WAS I M HOME NOW .
OH .
FULL TIME .
UHHUH .
BUT UH SO YEAH WE RE WE THINK BOOKS ARE IMPORTANT AROUND HERE .
YEAH .
WELL YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY .
OKAY .
STAY OUT OF THE RAIN .
OKAY YOU TOO .
BYEBYE .
TAKE CARE BYEBYE .
OKAY .
ALL RIGHTY I THINK ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THAT HAVE HAPPENED IS THAT THEY VE CHANGED FROM HOMEMAKER TO THE WORK MARKET .
UHHUH .
AND FOR SEVERAL REASONS PROBABLY SOME OF THAT IS DIVORCE AND SOME IS THEY RE MORE EDUCATED THAN THEY USED TO BE I THINK .
UHHUH .
UH I THINK SOMETIMES UH LEADERS IN GOVERNMENT THEY VE BECOME MORE UH ADROIT IN THAT AREA TOO INSTEAD OF JUST MEN ALL THE TIME .
UHHUH .
WE HAVE MORE WOMEN IN GOVERNMENT .
UHHUH .
AND NOW I LL LET YOU SAY SOMETHING .
WELL UH I PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT OLDER THAN YOU ARE SO WHAT I SEE UH IS THE CHANGE THAT I SEE THE MOST IS IS THAT UH WOMEN HAVE MUCH MORE MANY MORE OCCUPATIONS AND CAREERS TO CHOOSE FROM THAN WHEN I W WENT TO COLLEGE WHEN I WENT TO COLLEGE YOU COULD BE A TEACHER OR MAYBE A NURSE OR A SECRETARY OR BUT THERE WERE VERY FEW WOMEN IN BUSINESS AT THAT TIME A FEW BUT THEY WERE THE ODDITY AND .
VERY LIMITED .
YES AND NOW I SEE AND AND I SEE FOR MY DAUGHTER WHICH IS WONDERFUL THIS SHE S THIRTEEN AND I SEE A WHOLE WONDERFUL WORLD OUT THERE THAT SHE CAN CHOOSE FROM .
UHHUH .
SO MANY DIFFERENT JOBS WHICH I THINK IS TERRIFIC .
YES .
BECAUSE I M A TEACHER AND I MEAN I LOVE TEACHING BUT THERE I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER THINGS I WOULD HAVE LIKED BETTER .
UHHUH .
AND UH NOT THAT I WOULD GIVE THE CAREER UP BECAUSE IT S IT S A SAFE CAREER PLUS BECAUSE I ALWAYS HAVE A JOB PLUS I AM A SINGLE PARENT TOO .
UHHUH .
AND I N I NEED THE INCOME .
RIGHT .
BUT UH AND I THINK THAT S THE REASON WHY A LOT OF WOMEN HAVE HAVE STARTED TO WORK TOO IS BECAUSE ECONOMICALLY IT S JUST A MUST .
I THINK THAT S RIGHT .
UH YOU JUST IT S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET ALONG ON ONE INCOME UNLESS UH THE MALE UH HAS AN EXTRAORDINARILY GOOD JOB .
UHHUH .
AND ESPECIALLY MEN WHO TEACH SCHOOL THEY DO NT MAKE THAT MUCH MONEY AND AND MOST ALL THEY ALWAYS EITHER HAVE THEY RE EITHER MOONLIGHTING OR ELSE THEIR THEIR WIFE WORKS TOO .
RIGHT .
UH IT S JUST AN ECONOMIC NEED NOW .
I REALLY THINK WOMEN HAVE SO MUCH MORE RESPONSIBILITY THAN YOU KNOW AS FAR AS EVERYTHING .
OH DEFINITELY .
AND LIKE YOU SAID UH ONE WOMEN TODAY HAVE SO MANY UH THE AVERAGE TODAY OF HAVING A A SINGLE FAMILY YOU KNOW WITH THE MOTHER AS THE HEAD .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW IT JUST REALLY UH SO COMMONPLACE .
OH YES EXACTLY .
NOWADAYS .
WE HAVE QUITE A FEW TEACHERS AT OUR SCHOOL THAT ARE SINGLE PARENTS AND .
UHHUH .
UH THE MAJORITY IS UH MARRIED COUPLE WITH CHILDREN BUT STILL THERE S A LOT MORE THAN THERE USED TO BE AND SEE YOU NEVER PICTURE YOURSELF IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS WHEN I MARRIED I THOUGHT I D BE MARRIED THE REST OF MY LIFE .
RIGHT RIGHT .
AND UH BUT I M ALL I M REALLY GRATEFUL THAT I WENT TO COLLEGE MY MOTHER ALWAYS SAID YOU KNOW GET AN EDUCATION IN CASE YOU NEED ONE A BECAUSE MY FATHER DIED WHEN WE WERE I HAVE A TWIN SISTER AND WE WERE ELEVEN WHEN HE DIED AND SHE HAD A NURSING DEGREE .

I THINK THAT S MOSTLY WELL YOU KNOW WE EVEN BEFORE AS SOON AS THE COMMUNITY SAID YOU KNOW WE RE GOING TO PUT UP BINS FOR RECYCLING YOU KNOW WE AUTOMATICALLY STARTED .
UHHUH .
DOING IT IT WAS .
RIGHT .
IT S ONE OF THOSE THINGS YOU KNOW AND JUST GOING AND TAKING THE TIME TO GO AND READ THE SIGNS AND THE BROCHURES ON WHAT THEY ACCEPT AND HOW IT SHOULD BE .
UHHUH .
SEPARATED YOU KNOW THAT S .

UHHUH .
THE SAME THING YOU KNOW EVERY ALMOST EVERY COLLEGE IN MARYLAND IS RECYCLING OFFICE PAPER BUT YOU KNOW IN THE GIANT BINS AROUND AND IT S SURPRISING HOW MUCH .

THE DIFFERENCE .
HOPEFULLY IF YOU KNOW I GUESS A LOT OF THE LARGE ORGANIZATIONS PROBABLY T I DID THEY ADVERTISE ON TELEVISION HOW SUCCESSFUL THEY ARE .
N .
MUMBLEX .
I HAVE NT SEEN .
YEAH .
ANYTHING UH BUT THAT DOES NT MEAN THAT THEY DO NT I DO NT WATCH MUCH T V .
YEAH .
BUT I HAVE NT REALLY SEEN ANYTHING ADVERTISE PUBLICLY .
UHHUH .
AND THEN LIKE I SAID THEY DO A LOT OF INTERNAL .
INTERNAL .
ADVERTISING ON THAT KIND OF STUFF .
UHHUH .
BUT I HAVE NT SEEN ANYTHING .
YEAH .
BUT SEE I DO NT SEE A LOT OF T I ADVERTISEMENTS ON T V ANYWAY I THINK THEY ADVERTISE MORE UM OTHER PLACES WHERE THEY RE NOT LOCATED .
RIGHT YEAH THAT WOULD PROBABLY .
YOU KNOW SO .
BE TRUE .
SO I DO NT SEE A LOT OF ADVERTISEMENTS FOR T I .
YEAH BECAUSE I KNOW THAT SOME OF THE LARGE INDUSTRIES HERE WILL ADVERTISE ON TELEVISION YOU KNOW THEY LL JUS COME UP AND SAY YOU KNOW THEY LL SHOW YOU THO TO ENCOURAGE TO ENCOURAGE RECYCLING THEY LL .
RIGHT .
SAY AND HERE THOSE OF US THAT DUMAVRA POWER WHICH IS OUR POWER COMPANY .
UHHUH .
THAT WE NOW RECYCLE FORTYFIVE PERCENT OF OUR SOLID WASTE .
RIGHT .
AND THEY AND THAT WE DO THIS FOR THE COMMUNITY THEY PUT THOSE ON SO I SO I THINK YOU KNOW WE RE PROBABLY REACHING A SUCCESSFUL STAGE AND AND JUST WITH VOLUNTARY .
RIGHT .
I THINK .
WELL EVEN I MEAN IN THE KID S SCHOOLS .
UHHUH .
I MEAN THEY DO THINGS TO TRY AND RECYCLE AND I KNOW MY KIDS UM LIKE IF THEY SEE LITTER ON THE GROUND THEY PICK IT UP AND SAY OH LOOK AT THAT SOMEBODY IS NOT SAVING THE EARTH YOU KNOW .
RIGHT YEAH .
SO I MEAN THE KIDS I MEAN THEY REALLY TRY TO EDUCATE ALL AGES YOU KNOW AND IT S GOOD TO START THE KIDS REAL YOUNG ON .
I THINK SO TOO .
STUFF LIKE THAT .
YEAH .
BECAUSE I MEAN WHEN I WAS A KID THEY NEVER DID STUFF LIKE THAT I MEAN IT S LIKE NOBODY WAS CONCERNED ABOUT IT .
RIGHT YEAH WE WERE NT .
YOU KNOW AND IT S LIKE .
CONCERNED YEAH THAT S TRUE .
YOU KNOW IT S LIKE ALL OF A SUDDEN WHEN THERE S NOTICEABLE THINGS SAYING HEY YOU KNOW .
HUH .
WE RE RUINING THE EARTH YOU KNOW AND NOW EVERYBODY IS DOING SOMETHING ABOUT WHICH IS GOOD .
UHHUH .
BUT HOW COME WE WERE NT DOING THIS SAY TWENTY YEARS AGO .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
I I THINK REALLY PROBABLY WHAT HIT PEOPLES YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT HERE IN THE UP IN THE UH UH THE THE NEW ENGLANDS AREA AND ALSO IN IN PENNSYLVANIA OHIO AND NEW YORK THE JUST RUN ALL OF A SUDDEN WE RE OUT OF LANDFILL .
UHHUH .
AND AND THEY RE SAYING WE ESTIMATE THIS LANDFILL BE OV WILL BE FULL IN TWO YEARS UNLESS WE CUT BACK AND .
UHHUH .
EVEN THEN YOU KNOW WE RE REALLY RUNNING OUT OF SPACE SO I THINK THAT THAT BECAME THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN REALLY HIT HOME THAT THERE S NO LONGER LANDFILL SPACE .
WELL .
IN SOME OF THE MORE CROWDED STATES .
YEAH THIS IS .
SO WHAT YOU KNOW AND N NO OTHER STATE I M SURE TEXAS PROBABLY STILL HAS SOME LANDFILL SPACE THEY RE NOT GOING TO VOLUNTARILY SAY HEY SHIP YOUR GARBAGE HERE .
RIGHT .
SO YOU KNOW .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
REALISTICALLY YOU KNOW WE HAD WE REALLY HAD TO START WE HAVE TO START RECYCLING IN SOME SOME UH GEOGRAPHIC AREAS IT S REALLY .
I THINK .
TOUGH .
THAT IT IT REALLY SURPRISES ME BECAUSE OF THE COST SAVINGS I MEAN THIS IS SUCH A TREMENDOUS .
UHHUH .
AMOUNT OF COST SAVINGS I MEAN WHY I CA NT UNDERSTAND WHY NOBODY SAW THAT BEFORE I MEAN EVEN EVEN NOT .
UHHUH .
EVEN THE ASPECTS OF NOT SAVING THE EARTH I .
RIGHT .
MEAN IT S .
YEAH BUT WELL .
SO COST YOU KNOW .
WELL IN SOME WAYS I GUESS IT IT DOES NT BECOME REALLY COST SAVING UNTIL YOU HAVE AN INDUSTRY AROUND IT YOU KNOW BECAUSE .
BRO .
I KNOW THAT LIKE IN .
YEAH .
PENNSYLVANIA THEY REQUIRE THEM TO UM PUT THEIR NEWSPAPER FOR RECYCLING BUT THE DEINKING PROCESS THAT THEY HAVE TO THEY USE .
UHHUH .
TO TAKE THE INK OUT OF THE NEWSPAPER SO IT CAN BE REUSED .
UHHUH .
UM IS VERY EXPENSIVE .
OH .
AND ALSO IT W IT PRODUCES A A WASTE A UM A .
OH .
LIQUID WASTE THAT THEY DO NT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH YET .
I SEE .
SO .
OKAY .
EVEN SOME ASPECTS OF RECYCLING .
IS NOT .
THEY STILL HAVE COST .
REAL COST EFFICIENT OH OKAY OKAY OH .
YEAH COST EFFICIENT YET YEAH .
I .
SO .
UNDERSTAND THAT THOUGH .
BUT OTHERS YOU KNOW LIKE TIN CANS AND PLASTICS .
UHHUH .
ARE ARE REALLY UH EFFICIENT YOU KNOW THEY .
RIGHT .
THEY MELT ON QUICKLY AND CAN BE YOU KNOW JUST BECAUSE OF THE .
AND GLASS RIGHT .
HEATING AND THINGS GETTING GLASS YEAH .
UHHUH .
SO I IT REALLY IS SURPRISING THAT PEOPLE HAVE NT NOTICED IT BEFORE .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
UHHUH YEAH .
AND EVEN I I NOTICED THAT A LOT OF GAS STATIONS ARE TELLING YOU TO RECYCLE YOUR OIL .
UHHUH .
AND I MEAN THAT KIND OF SURPRISES ME I MEAN YOU KNOW BECAUSE ONCE OIL GETS SO YOU KNOW THICK AND YUCKY YOU D WONDER HOW THEY COULD YOU KNOW CLEAN THAT UP .
YEAH .
ENOUGH TO USE IT AGAIN BUT THEY CAN .
UHHUH .
UM I DO NT KNOW HOW COST EFFICIENT THAT WOULD BE I GUESS .
YEAH I D I DO NT KNOW EITHER THAT S I KNOW THAT THOUGH I E ALL THOSE PETROLEUM PRODUCTS THOUGH ARE SO TERRIBLE FOR YOUR UM THE WATER TABLE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THEY REALLY POLLUTE QUICKLY AND YOU KNOW ONE MUMBLEX I WAS READING SOME PLACE THE BRAKE FLUID YOU PUT BRAKE FLUID NORMALLY COMES IN JUST SMALL LITTLE PINT CONTAINERS .
UHHUH .
THAT ONE PINT OF BRAKE FLUID CAN CONTAMINATE SO MANY GALLONS OF WATER .
WOW .
YOU KNOW LIKE HUNDREDS OF GALLONS OF WATER SO IT S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT THEY REALLY UM AND YOU WONDER YOU KNOW WITH ALL THESE OIL SPILLS .
YEAH .
HOW HOW TERRIBLE THAT IS .
YEAH I KNOW .
YEAH HOW TERRIBLE THAT IS SO WE LL HAVE TO WE LL HAVE TO KEEP OUR EYES ON ALL THAT I GUESS .
REALLY .
UHHUH .
I KNOW I REALLY I DO NT KNOW I I THINK THAT I MEAN I THINK THAT THEY REALLY ARE DOING A GOOD THING NOW AND I HOPE IT KEEPS WELL I M SURE WE LL KEEP UP .
YEAH I .
YOU KNOW .
AGREE .
I THINK IT S REALLY CATCHING ON .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW I I THINK THAT I M NOT SURE IF IT I DO NT KNOW I THINK IT S A GOOD IDEA TO MAKE IT MANDATORY .
I DO TOO .
UM IT BECAUSE LIKE WE WERE ASKING SOME PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN UM NORTH DAKOTA WELL ARE YOU SAVING YOUR YOU KNOW ARE YOU RECYCLING AND THEY SAID WELL WE RE NOT FORCED TO DO IT YET SO NO .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW SO I MEAN I DO NT KNOW I THINK THAT IF PEOPLE ARE FORCED IF THE PEOPLE ARE NOT FORCED TO DO IT THEY MAY NOT YOU .
YEAH IT D .
KNOW I MEAN I DO NT KNOW I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE STILL WILL BUT .
WELL YOU KNOW IF THEY RE FORCED TO DO IT IT BECOMES SORT OF A HABIT .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT IT S REALLY FUNNY MY PARENTS ARE FORCED TO DO IT AND THEY .
OKAY .
WELL LIKE I WAS SAYING BURLINGTON S CRIME IT DOES NT INVOLVE CHILDREN AND WHAT .
YOU SEE ON THE T V S FROM YOU KNOW IN WASHINGTON AND NEW YORK .
SO WHAT .
I BELIEVE THE PEOPLE WANT THE SUBJECT IS IS BIG CITY CRIME WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT I DO NT HAVE ANY FIRST HAND EXPERIENCES ABOUT BUT I HAVE YOU KNOW CONCERNS AND .
UHHUH .
I HAVE A FEW IDEAS OF UM HOW TO COMBAT IT .
I MEAN I DO NT I DO NT THINK IDEALLY YOU KNOW YOU NEED MONEY TO DO EVERYTHING SO .
UHHUH .
THAT .
S ONE THING THAT THAT S THAT S CRIME THAT YOU CA NT FIGHT IT IF YOU NEED THAT MONEY .
SO .
RIGHT YEAH WELL WHEN UH WE LIVED IN SAN ANTONIO I GREW UP AROUND SAN ANTONIO AND IT S ALWAYS BEEN A VERY LARGE UH CITY AND INCREASINGLY GROWING .
IT .
S HAS KIND OF THE SPLIT POPULATION .
UM THERE S A LOT OF RETIRED MILITARY UH INDIVIDUALS .
THAT LIVE THERE AND THEN THERE S A VERY LARGE HISPANIC POPULATION THERE .
AND THE ONE THING THAT WE NOTICED THAT OVER THE YEARS HAS GOTTEN WORSE AND WORSE IS HISPANIC UH GANG CRIME IN THE CITY .
OH .
AND THAT HAS UH BEEN THE WORSE THING THAT WE VE SEEN HAPPENING .
DOES IT SPREAD OUT OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS INTO THE MORE THE UH RETIRED PEOPLE S COMMUNITY OR DOES IT STAY IN THE BAD NEIGHBORHOODS .
UM THE MAJORITY OF THE ACTUAL GANG CRIMES LIKE THE PAT THE DRIVE BY SHOOTINGS AND STUFF STAYS IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS BUT THE CRIME SPREADS OUT INTO THE MORE AFFLUENT DIVISIONS THROUGH ROBBERIES RAPE AND UH CAR CRIME .
THERE S A VERY LARGE UH OR VERY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF CAR THEFT .
AND SAN AN SAN ANTONIO S NOT FAR FROM THE BORDER TO MEXICO SO A LOT OF THE UH CARS GO TO UH YOU KNOW MUMBLEX SHOPS AND THEY TAKE THEM APART AND A LOT OF THEM GO OVER THE BORDER ESPECIALLY LIKE MERCEDES .
A LOT OF THOSE THOSE IN THE THE Z UH THE Z CARS THE DATSUN CARS END UP OVER THE BORDER AND UH .
SO THAT S A BIG CONCERN IF YOU LIVE THERE .
VERY MUCH SO .
IS TO REALLY LOCK YOUR CAR UP .
VERY MUCH SO IN FACT FOR A WHILE .
THERE .
THEY HAD DOWNTOWN IF YOU WERE TO COME TO A STOP LIGHT THEY HAD A RASH OF WHERE PEOPLE WERE WHEN PEOPLE WERE STOPPED AT STOP SIGNS THAT PEOPLE WOULD GET IN THEIR CAR AND HOLD A KNIFE AND HOLD THEM UP .
SO NOW EVER SINCE THEN WHEN YOU DRIVE INTO THE CITY MOST PEOPLE KEEP THEIR DOORS LOCKED WHILE THEY RE IN THE CAR UNTIL THEY GET DOWN THERE AND ONCE YOU VE REACHED THE THE RIVER WALK AREA WHICH IS THE TOURIST AREA IT S USUALLY PRETTY SAFE DURING THE DAY IF YOU RE JUST KIND OF CAUTIOUS AND DO NT GO DOWN THE BACK STREETS OR ALLEYS AND UM YOU KNOW OR ALONE .
IF YOU STAY WITH THE GROUPS AND ALONG THE AREA WHERE THEY HAVE THE RIVER PATROL COPS IT S VERY NICE .
BUT AT AT EVENING UM AGAIN YOU THEY HAVE THE HIGH TOURIST AREA THE RIVER WALK AREA WHICH IS NICE BUT YOU DO NT WANT TO GET OFF THE BEATEN TRACK .
UM THERE S A LOT OF PARKING GARAGES THERE BECAUSE PARKING IS VERY TIGHT .
AND SO YOU DO NT WANT TO GET CAUGHT IN THE PARKING GARAGE UH ALONE .
OH MY IT SOUNDS LIKE UM SAN JUAN PUERTO RICO WE WERE THERE JUST WELL FOR A LAY OVER .
UHHUH .
AND UM WELL IT .
WAS NT .
A LAY OVER WE WERE WE HAD WE WERE STAYING AT THE OTHER END OF THE ISLAND AND WE DROVE INTO SAN JUAN TO CATCH OUR PLANE .
UHHUH .
IT WAS AT NIGHT AND THIS BOY REALLY WANTED TO GO ON THE BEACH AND THEY LOOK AT YOU CRAZY .
UHHUH .
YOU DO NT GO ON THE BEACH .
UHHUH .
WELL IT S A BIG TOURIST TOWN YOU KNOW DO NT THEY DO NT PEOPLE GO FOR A WALK ON THE BEACH AT NIGHT .
AND THEY SAID NO IT S VERY SAFE IN THE DAYTIME .
UHHUH .
BUT AT NIGHT THEY EVEN HAVE THE POLICEMEN COME AROUND AT DUSK AND SOUND THEIR SIRENS PRETTY MUCH TELLING PEOPLE BE WARY YOU KNOW AND GET OFF THE BEACH .
IT S JUST SO SAD YOU KNOW IT IS JUST REALLY SO SAD YOU KNOW IT IS JUST REALLY SO SAD BECAUSE YOU CA NT ENJOY ANYTHING ANY MORE .
UM IN SAN ANTONIO I DO NT KNOW WHAT .
THE ANSWER IS .
EDUCATION I THINK IS A LOT OF IT .
UM SO MANY OF THE KIDS ARE DROP OUTS .
UM UH THERE S A LOT OF DRUGS .
THAT GO ON AND THAT THEY JUST HAVE HOPELESS LIVES .
THEY THEY LEAD THEMSELVES DOWN HOPELESS TUNNELS .
I THINK EDUCATION HELPS A LITTLE BIT THERE .
UM THEN AGAIN I DO NT KNOW REALLY WHAT STEPS .
THERE ARE THAT THEY .
WELL WHAT .
THEY WHAT .
THEY SAY THEY TRY TO DO IS TO GET THE KIDS UM EARLY AND YOUNG .
UHHUH .
AND WHAT .
WE HAVE HERE IN BURLINGTON WHICH .
IT DOES NT COST A LOT OF MONEY BUT THEY HAVE A KIDS COUNCIL .
UHHUH .
THAT THEY HAVE ALL THESE AFTER SCHOOL ACTIVITIES FOR KIDS .
UHHUH .
THEY SET UP KIDS WITH ELDERLY PEOPLE IN THE WINTER TIME .
THEY SHOVEL THEIR SNOW .
THEY HAVE A BIG BROTHER BIG SISTER PROGRAM .
UHHUH .
THEY HAVE BOTTLE DRIVES THEY HAVE CLEANUP OUTINGS .
AND THEY HAVE ALSO ORGANIZED FUN ACTIVITIES LIKE GYMS GOING TO THE BEACH AND PLAYING VOLLEYBALL AT THE BEACH IN THE SUMMER AND THEY HAVE GYMS OPEN .
AND IT SEEMS THAT THE YOUNGER YOU CAN GET THEM AND GET THEM INVOLVED WITH PROGRAMS .
UHHUH .
AFTER SCHOOL YOU MIGHT KEEP THEM .
UHHUH .
BUT YOU AGAIN YOU NEED THAT ONE ON ONE LIKE A BIG BROTHER TRYING TO KEEP THE YOUNGER KID YOU KNOW TELL HIM HEY STAY IN SCHOOL IT LL GET BETTER YOU KNOW SO THAT YOUR MOM DOES NT HAVE A JOB .
UHHUH .
AND SHE DOES NT WORK YOU DO NT KNOW YOU CAN BE BETTER THAN THAT .
YOU DO NT HAVE TO LIVE ON THE YOU KNOW FOR A STREET LIFE .
UHHUH .
BUT .
UHHUH THAT S GOOD THAT SOUNDS LIKE THEY VE GOT A LOT GOING ON THERE .
YEAH BUT IT S SO CHEAP THEY DO NT HAVE A PROBLEM HERE .
I MEAN UM THEY CAN DEAL WITH THAT .
UHHUH .
SCALE .
THEY MIGHT HAVE FIVE HUNDRED TROUBLED YOUTHS .
UHHUH .
WHEN YOU HAVE FIVE THOUSAND TROUBLED YOUTHS PLUS WHEN YOU RE GETTING INTO TH WELL THE KIDS NOW IT S TWELVE YEARS OLD AND THEY RE SELLING DRUGS .
UHHUH .
AND THEY VE GOT A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD THAT S THEIR BOSS .
UHHUH .
THAT IS CARRYING A GUN .
UHHUH .
IT S JUST IT S THE MORALS OF THE PEOPLE .
WHICH I MEAN I GUESS WE EVERYBODY S RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SOCIETY BUT IF I HAD A CHILD THAT THAT DID THINGS SO BAD IT S NOT THEY DO NT CARE ABOUT ANYBODY .
UHHUH .
THESE PEOPLE THEY RE STEALING FROM THEY RE JUST THE BIG BAD RICH GUY .
UHHUH .
AND WE DO NT HAVE IT SO WE DESERVE IT AND WE SHOULD TAKE IT .
UHHUH YEAH .
I DO NT KNOW HOW YOU COMBAT THAT .
I I DO NT KNOW WHERE YOU START OR WITH A LOT OF THESE KIDS UM SO MANY OF THEM ALL .
THEY SEE IS JUST THE GANGS .
YES .
AND UNLESS YOU CAN TAKE THEM OUT OF THE ENVIRONMENT ENOUGH TO WHERE THEY DO NT HAVE THE PEER PRESSURE FROM THE GANGS AS SOON AS THEY COME HOME FROM SCHOOL .
WELL I THINK A LOT OF IT IS THE PARENTS ARE TOTALLY IRRESPONSIBLE TOO .
WE RE TALKING .
OH YEAH .
THESE KIDS ARE FOURTEEN YEARS OLD .
THE PARENTS MIGHT BE THIRTY YEARS OLD .
UHHUH .
AND I M THIRTY YEARS OLD AND I M KIND OF IRRESPONSIBLE BUT I HAVE THE MORALS .
THAT KEEP ME FROM YOU KNOW IF I WAS GOING TO GO OUT AND DRINK OR DO SOMETHING I WOULD NT DO IT IN FRONT OF MY CHILD .
THESE PEOPLE YOU KNOW THEY BRING THEIR THEIR JOHNS HOME AND THEY BRING THEIR DRUGS HOME AND THE KIDS ARE JUST SITTING THERE IN THE SAME ROOM .
UHHUH .
IT S JUST THAT THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO NO MORALS .
UHHUH .
AND IT S REALLY SAD .
AND I DO NT KNOW HOW YOU COMBAT THAT .
I REA I DO NT KNOW WHAT .
THE ANSWER IS TO THAT PROBLEM YOU KNOW .
BUT I LIKE YOUR IDEA OF EDUCATION .
UHHUH .
I MEAN IF THE PARENTS ARE NT SUPPLYING IT THEY VE GOT TO GET IT .
UHHUH .
FROM SOMEONE ELSE .
YEAH .
FROM THE SCHOOLS .
AND WHAT DO THOSE KIDS DO THEY GET IT AT SCHOOL AND COME HOME WHAT DO THEY DO THEN .
I I FEEL I FEEL FOR THEM I DO NT KNOW HOW TO MAKE IT BETTER FOR THEM OR YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT THEY CA NT REMOVE THEMSELVES THEY CA NT JUST LEAVE AND SAY OKAY WELL IT S NOT ACCEPTABLE I M LEAVING THE BIG CITY MOM AND I M I M GOING OFF YOU KNOW WHEN THEY RE TEN THEY HAVE TO LIVE IN IT AND .
YEAH IT S REALLY SAD LIKE IF THEY DID HAVE A BIG BROTHER BIG SISTER PROGRAM .
UHHUH .
THOSE THOSE PEOPLE TRYING TO HELP THE KIDS THE PARENTS MIGHT HAVE HOSTILITIES TOWARDS THEM YOU KNOW .
RIGHT I THINK SO AND UH .
LIKE YOU RE JUDGING US AND I M NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO RAISE MY CHILD WHICH BASICALLY IS TRUE .
UHHUH .
IT S IT S IT S I M GLAD I DO NT LIVE IN A BIG CITY .
UHHUH YEAH .
JUST BECAUSE I MEAN NOT JUST BECAUSE I WOULD NT FEEL SAFE IT S JUST BECAUSE THAT I WOULD BE REMINDED EVERY DAY .
YEAH .
OF SOMETHING THAT I DO NT SEE AND I MIGHT SEE IT ON A YOU KNOW A SIXTY MINUTES SPECIAL .
UHHUH NO IN SAN ANTONIO .
IT WAS LIKE EVERY DAY IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF WHO WAS SHOT THAT NIGHT .
I KNOW IT BUT SAN ANTONIO IS CONSIDERED A NICE CLEAN CITY BELIEVE IT OR NOT .
I MEAN THEY HAVE ALL KINDS OF NICE WRITE UPS ABOUT IT .
UHHUH OH YEAH BUT .
BUT ANY BIG CITY HAS A BAD SECTION .
BUT THERE S A LOT OF THEM IT S VERY PREVALENT A LOT OF THE CRIME IS VERY PREVALENT .
YES THEY RE VERY BOLD IT SEEMS .
UHHUH VERY MUCH .
WHEN WE MOVED HERE TO MONTERREY .
IT WAS A BIG CHANGE BECAUSE IT S SUCH A SMALL COMMUNITY WE RE JUST ABOVE CARMEL AND UM THERE S HARDLY MOST EVERYBODY SEEMS PRETTY WELL EMPLOYED AROUND HERE AND UM THOSE .
THAT ARE NT THERE .
S CELINAS .
WHICH IS ABOUT A FIFTEEN MINUTE DRIVE WHICH IS MOSTLY MIGRANT WORKERS AND THERE S A LOT OF CRIME THERE UM MIGRANT HISPANIC FARM WORKERS PEOPLE .
THAT ARE DOWN AND OUT AND UH THEY .
ALL SEEM TO CONGREGATE IN CELINAS NOT SO MUCH HERE IN MONTERREY .
SO IT S IT S PRETTY QUIET .
YOU KNOW WE WALK THE STREETS AT NIGHT AND UH PEOPLE RUN IN THE PARK AND YOU KNOW YOU RE JUST HAVE YOUR NORMAL SMARTS ABOUT YOU THEN YOU REALLY DO NT HAVE TO WORRY OR .
REALLY EVEN UH EVEN IN THE WORST CRIME AREAS IN BURLINGTON I I CAN WALK THE STREETS .
I WOULD NT I IF I DID IT .
EVERY NIGHT .
UHHUH .
I THINK THERE WOULD BE TROUBLE IN OUR HOUSE SO YOU WOULD NT GET CONFRONTED OR ANYTHING .
RIGHT .
BUT I DO NT THINK YOU WOULD UH SOMEONE MIGHT GRAB YOU MESS AROUND WITH YOU BUT THEY RE NOT GOING TO GRAB YOU STEAL YOU YOUR MONEY AND SLIT YOUR THROAT .
UHHUH .
WHICH IN A LOT OF BIG CITIES .
YEAH .
I MEAN THAT S WHAT .
YOU YOUR GOING TO HAVE TO EXPECT THAT TO HAPPEN .
PEOPLE ARE JUST TOTALLY UNFEELING .
UHHUH UH I DID NT KNOW THAT ABOUT BURLINGTON I LL HAVE TO KEEP THAT IN MIND .
ARE YOU GOING TO TELL ME .
WHAT .
YOU VE BEEN DOING LATELY IN THE .
SURE UH .
OKAY .
I LL OFFER ANYTHING THAT I CAN ON THE SUBJECT .
UH MY HUSBAND AND I JUST BOUGHT A JUST MOVED HERE RECENTLY AND UH WE BOUGHT UH THIS HOUSE ABOUT UH I DO NT KNOW YEAR AND A HALF AGO .
WHAT .
WE HAVE HERE NOW IS JUST A BASIC THREE BEDROOM TWO BATH BRICK HOUSE .
WHICH IS UH COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT .
I HAD HAD BEFORE .
WHEN I WAS WORKING AND BEFORE I MARRIED UH I LIVED IN A LITTLE TOWN SOUTH OF HERE THAT IS JUST FULL OF OLD HOMES AND UH HISTORIC OLD HOUSES AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO I UH TRIED TO I WAS IN THE PROCESS OF RENOVATING A HOUSE AND UH THAT WAS ABOUT SEVENTYFIVE YEARS OLD .

SO UH IT HAD TO HAVE EVERYTHING DONE FROM TOP TO BOTTOM TO HAVING IT LEVELED JACKED UP UH NEW PLUMBING NEW WIRING WALLPAPER PAINT EVERYTHING .
YOU CAN THINK OF .

THAT HOUSE HAD TO HAVE .
YOU ARE EXPERIENCED I WOULD SAY .
WELL I I REALLY DID ENJOY IT UH YOU KNOW IT WAS AMAZING WHAT .
I FOUND OUT I COULD DO ON MY OWN IF I JUST PUT MY MIND TO IT .
WELL I AGREE .
YEAH .
I HAVE DONE SOMETHING UH LIKE THAT TOO ONLY NOT NEARLY AS EXTENSIVE .
UHHUH .
BUT IT MUST BE INTERESTING NOW TRYING TO DO SOMETHING TO A BASIC RANCH .
IT IS .
STYLE HOME .
IT IS .
UH .
YEAH .
AFTER HAVING A ONE .
THAT WAS HISTORICAL LOOKING .
THAT S THAT S TRUE .
WHEN UH I MET MY HUSBAND HE WAS LIVING IN AN APARTMENT AT THE TIME AND AND UH THE TOWN THAT I WAS LIVING IN ONLY ABOUT EIGHTY MILES FROM HERE .
SO UH YOU KNOW I WE REALLY IT WAS JUST THE MARKET WAS SO GOOD WE HAD NT REALLY PLANNED ON BUYING AND AS YOU PROBABLY HEARD FROM THE IN THE DALLAS AND TEXAS AREA PERIOD .
THE HOUSING MARKET IS JUST UNREAL .
I MEAN YOU CAN GET THINGS FOR SUCH A SONG .

SO THAT S THAT S REALLY WHY WE ENDED UP IN A HOUSE LIKE THIS .
THIS IS NOT WHAT .
WE YOU KNOW WHAT .
WE WANT TO STAY IN FOREVER BECAUSE I HAVE TO HAVE MY I VE FOUND THAT AFTER DOING THIS OTHER HOUSE I HAVE TO HAVE MY HANDS INTO STUFF AND .

KIND OF HAD PLANNED THIS UH TREK TO THE EAST .
UHHUH UHHUH .
BECAUSE WE RE BOTH ORIGINALLY FROM THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY .
I SEE UHHUH .
AND SO I THINK SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I DID PAID OFF .
FOR INSTANCE .
UHHUH .
ONE THING THAT I DID THAT MIGHT EVEN BE A GOOD SUGGESTION FOR YOU .
UHHUH .
UH WAS SOMETHING .
I DID ON THE OUTSIDE .
I LOVE OLD ESTATE ESTATE SALES .
YES YES .
I HAPPENED TO GO TO JUST A LITTLE ESTATE SALE THAT .
UHHUH .
JUST A LITTLE WHITE FRAME HOUSE .
UHHUH .
WHERE THE COUPLE UH WAS VERY OLD .
UHHUH .
AND HAD GONE INTO NURSING HOMES AND .
OH YEAH .
UH ALL THE MEN STARTED GOING DOWN TO THE BARN .
UH OH .
AND SO I TH WELL SHOOT I M GOING .
THAT S WHERE I NEED TO GO .
YES I M GOING TO THE BARN TOO .
EXACTLY .
THEY UH AUCTIONED SOME TOOLS AND .
YEAH .
THINGS LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
BUT THEN THEY WENT OVER AND STARTED UH AUCTIONING THIS BIG STACK OF BRICKS .
OH .
AND SO WELL I THOUGHT GEE I VE BEEN WANTING TO .
UHHUH .
DO SOME BRICK UH WALKWAYS .
WORK RIGHT RIGHT .
FOR A TIME .
UHHUH .
ANYWAY IT ENDED UP AFTER SOME PRETTY UH HEAVY BIDDING .
UHHUH .
THAT I GOT ALL THOSE BRICKS FOR FORTY DOLLARS .
OH MY WORD .
AND SO MY HUSBAND AND I LOADED BRICKS IN HIS .
OH NO .
PICKUP TRUCK FOR DAYS .
OH MY WORD .
BUT WHAT .
WE ENDED UP WITH WAS ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND .
FOR FORTY DOLLARS .
FOR FORTY DOLLARS .
OH MY .
AND SO WHAT .
WE DID WE HAD BUILT A DECK ON THE BACK OF THAT HOUSE .
UHHUH .
BUT IT NEEDED AND .
SOMETHING .
IT WAS QUITE LARGE OUT TO .
UHHUH .
INTO THE YARD BUT .
UHHUH .
ON EITHER SIDE OF IT TO THE ENDS OF THE HOUSE .
IT JUST NEEDED TO BE ALL TIED TOGETHER .
SO WE .
RIGHT .
MADE BRICK PATIOS AND WALKWAYS .
OH HOW FUN .
OH HOW NICE .
AND SO FOR AND HE HE DID THE DIGGING .
UHHUH .
WHICH WAS ABOUT SIX INCHES BUT I FIGURED THE SAND AND ALL .
UHHUH .
HAD THAT DELIVERED AND .
RIGHT .
LEVELED IT AND AND .
RIGHT .
PLACED MOST ALL THE BRICKS .
UHHUH .
AND IT TURNED OUT BEAUTIFULLY .
OH I BET .
AND WHAT SATISFACTION TO KNOW THAT YOU DID IT IN SUCH AN INEXPENSIVE WAY .
YES .
WELL IT NEARLY KILLED ME .
YEAH BUT BUT YOU DID STAG STAGGER BACK AND SAY OH DOES NT THIS LOOK NICE .
I HATED TO LEAVE IT .
WELL LET ME ASK YOU WHEN YOU LAID THOSE BRICKS I KNOW MY PARENTS BOUGHT A HOUSE ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO THEY RE FIXING TO SELL IT AGAIN BUT AND MOVE AGAIN .
THEY RE KIND OF MY MOM S LIKE I AM .
SHE S A RENOVATOR A LOVER OF OLD THINGS .
UHHUH .
AND YOU KNOW THEY HAVE TO BE DOING SOMETHING CONSTANTLY .
AND THE PATIO .
THAT CAME WITH THAT HOUSE UH WAS NOT LAID ON A LIKE I DO NT KNOW IF YOU CAN PUT SOME SORT OF A PLASTIC SHEETING OR SOMETHING UN ON ON TOP OF THE SAND AND THEN LAY THE BRICKS .
NO WE .
BUT THEY HAVE THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THESE LITTLE TIN LIKE SAND BUGS OR SOMETHING .
WELL I .
THAT DRILL IN BETWEEN ALL THESE BRICKS .
AND OF COURSE .
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE UH THE WEEDS .
THAT COME UP IN BETWEEN THE BRICKS OR AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
WELL NO I I DID NT HAVE THAT TROUBLE BECAUSE UH WE LAID THE I DID GET SOME MATERIAL .
UHHUH .
AND STUDIED EVERY BIT OF MATERIAL THAT I COULD STUDY BUT .
YEAH .
WE LAID THOSE BRICKS ABOUT AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN GET THEM .
I SEE .
BECAUSE WHEN YOU START AND WE PUT THEM ON A BASE OF FOUR INCHES OF S SAND .
OKAY YEAH .
AND THEN WE UH WE SWEPT SAND IN BETWEEN BUT .
UHHUH .
BUT IT WAS AN ERROR TO TO LEAVE LIKE AN EIGHTH OF AN INCH OR WHATEVER .
YOU JUST PUT THEM TOGETHER AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN .
AS TIGHT AS YOU CAN .
THAT S PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY HAD YOU KNOW EVERY SPRING MY MOM SAYS WE RE GOING TO HAVE A PAR A BARBECUE AND TELL EVERYBODY GUESS WHAT WE RE GOING TO WE RE GOING TO REDO THE PATIO YOU KNOW WE RE GOING TO PULL UP ALL THE BRICKS .
UHHUH .
BUT UH THEY JUST THEY JUST HAVE NT BROUGHT THEMSELVES TO DO IT .
YEAH WELL .
SO .
AND I ALSO USED A RUBBER HAMMER A LOT .
UHHUH .
TO UH .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW IF IT WAS NT QUITE LEVEL OR SOMETHING I D JUST GET THAT .
RIGHT .
RUBBER HAMMER AND UH AND AND PROB YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THEY COULD IF THEY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH UH SAND BUGS OF SOME KIND .
UHHUH .
I THINK ALL .
THEY NEED TO DO IS PROBABLY PUT SOME INSECTICIDE DOWN IN THERE .
YEAH .
ON A OH A FAIRLY REGULAR BASIS .
RIGHT .
FOR A WHILE ANYWAY .
RIGHT WELL THE THING .
THAT S FUNNY IS THEY VE DONE UH THEY VE DONE THINGS LIKE THAT YOU KNOW I LL CATCH HER OUT THERE SPRAYING AROUND AND THEN IT .
S LIKE IN TWO DAYS TIME .
THEY LL COME HOME FROM WORK AND THOSE LITTLE THINGS ARE BACK .
IT S JUST THEY RE THE MOST RESILIENT LITTLE CHARACTERS AND SO I DO NT KNOW WHAT .
THEY RE FINALLY GOING TO DO .
SHE MAY JUST HOPEFULLY THEY LL SELL THE HOUSE .
AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE .
WELL I THINK .
AND THEN SHE WO NT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT .
I THINK SHE NEEDS TO TAKE THEM TO THE EXTENSION AGENT AND ASK HIM .
WHAT .
THEY ARE AND .
WHAT ARE THESE THINGS .
YEAH IS IT .
DIAZINON OR WHAT IS IT .
THAT WILL UH .
RIGHT .
DURSBAN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
YEAH WHAT .
IT WHAT .
IT IS THAT LL THAT LL .
DURSBAN .
TAKE CARE OF THEM .
I THINK IN THIS AREA OR MOST ALL AREAS THEY USE YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
FOR TICKS AND FLEAS .
AND YOU KNOW THEY RE .
RIGHT .
AWFUL HARD TO DO ANYTHING WITH .
OH THAT S TRUE .
THAT S TRUE .
BUT MY MY DAD FARMS AND YOU KNOW SHE S ALWAYS TELLING HIM IS NT THERE SOMETHING THAT THAT YOU CAN BRING HOME WITH YOU .
THAT KILLS EVERYTHING THAT YOU SPRAY YOU KNOW OUT IN THE OUT IN THE FIELD THAT YOU CAN GET RID OF .
YEAH .
THESE BUGS BUT UH .
I BET DURSBAN WOULD DO IT .
IT MIGHT IT MIGHT DO IT YEAH .
SHE .
S GOT SO MANY FLOW SHE S GOT JUST A GORGEOUS YARD SO MANY UH FLOWERS AND HER HER FOUR CATS YOU KNOW SO SHE S SORT OF UH REAL FUNNY ABOUT WHAT .
SHE SPRAYS .
YEAH .
I THINK UH YOU PROBABLY JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DRIES .
UHHUH .
VERY VERY CAREFUL UH WELL .
UHHUH .
BEFORE SHE LETS HER CATS OUT OR SOMETHING .
YEAH .
LIKE THAT .
YEAH .
WELL GOSH DEB WE COULD TALK ALL DAY COULD NT WE .
I KNOW I I WAS JUST YOU KNOW IT JUST SEEMS LIKE I AS I SAID WHEN I HEARD THE WHAT .
THE SUBJECT WAS I THOUGHT OH GOSH I HAVE NT THOUGHT ABOUT UH WHAT .
I WENT THROUGH AT THAT OTHER HOUSE IN SO LONG .
I VE BEEN SO BUSY .
BUT UH I DO NT KNOW OF EVERYTHING THAT I DID I GUESS I ENJOYED PROBABLY WALLPAPERING THE MOST AND I THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE THE HARDEST THING TO DO .
YES .
BUT UH GOSH YOU KNOW I ENDED UP WALLPAPERING EVERY BEDROOM IN THAT HOUSE UH UP THE STAIRWAY .
WOW .
EVEN .
YOU KNOW I JUST HAD A BALL WITH IT .
OH .
IT WAS SO MUCH FUN .
OH GOOD .
YEAH .
AND I VE SWORN UP AND DOWN MY MOM S UH MY MOM S GREAT GRANDPARENTS HAD THIS HUGE VICTORIAN HOUSE IN PARIS TEXAS AND THE ONE THING THAT SHE ENDED UP WITH IS WAS THE OLD DOOR .
UHHUH .
THAT WAS THAT WAS ON THE FRONT DOOR OF THAT HOUSE .
YES .
AND SHE HAS THAT UP IN HER ATTIC AND I HAVE SWORN THAT .
IT I M GOING TO FIND A HOUSE TO PUT THAT DOOR ON BEFORE SHE DOES .
SO AS FAR AS LOOKING TOWARD THE FUTURE YOU KNOW THAT S MY PLAN .
I M GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE FAST .
I THINK THOUGH BECAUSE UH YOU KNOW AS A .
OKAY SO UH DO YOU OWN A P C .
UM NO NOT PERSONALLY BUT .
BUT YOU HAVE ONE AT WORK .
YES UHHUH YEAH SEVERAL .
OKAY AND NOW BECAUSE UM SEE I M I M DOING MY UH MASTER S IN COMPUTER SCIENCE AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING .
UHHUH .
AND UM AND I I DO NT HAVE ONE BUT I HAVE TO USE THEM .
RIGHT .
LIKE DURING ESPECIALLY DURING MY UNDERGRAD .
UHHUH .
YOU YOU USE UM LIKE YOUR FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS YOU USE PERSONAL COMPUTERS BECAUSE UH YOU KNOW THE SOFTWARE YOU KNOW LIKE IT S EASIER FOR YOU TO GO TO AND RUN A PROGRAM .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THROUGH THE DISK .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE UM THE GRADER CAN DO IT AT HOME .
YEAH .
THEN AS THE YOU KNOW AS YOU GO UP HIGHER LIKE IN YOUR SENIOR LEVEL YOU RE DOING PROJECTS WHICH ARE ARE SO BIG AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE SHARING THE SAME DATA .
UHHUH .
THAT YOU CA NT USE PERSONAL COMPUTERS SO YOU HAVE TO USE YOU KNOW A MAIN FRAME .
RIGHT RIGHT YEAH I KNOW I UH I DO HAVE A UH YOU KNOW A COMPUTER AT HOME BUT IT S ONE THAT THE COMPANY HAS LOANED ME .
OH OKAY .
AND THAT THAT S BEEN MY SITUATION IS THAT UH THAT WAY I CAN GET IN ACCESS OUR UH COMPUTERS THAT I HAVE UP HERE AND YOU KNOW DO WORK FROM HOME .
BUT DOES IT HAVE UH LIKE A DISK DRIVE .
OH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH .
OH OKAY BECAUSE UH THE ONES THAT WE USE YO YOU KNOW ARE LIKE UNIX BASE SYSTEMS .
RIGHT UHHUH .
AND SO THEY DO NT HAVE A DISK DRIVE .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW SO YOU CA NT THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU CAN DO IT IS THROUGH A MODEM .
RIGHT .
AND YOU YOU KNOW YOU JUST DO IT THAT WAY .
YEAH .
BUT THAT S UH THAT S THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU CAN GET TO THROUGH TO THE SYSTEM YOU CA NT STORE IT ANYWHERE .
RIGHT YEAH NO I UM I I HAVE BOTH BECAUSE THAT THAT S WHAT I USE ALL THE TIME IS UNIX SYSTEMS UM VERSUS THE DOS BUT THEN I TEACH DOS CLASSES UH AT NIGHT .
OH OKAY .
UHHUH PART TIME SO .
AND THEN YOU ALSO HAVE TO DO ALL YOUR GRADING ON THE P C .
WELL THAT THAT S THE REALLY NEAT THING I TEACH IN THE CONTINUING EDUCATION CLASSES SO I DO NT UH I DO NT HAVE TO HAVE GRAD ANY GRADES NO GRADE BOOKS SO THAT S GREAT .
OH OKAY .
BUT NO I FIND THAT I USE THE THE PERSONAL COMPUTER A LOT THOUGH FOR MY WORDPERFECT .
OKAY .
AND ALSO FOR MY SPREAD SHEETS .
YEAH .
UM SO I THINK IT S EXTREMELY HELPFUL AND VERY USEFUL .
WELL UH FOR US IT S UH UH YOU KNOW IT S LIKE FOR DOING LIKE YOU KNOW LIKE RESUMES .
UHHUH .
AND PRESENTATIONS .
UM UM UHHUH .
WE USE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE A MACKINTOSH WHICH IS A LOT EASIER FOR GRAPHICS .
YEAH .
THAN THE P THAN YOU KNOW THE I B M P C S OR ANYTHING COMPATIBLE WITH THAT .
RIGHT .
DUE DUE TO THE FACT THAT WELL YOU KNOW I I HAVE NT TESTED THE THE P S TWO YET .
UM UM UHHUH .
BUT I DO NT KNOW IF THE SOFTWARE IS AS EASILY YOU KNOW LIKE YOU CAN MANAGE IT A LOT EASIER THAN THAN THE OLD ONE .
RIGHT .
THE OLD ONE YOU HAD TO GO PICK A LINE USE LITTLE ARROWS TO GO ONTO THE SCREEN AND CHECK WHERE YOU WANTED TO START AND WHERE .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW WITH THE MOUSE YOU DO IT YOU KNOW LIKE A HUNDRED TIMES FASTER .
THAT S TRUE THAT S TRUE .
AND UH YOU ALSO GET YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SEE IT ON THE MACKINTOSH WITH YOU KNOW THE ONE I HAVE THAT DOES NT HAVE ANY COLOR YOU CAN LOOK AT IT AND THAT S THE WAY IT S GOING TO PRINT OUT .
UHHUH .
AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE A LASER PRINTER IT S GOING TO PRINT OUT THE SAME WAY AS IT S ON THE SCREEN .
OH UHHUH .
AND SO WITH YOU KNOW WITH THE I B M WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS UH SINCE THE SOFTWARE THAT I HAD WAS IT WAS BASICALLY YOU KNOW YOU ONLY SEE PART OF THE PAGE .
UHHUH .
AND SO THE WHOLE PAGE YOU YOU NEVER CAN ACTUALLY SEE IT .
OH .
YOU JUST DRAW IT AND THEY HAVE TO ZOOM OUT AND ZOOM IN AND YOU KNOW IT S LIKE EVERY TIME THAT YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING IS IT S REALLY A PAIN .
WHAT A HASSLE YEAH YEAH .
AND ALSO YOU KNOW IT S LIKE FOR FOR PRESENTATIONS IT S LIKE IF YOU HAVE TO DO ANY STATISTICAL DATA IT CAN BE EASILY REPRESENTED ON A ON A P C .
UHHUH .
IT CAN BE EASILY REPRESENTED ON A ON A P C YOU KNOW LIKE YEARS BACK WHEN YOU DID NT HAVE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO MAP OUT ALL THIS ALL THESE NUMBERS .
YEAH .
AND GET A GRAPH WHICH YOU WERE NT SURE IF IT WAS OKAY OR NOT YOU KNOW .
RIGHT YEAH .
BUT WITH A WITH A NEW SYSTEM I CAN CALCULATE EVERYTHING SO FAST .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW LIKE FOR SPREAD SHEETS .
RIGHT RIGHT .
YOU CAN SEE WHAT THE TREND IS OVER THE YEARS .
YEAH AND I LOVE ALL THE WINDOWS THAT THEY HAVE OUT NOW TOO .
YEAH THAT .
THEY HAVE REALLY SIMPLIFIED THINGS .
THAT I I HAD A I HAD A PROGRAM DUE AND UH ONE ONE WINDOW I HAD THE PROGRAM AND THE OTHER ONE I HAD THE PROGRAM RUNNING .
RIGHT RIGHT .
SO IF THERE WAS EVER A MISTAKE I COULD EASILY CHECK YOU KNOW I COULD LOOK AT THE PROGRAM AND SAY THIS IS WHERE I MADE THE ERROR .
RIGHT .
INSTEAD OF SAYING WHERE DID I MAKE THE ERROR .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW GO BACK AND FORTH AND AND YOU KNOW YOU ALWAYS YOU KNOW THE OLD ONES YOU HAD TO GO OUT OF YOUR PROGRAM LOAD UP UM UH WELL LOAD UP THE PROGRAM AGAIN .
UHHUH .
IN THIS CASE AFTER YOU LOAD IT UP CHANGE IT HOPE THAT S RIGHT .
GET OUT OF THAT RUN THE PROGRAM .
YES .
RUN UHHUH AS LONG AS IT TOOK .
YES .
AND THEN GO BACK AND SEE IF THAT WORKED OR NOT .
YEAH .
BUT WITH WINDOWS YOU CAN HAVE THE PROGRAM AND SAY IT MESSED UP IN LINE FIFTYFOUR .
YEAH .
SO YOU TAKE A LOOK AT LINE FIFTYFOUR YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE OUTPUT AT THE SAME TIME AND YOU CAN SEE THAT WHERE IT MESSED UP BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT S LIKE IN THE OLD COMPUTERS THE ONES THAT UH WE RE USING HERE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO YOU WOULD ALWAYS HAVE TO HAVE A PRINTOUT .
UHHUH .
EVERY TIME THAT YOU RAN YOUR PROGRAM .
YEAH .
YOU WOULD NEED A PRINTOUT BECAUSE EVERYTHING ELSE WAS ERASED IN THE BACKGROUND .
YEAH RIGHT RIGHT YEAH I KNOW I UH I REMEMBER MY COLLEGE DAYS AND HAVING TO DO THAT TOO .
DI DID DID YOU LEARN IT IN COMPUTER SCIENCE .
OH YEAH UHHUH I SURE DID .
AND WHEN WAS THIS .
UH I GRADUATED IN EIGHTYSIX .
OH OKAY .
YEAH SO IT S BEEN FAIRLY RECENT .
YEAH I KNOW BECAUSE UH ALL I KNOW IS THAT WHEN I CAME HERE IN EIGHTYSEVEN THEY STILL HAD UH .
THE CARDS .
IT WAS THE LAST YEAR TO TO PUT ALL YOUR PUNCH CARDS IN .
OH OH DEAR I DID NT HAVE TO BOTHER WITH THAT AT ALL THANK GOODNESS YEAH .
SO YEAH NO BUT IT IT WAS JUST SENSATIONAL BECAUSE I WALKED IN AND THEY GO OH MY GOD THEY RE STILL USING THIS .
YES .
IT WAS LIKE THIS IS THE LAST YEAR YOU CAN PUT YOUR PUNCH CARDS IN AND GET YOUR PROGRAM OUT AND YOU KNOW .
WOW WOW .
YOU CAN GET A HARD COPY OF IT AND THAT S ABOUT IT .
UHHUH WOW .
SO BUT I MEAN THE PRICE OF COMPUTERS HAS GONE DOWN THEY SAID THAT UM IF THE AUTO INDUSTRY WOULD HAVE KEPT THE SAME TREND AS THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY HAS EVER SINCE YOU KNOW IT STARTED .
UHHUH .
THEY SAID THAT UH CARS WOULD COST TWO DOLLARS AND THEY WOULD RUN FOREVER .
OH THAT WOULD BE GREAT .
SO I MEAN IT S LIKE YOU KNOW THE THE JOKE WITH THE YUGO YOU KNOW IT S LIKE YEAH YO YOU KNOW LIKE WHEN YOUR UH CAR RUNS OUT OF GAS JUST THROW IT AWAY .
UHHUH .
AND THAT THAT S THE WAY IT WOULD BE .
WOW .
IT S LIKE YEAH I THINK I LL BUY A NEW CAR TODAY YOU KNOW SO .
YEAH BUT I MEAN THE PRICE HAS REALLY GONE DOWN I MEAN I B M WHICH UH AN I B M P C IN LIKE IN NINETEEN EIGHTYONE IT WOULD COST YOU FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS .
OH SURE OH SURE .
AND NOW YOU CAN GET IT YOU KNOW LIKE FOR ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS BECAUSE YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF THE PARTS BASICALLY .
RIGHT YEAH AND THE TWO EIGHTYSIX TOO SO YEAH .
YEAH THE PARTS AND THE LABOR IS WHAT THEY RE CHARGING YOU THEY RE NOT CHARGING YOU YOU KNOW OVER PRICING .
UHHUH .
IT BECAUSE IT S LIKE IF WE SELL IT FOR LESS YOU KNOW IT S LIKE WE RE LOSING MONEY YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
IT S LIKE WE WANT TO SELL IT TO BREAK EVEN AT LEAST .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK THEY STOPPED PRODUCING THE I B M P C .
UHHUH .
AND UH AND THE UH P C JUNIOR WAS A TOTAL FAILURE .
OH .
TO THEM .
YEAH .
THEY HAD UH THEY RE TRYING TO GET OUT SMALL COMPUTERS BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THAT WHEN THEY TOOK THAT ONE OUT THE SMALL COMPUTER WAS THE I B M P C .
AND SO YOU COULD NT YOU KNOW IT S LIKE SURE BRING OUT N INTO THE MARKET SOMETHING THAT S SMALLER WHEN NO NOBODY USES ANYTHING THAT S SMALLER THAN YOU KNOW THIS YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
AND SO .
OH .
BUT OVER THE PAST YEARS IT S LIKE I B M HAS BEEN PRODUCING LIKE EVERY TWO YEARS THEY BRING OUT A WHOLE NEW SYSTEM .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW LIKE THE P C X T A T AND THE P S ONE P S TWO THINGS YOU KNOW AND SO IT S JUST THAT YOU HAVE TO ALWAYS COMPETE AND UH MACKINTOSH TOOK A LOT OF THE MARKET FROM A LOT OF SCHOOLS .
YEAH .
BECAUSE OF OF THEIR YOU KNOW YOU CAN WORK WITH IT A LOT EASIER .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
SO THAT S WHAT THEY RE TRYING TO DO OH WELL .
WELL .
I LL LEAVE YOU BACK TO YOUR WORK .
OKAY .
AND UH HAVE A GOOD LUNCH .
THANKS BYE .
ALL RIGHT BYE BYE .
OKAY UM SO UM DO YOU HAVE ANY FAVORITE TEAMS .
WELL I KIND OF LIKE THEM ALL I PLAYED FOR ABOUT EIGHTEEN YEARS ALL THE WAY THROUGH COLLEGE AND THEN UH KIND OF HUNG THEM UP AFTER COLLEGE BUT .

YEAH .
I NEVER FOU I NEVER QUITE FOUND A NEW YORK FAN .
I ALWAYS FOUND A FAN YOU KNOW OF EITHER ONE OR THE OTHER AND SO THAT OF COURSE MEANS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO THE AMERICAN LEAGUE MY FAVORITE TEAM IS THE RED SOX .
OH OKAY .
BY DEFAULT BECAUSE I WENT TO COLLEGE ALSO IN BOSTON .
I SEE YEAH I LIKE THE UH HUH I GUESS IF I HAD TO PICK A FAVORITE TEAM ANY MORE AS WELL AS I KIND OF GREW UP ROOTING FOR PHILADELPHIA .

WELL I DO NT KNOW UM THERE S THERE S A PART OF ME THAT SAYS THAT YOU KNOW UM I M SORT OF GLAD STRAWBERRY WENT AWAY .
YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN HE SORT OF WENT AWAY I STARTED THINKING YEAH WELL HE WAS PERFORMING FAIRLY WELL BUT HE REALLY WAS NT WORTH THE BAGGAGE YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
UM I THINK THEY RE OKAY I THINK THEY RE YOU KNOW I THINK THEY HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO ARE WHO ARE STILL IN THEIR PRIME YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
UM I MEAN CERTAINLY IF YOU LOOK AT THEM COMPARED TO LET S SAY YOU KNOW UM EIGHT YEARS AGO OR SOMETHING THEY RE .

THEY RE THEY RE THEY RE YOU KNOW THEY RE SORT OF IN IN GOOD STANDING WHEREAS YOU KNOW UM I THINK I CERTAINLY DO NT THINK THEY RE THE EIGHTYSIX TEAM ANY MORE .

YEAH I .
THAT WAS THAT WAS THE YEAR THEY BEAT HOUSTON IN EXTRA INNINGS RIGHT .
RIGHT THEY MUMBLEX BEAT HOUSTON IN EXTRA INNINGS AND THEN THEY ACTUALLY WON THE SERIES BYEBYE SORT OF A SNEAKY ROUTE UM AGAINST BOSTON .

YEAH FOR HAVING HIM OUT THERE .
THAT S RIGHT SO .

SO I I I WAS UH I WAS ALSO I WAS IN SCHOOL AT BOSTON AT THE TIME .
OH BOY .
SO I IT WAS ACTUALLY WONDERFUL BECAUSE WHERE I WAS THEY WERE HALF MET FANS AND UM HALF SOX FANS .
YEAH I THINK WE WERE ALL PRETTY MUCH UH ASTROS FANS IN THE NATIONAL LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES .

BUT THERE S LIKE TWO FELLOWS FROM UH BROOKLYN .
AND THEY THEY WERE YOU KNOW THEY WERE PRETTY MUCH WITHOUT HAVING TO SAY THEY WERE PRETTY MUCH METS FANS .

ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF NOT HAVING PITCHERS WHO ARE .

I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY COUNTRIES THAT UH ARE VERY SUCCESSFUL WITH THE OPERATION OF THE GOVERNMENT UH PROVIDING THAT PLAN .
UHHUH DO THEY HAVE OPTIONS ON WHO THEY UH YOU KNOW LIKE CHOICES OF DOCTORS AND THAT TYPE OF THING DO YOU .
UM I M NOT SURE WHA HOW THEIR PROGRAM IS RUN BUT I KNOW IT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL .
UHHUH .
AND I WOULD REALLY HAVE TO UH READ THE HISTORY OF PROBABLY I UH THE COUNTRY THAT HAS FARED VERY WELL WITH IT AND I D LIKE TO SEE THE UH THE DATA ON THAT .
UHHUH THAT S THE WAY WITH ME I DO NT KNOW A WHOLE LOT ABOUT IT I WOUL THAT S THE ONLY CONCERN I WOULD HAVE BECAUSE I THINK PERSONALITIES PLUS THE TYPE OF DOCTOR IT IS HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THE CARE AND IF YOU DID NT HAVE ANY CHOICE .
WELL I .
ON YOU KNOW IN WHO YOU GO TO .
YES I THINK THAT S PRIMARY IS IF YOU HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP .
UHHUH UHHUH .
WITH YOUR DOCTOR THAT YOU CAN FEEL FREE TO DISCUSS ANYTHING WITH HIM .
UHHUH .
AND UH .
OR TO CHANGE EVEN LIKE IF YOU DID NT APPROVE OR DID NT THINK YOU WERE GETTING GOOD SERVICE .
OH ABSOLUTELY THAT THE CHOICE WOULD BE YOURS .
UHHUH .
YES IF YOU FELT THAT YOU WERE NT BEING UM GIVEN THE PROPER GUIDELINES .
UHHUH .
FOR YOUR HEALTH THAT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE UM A CHOICE THERE .
UHHUH THERE THAT S ONE OF MY MAIN CONCERNS I I HAVE A FRIEND THAT HAS THEIR BOY HAS BEEN SICK FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AND THEY JUST HAVE FOUND OUT WHAT S THE TROUBLE AND THEY HAVE GONE THROUGH UH ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE DOCTORS AND THEN A TEAM OF DOCTORS AND THEY FINALLY DETERMINED WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS IT TOOK THAT LONG .
YES AND THE EXPENSE OF THAT YES .
AND THAT THAT SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW I THOUGHT IF YOU COULD NT CHANGE OR LOOK ELSEWHERE YOU KNOW FOR HELP IF YOU WER I DO NT KNOW HOW THAT PROGRAM WORKS YOU KNOW IF YOU CAN DO THAT .
WELL I WOULD I WOULD THINK THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THAT AS PART PART OF THE BENEFIT .
UHHUH UHHUH .
TO THE HEALTH CARE PROGRAM THAT YOU WOULD INDEED HAVE A CHOICE THAT YOU COULD SELECT THAT INDIVIDUAL .
UHHUH .
YOURSELF AND I M SURE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE A HISTORY OF EACH DOCTOR AND HOPEFULLY THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THEIR UM ACCREDITATIONS THERE TOO .
UHHUH UHHUH I GUESS THAT S THAT S PRIMARILY WAS ONE OF MY THOUGHTS YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOW GOVERNMENT IS .
YES UM BUT THOSE GUIDELINES HAVE TO BE SET UP AND I THINK THEY SHOULD BE VOTED ON BY THE PUBLIC .
UHHUH .
AND UH .
FOR THEM TO HAVE A CHOICE ON .
UHHUH UHHUH .
IF THEY RE IN FAVOR OF IT OR NOT .
RIGHT YES .
IT IT WOULD .
AND OF COURSE THEY WOULD GIVE A FULL PLAN OF WHAT THEIR INTENTIONS WOULD BE AND UM I THINK THAT S PRIMARY UH .
UHHUH .
FOR THE HEALTH IF THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE A UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE PLAN .
UHHUH UHHUH .
THAT UH THEY WOULD HAVE ALL THE FACTS AND THE FIGURES AND UH WHAT IT WOULD MEAN TO EACH INDIVIDUAL FAMILY .
UHHUH .
OR AN ID INDIVIDUAL PERHAPS BEING SINGLE .
UHHUH UHHUH UHHUH .
UM I M NOT SURE WHAT ELSE THAT UH WE COULD ADDRESS UH ON HEALTH CARE UH OTHER THAN THE FACT I THINK UH THE EYES AND THE EARS AND THE UH WHOLE SELF SHOULD BE UH UH INCLUDED IN ALL OF THAT .
UHHUH UHHUH .
UH DENTAL EYE CARE AND UH OUR BODY .
UHHUH .
AS A WHOLE SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THAT .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY AVENUES THAT NEEDS TO BE UM UNDERTAKEN IN A PROGRAM LIKE THAT UM I WOULD NT WANT TO HAVE TO GO FOR A PRIVATE DOCTOR FOR ANYTHING AND NOT BE COVERED BY THE PROGRAM .
UHHUH I KNOW WHERE MY SON WORKS THEY HAVE UH AN OPTION RIGHT NOW WHERE THEY CAN HAVE THEIR OWN PHYSICIAN OR THEY CAN CHOOSE ONE THAT THEIR COMPANY HAS ELECTED .
UHHUH .
AND THAT COSTS THEM LESS IF THEY TAKE THE DOCTOR THAT UH THAT THE COMPANY HAS SELECTED .
AND DOES HE HAVE AN OPTION .
HE GE .
UH IF HE DOES NT CARE FOR THE PERSONALITY .
WELL ONLY TO THE POINT THAT HE COULD GO TO SOMEBODY AT HIS OWN EXPENSE .
OH I SEE .
OTHERWISE HE WO YOU KNOW HE HAS TO TAKE THE PHYSICIAN THAT UH AND THE HOSPITAL THAT THE COMPANY HAS CHOSEN AS THEIR YOU KNOW THE ONE THEY HAVE TAKEN AND THERE AGAIN I MEAN HE S GOTTEN GOOD SERVICE HE TOOK THE LESS EXPENSIVE ONE OF COURSE .
WELL IF HE S PLEASED WITH IT I GUESS THAT S UH THE BOTTOM LINE .
UHHUH UHHUH UH .
SO BUT I I WOULD BE AFRAID OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU HAD A PERSONALITY CONFLICT OR SOMETHING .
RIGHT RIGHT YEAH .
YEAH CAUSE THERE S ALWAYS THAT OPPOSITE STORY THERE .
UH CAUSE THAT S THE FIRST I VE REALLY KNOWN ANYBODY THAT YOU KNOW WORKS FOR SOMEBODY THAT THEY HAD THAT OPTION YOU KNOW TO MAKE THE CHOICE .
UHHUH .
OF WHAT KIND OF INSURANCE POLICY THEY WHAT KIND OF HOSPITALIZATION THEY WANTED TO TAKE .
IT S QUITE DIFFERENT FROM WHEN I WAS UH UNDER DOCTOR S CARE THAT S FOR SURE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
I M I M VERY THANKFUL THAT I M NOT UNDER ANY DOCTOR S CARE .
OH IF YOU HAVE YOUR HEALTH YOU RE WEALTHY .
THAT S RIGHT .
YOU REALLY ARE YEAH YEAH .
YES .
UH WE LIVE IN A RURAL AREA UP HERE .
UHHUH WHAT PART OF UH PENNSYLVANIA DO YOU LIVE IN .

UH UH SEEMS LIKE IT WAS ON A FRIDAY .
UH .
FRIDAY OR .
THAT SOUNDED LIKE ONE .
UHHUH UM I THINK THAT THERE IS SOMETHING DEFINITELY WRONG WITH OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM JUST BECAUSE OF THE RESULTS THAT YOU SEE COMING OUT OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM .
UHHUH .
AS FAR AS UH PEOPLE DROPPING OUT OF SCHOOL UH GRADES ON TEST SCORES BEING LOW UH MORE AND MORE PEOPLE TAKING G E D S TRYING TO GET OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL INSTEAD OF JUST GOING THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW SOMETHING MUST BE WRONG AS FAR AS UH MAK NOT JUST THE TEACHING TECHNIQUES BUT JUST MOTIVATION .
YEAH .
WITHIN WITHIN THE SCHOOLS THEMSELVES .
YEAH EXCUSE ME JUST A MINUTE .
UHHUH .
UH I M ON THE OTHER LINE KAREN I M SORRY .
OH IT S OKAY .
OKAY UH SHE UH YEAH WELL THE THE RESULTS I I HEAR WHAT YOU RE YOU RE SAYING ABOUT THE RESULTS .
UHHUH .
AND UH IT S WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT I GUESS IS THE THE BIG THING .
YEAH .
I M I M IN A KIND OF AN INTERESTING SITUATION IN THAT MY MY WIFE TEACHES SCHOOL HERE IN PLANO .
UHHUH .
AND I KNOW THAT UH THE RESULTS THAT THEY GET OUT OF THE SYSTEM SOMETIME IS IS CERTAINLY NOT YOU KNOW UP TO WHAT THE EFFORT THEY PUT INTO IT YOU KNOW I VE SEEN THAT FOR YEARS YEAH .
RIGHT AND I KNOW UH I WORK AROUND YOU KNOW A LOT OF TEACHERS AND I U I UNDERSTAND HOW UH SUPPORTIVE THEY ARE OF THEIR STUDENTS AND HOW EXCITED THEY ARE .
UHHUH .
BUT SOME HOW I DO NT THINK THE STUDENTS ARE GETTING EXCITED .
YEAH I VE OFTEN WONDERED IF IT DOES NT COME BACK TO THE THE HOME ENVIRONMENT .
OH YES DEFINITELY UHHUH .
AND UH IT IF UH NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO IN THE THE CLASSROOM IF THEY GO HOME AT NIGHT AND YOU KNOW IT S ALL TOTALLY UNDONE UH .
UHHUH .
THE THE THING THAT UH UH THAT KAREN MY WIFE HAS HAS RUN INTO SO OFTEN IS THAT YOU RUN INTO A GROUP OF KIDS THAT ARE GOING TO SUCCEED NO MATTER WHAT NO MATTER HOW BAD THEIR TEACHERS ARE .
RIGHT RIGHT .
NO MATTER WHAT A LOUSY SYSTEM THEY RE IN OR ANYTHING ELSE .
UHHUH .
THESE PEOPLE SOMEHOW MANAGE TO UH YOU KNOW .
PROGRESS UHHUH .
PUSH ON THROUGH AND ARE SUCCESSFUL IT S UH UNFORTUNATELY PROBABLY WHAT MAYBE TWENTYFIVE OR THIRTY PERCENT OF THEM DO THAT .
YEAH NOT NOT EVEN THAT MUCH PROBABLY .
WELL YE THAT WOULD BE BE AT THE ABSOLUTE MOST .
YEAH UHHUH .
AND UH YOU KNOW THOSE THOSE THAT YOU KNOW COME OUT YOU KNOW FALL OUT OF THE SYSTEM THAT ARE ARE REAL TROUBLE .
UHHUH .
I I WONDER WHETHER THAT S JUST A UH UH A PART OF THE SYSTEM YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
IF YOU KNOW IN A DEMOCRACY WHERE YOU KNOW PEOPLE HAVE KIND OF UH A FREEDOM TO SORT OF DO WHAT THEY WANT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THERE THERE S AN INEFFICIENCY THERE .
UHHUH .
AND YOU VE GOT TO LET THOSE YOU KNOW THOSE .
AND SPEAKING SPEAKING OF DOING WHAT YOU WANT UH JUST IN SOCIETY TODAY BEING THAT IT S NINETEEN NINETYONE .
UHHUH .
UM A LOT OF TEENAGERS AND YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE A LOT MORE FREEDOM AS FAR AS WHAT THEY DO .
OH OH YEAH .
AS FAR AS YOU KNOW EVEN EVEN SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS STAYING UP LATE UM WATCHING TELEVISION LATE UM .
UHHUH .
GOING OUT LATE START DATING YOU START DATING TOO EARLY YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
JUST LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT THAT DO START IN THE HOME .
YEAH .
THAT CAN THAT PLAYS A BIG PART BECAUSE YOU SPEND EIGHT HOURS OF YOUR DAY OR MORE IN SCHOOL AND SO ANY OTHER PART OF YOUR LIFE THAT S GOING TO DEFINITELY AFFECT YOUR SCHOOL LIFE .
YEAH .
BECAUSE YOU SPEND SO MUCH TIME THERE .
AND SOMETIMES IN SOME SYSTEMS THEY MAKE EVERYTHING SO COMPETITIVE YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
YOU FROM THE MINUTE THAT YOU WALK IN UNTIL YO UNTIL YOU LEAVE YOUR YOUR COMPETING AGAINST SOMEBODY ELSE OR YOUR COMPETING AGAINST UH A SYSTEM OR OR SOMETHING .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW AND THEN A LOT OF THE THERE IS A PERSONALITY TYPE I BELIEVE THAT IS REALLY NONCOMPETITIVE THEY RE COOPERATIVE RATHER THAN COMPETITIVE .
UHHUH .
AND WHEN THEY GET INTO A REAL COMPETITIVE SYSTEM THEY JUST SAY OH WELL WHAT THE HECK .
UHHUH .
AND UH TEND NOT TO YOU KNOW DO TOO AWFUL WELL MUMBLEX .
RIGHT I TALKED TO A GUY THE OTHER DAY AND HE IS NOW IN IN A PROGRAM THAT S TRYING TO GET HIM OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL BECAUSE HE HE FELL BACK SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND HE S GOING TO HE HE WILL HAVE GONE TO SCHOOL FIVE YEARS .
YEAH .
UM AND THE REASON THAT HE WAS DOING SO BADLY A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WAS BECAUSE HIS MOTHER DIED .
UHHUH .
AND HE WAS HAVING TO UH SUPPORT HIS ENTIRE FAMILY TAKE CARE OF HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
AND ALL THAT HAD AN ADVERSE AFFECT ON HIS SCHOOL LIFE .
I WOULD THINK SO YEAH .
AND YEAH AND THAT AND THAT S A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF HOW YOUR HOME LIFE YOU KNOW PLAYS A DEFINITE PART AND YOU KNOW .
YEAH YEAH .
ANY OTHER ASPECT OF YOUR LIFE AN BUT NOW NOW THAT HE S IN THIS PROGRAM AND YOU KNOW HE S I GUESS OKAY HE S HE S MAKING STRAIGHT A S AND YOU KNOW IT JUST IT IT WAS THERE IT WAS JUST I GUESS SCHOOL WAS NOT A NUMBER ONE PRIORITY FOR HIM AT THAT TIME .
YEAH IT UH RIGHT SURVIVAL BECOMES MORE OF A PRIORITY THAN THAN EDUCATION .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND UNFORTUNATELY YOU KNOW THERE S UH THERE S AND OLD JOKE ABOUT UH YOU KNOW EDUCATION S WASTED ON THE YOUTH ANYWAY .
YOU DO NT YOU DO NT REALLY APPRECIATE IT UNTIL YOU RE MUCH OLDER ANYWAY .
RIGHT EXACTLY .
I KNOW WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL UH MY ATTITUDE WAS KIND OF ONE OF YOU KNOW THESE PEOPLE ARE YOU KNOW TAKING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MY TIME .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND I VE GOT BETTER THINGS TO BE DOING THAN SITTING HERE LISTENING TO THIS STUFF OVER AND OVER AGAIN .
EX EXACTLY .
I GUESS TODAY THAT WOULD BE UH SOME HOW OR OTHER THERE WOULD BE A PROGRAM OF SOME SORT THAT WOULD TAKE CARE OF THAT SORT OF THING BUT .
UM .
THE UH THE CURE SOME OF THE CURES THAT I VE HEARD FOR THIS THAT THAT SORT OF MAKE SENSE .
UHHUH .
UH MOST TEACHERS AFTER THEY HAVE TAUGHT FOR A VERY LONG ESPECIALLY AT THE THE LOWER GRADES CAN SPOT A PROBLEM ALMOST IMMEDIATELY .
UHHUH .
AND UH IT S KIND OF THESE INTERVENTION PROGRAMS NOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL GET TO LOOKING AT THESE AND SAY HEY THAT S SOCIALISM AND THAT S COMMUNISM .
RIGHT .
AND THAT S YOU KNOW AND THEN IT GETS POLITICAL .
UHHUH .
BUT UH BOY .
WHEN PEOPLE START TALKING ABOUT PROGRAMS THAT HELP FOR ME I DO NT CARE IF IT S SOCIALIST OR I DO NT CARE .
AS LONG AS IT S SOMETHING THAT S GOING TO DO SOME GOOD OR THAT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE BENEFICIAL .
UHHUH YEAH .
I MEAN THAT S THE POINT I M AT NOW I MEAN THAT S THE POINT WE ALL SHOULD BE AT IS LIKE FINDING SOME SOLUTION .
UM YEAH .
I MEAN YOU KNOW NOTHING TOTALLY RADICAL BUT IF IT S SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW MIGHT HELP YOU KNOW BECAUSE THERE S NOT A LOT BEING DONE .
WELL YOU KNOW THE THE RADICAL PROGRAMS IN SOME CASES ARE JUST TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE THERE ARE KIDS FAMILIES THAT SHOULD JUST SIMPLY BE TAKEN OUT OF THE HOMES YOU KNOW .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND UH UH YOU KNOW UH JUST REMOVED FROM THOSE SITUATIONS .
RIGHT .
OR THEY RE NEVER GOING TO GET ANYWHERE BUT YET POLITICALLY THAT IS NOT A VERY POPULAR VIEW .
UHHUH .
I M SURE THAT IF YOU YOU KNOW RAN ON A PLATFORM OF YOU KNOW WE RE GOING TO FIND THE KIDS THAT ARE HAVING TROUBLE AT HOME AND WE RE GOING TO TAKE THEM OUT OF THE HOME .
TAKE THEM OUT .
YEAH YOU KNOW HOW FAR YOU RE GOING TO GET WITH THAT .
YEAH NOT VERY FAR AT ALL .
UH BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT S IT S SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN LIEU OF THAT YOU KNOW IS THE INTERVENTION PROGRAMS IN SCHOOL WHERE THE THESE KIDS ARE ARE SPOTTED FAIRLY EARLY ON .
UHHUH .
AND UH YOU KNOW THERE S WELL THAT S GET TO BE A PROBLEM IN TEXAS YOU KNOW .
I MEAN IT S IT S ALMOST LIKE .
BECAUSE DIFFERENT SCHOOL SYSTEMS HAVE GOT MORE OR LESS MONEY TO TAKE CARE OF THAT SORT OF THING .
RIGHT RIGHT .
YOU GOT COUNSELORS AND ALL THAT BUT YOU KNOW YOU CAN COUNSEL A KID EIGHT HOURS A DAY AND THEN HE GOES HOME AND AND UH YOU KNOW IN THE IN WORST CASES HE S GOT PARENTS EITHER ON DRUGS OR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
RIGHT .
OR THEY DO NT CARE YOU KNOW MAMMA WHA GUESS WHAT I DID IN SCHOOL TODAY WELL WHO CARES YOU KNOW .
AN A LOT OF IT A LOT OF THE PARENTS NOW ARE SO YOUNG .
TRUE .
YOU KNOW THAT THEY RE THEY STILL THEY STILL DO NT KNOW WHAT S GOING ON AND HOW ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO YOU KNOW TEACH THEIR KIDS THAT ARE COMING UP YOU KNOW WHAT S GOING ON I MEAN IT S JUST IT S A VICIOUS CYCLE .
YEAH .
THAT WE RE YOU KNOW DEAD SMACK DEAD IN THE CENTER OF AND WE HAVE TO TRY TO SWIM OUT YOU KNOW KIND OF LIKE THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE WE RE JUST SINKING AND IT S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO SWIM BACK UP .
YEAH .
BUT UM YEAH THERE S DEFINITELY PROBLEMS .
YEAH I M .
ITS JUST THE SOLUTIONS THAT YOU KNOW THEY RE GOING TO BE IN OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM THEY RE GOING TO BE ON EVERYONE S MIND FOR QUITE A WHILE TOO LONG .
I DO NT KNOW IF YOU VE EVER HAD TOO MUCH TO DO WITH UH OH ESPECIALLY ASIAN JAPANESE FAMILIES COMING HERE IN PLANO WE VE GOT UH QUITE A FEW .
UHHUH UHHUH .
UH ENGINEERING TYPES PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME FROM JAPAN .
RIGHT .
AND THEY PUT THEIR KIDS IN THE U S SCHOOLS AND THEY RE APPALLED .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW NOT SO MUCH AT WHAT THE SCHOOLS ARE TEACHING BUT WHAT THEY LET THE KIDS GET AWAY WITH .
UM UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THEY THEY SEE MOST UH THEY RE THEY RE QUITE UPSET ABOUT THE UH THE DISRUPTIVE INFLUENCE OF SCHOOL MOST OF THEM WOULD SAY YOU KNOW THOSE PEOPLE SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE SCHOOL SYSTEM .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND IN JAPAN THEY WOULD BE YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
BUT UH HERE AGAIN YOU GET BACK INTO A POLITICAL THING WHERE UH .
YEAH THERE S THERE S RIGHT THERE S DEFINITELY TOO MUCH LEEWAY AS FAR AS .
UHHUH .
I MEAN I VE ONLY BEEN OUT OF I VE BEEN OUT OF COLLEGE ONLY TWO YEARS .
UHHUH .
AND YOU WERE SAYING THAT YOU DO NT APPRECIATE EDUCATION UNTIL YOU GET OUT AND I I ALREADY YOU KNOW I REALLY DID NT I REALLY DO NT SEE MYSELF GOING BACK TO SCHOOL OR ANYTHING BUT I APPRECIATE MORE WHAT I HAD .

I GUESS IN THE ICE AGE IT IT IT S PUSHED A LOT OF UH LIMESTONE AND EVERYTHING .

UHHUH UHHUH .

UHHUH .
AND KEEPING YOUR BILLS DOWN UH I GUESS YOU HAVE MOSTLY PINE TREES BUT WHERE IN VIRGINIA ARE YOU ALL .
UM RIGHT NOW THE DISTRICT WASHINGTON .
UHHUH .
UM IN FAIRFAX VIRGINIA IT S FIFTEEN MILES WEST OF WASHINGTON D C .
OH DO YOU HAVE THE CHERRY BLOSSOMS THERE IN THERE OR NOT .

UHHUH .
YEAH .
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN DOWN HERE .
UM NO ACTUALLY I HAVE NT .
OKAY IT S INTERESTING COUNTRY IT IS WIDE OPEN UH AND FLAT .
UHHUH .
UH AND AGAIN AS I SAID I THINK THE WHEN THE INDIANS WERE HERE THERE THERE WERE NT ANY TREES BUT THE THE CIVILIZATION HAS BROUGHT ALL KINDS OF EXPERIMENTS WITH ALL KINDS OF TREES AND A LOT OF THEM HAVE DONE WELL .
UHHUH .
UH THEY DO HAVE SOME PINE FOREST AREAS IN WES IN WES IN EAST TEXAS .
UHHUH .
WHERE YOU HAVE NATIVE PINE TREES BUT HERE IN DALLAS IT S I THINK THEY ALL WERE PLANTED BY THE CLASSICAL JOHNNY APPLESEED AND JOHNNY PECANSEED WHATEVER YOU WOULD CALL IT YOU KNOW THERE S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PECAN TREES .
UHHUH .
THAT WE USE FOR YOU KNOW UH FOR EATING .
UHHUH .
I THINK THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS GOING TO BE A GREAT BOOM CROP UH HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE .
UHHUH .
IN THE SOUTH WHAT ELSE .
UM WELL I GUESS THAT I REALLY DO NT KNOW THAT MUCH .
I DO NT HAVE ANY SAY I I THE SUBJECTS ARE USUALLY PRETTY INTERESTING I I M I M OF COURSE I M A T I ER SO I M HOPING THIS WORKS T I IS VERY GOOD UH HAS DONE A LOT OF EXPERIMENTS IN THE SPEECH UH .
UHHUH .
SPEECH UH SYNTHESIS SYNTHESIS CA NT SAY IT .
UHHUH .
AND THEY VE COME OUT WITH SOME NEW PRODUCTS IN FACT THIS WEEK THEY CAME OUT WITH SOME NEW MATH UH YOU MIGHT SEE THEM IN YOUR ADVERTISEMENTS UH NEW MATH UH SPEAK AND MATH UH DEVICES THEY THEY HAVE HAD SPEAK AND SPELL AND ALL THAT FOR YEARS .
RIGHT .
BUT THEY VE COME OUT WITH SOME DIFFERENT ONES .
UHHUH .
THIS PAST WEEK AND UH MY WIFE AND EVERYONE WHAT WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO ACCOMPLISH OUT OF ALL THIS AND I SAID WELL YOU RE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO TYPE ON THE COMPUTER ONE DAY YOU RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO TALK TO IT .
RIGHT UHHUH .
YOU KNOW SO YOU YOU IT S GOING TO BE MUCH FASTER OF COURSE YOU KNOW THE CLASSICAL THING FOR THE HANDICAPPED TOO PERSON WHO CA NT TYPE VERY FAST OR .
UHHUH .
LIKE I CAN OF COURSE .
UHHUH .
NOT THAT I CAN TYPE VERY FAST EITHER BUT UH .
UHHUH BUT THEN WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE THAT UM I I I PERSONALLY WORK WITH SOMEONE THAT THAT IS DEAF AND CAN NOT SPEAK SHE CAN SPEAK BUT SHE CA NT SPEAK VERY CLEARLY .
YEAH .
AND SHE IN FACT IS A DATA ENTRY PERSON I MEAN SHE TYPES AWAY ALL DAY .
WELL I I VE BEEN UH I HAVE PROBABLY HAD MORE TIME THAN YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THIS SUBJECT .
UHHUH .
SO I LL TELL YOU IS IT .
A SERIOUS PROBLEM .
YES I DO .
YEAH .
BELIEVE IT S A SERIOUS PROBLEM .
UHHUH .
HOWEVER THERE ARE SOLUTIONS TO IT .
UHHUH .
AND FOREMOST UH WHERE WE COMPARE W THAT WE ARE NOW DOING FIFTY PERCENT OF OUR UH PEOPLE ARE VOTING .
UH WE RE PROBABLY MAKING A COMPARISON AGAINST UH SOME EUROPEAN AND UH AND UH UH SSSAY NEWER REPUBLICS .
THAT UH .
UHHUH .
THAT HAVE VERY HIGH PERCENTAGES .
UHHUH .
UH SO UH ONE OF THE REASONS UH THAT UH O ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE COULD GET UH ONE OF THE REASONS THAT IT IS LOWER IN THE UNITED STATES IS THAT MOSTLY WE HOLD IT ON TUESDAYS .
GOD KNOWS WHY WE HOLD IT ON TUESDAYS .
AND THEN WE FURTHER .
WHAT .
COMPLICATE IT BY SAYING YOU KNOW WE WILL KEEP THE POLLS OPEN UNTIL EIGHT OCLOCK .
RIGHT .
MOST PEOPLE UH A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE NOW WORK AT VARIOUS AT DIFFERENT JOBS THAT IF A THIRD OF THE PEOPLE ARE SHIFT WORKERS THEY WO NT BE ABLE TO GET TO THE TO THE POLLS IN ANY CASE .
IF THEY UH HAVE TO WORK LATE INTO THE EVENING AND NOT GET UP .
MY SOLUTION .
RIGHT .
TO THAT IS THAT WE HOLD IT ON SUNDAYS .
AS DO PROBABLY SIXTY TO SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES NOW .
OH REALLY THEY HOLD IT ON THE WEEKENDS .
THEY HOLD IT ON THE WEEK NO THEY HOLD IT ON A EITHER A .
SUNDAY .
SATURDAY OR A SUNDAY .
UHHUH .
OR AT LEAST A DAY WHEN WHEN UH A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE NOT WORKING .
HUH .
I IN AMERICA .
THAT IS NOT TRUE BECAUSE A A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE WORK ON SUNDAYS .
WELL UH .
BU BUT THAT IS ONE OF MY SOLUTIONS .
UH .
I I KNOW HERE IN DALLAS THAT THEY HAVE JUST INSTITUTED IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS A UH A REAL LONG PERIOD OF TIME THAT YOU CAN ABSENTEE VOTE BEFORE THE ELECTIONS .
AND THEY I DO NOT THINK THEY HAVE SEEN A REALLY HIGH .
HAVE YOU .
ABSENTEE .
IMPROVEMENT .
VOTED IN IN .
NO .
IN TEXAS .
NO I ALWAYS VOTE .
WELL I HAVE ABSENTEE VOTED IN UH NEW HAMPSHIRE AND IT IS A FAIRLY FAIRLY COMPLICATED PROCESS WHERE YOU HAVE TO GO .
OH REALLY .
PICK UP THE BALLOT .
I DO NOT SAY THAT IT IS THAT COMPLICATED BUT PART OF THE PROCESS ALSO IS THAT YOU MUST REGISTER PREREGISTER AT SOME PARTICULAR POINT .
NEW HAMPSHIRE IS FAIRLY EASY BUT OTHER STATES .
HUH .
YOU HAVE TO REGISTER EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS .
AND UH .
TO ABSENTEE VOTE SPECIFICALLY .
WELL TO VOTE TO VOTE TO JUST VOTE .
OH .
SO REGISTRATIONS ARE PERHAPS A A PROBLEM ALSO .
AND WE RE THE MOBILE MOBILE SOCIETY UH .
UHHUH .
PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS MO YOU KNOW ONE OUT OF EVERY SEVEN PEOPLE MOVES EVERY YEAR .
UH TH THAT IS ALMOST A FOURTEEN PERCENT TURNOVER .
EVERY .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW IF YOU COMPOUND THAT THAT UH EH EH TH I IF IT IS DIFFICULT TO REGISTER TO VOTE THAT WOULD REMOVE YOUR ELIGIBILITY TO VOTE .
BUT I DO NOT THINK IT IS DIFFICULT ENOUGH TO PREVENT PEOPLE .
WHO ARE MOTIVATED IN THE FIRST PLACE .
WELL .
WHO OR WHO ARE NOT JUST MOTIVATED WHO REALLY BELIEVE THAT THEIR THEY THEIR VOICE IS HEARD .
I MEAN AND THE PEOPLE THAT I HAVE TALKED TO .
WELL MAYBE THAT IS ANOTHER FACTOR THE MOTIVATIONAL FACTOR .
THE MOTIVATIONAL FACTOR IS PROBABLY .
RIGHT .
I THINK THAT IS THE BIGGEST ONE .
I .
THAT S THE BIGGEST PROBLEM .
I .
WELL THAT S DIMINISHED BY WWE HAVE NOTICED THIS IN PARTICULAR .
I I M JUST READ TWO BOOKS ONE OF THEM IS WHOSE STARS AND STRIPES NOW .
UHHUH .
THE UH TRIVIAL PURSUIT OF THE PRESIDENCY IN NINETEEN EIGHTYEIGHT .
OH REALLY .
IT S A FAIRLY DECENT BOOK .
I MEAN .
HUH .
IT .
S UH IT S PRECEDED BY UH SEVERAL OTHER BOOKS BY THESE GUYS .
UH WAKE ME UP WHEN IT S OVER WAS ABOUT THE EIGHTYFOUR ELECTIONS .
AND I FORGET WHAT .
THE OTHER BOOKS WERE .
BUT ANY CASE UH IIIT IS UH UH THE MAR UH UH TH TH THERE WAS UH BLUE SMOKE AND MIRRORS WAS THE ONE IN EIGHTYTWO .
UH THEY THESE GUYS UH HAVE TAKEN THE PLACE OF THEODORE WHITE ON REPORTING ELECTIONS .
IN ANY CASE THEY SAY THAT UH THERE S A DEFINITE TREND UH WELL YOU KNOW TOWARD CANDIDATES USING NEGATIVE VOTING .
IT IS THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU CAN USE TELEVISION EFFECTIVELY .
I DO NT UNDERSTAND THAT .
WHY DO UH IS THAT JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE SUCH A LOW OPINION OF THE PUBLIC .
AND THE PUBLIC S UH .
NO THE PUBLIC .
GULLIBILITY .
WOULD RATHER HEAR SOMETHING NEGATIVE ABOUT THE OTHER GUY TH UH THAN THAN A POSITIVE FACTOR .
AND Y AND YOU KNOW TO IF YOU IF YOU GO ON THE ATTACK I AND PUT SOME SENSATIONAL THING BEFORE THE PUBLIC AS MIKE DUKAKIS LEARNED IN THE LAST CAMPAIGN AND IT IS NOT REFUTED PEOPLE WILL YOU KNOW UH BELIEVE IT .
IF YOU DO NT REFUTE IT AS HE DID NT THERE MUST BE SOME TRUTH .
WELL HE DID REFUTE IT .
TO THE MATTER SEE .
HE HE REFUTED IT IT JUST WAS NOT EFFECTIVE ENOUGH TO .
WELL HE DID NT REFUTE IT TIL THE LAST TWO WEEKS OF THE CAMPAIGN .
HE DID NT BELIEVE ANYBODY WOULD BELIEVE THAT .
AND INDEED HIS TREND STARTED UPWARD .
WELL THAT SEE I I DID NT BELIEVE ANYBODY WOULD BELIEVE THAT EITHER .
I I I GUESS I .
WELL THEY DO .
HAVE A HARD TIME COMING TO TERMS WITH THE THE FACT THAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC REALLY WAS YOU KNOW SO .
WELL DO NT GIVE TOO MUCH CREDIT TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC FOR THEIR MOTIVATIONAL ABILITY .
AND AND AND IT .
WELL THEN HOW CAN A DEMOCRACY WORK THEN .
WELL IT UH WELL I DO NT KNOW .
HOW HOW CAN IT WORK .
IS IT WORKING .
I MEAN THAT S THAT S THE QUESTION .
I GUESS THE QUESTION ALSO IS THAT WE DISCOVERED IS THAT THEY DO NT THROW RASCALS OUT .
EVERYBODY SEEMS .
RIGHT .
DISAPPOINTED BUT THEY DO NT THROW THE RASCAL OUT THEIR OWN RASCAL .
RIGHT .
UH MY MY SOLUTION TO TO PART OF THIS IS IS TO TO MAKE IT .
AAAN AN ECONOMIC INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE .
THAT SOUNDS RATHER CRASS I THINK BECAUSE .
WHAT .
THEN THEN YOU ARE SAYING WELL UH YYYOU .
KNOW Y IN YY IT COULD BE C CONVOLUTED IN MANY WAYS WHERE PEOPLE WOULD ACTUALLY UH BY PAYING THEM I MEAN YOU KNOW YOU WOULD TAKE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OFF THEIR INCOME TAX OR PROPERTY TAX OR WHATEVER .
HUH .
BUT TH IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO ADMINISTER BECAUSE I AM SURE THAT ANY TIME MONEY AND VOTES ARE INVOLVED IT JUST THE WHOLE THING .
WELL .
JUST STINKS .
HOW ABOUT HOW ABOUT THE REVERSE OF THAT .
WHEN I HAVE HEARD ABOUT ENGLAND S ELECTIONS THEY ARE ALLOWED TO RUN FOR WHAT A TOTAL OF SIX OR EIGHT WEEKS .
EVEN FOR THE HIGHER OFFICES IN THE IN THE LAND .
WHAT IF WE TOTALLY TOOK MONEY OUT OF THE CAMP EH MA JUST SEVERELY LIMITED THE CAMPAIGNS SO MONEY WAS NT SO MUCH OF AN ISSUE .
I FEEL LIKE IF .
IF WE DID THAT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE A LOT HIGHER CONFIDENCE THAT THEIR VOTE WAS COUNTING RATHER THAN THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS WOULD COUNT .
YEAH BUT THE IDEA IS TO GET THE INDIVIDUAL TO THE POLLS AAAND WE HAVE TO MAKE IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO GET TO THE POLLS .
I DO NT I DO NT CARE HOW EASY .
IT IS FOR THEM I DO NOT THINK THEY ARE GOING TO BECAUSE THEY DO NO THINK THAT THEIR THAT ANYBODY LISTENS TO THEIR VOTE .
THEY THINK WHOEVER HAS THE B .
THEY REALLY THINK THAT THE PACKS YOU KNOW NO MATTER .
WHAT .
YOU RE PROMISED DURING A CAMPAIGN AND THESE DAYS WE ARE PROMISED HARDLY ANYTHING OF SUBSTANCE .
OH YOU MEAN THE SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS .
RIGHT .
AND EH AND EH Y NO MATTER .
WHAT .
A A CANDIDATE PROMISES DURING THE CAMPAIGN I WHICH IS NT VERY MUCH SPECIF ANY TH THEY DO NOT PROMISE ANYTHING .
SPECIFIC THESE DAYS .
BUT WHATEVER .
YOU ARE PROMISED THEY JUST THEY JUST REVERSE THEMSELVES DEPENDING ON WHO PAYS THEM .
WHAT ONCE THEY GET INTO OFFICE .
I MEAN I THINK THAT S THE .
WELL READ MY LIPS .
AND AND AND NO NEW TAXES AND YET BUSH DID THAT .
BUT I MEAN BUT .
YEAH .
YEAH .
BUT HE S EXCUSED FROM THAT .
GENERALLY PEOPLE I VE READ POLLS NOW WHERE THEY VE EXCUSED HIM BECAUSE THERE WAS A A DEFINITE NECESSITY TO BALANCE THE BUDGET .
WELL THEN WHY DID HE SAY THAT DURING HIS CAMPAIGN .
OH HE HE .
HE GAVE IT HE DID .
THEN HE IT WAS TOTALLY IRR .
HE DID HE PROMISED THE BEST .
HE COULD .
AND HE IS THE PRESIDENT AND HE SHOULD HE SHOULD ADDRESS THOSE PROBLEMS AND IF THERE NEEDS TO BE A CHANGE IN A PERIOD OF TIME .
WH WHAT WAS SO FUNNY ABOUT IT IS THAT I GUESS THAT IT HAPPENED SO RAPIDLY YOU KNOW .
HE KNEW IT .
HE ACTUALLY KNEW IT .
AND BEING .
YEAH .
YEAH .
YEAH .
ASSOCIATED WITH GOVERNMENT HE SHOULD BE HELD UP TO THE LIGHT FOR THAT .
AND MAYBE .
YEAH .
HE WILL .
YEAH .
WELL .
BUT I THINK IT IS ERRR I MEAN .
I THINK YOU YOU STILL HAVE A VIEW THAT THE AMERICAN VOTER IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER VOTERS .
AND HE IS MOTIVATED BECAUSE WE HAPPEN TO BE THE CRADLE OF LIBERTY AND ALL THAT .
I THINK VOTERS ARE MOTIVATED UH .
WHAT ABOUT WHAT ABOUT VOTERS IN THE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT .
LIKE IN THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WHERE THEY HAVE HIGHER TURNOUTS .
AND WELL THE NEWER DEMOCRACIES BECAUSE IT S GOING TO BE TOTALLY DIFFERENT BUT .
WELL I DO NT KNOW IF THEY HAVE HIGHER TURNOUTS .
YOU DO NOT THINK SO .
OVERALL .
I DO NT THINK ENGLAND HAS I THINK ENGLAND HAS ABOUT A SEVENTY PERCENT SIXTYFIVE PERCENT TURN OUT .
UHHUH .
I THINK THAT WE JUST DISCOVERED IN THIS IN IN THE INDIAN ELECTIONS IS TH ONE OF THE GREATEST .
OH .
GREATEST AND MASSIVE THINGS IN IN THE WORLD .
UH JUST IT WAS GOT VI MORE VIOLENT EVERY YEAR .
RIGHT .
THEY WENT DOWN ALMOST FIFTY PERCENT IN THIS ELECTION BEFORE THEY BLEW UP .
OH REALLY .
GHANDI .
BUT .
SIMPLY BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE SO .
YEAH .
CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR INABILITY THAT TO THAT THEIR VOTE DOES NOT COUNT ANY WAY .
HUH .
AND THE CORRUPTION OF POLITICS IN IN IN THAT SSSITUATION THERE .
BUT TH BUT YOU KNOW EVERYTHING IS RELATIVE TO WHEN UH EH WW YOU KNOW WE HAD HIGHER TURNOUTS BECAUSE AT THAT TIME .
WE .
CUR TALK ABOUT THE TURNOUT RELATIVE TO THE ELIGIBLE VOTER RIGHT .
YEAH .
I MEAN IS BUT BUT BEFORE THESE ENORMOUS BEFORE THIS VOTING RIGHTS ACT WHAT .
WE HAD WAS A A GREAT DEAL OF OUR POPULATION UH MAINLY THE BLACKS IN THE SOUTH AND THE .
UHHUH .
HISPANICS WERE PRECLUDED BY .
OH .
BY UH VOTING LAWS UH FROM REG FROM THEIR ELIGIBILITY TO REGISTER .
NOW EVERYBODY IS AVAILABLE .
OH .
SO IF YOU REALLY COMPUTED IT THEY PROBABLY WHEN WE SAID WE HAD A SEVENTY PERCENT TURNOUT IN NINETEEN FIFTY WE REALLY ONLY HAD A FIFTY PERCENT TURNOUT BECAUSE ALL THE ELIGIBLE .
OH I SEE BECAUSE RIGHT .
VOTERS .
WERE NT QUAL .
YOU KNOW THE IT WAS SKEWED .
DIS WERE DISQUALIFIED .
BY THE ELIGIBLE VOTERS BEING LESS THAN THE TOTAL POPULATION OF .
BUT IS NT THAT IS NT THAT KIND OF A BLANKET RACIST KIND OF THING TO SAY THE BLACKS AND HISPANICS AND OTHER MINORITIES JUST DO NT VOTE .
OR IS THAT JUST THE THE TRUTH .
NO I THINK THE HIGH THERE S A HIGHER PERCENTAGE IN IN CERTAIN BLACK AREAS OF VOTERS .
I DO NT KNOW ABOUT HISPANICS YOU KNOW .
I JUST .
YEAH .
I I MEAN I HAVE NT STUDIED THE STATISTICS WELL ENOUGH TO I MEAN I THINK IN THIS SORT OF .
WELL .
CONVERSATION .
WE CAN ONLY DO OUR OWN REACTION .
RIGHT RIGHT .
BUT YOU KNOW THAT JUST MADE ME THINK OF SOMETHING .
THAT HAPPENED DOWN HERE IN DALLAS LAST YEAR .
THEY HAVE THIS HUGE FIGHT GOING OVER REDISTRICTING HERE .
UHHUH .
AND AT ONE POINT .
THEY .
DI THEY TOOK ANOTHER VOTE ON IT AND THEY UH THE MINORITIES COULD NOT GET ENOUGH OF A VOTE OUT TO TO PASS THEIR PLAN .
AND THIS IS SOMETHING .
THAT HAD BEEN GOING ON FOR MONTHS .
IT WAS ON THE NEWS .
EVERY NIGHT .
THEY AND THEY HAVE HAD LAWSUITS OVER IT .
I MEAN IT WAS R IT WAS A MAJOR ISSUE AND THERE STILL WAS NT ENOUGH MINORITY VOTE TO GET TO PASS THE PLAN THAT THEY WERE BACKING .
SO THAT S Y YOU KNOW I THINK THAT YOU HAVE REALLY HIT ON SOMETHING THERE .
WA TO SAY THAT UH THOSE .
WHAT DO YOU MEAN .
WELL WITH THE MINORITIES AND WE ARE SAYING WE HAVE LOWER VOTER TURNOUT .
MAYBE IT IS IS UH NOW THAT WE HAVE MINORITIES INCLUDED IN THE .
YOU KNOW KAREN I WONDER IF WE ARE RECORDING .
WHY DID YOU NOT PRESS ONE .
I DID PRESS ONE BUT USUALLY BY THIS TIME .
THEY TELL ME THAT THE TIME IS UP .
ALL RIGHT .
ALL RIGHT .
WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR FAVORITE FOODS .
MINE WELL .
I IMAGINE IN ARGENTINA .
YOU VE GOT SOME GREAT FOODS .

THE HOMEBOYS ARE DOING .
UH .
I SEE SO YOU MAKE IT UH TO THAT LONGHORNS SOONERS GAME .
NO .
EVERY YEAR .
NO IT S FUNNY .
UH I GOT OUT AND GOT MY BACHELOR S DEGREE IN UH SEVENTYTHREE AND UH NEVER WENT TO A GAME THERE AND HAVE NEVER GONE TO A GAME SINCE .
HOW ABOUT THAT .
BUT I ALWAYS ENJOYED WATCHING THEM I JUST GROWING UP IN OKLAHOMA THERE IT WAS ALWAYS THE HOME TEAM KIND OF LIKE DALLAS IS AROUND HERE .
YEAH YEAH .
AND THERE S ALWAYS BEEN AN INTEREST THERE .
WELL IT S KIND OF SAME FOR ME I GREW UP IN SOUTHERN NEW JERSEY AND THE LOCAL TEAM WAS PHILADELPHIA .
YEAH .
AND THEY WERE LIKE THIRTY MILES RIGHT UP THE RIVER AND I M STILL PRETTY MUCH AN EAGLE FAN I GUESS .
I GUESS YOU KEEP THOSE THINGS YOU GREW UP WITH .
I WORKED IN UH MISSOURI FOR A WHILE AND UH I WAS PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE IN THE ROOM SEVERAL TIMES WHEN WE WERE WATCHING FOOTBALL ON T V WHEN THE COWBOYS WERE PLAYING THE SAINT LOUIS CARDINALS AND I WAS ROOTING FOR THE COWBOYS .
YEAH .
BUT THEY WERE KIND OF CLOSER TO HOME WHEN WHEN I STRUCK UP WITH THEM .
I REALLY DO NT KNOW WHAT S GOING TO TAKE PLACE WITH THE COWBOYS .
THIS YEAR .
EVERYBODY KEEPS TALKING ABOUT THE RECONSTRUCTION .
THEY RE GOING THROUGH AND NEW PLAYERS AND HOW NEXT YEAR IS GOING TO BE EVEN BIGGER AND BETTER THAN THE PREVIOUS YEAR .
IN A WAY .
THAT HAPPENED THIS PAST SEASON AND I THINK THAT S QUITE A BIT OF OPTIMISM AROUND HERE THAT STILL THERE S A CHANCE THAT MAYBE UH THESE GUYS ARE RIGHT MAYBE THEY WILL COME THROUGH AND AND DO SOMETHING THIS YEAR .
I LOOK FOR IT TO BE A PRETTY GOOD YEAR .
BOY .
THEY UH THEY SURE DID HAVE A BIG TURN AROUND FROM A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO .
THEY DID UH THEY GOT RID OF A LOT OF FAMILIAR NAMES AND GOT A LOT OF NAMES IN THAT WE WERE NT WERE NT FAMILIAR WITH .
SOME OF THEM TURNED OUT TO BE PRETTY GOOD PLAYERS UH SOME OF THEM DID NT AND YOU KNOW MAYBE THE STUFF THAT UH JERRY JONES IS TALKING ABOUT THE CONSTRUCTION AND REDEFINING THE TEAM AND MAYBE THE EFFORT MIGHT BE STARTING TO PAY OFF .
AT LEAST WE HOPE IT WILL .
YEAH I M I KEEP WAITING FOR THE EAGLES TO GET OVER THE HUMP .
THEY MAKE IT TO THE PLAYOFFS .
IT SEEMS FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS BUT THEY JUST HAVE DONE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WHEN THEY GOT THERE .
AND YOU KNOW THEY VE GOT A LOT OF THE TOOLS TO DO IT BUT DOGGONE IF THEY CA NT JUST PUT IT TOGETHER UH YOU KNOW THEY HAVE GOT THE QUARTERBACK THERE IN RANDAL CUNNINGHAM WHO S JUST YOU KNOW PHENOMENAL BUT HE HE S TOO STREAKY IT SEEMS .
YEAH BUT THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A REALLY STRONG TEAM .
YEAH YEAH AND WITHOUT A WHOLE LOT OF BIG NAME PLAYERS .
THEY HAVE GOT A FEW ANCHORS ON OFFENSE AND DEFENSE AND YOU KNOW THEY THEY VE MANAGED WITH THOSE GUYS AND I DO NT KNOW .
ONCE THE PRESSURE GETS TURNED ON THEY THEY SEEM TO LOOSE IT .
I GUESS YEAH .
SEE THAT S THE TYPICAL TRAIT OF THE DALLAS COWBOYS .
YEAH .
AND THE OKLAHOMA SOONERS .
IT S FUNNY OVER THE YEARS .
I GUESS SINCE STAUBACH LEFT THEY HAVE NT BEEN ABLE TO .
IT S .
KEEP IT GOING .
IT S BEEN A ROUGH TOW A ROUGH ROAD TO HOE EVER SINCE HE LEFT .
I DO NT KNOW WHY IT S SO HARD TO FIND UH A GOOD QUARTERBACK THESE DAYS .
WELL THAT THAT SAYS A LOT FOR THE FOR HIS ABILITY THOUGH I THINK .
WELL YEAH .
FOR STAUBACH S I MEAN .
YOU KNOW HE WAS ONE OF THE FEW .
WHO COME THROUGH IN HISTORY .
THAT CAN REALLY PERFORM UH WE HOPE EVERY TEAM HOPES THEIR CURRENT QUARTERBACK IS GOING TO PULL THEM THROUGH .
IN A WAY AIKMAN HAS DONE SOME OF THAT .
BUT UH THE GUY WINDS UP GETTING HURT EVERY OTHER GAME .
YEAH I I TELL YOU IT S DIFFICULT IN THAT GUY S POSITION COMING INTO THAT BECAUSE THERE HE WAS JUST SO HIGHLY TOUTED BY THE PRESS AND EVERYBODY EXPECTED SO MANY BIG THINGS YOU KNOW .
YEAH THEY DID .
THEY PUT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON HIM FROM THE OUTSIDE AND FROM THE INSIDE .
UH IT S FUNNY WATCHING THEM THEM PLAY HE S PROBABLY LIKE A LOT OF QUARTERBACKS UH WHEN THE PRESSURE IS REALLY ON WHEN IT S DOWN TO THE LAST FEW MINUTES OF THE GAME FOR THE SEASON IS WHEN THE GUYS SEEM TO REALLY DO THEIR BEST .
UHHUH .
AND I HAVE NT QUITE FIGURED THAT OUT IF THEY FIGURE THEY HAVE GOT IT WON OR IF THERE S NO REAL HURRY BECAUSE THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OR UH IF UH IF SOMETHING HAPPENS THAT THAT ADRENALIN STARTS FLOWING .
THEY SAY HEY WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING NOW .
AND THEN START PLAYING THE GAME .
THE WAY .
THE GAME SHOULD BE PLAYED TOWARD THE LAST FEW MINUTES .
YEAH .
SO I DO NT KNOW I M LOOKING FOR A GOOD YEAR .
I GUESS WE RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR A GOOD YEAR .
SO OBVIOUSLY THOUGH DO YOU THINK THEY RE GOING TO DO ANYTHING IN THE PLAYOFFS TO MAKE IT TO THE SUPER BOWL .
THIS YEAR OR WHO DO YOU WHO DO YOU LIKE TO DO THAT THIS YEAR .
UH NO I DO NT THINK THE COWBOYS HAVE GOT A CHANCE .
I THINK THEY WILL PROBABLY WIN ONE OR TWO MORE GAMES THAN THEY DID THIS YEAR AND THEY LL GET CLOSE TO IT .
THEY LL PROBABLY GET EVERYBODY .
S HOPES UP AND BLOW IT TOWARD THE END .
SO WHO S GOING TO BEAT THEM .
WHO ARE THEY GOING TO BLOW IT TO .

AND I DID PAY STATE TAX IN CALIFORNIA BUT MY GOODNESS THAT THAT THE WHAT DID YOU CALL IT THE SALES TAX IS JUST GETTING OUTRAGEOUS TO PAY .

YOU JUST YOU JUST MANAGED TO ESCAPE THE REAL TEXAN ACCENT .
YEAH .
I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU HAD COME FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE AND HAD SOME EXPERIENCE WITH TAXES THERE .
NO .
NO .
I VE JUST LIVED HERE .
YEAH .
BUT I DO NT KNOW I DO I CAN THINK OF ALL THE BIBLICAL THINGS ABOUT IT TOO .
WHERE WHAT DID THEY SAY TO UH I CA NT THINK OF THE SCRIPTURE .
RENDER UNTO CAESAR S .
WHAT IS CAESAR S .
THAT S RIGHT .
SO YOU KNOW EVEN EVEN IN THE STORY WHERE THEY HAD TO PAY THE TAXES THE DISCIPLES .
YEAH .
AND UH JESUS SAID THE MONEY IN THE FISH S MOUTH OR IN THE FISHER INSIDE THE FISH .
AND UH I THOUGHT OF THOSE TWO THINGS WHEN I WAS I WAS HOLDING FOR A LONG TIME .
OH WERE YOU REALLY .
YEAH .
TRYING TO FIND SOMEONE AT HOME .
YEAH .
WELL YOU KNOW UM BACK THEN WHAT .
THEY TRIED TO DO YOU KNOW THE MUMBLEX WOULD ALWAYS TRY TO STUMP JESUS TRY TO GIVE HIM .
SOMETHING .
THAT WOULD CONTRADICT HIMSELF .
RIGHT .
AND SO THAT S WHAT .
THEY WERE TRYING TO DO WITH THE TAX SITUATION .
AND OF COURSE THAT S WHEN HE SAID WELL YOU RENDER UNTO CAESAR S .
WHAT IS CAESAR S YOU RENDER UNTO GOD .
WHAT IS GOD S .
RIGHT .
AND UH YOU KNOW OF COURSE THERE I DO NT THINK THEY REALLY CARED ABOUT THE ANSWER .
RIGHT .
THEY JUST WANTED TO TRY AND CATCH HIM IN SOMETHING .
YEAH .
BUT BUT I BELIEVE IN PAYING TAXES AND I MEAN YEAH LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE I TRY TO TAKE AS MANY DEDUCTIONS AS I CAN .
OH SURE .
MUMBLEX YOU KNOW I DO NT WANT TO PAY MORE THAN I HAVE TO .
SURE .
AND I GET OUTRAGED WHEN I FEEL LIKE THEY GO UP FOR USELESS REASONS BUT I BELIEVE THAT THEY RE NECESSARY .
RIGHT .
SO I REALLY DO .
YEAH ARE .
DO YOU DO YOU DEAL WITH TAXES MUCH IN WHAT .
YOU DO WHEN YOU WORK OR .
NO NOT REALLY .
I VE I SPENDS A LOT OF TIME WITH OUR INCOME TAX THOUGH .
THIS ESPECIALLY THIS YEAR AND LAST YEAR .
UM I HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR JUST A FEW YEARS SO I VE HAD TO REALLY SWITCH AROUND FROM THE E Z FORM TO THE UH .
SCHEDULE .
A .
RIGHT .
WELL YEAH .
ALL THE DEDUCTIONS AND ALL THAT .
DID YOU NOTICE THAT WHEN THEY PASSED THE NEW SIMPLIFIED TAX ACT IT SEEMED LIKE IT MADE EVERYTHING HARDER .
YEAH .
IT REALLY DID .
I I SAW THAT TOO .
I DID NT NOTICE ANYTHING SIMPLIFIED ABOUT IT EXCEPT THAT THEY TOOK AWAY THE DEDUCTIONS .
RIGHT .
THE INTEREST AND .
RIGHT .
OTHER THINGS .
WE RE LOOKING AT BUYING A HOUSE .
YEAH .
AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE MAIN PLUSES THAT WE HAVE ABOUT BUYING A HOUSE .
AND IT WILL HELP TREMENDOUSLY .
YEAH .
WE BOUGHT OURS FIVE YEARS AGO AND IT S THE ONE THING IT SEEMS LIKE YOU MAKE THOSE PAYMENTS .
EVERY MONTH AND AT THE END OF THE YEAR .
YOU VE PAID ALL INTEREST AND NO PRINCIPLES .
RIGHT .
SO THAT WILL DEFINITELY HELP IN TAXES AND WHAT .
YOU WILL GET BACK .
YEAH .
THERE S A THING .
I JUST I VE BEEN TRYING TO LEARN AS MUCH AS I CAN ABOUT IT IF YOU PAY I KNOW I GET PAID TWICE A MONTH EVERY TWO WEEKS .
HUHUH .
THAT S ONCE A MONTH .
HUHUH .
WELL I GET TWENTY SIX PAYCHECKS .
THAT S RIGHT .
WHICH WOULD COME OUT TO BE IN THIRTEEN MONTHS .
SO IF YOU PAY YOUR RENT OR YOUR HOUSE PAYMENT .
EVERY TWO WEEKS .
HUHUH .
INSTEAD OF ONCE A MONTH YOU LL COME OUT PAYING A UH ONE MONTH EXTRA EVERY YEAR .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND IT WILL IF HAVE YOU .
A THIRTY YEAR NOTE IT WILL TAKE LIKE SEVEN OR PLUS YEARS OFF OF YOUR NOTE .
THAT S RIGHT .
MY PARENTS UH BOUGHT A HOME IN SAN DIEGO ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS AGO .
AND THEY DID THAT .
THEY THOUGHT THEIR PAYMENT WAS AUTOMATICALLY TAKEN OUT LIKE EVERY OTHER WEDNESDAY .
OH YEAH .
AND THAT S EXACTLY RIGHT .
EVERYONE THOUGH THE NOTE IS THIRTY YEARS SHE SAID IT S GOING BE PAID OFF IN TWENTY OR TWENTY ONE YEARS .
RIGHT .
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
YEAH .
JUST BECAUSE OF EXACTLY WHAT .
YOU SAID .
RIGHT .
YOU RE MAKING ONE MORE MONTHS PAYMENT .
EVERY YEAR .
AND THAT S GOING ON THE PRINCIPLE IT DOES NT PAY ANY INTEREST .
YEAH .
OR .
SO .
USUALLY IT DOES NT .
THAT S A GOOD WAY TO DO IT .
YEAH .
AND WHEN WE BOUGHT THIS HOUSE WE LOOKED AT DOING A FIFTEEN YEAR NOTE BECAUSE IT ADDED MORE TO THE PAYMENT .
HUHUH .
BUT NOT SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS YOU KNOW IT WAS A GOOD PAYOFF FOR BEING ABLE TO PAY IT OFF SOONER .
RIGHT .
THAT S WHAT .
WE RE LOOKING AT FIFTEEN OR MAYBE TWENTY .
YEAH .
WE RE NOT GOING TO GO LONGER THAN TWENTY .
YEAH .
BUT WE RE TAKING OUR TIME .
WE RE GOING TO TRY TO MAKE OUR DECISION BY JULY .

I I DO NT UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHY THEY DO NT HAVE THAT OPTION .
WE WE HAVE OUT HERE .
UHHUH .
UH UP UNTIL JUST THIS LAST YEAR IN ON YOU ARE TOWN THERE WAS NT ANY REALLY GOOD WAY THEY HAD SOME BENDS .
UHHUH .
AROUND THAT WE COULD FIND AND PUT THEM IN BUT NOT ALL THAT MANY IT WAS NT VERY WELL ADVERTISED .
UHHUH .
BUT RECENTLY UH THE REFUSE DEPARTMENT HAS HAS UH IS WORKING ON GETTING A SYSTEM GOING WHERE WE WILL ACTUALLY HAVE UH A BEND THAT WE PUT THINGS IN FOR RECYCLING THESE OTHER THINGS .
UHHUH .
SO IT IT SHOULD BE GOOD UH .
UHHUH .
I THINK IT S A MARVELOUS IDEA WHEN YOU THINK OF UH WHEN I JUST THINK OF THE PAPERS THAT I DUMP OUT .
UHHUH .
I MEAN THERE JUST IT S SUCH A .
I WASTE I JUST HATE TO THINK ABOUT IT .
YEAH NOW AN ADDITIONAL THING IS UH WHERE I WORK .
UHHUH .
THEY ALSO HAVE RECYCLING THERE OF UH ALL WHITE PAPER AND OF YOU KNOW CANS ALSO .
UHHUH .
SO I MEAN A LOT OF PEOPLE YOU KNOW RIGHT AT THE VENDING MACHINES .
UHHUH .

THAT YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
YOU CAN JUST POP YOUR CANS IN AND NEAR THE .
UHHUH .
XEROX MACHINES THEY HAVE PLACES YOU KNOW FOR YOUR .
UHHUH .
PAPER YOU KNOW I KEEP A LITTLE BOX AT MY DESK YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
AND I JUST THROW AS I M USING THE WHITE PAPER YOU KNOW I JUST THROW IT RIGHT IN THERE .
UH .
AND THEN YOU KNOW THEY HAVE SOMEONE .
THAT COMES AROUND AND PICK IT UP YOU KNOW EVERY AFTERNOON .
YEAH THAT S NEAT .
WHICH YOU KNOW IS AN EXCELLENT IDEA .
YEAH .
AT WORK BECAUSE I KNOW THE AMOUNT PAPER .
THEY GO THROUGH THERE BECAUSE .
YEAH THAT S RIGHT .
I GUESS ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IS WE NEED TO BE BETTER INFORMED ABOUT .
UHHUH .
ABOUT IT THERE S NEEDS TO BE MORE PUBLIC UH .
YEAH I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT .
SERVICE OF PROGRAMS OR SOMETHING .
THAT WOULD LET US KNOW HAD A HAPPENS TO IT .
UHHUH .
AND HELPS US TO BECOME ENTHUSED ABOUT IT BECAUSE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING .
UHHUH .
AND THERE S .
RIGHT .
I VE SEEN A FEW THINGS BUT NOT VERY MUCH .
UHHUH .
REALLY AND I I THINK THAT S A SHAME .
THEY NEED TO UH DO A LITTLE MORE I D LIKE TO KNOW FOR INSTANCE WHEN I WHEN THEY SAY UH PLASTIC ALL PLASTIC WHAT KIND OF PLASTIC .
EXACTLY .
CAN YOU PUT ALL TOGETHER OR .
UHHUH .
IS THERE .
SOME REASON NOT TO UH NOW MAYBE THEY JUST SORT IT AFTER THEY GET IT AND THROW OUT WHAT .
THEY CA NT USE I DO NT KNOW .
UHHUH .
BUT I I D BE GLAD TO ORGANIZE IT .
UHHUH .
IF THAT THEY D TELL ME .
WHAT .
IT IS I M DOING .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL .
UHHUH YEAH I AGREE WITH YOU THERE ANOTHER THING THAT I LIKE HERE WHICH IS I DO WITH I HAVE TO ACTUALLY GO TO TWO DIFFERENT RECYCLING AREAS BECAUSE ONE OF THEM IS THAT UH THEIR ALUMINUM CANS IS FOR UH CHILDREN S HOSPITAL FOR A BURN FUND .
UHHUH .
SO ALL THE MONIES ARE DONATED YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
FOR THE RECYCLING TO CHILDREN S HOSPITAL WHICH .
I THINK IS AN EXCELLENT IDEA .
UHHUH THAT S GREAT .
THERE YOU KNOW BECAUSE THE OTHER .
NOW THAT GIVES .
PUBLIC .
YOU .
A LITTLE BIT OF INCENTIVE THERE .
RIGHT RIGHT .
UHHUH .
AND BEFORE EVEN AT WORK BEFORE THEY STARTED THE RECYCLING PLAN WHICH AT WORK .
THEY VE ONLY BEEN DOING SINCE JANUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR I HAD HAD EVERYONE IN MY DEPARTMENT RECYCLING AND YOU KNOW I WOULD HAVE THEM DROP .
SAVING THEM FOR YOU UH .
RIGHT DROP THEIR CANS OFF IN MY OFFICE AND THEN I WOULD HAUL THEM YOU KNOW HERE TO THIS PLACE FOR THE CHILDREN S HOSPITAL FUND .
UHHUH .
WHICH GOT PEOPLE REALLY GOING INTO IT .
I THINK THAT S .
BUT .
RIGHT .
I THINK I THINK HELPING US BE MORE ENTHU ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT IT .
UHHUH .
HELPING US MAYBE MAYBE USING THE MONEY FOR SOMETHING SPECIAL THAT WOULD BE LIKE PAYING OFF THE NATIONAL DEBT .
UHHUH .
THAT THERE YOU GO .
MAKING SURE MUMBLEX .
THAT S FOR SURE .
BUT I I THINK THAT S RIGHT I THINK THEY THERE NEEDS TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE IN THE AREA OF OF UH AD ADVERTISEMENT .
UHHUH .
AND LETTING PUBLIC LETTING YOU UNDERSTAND .
UHHUH .
MORE OF WHAT .
IT IS YOU RE DOING WHY YOU RE DOING IT HOW YOU RE IT S DONE AND .
RIGHT RIGHT .
WHAT WHAT HAPPENS TO IT BECAUSE I THINK THAT S THAT WOULD HELP A LOT .
UHHUH AND I M SURE YOU KNOW IN THE NEAR FUTURE .
I WOULD THINK THEY WOULD BE COMING OUT WITH MORE .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW I VE SEEN A DEFINITE TREND YOU KNOW TOWARDS MORE RECYCLING .
YEAH I .
EVERYWHERE YOU KNOW EVEN AT MCDONALD S .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW WITH THEIR THEIR USE OF NO .
YES I I M GLAD .
FOAM CONTAINERS ANYMORE .
TO SEE SOME OF THESE THINGS I THINK .
RIGHT .
I THINK I THINK IT IS GETTING MORE YOU KNOW ADVERTISEMENT .
PEOPLE ARE BECOMING MORE CONSCIENCE .
ALL THE TIME THAT IT S NECESSARY TO DO .
RIGHT .
AND THAT WE NEED TO SOMEHOW GET AWAY FROM THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE EVERYTHING INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED .
UHHUH .
AND ALL THESE THINGS .
THAT .
RIGHT .
I THINK THAT S TRUE .
WELL I THINK I M THAT S ABOUT MY UH .
YEAH .
SOME ON RECYCLING BUT I I ENJOYED TALKING TO YOU .
OKAY WELL I DID TOO .
UHHUH ALL RIGHT BYE NOW .
OKAY .
BYEBYE .
ARE YOU IN THE MARKET FOR A CAR RECENTLY .
YEAH I JUST BOUGHT A CAR .
OH WHAT DID YOU GET .
I GOT A NINETEEN NINETYTHREE CAVALIER STATION WAGON .
UHHUH WHAT WHAT CONVINCED YOU TO GET THAT ONE .
WELL A FRIEND OF MY FATHER S AND HE D DRIVEN IT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY .
UHHUH .
AND IT RUNS GREAT .
OH INCREDIBLE HOW MANY MILES ON IT .
IT S LIKE IT HAS A HUNDRED AND FIFTYTHREE THOUSAND .
AND IT S STILL RUNNING REAL WELL .
YEAH .
OH GREAT YEAH WE HAVE UH RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TWO CARS UH I HAVE MY HUSBAND AND MYSELF AND WE HAVE TWO SONS WHO ARE DRIVERS .
UHHUH .
AND ONE OF WHICH IS A UM AN EIGHTYEIGHT PLYMOUTH VOYAGER VAN AND THEN WE HAVE UM ABOUT A YEAR AGO WE PICKED UP A SECOND HAND UH UH AUDI .
UHHUH .
AND UH THAT WAS A CA YOU KNOW A SEDAN AND UH WE GOT THAT MUMBLEX THE MAJOR THINGS THE REASON WHY WE GOT THAT IS WE HAD HAD A NOVA AND A WELL MY SON WAS DRIVING AND SOMEONE CAME INTO HIS LANE AND HIT HIM AND FORTUNATELY HE WAS ABLE TO HIS I MEAN HE WAS CHECKED OUT OF THE HOSPITAL WAS OUT OF THE HOSPITAL BY THAT NIGHT BUT THE CAR WAS COMPLETELY TOTALLED .
UHHUH .
AND MIKE AND THEY HAD BEEN MY TWO SONS HAD BEEN A PASSENGER IN A CAR ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF BEFORE THAT WHICH WAS HIT BY ANOTHER CAR .
UM .
SO I MEAN I GOT I WAS GETTING REALLY NERVOUS SO I FINALLY SAID WE I WANT A REALLY SOLID CAR SO WE FOUND THE AUDI SECOND HAND I GUESS RIGHT NOW MY CRITERIA FOR CARS IS UH OF BEING SOLID ABLE TO TAKE AN IMPACT .
RIGHT .
AND UH SO UH I WE RE NOT GOING TO BE IN THE MARKET FOR IN THE NEAR FUTURE FOR ANY NEW CAR .
UHHUH .
BUT THE THINGS THAT I WOULD WANT WOULD BE A SOLID CAR ANOTHER THING I D DEFINITELY WANT WOULD BE ANTILOCK BRAKES .
RIGHT .
UH OUR OUR VAN WHICH IS A A DELIGHT TO DRIVE DOES NOT HAVE I THINK THE BRAKES ON THE PLYMOUTH VAN IS JUST ARE TERRIBLE .
UM .
IF THE ROAD IS AT ALL WET AND I M AND I DO NT GO ALL THAT FAST BUT THE UH IT IT JUST DOES NT HOLD IT DOES NT HOLD WELL AT ALL SO I I DEFINITELY WANT TO GET ANTI LOCK BRAKES SO I DO NT KNOW DO YOU HAVE ANY PARTICULAR THINGS THAT THAT ARE PRIORITIES ON YOUR LIST .
WELL IT S I DID NT REALLY NEED POWER WINDOWS BUT IT HAS POWER YOU KNOW WINDOWS .
YEAH .
AND STEERING AND AIR CONDITIONING AND AND UH .
I GUESS DOWN HERE AIR CONDITIONING S A MUST IS NT IT .
UHHUH OH YEAH IT HAS A STEREO AND A CASSETTE PLAYER .
UHHUH .
AND UM HE S TOLD ME IT GETS FORTYTWO MILES TO THE GALLON .
THAT S INCREDIBLE .
UHHUH .
THAT IS INCREDIBLE .
SO .
UH WE WE GET ABOUT OUR THE VAN GETS ON HIGHWAYS CAN GET ABOUT TWENTYEIGHT THE AUDI DOES NOT HAVE GOOD MILEAGE THAT S THE ONE DRAWBACK IT S A POWERFUL CAR .
UHHUH .
UM BUT IT DOES NOT UH I MEAN I IF I M ON A HIGHWAY AND I CAN GET TWENTY TWENTYONE MILES PER GALLON I CONSIDER THAT LUCK I M LUCKY MAYBE MAYBE SOMETIMES I VE GOTTEN TWENTYTWO IT COMES OUT AROUND THE EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN LOCAL DRIVING .
UHHUH .
AND THAT S A TO ME IS A REAL DRAWBACK I WISH I WOULD YOU KNOW I COULD SETTLE FOR TWENTYEIGHT BUT UH THE UH THE FRILLS ON THAT CAR ARE NICE BUT THEY RE NOT NECESSARY FOR ME .
UHHUH .
EXCEPT AIR CONDITIONING IN THIS AREA UH IN WASHINGTON D C AREA IT GETS HOT AND HUMID .
UHHUH IT S REALLY HUMID .
YEAH UH SO AIR CONDITIONING IS DEF UH DEFINITELY A NECESSITY FOR US THROUGH TWO OR THREE MONTHS IN THE SUMMER UM BUT I UH I I DO NT NEED UH YOU KNOW POWER WINDOWS ARE NICE BUT I DO NT NEED THEM .
RIGHT .
ALTHOUGH I MUST SAY WHEN YOU RE DRIVING IN THE EAST AND THERE ARE ALL THESE TOLL ROADS COME INTO A TOLL ROAD YOU JUST PUSH THAT BUTTON DOWN IT S REAL NICE FOR THAT WINDOW TO ZIP DOWN AND ZIP UP INSTEAD OF HAVING TO CRANK IT .
CRANK YEAH .
YEAH BUT OR YOU KNOW IF YOU WANT TO HAVE OPEN WINDOWS TO BE ABLE TO OP IF YOU RE ALONE IN THE CAR .
RIGHT .
JUST TO PRESS BUTTONS AND .
YOU DO NT HAVE TO STRETCH .
BUT YOU KNOW I VE LIVED ALL THESE YEARS WITHOUT THEM I PROBABLY COULD HAVE LIVED A LITTLE LONGER .
THAT S TRUE .
UH ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE UH WE VE LIKED WHEN WE GOTTEN A NEW CAR AND THIS THIS USED CAR HAS IT IS A SUN ROOF .
UHHUH .
AND THOSE ARE REALLY NICE IN GOOD WEATHER .
THAT S RIGHT .
SO SO I GUESS IF WE GET A NEW CAR IT DEFINITELY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE AN ANTI LOCK BRAKES I D LOVE TO GET AN AIR BAG .
UHHUH .
AND A SUN ROOF AND UH JUST SO IT D BE A GOOD SOLID CAR I GUESS THAT THOSE ARE M MY MAJOR CRITERIA EVERYTHING ELSE IS YOU KNOW A LUXURY AND THEY .
MAKE THE CAR MORE EXPENSIVE BUT THEY OFTEN ADD MORE THINGS TO REPAIR WHEN THINGS GO WRONG .
RIGHT .
SO UH IF YOU WERE TO BUY A NEW CAR NOW A BRAND NEW CAR WHAT WOULD YOU LOOK FOR .
UM LIKE YOU SAID ANTILOCK BRAKES AND AIR BAG AND UH I D I D REALLY LIKE TO HAVE A CAR THAT S DEPENDABLE .
YEAH YEAH .
THAT THAT YOU DRIVE YOU KNOW LIKE A AMERICAN MADE CAR THAT S AS DEPENDABLE AS MERCEDES OR SOMEBODY YOU KNOW THAT S .
IS NT THAT TRUE IT S IT S FUNNY UM UH THAT YOU USE THE AUDI S GERMAN AND I HAVE TO SAY IT HAS BEEN PRETTY DEPENDABLE .
UHHUH .
YEAH SOMETIMES ONE ADVANTAGE OF AN AMERICAN MADE CAR IS IF YOU GET STUCK ANYWHERE MOST LOCAL GARAGES CAN FIX YOU UP .
YEAH THEY HAVE PARTS UHHUH .
BUT ONCE YOU GET IF YOU ONCE YOU GET SOMETHING FANCY YOU GET STUCK SOMEWHERE OFF OF THE MAIN AREA .
RIGHT .
YOU CAN BE REALLY AND THE PARTS I KNOW THE AUDI PARTS ARE TERRIBLY EXPENSIVE .
UHHUH .
I MEAN IT JUS I SHUDDER I WOULD NOT GET THE AUDI AGAIN JUST FOR THAT REASON BUT I WOULD LOVE I WISH AN AMERICAN AN AMERICAN THAT YOU KNOW ENGINEERING WOULD MAKE SOMETHING AS SOLID AS A GERMAN CAR YOU KNOW WE .
RIGHT .
CERTAINLY HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY BUT IT S AMAZING WHEN WE BOUGHT THIS AUDI I MEAN EVERYTHING IS MORE SOLID IN IT .
RIGHT .
UH IF YOU DO NT FEEL YOU VE GOT ANY OF THE FLABBY PLASTIC .
UHHUH .
AND I KNOW AND I I AND I M WILLING TO GIVE UP A LITTLE BIT IN THE MILEAGE FOR A SOLID CAR I DO NT THINK I HAVE TO GIVE UP AS MUCH AS I M GIVING UP .
RIGHT .
BUT DO YOU NEED AIR CONDITIONING DOWN THERE .
YES WE REALLY DO .
YEAH .
BECAUSE EVEN TODAY IT S SUPPOSED TO GET UP INTO THE NINETIES SO .
OH WE VE HAD ELEVEN DAYS IN A ROW OVER NINETY .
UHHUH .
THEY VE IN FACT HAD TO EXCUSE SCHOOL DOWN HERE BECAUSE OF THAT .
UM .
WELL LISTEN I ENJOYED TALKING WITH YOU .
IT WAS NICE TALKING TO YOU .
OKAY AND ENJOY ENJOY YOUR CAR .
YEAH HAVE A NICE SUMMER .
THANK YOU YOU TOO IT S GOING TO BE A HOT ONE .
YEAH .
OKAY BYEBYE .
BYEBYE .
WELL WHAT D DO YOU THINK IN TERMS OF UH BENEFITS .
WELL PERSONALLY YOU KNOW I THINK YOU KNOW OF COURSE .
I M SURE WE RE FAMILIAR WITH THE EXACT SAME BENEFIT PACKAGE AND I THINK THAT UH WE VE PROBABLY GOT ONE OF THE BEST AROUND YOU KNOW BESIDES THEY TEND TO OFFER AD ADEQUATE VACATION I GUESS .
AND THE PAID TIME OFF IS WONDERFUL AND UH ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT AS A MATTER OF FACT .
THIS WEEK AT WORK WAS THE CODA PLAN .
THAT IS OFFERED AND I THINK THAT IS JUST A A FABULOUS ONE SO .
I DO NT KNOW IF YOU PARTICIPATE IN THAT OR NOT BUT .
ABSOLUTELY .
IS NT IT GREAT .
IT S JUST A IT S JUST A MIRACLE THAT HOW FAST THAT ADDS UP YOU KNOW .
WELL I HAVE TO AGREE WITH THAT .
YOU KNOW I WAS THINKING ABOUT UH IMPORTANCE OF BENEFITS AND THAT KIND OF THING OTHER THAN SALARY .
UHHUH .
WHILE I WAS WAITING FOR UH THE SYSTEM TO FIND A A RESPONDENT .
UHHUH .
AND I STARTED THINKING THAT OVER THE YEARS THAT IMPORTANCE HAS CHANGED AND I SUSPECT THAT THAT S PROBABLY TRUE FOR EVERYONE .
YEAH .
WHEN I WAS MUCH YOUNGER IT WAS UH LESS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER RETIREMENT AND LESS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER MEDICAL BENEFITS .
BUT AS I GROW OLDER AND MY FAMILY GROWS IT THE MEDICAL BENEFITS ARE MORE IMPORTANT AND THE RETIREMENT IS MORE IMPORTANT .
I HAD NEVER REALLY THOUGHT OF IT THAT WAY BUT I GUESS THAT S TRUE I GUESS THAT S TRUE .
I M STILL YOUNG ENOUGH THAT THAT UH THE VACATION S REAL IMPORTANT TO ME AND THE PAID TIME OFF IS REAL IMPORTANT TO ME AND AND THAT KIND OF THING .
BUT UH YOU KNOW I WAS JUST AS A MATTER OF FACT I JUST UH CELEBRATED MY FIFTH YEAR AT T I .
THE END OF LAST MONTH AND UH KIND OF STARTED LOOKING THROUGH THE THE BOOK BECAUSE OF THAT YOU KNOW NOW THAT I M A HUNDRED PERCENT VESTED YOU KNOW YOU .
KIND OF LOOK THROUGH THE BOOK AND SEE WELL WHAT EXACTLY WHAT DOES THAT MEAN AND WHAT IS THE PENSION .
ALL ABOUT AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU RE WHEN YOU RE YOU KNOW IN YOUR I M ONLY IN MY LATE TWENTIES NOW SO YOU TEND NOT TO THINK ABOUT RETIREMENT .
BUT UH IT S I GUESS NOW IS THE TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT SO .
DOES T I HAVE A PRETTY GOOD RETIREMENT PACKAGE DO YOU THINK .
I THINK THEY HAVE UH A ONE THAT WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE RE GOING TO HAVE TO SUPPLEMENT OURSELVES .
YEAH .
AND THAT S CERTAINLY ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I M SURE THAT THEY VE BEGUN THE UH CODA PLAN .
UHHUH .
IT .
S .
UHHUH .
CERTAINLY A A SUPPLEMENTAL WAY UH AND I SUPPOSE IF B MAYBE IN IN YOUR INSTANCE IF IF YOU RE STARTED WITH T I IN YOUR EARLY TO MIDTWENTIES AND HAPPEN TO STAY WITH THEM UNTIL YOU RE SIXTYFIVE THEN YOU LL HAVE A VERY GOOD RETIREMENT PLAN .
RIGHT .
BUT I HAD ANOTHER CAREER FIRST AND THEN CAME TO T I .
A LITTLE LATER .
UHHUH .
SO IT S NOT UH ALL BY ITSELF .
IT WO NT BE ADEQUATE FOR .
IT S NOT GOING TO BUILD UP .
FOR MY SITUATION .
QUITE ENOUGH YEAH .
SO I HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO SUPPLEMENT THAT .
YEAH .
WELL THEY JUST THEY SEEM TO MAKE IT SO EASY TO SAVE .
YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE RE DOING WHICH IS PROBABLY THE WORST INVESTMENT IN THE WORLD BUT I VE GOT MONEY COMING OUT MUMBLEX TO BUY SAVINGS BONDS JUST COMING STRAIGHT OUT OF MY CHECK .
AND IT S PROBABLY NOT A GREAT INVESTMENT BUT IF I WAS NT DOING THAT THE MONEY WOULD NT BE BEING SAVED ANYWAY YOU KNOW .
I .
KIND OF HAVE TO TRADE OFF YOU KNOW .
IF YOU NEVER SEE IT .
YOU DO NT SPEND IT SO .
AND IT S .
I UNDERS UNDERSTAND THOUGH IT .
YEAH .
UH BELIEVE ME I DO THAT .
MYSELF .
DO YOU .
YEAH .
AND I DISAGREE WITH YOU .
I DO NT THINK IT S THE WORST INVESTMENT .
DO YOU REALLY NOT .
IN THE WORLD .
I I FR YOU KNOW I I DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER IT S REALLY GOOD OR NOT YOU KNOW .
WELL IT S IN TERMS OF GUARANTEED RETURN ON INVESTMENT AND MAYBE YOU DO NT START LOOKING FOR THAT WORD GUARANTEED .
YEAH .
UNTIL LATER .
YEAH .
UH IT S SHOWN A HISTORY THAT UH SURE BEATS ANYTHING ELSE .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
THAT S VERY TRUE .
OVER MANY MANY YEARS .
WE WENT UH AND DID A A THING THROUGH I B S .
WHICH IS A LIKE A FINANCIAL CONSULTANT TYPE THING HERE IN DALLAS AND UH ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT WITH THE COUNSELOR THERE WAS YOU KNOW THEY WORK UP THIS WHOLE BIG YOU KNOW PROPOSAL PROFILE FOR YOU THAT EV ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO WORK ON AND YOU NEED TO DO .
AND THEN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT WITH HER WAS YOU KNOW THE NEED TO SAVE FOR OUR SON S EDUCATION .
WE HAVE A TWO YEAR OLD YOU KNOW AND AND YOU KNOW WE CA NT START SAVING FOR COLLEGE WHEN HE S SIXTEEN YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO DO THAT NOW .
AND AND UH THEY HAVE A WAY THAT THEY CAN FIGURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW AND HE S TWO NOW IN SIXTEEN YEARS WHEN HE S READY TO GO TO COLLEGE THIS IS HOW MUCH .
IT LL COST YOU KNOW AND IT S JUST REALLY SCARY THE THOUGHT OF HOW MUCH .
IT S GOING TO IT S WHAT .
IT COSTS NOW IS RIDICULOUS WHAT .
IT S GOING TO COST SIXTEEN YEARS FROM NOW IS JUST REALLY SCARY .
AND THEY SAT DOWN AND FIGURED UP THAT WE NEEDED TO SAVE LIKE BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND SEVENTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS .
A YEAR AT A OH YOU KNOW SIX PERCENT INTEREST RATE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE YOU KNOW MONEY FOR HIS COLLEGE .
AND THAT S EXACTLY WHAT .
WE HAVE COMING OUT IN SAVING BONDS IS IS YOU KNOW ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS .
A YEAR .
SO I GUESS IT YOU KNOW IN THAT WAY AT LEAST WE KNOW THAT THAT S TAKEN CARE OF YOU KNOW .
WE WE CAN WORRY ABOUT OTHER THINGS SO .
I UNDERSTAND .
YEAH .
THAT APPROACH .
THAT S .
YEAH .
WHAT THAT S EXACTLY WHAT S HAPPENING IN MY FAMILY .
IS IT REALLY .
YEAH .
UN EXCEPT THAT MINE ARE A LITTLE BIT OLDER AND AND I VE SHOWN THEM .
THE NUMBERS AND SAID THIS IS WHAT S GOING TO BE AVAILABLE ALL THIS IS GOING TO DO IS GIVE YOU .
A LITTLE SPENDING MONEY WHILE YOU RE THERE .
UHHUH .
YOU BETTER MAKE SURE THAT YOU VE GOT A SCHOLARSHIP .
THAT S RIGHT .
THAT S RIGHT .
WELL THAT S WHAT .
SHE SAID TO US .
SHE SAID NOW DO YOU .
ALL WANT HIM TO GO TO A A STATE COLLEGE OR A PRIVATE COLLEGE .
AND AND OUR ANSWER WAS THAT YOU KNOW WE WILL HAVE ENOUGH MONEY AVAILABLE FOR HIM TO ATTEND A STATE COLLEGE .
AND IF HE WANTS TO GO TO A PRIVATE COLLEGE HE CAN GET A SCHOLARSHIP TO ATTEND YOU KNOW .
AND THAT WAS KIND OF OUR VIEW ON IT .
IT JUST COSTS TOO MUCH YOU JUST CA NT DO IT YOU KNOW .
SO I DO NT KNOW IT S IT S I DO NT UH IT JUST AMAZING IT AMAZES ME HOW MUCH THE THE COSTS ARE GOING TO GO UP OVER THE NEXT TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS .
I JUST DO NT KNOW HOW ANYBODY S GOING TO DO IT .
I KNOW .
AND BOY IT GETS REALLY SCARY WHEN YOU START TALKING TO THEM .
UH I HAVE A AN ELEVEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER NOW WHO S SAYING GEE DAD I WANT TO BE AN ALLERGIST .
OH GOODNESS .
AND I SAID THAT S WONDERFUL .
I APPLAUD THAT .
LET .
YEAH .
ME EXPLAIN TO YOU HOW YOU GET SCHOLARSHIPS TO DO THAT .
YEAH .
EXACTLY .
AND .
EXACTLY .
THEN HER LITTLE BROTHER S ONLY TWO YEARS BEHIND AND HE SAYS WELL I DO NT KNOW I THINK THAT I PROBABLY WANT TO BE A VETERINARIAN .
AND I SAID THAT S GREAT .
LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU HOW YOU GET SCHOLARSHIPS .
THAT S RIGHT .
TO DO THAT .
THAT S RIGHT .
WELL YOU KNOW T I YOU KNOW T I OFFERS SOME GOOD STUFF AND THEN I THINK THERE S I MEAN I THINK THERE S SOME NEGATIVES BUT THERE S GOING TO BE SOME NEGATIVES ANYWHERE YOU KNOW NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO .
I HAVE YOU KNOW ALL THIS IS THE FIRST REALLY LARGE COMPANY .
I VE WORKED FOR .
I VE ALWAYS BEEN INVOLVED IN LITTLE SMALL YOU KNOW IND PRIVATELY OWNED S OWNED FIRMS AND SO I VE NEVER HAD THE THE BIG BENEFIT PACKAGE .
SO I REALLY DO NT KNOW HOW TO COMPARE IT TO OTHER BIG COMPANIES YOU KNOW .
IT WHEN I CAME ON IT WAS GREAT BECAUSE I HAD NEVER HAD ANYTHING EVEN CLOSE TO WHAT WHAT .
THEY OFFERED .
SO I VE BEEN REAL PLEASED .
WELL THAT S FANTASTIC .
YEAH .
AND ON WHOLE O I WOULD SAY THAT THEY RE EQUAL TO UH MOST OF OUR COMPETITORS .
THINK SO .
UH I CAN SEE SOME SOME POTENTIAL CHANGES .
THAT PROBABLY ARE ARE WOULD NOT COST VERY MUCH BUT MIGHT UH MAKE THINGS .
A LITTLE EASIER .
UHHUH .
SUCH AS OFFERING A A SMORGASBORD .
HAVING A LARGER VARIETY OF BENEFITS BUT .
YEAH .
BUT HERE S THE AMOUNT THAT THAT T I IS GOING TO PAY FOR IT .
YEAH AND YOU CAN PICK WHAT .
YOU WANT AND YEAH .
NOW IT S UP TO YOU .
IT .
S MENU SELECTION SO .
RIGHT .
TO SPEAK .
THAT SOUNDS REALLY GOOD .
I READ A THING I DO NT EVEN REMEMBER IF IT WAS IN THE DALLASITE OR THE INSITE ONE ABOUT UH COMPANIES ALLOWING YOU AND THEY SAID THAT T I WAS LOOKING INTO IT TO PURCHASE EXTRA VACATION DAYS .
WHICH .
I THOUGHT SOUNDED LIKE A GOOD IDEA .
YOU KNOW IF YOU VE BEEN THERE YOU KNOW UNDER FIVE YEARS AND YOU GET TWO WEEKS OF VACATION BUT THAT S REALLY NOT ENOUGH AND YOU WANT AN EXTRA WEEK THEN YOU CAN PURCHASE AN EXTRA WEEK OF VACATION BY SAYING OKAY I M GOING TO WANT AN EXTRA FIVE DAYS .
THIS YEAR AND THEY LL TAKE A SET AMOUNT OUT OF EACH PAYCHECK YOU KNOW AND THEY RE DEDUCTING IT .
ALL ALONG SO YOU YOU CAN HAVE AN EXTRA FIVE DAYS OFF AND BE PAID FOR THEM AT THE TIME YOU KNOW YOU RE REALLY NOT BEING PAID FOR THEM THE MONEY IS ACTUALLY COMING OUT OF YOUR OWN POCKET BUT IT S COMING OUT A LITTLE BIT AT A TIME INSTEAD OF ALL AT ONCE YOU KNOW .
SO THAT IS KIND OF AN IDEA THAT THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE SOUNDED LIKE THAT THEY WERE REALLY INTERESTED IN AND T I SAID THAT THEY WERE LOOKING INTO SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO .
WELL I COULD CERTAINLY PERSONALLY STAND SEEING THEM GO TO A A STANDARDIZED COMPENSATORY TIME .
UHHUH .
FOR OVERTIME .
UHHUH .
AND I DO NT BELIEVE ANY OF US WOULD HAVE TO PURCHASE ANY EXTRA VACATION DAYS .
WELL .
IF THEY DID .
TRUE .
THAT .
TRUE .
UH AND AND I WOULD CERTAINLY SUPPORT SOMETHING LIKE FOUR TO ONE OR FIVE TO ONE OR OR YOU KNOW MAYBE THEY WANT TO GET GENEROUS AND MAKE IT .
THREE TO ONE .
UHHUH .
UH A AS A REPAYMENT FOR .
YEAH .
EVERY THREE TO FIVE DAYS THAT I WORK OVERTIME THERE .
YEAH .
THEY SHOULD GIVE ME .
ONE DAY .
YEAH .
BUT IT SHOULD BE A STANDARD AND AND NOT LEFT UP TO EITHER .
THE WHIM OR THE CURRENT OVERHEAD RATE T UH THAT S RUNNING IN EACH DEPARTMENT .
UHHUH .
WELL AND YEAH AND AND A LOT OF THAT IS LEFT UP TO WHOEVER .
YOUR SUPERVISOR HAPPENS TO BE AND WHAT TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP .
YOU HAVE WITH THAT PERSON AND YOU KNOW I SEE A LOT OF DIFFERENCES BUT FROM ONE GROUP TO THE NEXT YOU KNOW ABOUT WHO GETS IT AND WHO DOES NT GET IT YOU KNOW .
BUT THAT S AND THAT S THAT WAY WITH A LOT OF THINGS YOU KNOW THERE .
IT SEEMS LIKE IT DEPENDS ON WHAT WHAT GROUP .
YOU HAPPEN TO BE IN WHAT WHAT .
YOU RE GOING TO GET AND WHAT .
YOU RE NOT GOING TO GET SO .
WELL THAT S FOR SURE .
WHICH IS THE SAME BUT BUT THEN IT S PROBABLY THAT WAY ANYWHERE YOU KNOW THAT S .
OH I M SURE PERSONALITIES ALWAYS COME INTO PLAY .
UHHUH .
UH JUST IN THIS SIZE OF ORGANIZATION .
UH BEING A FORMER DRUG USER .
WHOA .
I UH I I GUESS I HAVE TO SAY AT THIS POINT THAT I DO APPROVE OF IT .
UHHUH .
UH BECAUSE I KNOW THAT UH IN USING DRUGS I WAS NOT A GOOD EMPLOYEE .
UHHUH .
AND SO I CAN SEE FROM THE COMPANY S STANDPOINT THAT THERE UH WHENEVER YOU ARE AN EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY YOU ARE USING IT .
S ASSETS AND UH B YOU ARE ALSO UNDER THEIR LIABILITY UNDER THE WORKMEN S COMP .
UHHUH .
UH ON MY JOB .
WE HAD A LOT OF WORKMEN S COMP CASES AND .
WHERE DO YOU WORK .
I WORK FOR A TIRE COMPANY .
OH .
MODERN TIRE .
AND UH IT S ALSO A RETREADING PLANT AND THAT S WHERE MOST OF OUR UH INJURIES OCCUR .
UHHUH .
AND WHAT .
WE DO IS WE LL HAVE A DRUG TEST IF AN IF A A BREAK OR A MAN UH HAS AN ACCIDENT .
THEN HE S AUTOMATICALLY UH GIVEN A DRUG TEST .
RIGHT .
DO THEY DO IT LIKE YOU KNOW WITHIN HOURS OF THE ACCIDENT OR IS IT .
YES WHEN HE GOES TO THE DOCTOR .
THE FIRST TIME .
YEAH .
AND SO THAT KIND OF UH I DO NT KNOW IF IT S BEEN A DETERRENT OR NOT BECAUSE WE HAVE UH JUST STARTED USING IT .
UHHUH .
OH FOR THE PAST YEAR OR SO .
YEAH .
NOW WE VE LET SOME PEOPLE GO UH THAT WA WE WAS FOUND THAT DRUGS WERE USED IN THEIR SYSTEM .
NOW I DO NT KNOW HOW T E C WOULD HANDLE IT .
THEY HAVE NT PURSUED IT YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
UH IF THERE S SOME UH PROBLEM .
I KNOW THERE WAS ONE .
GUY THAT WE TESTED FOR PREEMPLOYMENT FOR DRUGS .
WHO ABSOLUTELY SWORE UP AND DOWN THAT IT SHOWED THAT HE WAS USING AMPHETAMINES AND HE WENT TO A A SEPARATE DRUG .
YEAH .
TESTING FIRM AND THEY SHOWED IT NEGATIVE .
HUH .
SO I THINK THE TESTS THEMSELVES ARE NOT REALLY THAT .
YEAH .
CUT AND DRIED YOU KNOW .
YEAH I THINK THAT S PROBABLY TRUE TOO .
THAT S THAT S THAT S SORT OF SCARY .
UHHUH REALLY .
AND THEN I ALSO HAD A FRIEND .
WHO WAS JUST AROUND SOME PEOPLE .
THAT WERE SMOKING COCAINE .
YEAH .
AND HE TESTED POSITIVE ON COCAINE .
NOW THEN YOU ALWAYS WONDER WELL IS HE JUST SAYING THAT .
YEAH YEAH REALLY REALLY .
YEAH .
YEAH THAT S THAT S A BAD SITUATION .
I THINK THAT PROBABLY I THINK MOST COMPANIES NOW AS FAR AS ENTRY .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW EXAMS REQUIRE THAT .
YEAH .
I THINK THEY SHOULD .
UHHUH .
I M A T I .
EMPLOYEE AND .
UHHUH .
AND AND UH I M I M REALLY GUNG HO FOR IT .

FACILITY BUT IT S A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW SEPARATED .
WE LEASE THE BUILDING .
AND IT S IT S A FACTORY ENVIRONMENT .
UHHUH .
AND UH THEY THEY HAVE DESIGNATED SMOKING BUT IT S JUST WIDE OPEN IT S NOT VENTILATED PROPERLY .
YEAH .
AND I THINK THAT S BAD .
BUT AS FAR AS THE DRUGS YOU KNOW BEING IN THE FACTORY KIND OF ENVIRONMENT .
THAT WAY .
UHHUH UHHUH .
I THINK IT S A IT S A DEFINITE I THINK IT S ESSENTIAL .
YEAH BECAUSE YOU RE ENDANGERING EVERYBODY .
S LIVES IF YOU .
YEAH .
IF IT S SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
IN FACT .
WE VE HAD THE POLICY ON JUST THE RANDOM TESTING NOW .
UHHUH .
FOR A COUPLE YEARS AND UH I I WAS GIVING MY BOSS .
A HARD TIME BECAUSE I KEPT WAITING FOR MY NAME TO CAME COME UP YOU KNOW .
THEY NEVER THEY NEVER CALLED ME THEY NEVER YOU KNOW AND FINALLY THE DAY .

AND SO AND AND MY BOSS HAS HAS GONE FOR ABOUT LIKE THREE TIMES I THINK .
AND I TOLD HIM .
HE S OBVIOUSLY IN A HIGH RISK GROUP .
THE EXECUTIVES RIGHT .

YOU KNOW THAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO ALL .
THEM FIRST .
THE EXECUTIVES .
UHHUH .

DOWNWARD SPIRAL .
UHHUH .
AND I WAS LOSING JOBS JUST FROM DOING A POOR JOB YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
YEAH THAT S THAT S IT .
I MEAN YOU KNOW THERE S ALL KINDS OF DRAWBACKS MUCH LESS THE DRUG TESTING .
YEAH .
JUST LIFE IN GENERAL .
UHHUH THAT S RIGHT .
YEAH WELL WELL I M DEFINITELY FOR IT .
YEAH .
PLUS YOU KNOW YOU YOU WANT TO THINK THAT THAT YOU RE WORKING WITH PEOPLE .
WHO ARE NOT ONLY PUTTING OUT THEIR FAIR SHARE .

YEAH IT S EASY TO IT S EASY I GUESS IT S STILL EASY TO FIND ENGINES FOR THOSE CARS ENGINES AND TRANSMISSIONS AND IF YOU I GUESS IF YOU KEEP TRAD CHANGING THEM OUT YOU CAN KEEP A CAR FOR A LONG TIME .
COURSE I GUESS I COULD DO THE SAME THING WITH THE THE TOYOTA THAT I HAVE I JUST DO NT KNOW HOW MUCH THEY LL WANT TO CHARGE ME TO .
IT ALMOST COSTS SO MUCH TO FIX ANYTHING OR DO ANYTHING WITH IT YOU RE JUST BETTER OFF BUYING ANOTHER CAR .
YEAH I GUESS SO BUT I JUST THINK THEY COST TOO MUCH IN THE IN THE FIRST PLACE NOW A DAYS .
OKAY WE RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM .
OKAY .
WHAT S WRONG WITH IT AN OR IF ANYTHING IS WRONG WITH IT AND WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT WHAT SHOULD BE DONE ABOUT IT .
FANTASTIC WELL ONE THING THAT POPS INTO MY MIND REAL QUICK IS UH ABOUT THE UH FUNDING OF THE THE SCHOOL SYSTEM RIGHT NOW .
YEAH .
EVIDENTLY UH THAT S THAT S A BIG PROBLEM .
YEAH IT S AMAZING UH I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT TEACHERS NEVER GOT PAID NEARLY ENOUGH I MEAN .
RIGHT .
TO BE DOING WHAT THEY RE DOING UH WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE I I ENJOYED TEACHING CAUSE I DID SOME TEACHING PARTTIME AND I REALLY ENJOYED THAT BUT I WOULD NT WANT TO GO TEACH HIGH SCHOOL OR JUNIOR HIGH IT JUST YOU KNOW ALL THE PROBLEMS .
OH LORD I MEAN YEAH AN YOU TALK ABOUT STRESS AND PRESSURE I TELL YOU WHAT IT S UH .
YEAH THEY RE PUTTING IN FIFTY SIXTY HOURS A WEEK I M SURE BECAUSE THEY VE GOT TO GRADE PAPERS AND GET CLASS STUFF READY .
DO RIGHT .
AND YOU KNOW AND THEY RE BEING PAID PROBABLY HALF WHAT MOST PEOPLE BEING PAID .
EXACTLY AND .
AND WE RE PAYING BASKETBALL PEOPLE YOU KNOW MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR FOR FOR WHAT YOU KNOW .
THAT S RIGHT AND THEN THEY UH POOF IT OFF YOU KNOW DO LIKE TARPLEY .
YEAH .
BUT UH I MUMBLEX WHAT GETS ME IS I CA NT BELIEVE THAT CONGRESS UH OR OUR STATE LEGISLATURE CA NT COME UP WITH UH SOME KIND OF WORKABLE MEANS TO HAVE FUNDS FOR THE SCHOOL YOU KNOW IT S UH I JUST DO NT UNDERSTAND THAT .
YEAH IT S UH NOW DO YOU HAVE LITTLE KIDS OR WHAT .
NO UH SURE DO NT MY WIFE AND I VE JUST BEEN MARRIED ABOUT TWO YEARS BUT I HAVE A SISTER THAT S A UH SCHOOL TEACHER AND UH .
YEAH YEAH MY WIFE AND I HAVE A A THREE YEAR OLD ALMOST FOUR AND A A TWO YEAR OLD .
OKAY .
SO WE RE LOOKING AT THE THE OLDER ONE GOING TO SCHOOL NEXT YEAR NOT NOT WELL NOT THIS COMING FALL BUT THE YEAR AFTER THAT .
OKAY SO IT S GETTING CLOSE .
YEAH HE S GOING TO BE GOING TO KINDERGARTEN SO .
RIGHT .
SO YOU KNOW WE RE WE RE THINKING ABOUT THAT WHAT S THAT GOING TO BE LIKE ARE THEY GOING TO BE TAUGHT NOTHING OR THEY GOING BE TAUGHT SOMETHING WE RE GOING TO WE RE GOING TO BE INVOLVED IN OUR CHILD S EDUCATION WE RE GOING TO BE TEACHING HIM WHAT WE CAN AT HOME OF COURSE .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE UH I GUESS WE DO NT TRUST THE SCHOOL SYSTEM WHICH IS VERY SAD UH BUT .
EXACTLY .
BUT IF IT DOES NT START AT HOME IT S NOT GOING TO GO ANYWHERE .
RIGHT THAT S TRUE .
YOU KNOW AND WE RE GOING TO TRY TO TEACH HIM GOOD VALUES BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE WHEN WHEN THEY GET TO UPPER LEVEL SCHOOL AND THEY START TEACHING THEM WELL HEY IF YOU CAN PLAY FOOTBALL OR BASKETBALL THAT S WHAT S IMPORTANT NOT IF YOU CAN READ OR WRITE OR DO OR UN UNDERSTAND SOME SCIENCE .
EXACTLY .
YOU KNOW I MEAN GIVE ME A BREAK THAT S THAT S THAT S BOGUS .
RIGHT RIGHT WELL AND UH YOU KNOW ONE THING MY WIFE AND I VE TALKED ABOUT I ARE UH PRIVATE SCHOOLS .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW WHETHER UH UH WE WOULD WANT TO INVEST IN IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS AS THEY RE G GROWING UP BECAUSE YOU KNOW JUST IN THE DALLAS AREA UM WE RE NOT REAL COMFORTABLE WITH THE WITH THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS .
AND DALLAS UH SCHOOL DISTRICT JUST RECENTLY GOT AN ADVISED STATUS BECAUSE OF THEIR LOW QUALITY SCHOOLING .
RIGHT .
I COULD NT BELIEVE THAT .
RIGHT YOU KNOW ONE THAT S ONE REASON WE BOUGHT A HOUSE HERE IN PLANO WE WERE HOPING YOU KNOW WELL THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS GOING TO BE GOOD YOU KNOW FOR RESALE VALUE AND .
YEAH .
SO ON AND SO FORTH BUT UH I CAN DEFINITELY UH SEE ON DOWN THE ROAD YOU KNOW WHERE WE DO HAVE KIDS AND ARE GETTING TO THAT AGE THAT S GOING TO BE A DEFINITE CONCERN .
YEAH WE TALKED YOU TALKED ABOUT BEFORE ABOUT THE SCHOOL FUNDING I THINK THERE S ONLY GOING TO BE ONE SOLUTION TO SCHOOL FUNDING WHICH I DO NT THINK WILL BE NECESSARILY THE BEST WAY BUT I THINK WHAT S GOING TO HAVE TO HAPPEN IS THERE S GOING TO HAVE TO BE TUITION FOR GRADE SCHOOL AND JUNIOR HIGH AND HIGH SCHOOL KIDS THAT S THE ONLY WAY THEY RE GOING TO FUND IT BECAUSE IF THEY START RAISING TAXES FOR PROPERTY AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO THROW A FIT .
THAT S YEAH AND YOU KNOW THAT S TAXES RIGHT NOW ARE POLITICAL SUICIDE .
OH YEAH .
YOU KNOW AND I DO NT THINK ANY POLITICIAN S GOING TO DO THAT SO .
YEAH AND THE ONLY THING THEY THEY WOULD THINK OF WOULD BE TUITION YOU KNOW IF IT WORKS AT COLLEGES IT WILL WORK DOWN BELOW .
RIGHT .
AND YOU KNOW THAT S GOING TO THAT S GOING TO AFFECT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE HAVING KIDS IN SCHOOL OF COURSE WHICH IS PROBABLY THE ONLY FAIR THING TO DO BUT IT WILL BE HARD FOR THOSE THAT PEOPLE THAT HAVE HAVE IN SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO PAY OUT EVEN MORE .
EXACTLY AND YOU KNOW IT S GOING TO REALLY HURT THE THE MIDDLE CLASS UH PEOPLE I THINK .
OH YEAH .
BECAUSE UH THEY RE THE ONES THAT WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO TO CARRY THE BRUNT OF THE LOAD .
THAT S RIGHT .
SO UH .
AND MOST OF THE PROBLEMS WITH KIDS IN SCHOOL CARRYING GUNS AND AND KNIVES AND EVERYTHING I MEAN GOOD GRIEF WHAT S MUMBLEX .
YEAH NOW THAT S THAT S JUST UNBELIEVABLE TO ME YOU KNOW .
I CA NT BELIEVE THAT I MEAN WHEN I WAS IN JUNIOR HIGH AND HIGH SCHOOL THAT NEVER HAPPENED YOU NEVER HEARD ABOUT THAT .
WELL YEAH WE DID NT WE DID NT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT YOU KNOW .
NO AND NOW YOU KNOW WHAT DO WE HAVE NOW YOU KNOW GOT KIDS THAT MUMBLEX EITHER GOT A YOU KNOW A MAGNUM GUN SCHOOL LIKE GOOD GRIEF .
R RIGHT .
I MEAN I D I D BE AFRAID TO BE IN SCHOOL I MEAN B TEACHING OR EVEN BEING A STUDENT AND THINK WHAT WHAT S IT GOING TO BE LIKE FOR MY MY YOUNGEST AN MY OLDEST SON WHEN HE GOES TO SCHOOL WHAT S GOING TO HAPPEN I MEAN I I M AFRAID FOR HIM TO GO .
EXACTLY RIGHT .
BUT THERE AGAIN YOU CA NT HOLD THEM BACK .
ANOTHER REASON YO AND YOU WANT TO ENCOURAGE THEM YOU KNOW TO TO BE ACTIVE AND EVERYTHING IN SCHOOL BUT UH YOU KNOW WITH ALL THE PEER PRESSURE THAT S GOING ON WITH ALL THE NEGATIVE THINGS IT IS UH IT S A TOUGH ENVIRONMENT TO BE GROWING UP IN .
YEAH AND LOT TOUGHER THAN IT WAS WHEN I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL AND THAT WAS WELL I WAS I GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL IN NINETEEN SEVENTYNINE SO .
OKAY .
THAT WAS WHAT TWELVE YEARS AGO I GUESS .
RIGHT .
SO YOU KNOW IT S LOT DIFFERENT NOW AND WHAT S IT GOING TO BE LIKE IN ANOTHER TWELVE YEARS WHEN MY UH OLDEST SON IS IN HIGH SCHOOL .
THAT S RIGHT THAT S RIGHT .
I M AFRAID TO I M AFRAID TO EVEN THINK ABOUT IT .
THAT YEAH THAT IS A SCARY THOUGHT BUT UH I DO NT KNOW I I GUESS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS JUST UH KEEP IN UH YOU KNOW ENCOURAGING THEM AND AND UH UH TRY TO BE OPEN WITH THEM SO THAT Y YOU CAN DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS AS THEY COME UP .
THAT S ALL YOU CAN DO .
YEAH AND .
YOU GOT TO YOU GOT TO BE YOUR CHILD S BEST FRIEND I GUESS .
RIGHT .
EVEN WHEN THEY RE A TEENAGER AND THEY YOU KNOW ARE KIND OF STANDOFFISH STILL YOU GOT TO BE THEIR BEST FRIEND BECAUSE WHEN THEY VE GOT PROBLEMS WHO THEY GOING TO GO TO THEIR FRIENDS THAT ARE DEALING DRUGS OR OR YOUR PARENTS .
EXACTLY .
YOU KNOW AN AND IF THEY GO TO THEIR FRIENDS DEALING DRUGS THEY RE GOING TO BE IN EVEN WORSE SHAPE .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND AND THE SCHOOLS DO NT DO NT REALLY ENCOURAGE TO STAY AWAY FROM THAT YOU KNOW THE SCHOOLS ARE THERE TO TEACH HISTORY AND THAT WE FOUGHT THE CIVIL WAR ETCETERA ETCETERA THEY DO NT TEACH THEM GOOD VALUES LIKE DRUGS ARE BAD I MAYBE I M WRONG BECAUSE I HAVE NT YOU KNOW BEEN IN THAT KIND OF ENVIRONMENT FOR A LONG TIME BUT .
RIGHT .
IT JUST IS AMAZING YOU KNOW NEED TO TEACH THEM GOOD VALUES .
THAT S TRUE THAT S TRUE AND UH .
OF COURSE WH IF I SAY THIS IS A GOOD VALUE SOMEONE ELSE IS GOING TO STAND UP AND SAY OH NO AND THE A C L U IS GOING TO GET AFTER THEM AND HAVE A LAWSUIT .
RIGHT .
WHICH IS GOING TO TAKE TWENTY YEARS TO RESOLVE YOU KNOW .
WELL AND I THINK UH YOU TOUCHED ON IT YOU KNOW YOU VE GOT TO START THEM AT THE HOME .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW THAT S WHERE THEY THAT S WHERE THEY GET THE THE DEEP ROOTED VALUES AND .
THAT S ALL YOU CAN DO .
AND AND UH AND THAT S ABOUT RIGHT THEN YOU JUST HAVE TO HOPE AND PRAY THAT THAT EVERYTHING UH WORKS OUT WORKS OUT OKAY SO .
THAT S RIGHT WELL I GOT TO BE GOING SO UH .
OKAY WELL HEY I APPRECIATE THE CALL .
NICE TALKING TO YOU TODAY .
YOU TO .
HAVE A GOOD LIFE UH .
ALL RIGHTY SO UH DO YOU THINK RUSSIA S STILL A THREAT .
WELL I GUESS I M MAYBE NAIVE BUT I NEVER DID FEEL THAT RUSSIA WAS A BIG THREAT TO US .
THERE YOU GO .
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THERE S THE THE THE POSSIBILITY OF OR WAS THE POSSIBILITY OF WAR UH BUT I SOMEHOW THINK THAT WAR IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT MAYBE IS INEVITABLE BUT UH I DO NT LOOK AT IT AS A THREAT IN THE SAME SENSE THAT THAT I THINK THIS QUESTION WAS MEANT WHAT ABOUT YOU .
WELL I THINK H HAVE YOU EVER READ THE BOOK NINETEEN EIGHTYFOUR .
YES .
OKAY YOU KNOW LIKE HOW UH THESE TWO THERE WAS LIKE THREE CONTINENTS THAT WERE ALWAYS FIGHTING WITH EACH OTHER .
UHHUH .
RIGHT AND YOU COULD PICTURE IT AS BEING RUSSIA VERSUS THE U S .
RIGHT .
D DURING THE WHOLE TIME AND WHAT THEY WOULD DO IS THEY WOULD GET THEIR PRISONERS AND KILL THEM AS SOON AS THEY GOT THEM BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THERE COULD REALIZE THAT THEY WERE THE SAME AS AS THEMSELVES YOU KNOW THE PRISONERS OF WARS WERE WERE THE SAME AS THE PEOPLE LIVING IN THAT COUNTRY .
RIGHT .
AND YOU DID NT WANT THAT TO HAPPEN AND TO ME IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN THAT WAY I MEAN WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU HAVE A GOVERNMENT RIGHT AND THIS GOVERNMENT CONTROLS EVERYTHING RIGHT .
YEAH .
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE PEOPLE INHABITING THE COUNTRY AND THESE PEOPLE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF .
RIGHT .
AND THESE PEOPLE ARE THE SAME AS YOU ARE .
RIGHT .
AND WHAT GOES ON IS THAT EVERY TIME SOMEBODY ATTACKS A COUNTRY SUPPOSEDLY U S OR RUSSIA ATTACKS A COUNTRY IT S NOT GOING TO BE WITHIN THE BORDERS OF THE U S OR RUSSIA ITSELF LIKE I WAS TELLING PEOPLE I M REALLY MAD BECAUSE THE WHOLE THING IN THE MIDDLE EAST THIS WAS GOING ON IN LITH IN LITHUANIA THEY THEY WERE ANNOUNCED TO BE A SEPARATE COUNTRY BUT YET THE THE GOVERNMENT THAT S IN MOSCOW TOLD ITS ARMY TO GO IN THERE AND GET THOSE PEOPLE AND THE U S DID NT GO IN THERE AND TRY TO SAVE THOSE PEOPLE .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW IT S LIKE YOU RE NOT GOING TO GO IN THERE AND SAY NO LISTEN THERE S A SEPARATE COUNTRY WHY BECAUSE YOU RE GOING INTO THE BORDER .
UHHUH UHHUH .
RIGHT ONCE YOU GET INTO THE BORDER THEN THERE S A THREAT BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU DO NT MESS WITH US WE WO NT MESS WITH YOU BUT LET S MESS WITH THE NEUTRAL COUNTRIES .
UHHUH UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND NOW IT S LIKE YOU KNOW THEY RE SAYING OTHER PEOPLE WERE WERE I GUESS OTHER LEADERS WERE STILL CRAZIER ABOUT IT YOU KNOW LIKE OTHER PEOPLE YOU COULD THINK THAT THEY MIGHT USE A BOMB HERE AND A BOMB THERE BUT RUSSIA HAS NEVER BEEN KNOWN FOR THROWING AN ATOMIC BOMB ANYWHERE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND THE U S HAS YOU KNOW IT S LIKE THEY IT SEEMS LIKE THEY CAN THEIR THEIR ARMY OR WHATEVER CAN CAN GO IN THERE QUICKER THAN AN ATOMIC BOMB CAN AND DO DO THE JOB WITH UH YOU KNOW LESS SUFFERING .
UHHUH UHHUH .
YOU KNOW BUT I THINK I THINK THE THING IS IS THAT THERE THE THING LIKE THEY WERE SAYING THEY GO YOU KNOW LIKE LIBYA COULD START A NUCLEAR WAR BECAUSE OF WHOEVER IS BEHIND THE BUTTON BUT NOT THE U S S R .
RIGHT .
THE U S S R .
UHHUH .
WOULD NT DO IT .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE THEY GOT TOO MUCH AT STAKE .
BUT I GUESS THERE WAS CONCERN UH THAT I IRAQ WOULD USE YOU KNOW NONCONVENTIONAL WARHEADS WITH WITH THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS AND THINGS BUT YET IT DID NT HAPPEN .
YEAH .
I MEAN .
WELL .
WHY NOT .
MY MY POINT OF VIEW TO THAT IS IS THAT IT WOULD HAVE HAD SO MUCH I MEAN THE ATTACK WOULD HAVE BEEN SO COMPLETE ON IRAQ IF THEY HAD I MEAN THE FIRST YOU CAN IMAGINE THE FIRST UH CHEMICAL WEAPON USED .
UHHUH .
THAT WOULD HAVE MEANT A TOTAL ATTACK OF THE IRAQ COUNTRY WITHIN YOU KNOW THREE HOURS OF WHEN THE WEAPON WAS SHOT .
OH SO YOU THINK IT WAS FEAR THAT KEPT IRAQ FROM .
RIGHT .
USING IT BUT YET THE .
AND WHAT HAPPENS IS WHAT HAPPENS IS SUPPOSE THEY GET SADDAM HUSSEIN WHICH THEY EVENTUALLY WILL HE S GOT ONE LESS THING TO GO AGAINST HIM .
UHHUH UHHUH .
I MEAN IF HE WERE TO USE THAT HE MIGHT AS WELL COMMIT SUICIDE .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE HE S GOING TO BE CAPTURED AND YOU KNOW BUT THE U S ALSO MAKES A LOT OF UH YOU KNOW TREATIES WITH OTHER PEOPLE LIKE SAYING OKAY IF YOU GIVE UP THEN YOU CAN COME LIVE IN OUR COUNTRY AND WE LL TAKE CARE OF YOU LIKE MARCOS RIGHT .
RIGHT .
WE LL OVERTHROW YOU BUT YET YOU CAN STILL COME LIVE HERE YOU KNOW .
RIGHT I DO NT THINK WE VE DONE THAT TO SADDAM HUSSEIN YET .
UH NO .
NO .
I THINK THAT S THAT S THAT S NOT VERY LIKELY BUT YET YOU KNOW AS AS THE PARALLEL RUSSIA IS THAT SADDAM HUSSEIN IS USING THE CHEMICAL WARFARE .
YEAH .
ON HIS OWN PEOPLE AND I GUESS THAT MAKES SENSE WHAT YOU SAID THAT UH WITHIN THEIR OWN BORDERS THEY FEEL FREER TO DO .
RIGHT .
WHAT WHAT THEY FEEL NECESSARY .
RIGHT .
YEAH .
AND UH YOU KNOW THERE S THERE S JUST YOU KNOW LIKE PEOPLE WILL GO LIKE THEY LIKE THE U S GOES AND GOES INTO PANAMA AND WHAT SEE I DO NT BELIEVE IN WAR THAT S MY THING I DO NT BELIEVE THAT ANYBODY SHOULD DIE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND SO THEN YOU KNOW YOU HAVE BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS SUPPOSE I M I GO TO WAR AND I M HOLDING A GUN AND I M JUST LOOKING AT MYSELF HOLDING A GUN AND WHOEVER SHOOTS FIRST SURVIVES YOU KNOW BUT THAT SAME PERSON ALSO HAS A FAMILY AND YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
HIS PARENTS ARE GOING TO CRY AND YOU KNOW LIFE ENDS THERE AND TO ME THAT S RIDICULOUS YOU KNOW I MEAN I JUST DO NT BELIEVE IT I THINK THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO FIX IT EVEN THOUGH SOMETIMES THERE ARE NT BUT IT S PRETTY HARD TO THINK THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE JUST GOING TO SHOOT EACH OTHER DOWN AND IT S LEGAL IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT .
WELL .
YOU KNOW .
OR THAT THAT IT RESOLVES ANYTHING IN THE END THAT .
YEAH .
THAT NEGOTIATIONS COULD NT RESOLVE .
YEAH I MEAN I MEAN SADDAM HUSSEIN LOST SO MUCH MONEY DURING THE WAR THAT IT WAS RIDICULOUS AND HE ALL HE WAS TRYING TO DO WAS MAKE MONEY AT THE BEGINNING .
UHHUH .
SO AND KEEP HIS POWER BUT WELL .
WELL IT SOUNDS LIKE NEITHER ONE OF US THINKS THAT THE SOVIET UNION IS A REAL THREAT TO THE U S .
NO I I DO NT THINK SO I THINK UH THEY RE GETTING THEY RE ESPECIALLY GETTING THEIR LIFE BACK TOGETHER NOW BECAUSE A LOT OF THINGS THAT YOU SAW ON TV A LOT OF UH INHABITANTS OF RUSSIA WOULD LOVE TO STAY IN THEIR COUNTRY JUST AS LONG AS THEY WERE ABLE TO EXPRESS WHAT THEY WANTED TO .
RIGHT .
A LOT OF LIKE DANCERS AND STUFF LIKE THAT .
RIGHT .
THEY SAID THAT THEY WOULD NT LEAVE RUSSIA UNLESS RUSSIA TOLD THEM THAT THEY COULD NT TRAVEL ANYMORE AND COMPETE SO IT MUST BE A BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY .
UHHUH .
IT S JUST THAT YOU KNOW THEY WO NT LET YOU GET OUT AND WHEN YOU WANT TO GET OUT OF THE COUNTRY THAT S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO .
RIGHT RIGHT .
SO OH WELL I GOT TO GO TO CLASS NOW .
OKAY WELL THANKS .
NICE TALKING TO YOU .
BYEBYE .
BYEBYE .
OKAY WHAT DO YOU USUALLY WEAR TO WORK .
WELL UH I AM BASICALLY RETIRED NOW .
UHHUH .
I WAS A MEMBER I WAS IN EDUCATION AND IN ADMINISTRATION .
UHHUH .
SO BASICALLY I WORE DRESSES .
UHHUH .
AND UH HEELS AND I WAS NEVER ONE UH BECAUSE MY WORK OFTEN TOOK ME INTO COURT UH NEVER WAS ONE .
THAT GOT UH ACCUSTOMED TO WEARING PANTS SUITS AND PANTS TO WORK .
UHHUH .
BUT THAT WAS JUST ME .
I KNOW MANY PEOPLE ARE CO VERY COMFORTABLE IN THE CLASSROOM AND WHAT HAVE YOU WEARING PANTS .
UH IT I GUESS I WAS JUST OLD ENOUGH NOT TO UH BE VERY COMFORTABLE IN IT .
UHHUH .
HOW ABOUT YOU .
WELL I WORK AT T I AND THEY DO NT REALLY HAVE UH DRESS CODE SO TO SPEAK THERE .
IT S PRETTY LAX ABOUT UM YOU KNOW WE YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH WEAR WHATEVER .
YOU WANT TO AND I WEAR ANYTHING FROM JEANS WHEN I M FEELING REALLY CASUAL TO UH SUITS AND DRESSES WHEN I M MEETING WITH A CUSTOMER OR I I TEACH TRAINING CLASSES .
OH .
AND SO WHEN I M TEACHING A CLASS OBVIOUSLY I WEAR A SUIT OR DRESS SO .
UHHUH .
IT IT UH DEFINITELY FLUCTUATES MAINLY WITH WHAT .
I M GOING TO BE DOING THAT DAY AND KIND OF WHAT .
MY MOOD IS AND WHEN IT S RAINING .
I M MORE LIKELY TO WEAR JEANS AND AND WHEN IT S REALLY COLD I M MORE LIKELY TO WEAR JEANS OR PANTS OR SWEATERS OR THAT TYPE OF THING .
UHHUH .
UM BUT IT JUST REALLY DEPENDS ON THE WEATHER AND MY MOOD AND THEN YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WHEN I M DOING ANYTHING THAT I M IN FRONT OF PEOPLE OR OR MAKING PRESENTATIONS TEACHING WHATEVER .
YES .
I M GOING TO DRESS UP MORE .
AND I THINK THAT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE BECAUSE WHEN YOU DO HAVE TO BE IN FRONT OF PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
UH I THINK YOU THE THE TENDENCY THERE IS TO WEAR DRESSES AND SUITS AND AND UH MORE CLASSICAL STYLE OF CLOTHING .
UHHUH .
WHAT ABOUT THE MINI SKIRT .
THERE ARE A FEW PEOPLE .
EVERY NOW AND THEN THAT WEAR THOSE TO WORK .
THERE PRETTY STRICT ABOUT THAT THOUGH .
UM I VE NEVER WORN I JUST WOULD NT I MEAN EVEN TO WELL JEANS ARE NT EXACTLY PROFESSIONAL BUT FOR SOME REASON .
A MINI SKIRT IS TO ME .
A LITTLE MORE UNPROFESSIONAL TO WEAR TO WORK THAN JEANS JUST BECAUSE IT S MAYBE IT S JUST BECAUSE OF THE SEXIST VIEWS AND EVERYTHING BUT YOU JUST FEEL LIKE YOU RE YOU RE BEING SHOWING TOO MUCH LE I DO NT KNOW I WOULD NT WANT TO WEAR A MINI SKIRT TO WORK .
WE .
I HAVE SEEN A FEW PEOPLE DO IT THOUGH BUT THEY THEY WERE NT OVERLY SHOR AND THEY WERE NT OVERLY REVEALING .
THEY WERE PRETTY MUCH IN GOOD TASTE BUT UM .
UHHUH .
FOR ME .
I JUST I JUST COU WOULD NT WANT TO DO THAT .
WELL THERE ARE MINI SKIRTS AND THERE ARE MINI SKIRTS .
YEAH .
THERE ARE SOME .
THAT ARE REALLY SHORT AND THEN THERE ARE SOME .
THAT MAY BE WILL COME LIKE FOUR INCHES OR FIVE INCHES ABOVE THE KNEE .
UHHUH THAT S WHAT .
I VE SEEN .
AND AGAIN IT DEPENDS UPON THE SIZE THE SHAPE OF THE PERSON .
UHHUH .
AS WELL AS THE SHAPE OF THE PERSON S LEGS .
UHHUH .
NOW I ALSO UH EVEN THOUGH I RETIRED FROM EDUCATION I UH I DO MODELING AND I TEACH AT A MODELING AGENCY HERE .
UHHUH .
AND UH SO WHEN WE ARE DOING WARDROBING AND WE HAVE UH TWO TWO HOUR CLASSES IN WARDROBE WE DO DISCUSS A GREAT DEAL THE MINI SKIRT AND THE TYPES OF CLOTHES TO WEAR ON THE JOB .
UHHUH .
UH EVEN THOUGH I MAY HAVE THEM FROM SIXTH GRADE ON UP THROUGH UH GRANDMOTHERS .
UHHUH .
IN MY CLASS .
AND UH WHE I ALWAYS TRY TO EMPHASIZE THE CLOTHES THAT YOU WEAR SHOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE THE GREATEST FAD .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE MAYBE THEY THOSE ARE NOT THE CLOTHES .
THAT ARE THE MOST UH APPEALING TO YOU OR THE MOST UH COMPLIMENTARY TO YOU .
RIGHT .
BUT UH THE MINI SKIRT MANY TIMES WILL EVOKE COMMENTS YOU DO NT REALLY WANT .
RIGHT .
AND AND THEN UH THEN YOU RE IN THE SITUATION WHERE YOU RE VERY UNHAPPY .
UHHUH .
WELL I FEEL LIKE TOO ON THE JOB WHEN YOU KNOW THERE .
S MEN AROUND AND SOME OF THE MANAGERS ARE MEN YOU JUST YOU KNOW YOU DO NT WANT THEM LOOKING AT YOUR LEGS NECESSARILY .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND UH TO ME .
I JUST WOULD NT FEEL COMFORTABLE IN THAT AT WORK BUT UH .
WELL I I UH I HAVE TO UH AGREE WITH THAT EVEN WHEN THEY WAS VERY VERY POPULAR IN THE EARLY SIXTIES .
UHHUH .
UH I UH UH AGAIN MAYBE BECAUSE I WAS AT THE SCHOOL THERE WERE STILL MANY TEACHERS .
WHO WORE MINI SKIRTS .
UHHUH .
UH WE HAD NO REGULATION AGAINST IT AND A LOT OF THE KIDS DID OF COURSE AND IT COULD BE VERY EMBARRASSING FOR THE MEN TEACHERS .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT THAT CAREFUL IN HOW THEY HANDLED THEMSELVES IN THOSE MINI SKIRTS .
RIGHT .
AND SO I THINK UH UH OF COURSE NOW I GO THE OTHER EXTREME I DO NOT LIKE TO SEE IN THE CORPORATE AREAS UH ALL THE WOMEN DRESSED LIKE MEN .
UHHUH .
WITH THE SUITS AND UH WHITE SHIRTS AND TIES AND WHAT HAVE YOU SO THAT THEY .
ALL LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME .
UHHUH .
UH I DO NT LIKE THAT I DO NT I THINK THERE SHOULD BE INDIVIDUALITY IN DRESSING .
UHHUH .
EVEN WITH THE VERY TAILORED LOOK OF A SUIT SOMETIMES I LIKE TO HAVE SOMETH A LIT JUST A LITTLE .
SOMETHING .
THAT .
S FEMININE .
YES .
NOT YOU KNOW YOU DO NT WANT TO OVER DO IT BUT JUST A LITTLE A TOUCH OF IT JUST TO SAY YES I AM A WOMAN .
RIGHT .
BUT I CAN BE PROFESSIONAL TOO .
WELL I AND I DO NT THINK THAT YOU HAVE TO BE MANISH AND EXTREMELY TAILORED TO TO LOOK PROFESSIONAL .
RIGHT UHHUH .
I THINK THAT YOU YOU MAKE OF THAT WHAT .
YOU WISH AND YOU CAN GO THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND UH OVER DO ALL THE FRILLS AND LACES AND FLOUNCES AND WHAT HAVE YOU WHICH DO NT BELONG IN THE IN AT LEAST IN MY OPINION IN THE WORK PLACE .
RIGHT .
UH BUT THAT THAT YOU CAN HAVE A CLASSICAL LOOK WITHOUT A LOT OF A GREAT DEAL OF ADORNMENT AND WHAT HAVE YOU AND STILL BE VERY FEMININE .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE THAT WAS ONE THING .
I ALWAYS FOUGHT AGAINST .
I STARTED OUT AS A PHYSICAL EDUCATION TEACHER .
UHHUH .
SO I WAS ALWAYS FIGHTING AGAINST THE IDEA OF LOOKING TAILORED OR MANISH .
RIGHT .
UH AND PEOPLE WOULD NEVER EVER GUESS THAT I WAS PHYS ED AND UM AND THAT PLEASED ME .
UHHUH .
UH AND SO THEN I OF COURSE JUST CONTINUED WHAT .
I CONSIDERED THE BEST STYLE OF CLOTHING FOR ME AT WORK AND UH AND I FIND EVEN EVEN AT HOME HERE NOW I I WILL WEAR BLUE JEANS OR I LL WEAR SHORTS AND WHAT HAVE YOU UH AND BE VERY COMFORTABLE BUT WHEN I GO OUT SOMEWHERE THEN UH UNLESS I HAVE A PAIR OF DRESS SLACKS I DO NT USUALLY WEAR A LOT OF BLUE JEANS .
UHHUH .
I HAVE DIFFICULTY GETTING THEM TO FIT ME COMFORTABLY ANY HOW .
UHHUH .
AND SO UH UH I JUST FEEL THAT UH YOU KNOW EACH PERSON HAS TO DRESS TO THEIR OWN LIKING AND FOR THEIR OWN COMFORT .
UHHUH .
BUT UH THERE ARE CERTAIN NORMS THAT COMPANIES SHOULD BE ABLE TO UH PUT OUT AS GUIDELINES FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES .
RIGHT THAT S WHAT .
I ONE THING .
I LIKE ABOUT T I IS THAT THEY ARE NT OVERLY STRICT ABOUT WHAT .
YOU WEAR AND THEY DO NT YOU KNOW YOUR BOSS DOES NT COME UP TO YOU AND SAY NOW REMEMBER TOMORROW YOU HAVE A MEETING SO YOU D BETTER WEAR A SUIT .
I MEAN THEY THEY LEAVE IT UP TO YOU AND YOUR JUDGMENT TO .
RIGHT .
TO USE GOOD JUDGMENT AND DRESS TASTEFULLY AND DRESS FOR WHATEVER OCCASION .
YOU MAY HAVE .
YES .
THE ONLY REAL RESTRICTIONS THEY HAVE ARE UH NO HALTER TOPS AND NO SHORTS EVEN THE LONG WALKING SHORT OF THE SQUIRTS THE THE SPLIT SKIRTS .
YES .
ANYTHING .
THAT THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED SHORTS THEY DO NT ALLOW .
THAT S GOOD .
AND THEY DO NT ALLOW UH ANY SWEAT ANY SWEAT SHIRTS OR T SHIRTS .
THAT MIGHT HAVE VULGAR OR YOU KNOW ANYTHING LIKE THAT ON IT BUT .
YEAH UHHUH .
OTHER THAN THAT IT S PRETTY PRETTY LAX AND I THINK THAT S GOOD BECAUSE IT DOES ALLOW PEOPLE TO BE INDIVIDUAL AND IT ALLOWS YOU TO KIND OF DRESS .
THE WAY .
YOU FEEL THAT DAY .
YES .
OR YOU KNOW IF YOU WANT TO BE COMFORTABLE AND CASUAL YOU CAN AND SOMETIMES I THINK YOU MAY BE MORE PRODUCTIVE IF YOU RE COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT .
YOUR WEARING AND CAN BE BE FEEL MORE RELAXED .
RIGHT .
WHEREAS UH SOMETIMES WHEN YOUR IN THE SUIT AND FEEL KIND OF ALMOST STIFF AND YOU RE NOT YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU DO NT UH CA NT GET AS COMFORTABLE TO SIT DOWN AND YOU KNOW LIKE WHEN I M WRITING TRAINING MATERIAL I PREFER TO BE MORE COMFORTABLE UNLESS I KNOW I HAVE TO MEET WITH A CUSTOMER LATER DURING THE DAY .
RIGHT RIGHT .
SO THAT S I THINK THAT IS GOOD THAT THEY RE LIKE THAT .
I DO KNOW THERE S A LOT OF COMPANIES .
THAT ARE VERY STRICT ABOUT WHAT .
THE EMPLOYEES WEAR AND THEY MUST WEAR BLUE OR GRAY OR BLACK AND A WHITE SHIRT AND .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW NO VARIATION AND I DO NT I DO NT QUITE AGREE WITH THAT .
YEAH WELL I DO NT EITHER .
FORTUNATELY I DO NT HAVE TO WORK IN THOSE COMPANIES .
RIGHT .
BUT UH I I UH DID HAVE A GROUP COME OVER FROM ONE OF THE BANKS OVER THE CHILDREN S HOSPITAL WHERE I WAS VOLUNTEERING AND UH THEY WERE DOING A PRESENTATION AND EVERY ONE OF THE YOUNG EXECS COMING UP WERE DRESSED EXACTLY A LIKE MEN AND WOMEN .
THEY .
ALL HAD ON THE GRAY JACKETS AND THE GRAY TROUSERS OR SLA OR SKIRTS AND THE WHITE BLOUSES AND THE SAME COLOR TIE .
I MEAN YOU COULD HARDLY TELL THE WOMEN FROM THE MEN EXCEPT FOR THE LENGTHS OF THE PANTS .
UH RIGHT .
AND ONE WAS A SKIRT AND ONE WAS A PANT .
YEAH .
AND UH AND I THINK THAT S SAD BECAUSE THAT DOES NT ALLOW FOR ANY INDIVIDUALITY .
UHHUH .
THAT S UH CAN STIFLE CREATIVITY .
RIGHT I AGREE .
SO .
WELL IT I GUESS WE VE TALKED PROBABLY LONG ENOUGH .
I GUESS SO WELL IT S BEEN NICE TALKING WITH YOU .
NICE TALKING TO YOU TOO I ENJOYED IT .
UHHUH BYE BYE .
BYE BYE .

ME TO .
BYE BYE .
BYE BYE .
OKAY WHAT TYPES OF MUSIC DO YOU LIKE TO LISTEN TO .
WELL I PRIMARILY LISTEN TO CLASSICAL MUSIC WHEN I HAVE MY DRUTHERS PARTLY BECAUSE I FIND IT MORE SOOTHING I DO NT KNOW A LOT ABOUT CLASSICAL MUSIC SO FAR AS UH ANY BACKGROUND IN MUSIC BUT IT S THE PO THE MUSIC I ENJOY THE MOST HOW ABOUT YOU .
I LIKE CLASSICAL MUSIC ALSO I UH LIKE YOU I DO NT KNOW A WHOLE LOT ABOUT IT AND I I WOULD LIKE TO BUY MORE CLASSICAL TAPES AND STUFF BUT I M NOT SURE WHICH COMPOSERS OR WHICH MUMBLEX .
RIGHT .
I REALLY LIKE SO I KIND OF HESITATE .
UHHUH .
TO BUY SOMETHING THERE ARE CERTAIN KINDS I LIKE AND CERTAIN KINDS I DO NT .
I TEND TO LISTEN TO THE CLASSICAL MUSIC UH ON THE RADIO A LOT THERE S UH ONE PARTICULAR WELL THERE SEVERAL STATIONS IN THIS AREA THAT PLAY UH CLASSICAL MUSIC ALL THE TIME BUT THERE S ONE IN PARTICULAR THAT IS ON BOTH A M AND F M SO I CAN LISTEN TO IT WITHOUT UH WORRYING IT S CUTE THOUGH BECAUSE MY CHILDREN WHEN THEY GET IN THE CAR AND I HAVE UH THE BUTTON PUSHED FOR THAT THEY ALWAYS SWITCH IT TO SOMETHING ELSE .
BECAUSE NATURALLY THAT IS NT THEIR TASTE .
YEAH .
AT THIS POINT IN TIME ANYWAY .
YEAH I UNDERSTAND THAT .
ARE ARE YOU INVOLVED IN MUSIC .
UH NO NOT REALLY MY HUSBAND IS BUT NOT I DO UH THE WORLD A FAVOR AND I DO NT SING ALOUD .
TO ANYBODY BUT MYSELF .
WELL MY WHOLE FAMILY IS SOMEWHAT MUSICAL UM AND NOT FROM TRAINING BUT JUST BECAUSE WE SING IN OUR CHOIR AND MY DAUGHTER S QUITE INVOLVED AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING SO UM I THINK THAT ONE OF THESE DAYS MAYBE SHE LL GET INVOLVED IN CLASSICAL MUSIC TOO BECAUSE THAT S USUALLY WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU UNLESS YOU GET INTO ROCK WHICH IS NT HER VOICE STYLE SO .
YEAH I I DO NT CARE FOR ROCK AT ALL I GUESS I M REAL OLD FASHIONED IN MY MUSICAL TASTES .
NO I WELL MOST OF IT IS NOT ALL THAT EXCITING IN THAT IT IS TERRIBLY REPETITIOUS .
YES .
IT S LOUD AND REPETITIOUS WITHOUT HAVING A GREAT DEAL OF MEANING NOW I DO LIKE FOLK SONG UM AND THERE HAVE BEEN SOME NICE FOLK SONGS OVER THE YEARS THAT YOU KNOW KIND OF STILL HANG AROUND .
RIGHT .
BUT UM BUT UH THE MORE POPULAR MUSIC I DO NT CARE FOR USUALLY .
YEAH .
UM EVEN WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER I DID NT REALLY LIKE THE MUSIC OF THAT PERIOD SO MUCH BECAUSE I FOUND I LIKED UM A LITTLE BIT MORE MELODIOUS MUSIC THAN WHAT WAS OFTEN THE POPULAR .
YEAH .
ROCK AND ROLL KIND OF SOUND .
I AGREE WITH THAT TOO .
ALTHOUGH NOW I KIND OF ENJOY HEARING THE ROCK AND ROLL I GUESS IT MAKES ME THINK I M YOUNG AGAIN .
YEAH NOW ROCK AND ROLL SEEMS TAME COMPARED TO LIKE THE NEW AGE AND ALL THAT STUFF .
IS NT THAT THE TRUTH IT S FUNNY IN FACT IT S INTERESTING TO ME THAT SO MANY OF THE SONGS NOW I GREW UP IN THE LATE FIFTIES AND EARLY SIXTIES AND SO MUCH OF THE MUSIC THAT WAS POPULAR AT THAT TIME HAS COME BACK .
UHHUH .
AND YOU YOU DO NT HEAR EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME BUT YOU HEAR MUCH OF THE SAME MUSIC PERHAPS A NEW VERSION OF IT BUT IT S THE SAME STUFF .
RIGHT .
UM WHICH IS ALWAYS KIND OF FUNNY .
UM AND I REMEMBER MY OLDER SISTER I HAVE A SISTER WHO S SIXTEEN YEARS OLDER AND AT THE TIME THAT I WAS A TEENAGER A LATE TEENAGER I GUESS I CA NT REMEMBER THE YEAR SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES BECAME POPULAR I THINK IT WAS DONE BY MAYBE THE PLATTERS OR SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
THEN AND SHE LAUGHED AND SHE SAID WELL YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER THAT HAD BEEN YOU KNOW SOME YEARS BEFORE SHE SAID THAT WAS A VERSION OF YOU KNOW A SONG THEN AND SHE SAID IT S VERY SIMILAR BUT THEY VE CHANGED A LITTLE BIT SHE SAID I LIKE THE ORIGINAL VERSION BETTER WELL THEY DID IT AGAIN ABOUT TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO AND I LAUGHED AGAIN I SAID OH NO HERE WE ARE .
CROPS UP EVERY SO OFTEN .
RIGHT RIGHT IT DOES INDEED .

SO I VE ALWAYS BEEN INVOLVED YOU KNOW IN ONE .
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THEM I MEAN SINCE YOU VE .
WELL I VE .
KIND OF BEEN CLOSE TO THAT .
WELL I CAN KIND OF SEE BOTH .
SIDES YOU KNOW I REALLY CAN .
UH NURSING HOMES TO ME I WOULD PERSONALLY BE THE LAST RESORT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW I REA YOU KNOW IF I HAD TO PUT SOMEONE IN THERE .
WELL I VE HAD A TOUCH OF EXPERIENCE .
MY UM DAD HAD EMPHYSEMA AND GOT TO THE POINT WHERE MOTHER COULD NT .
YEAH IF IT S A HAVE TO THING YEAH I YEAH .
TAKE CARE OF HIM AND UH SHE PUT HIM IN BUT HE .
WAS NT THERE VERY LONG BEFORE HE DIED .
UHHUH .
BUT UM I GUESS UM THE ONE TIME THAT I SAW HIM THERE YOU KNOW AS FAR AS THE SURROUNDINGS THAT SEEMED OKAY .

KIND OF THOUGHT THAT MAYBE THEY JUST WANTED TO GIVE HIM .
SOME MEDICATION TO SORT OF YOU KNOW .

KEEP HIM REAL OUT OF IT .
ALL THE TIME .

AND THAT S ALWAYS KIND OF BOTHERED ME .
YEAH .
WELL I .
KIND OF THINK THAT S TRUE TOO .
I GUESS BECAUSE IT S SO UNDER STAFFED YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
THAT S LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE THOUGH .
I HAVE A SISTERINLAW .
WHO RUNS A NURSING HOME BUT I VE NEVER ACTUALLY BEEN THERE .
UHHUH .
AND I KNOW THAT SHE S THE KIND OF PERSON .
WHO WOULD NT ALLOW YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE .
YEAH .
HORROR THINGS TO TAKE PLACE THAT YOU HEAR ABOUT .
YEAH BUT .
BUT STILL .
YEAH .
I M SURE THERE ARE YOU KNOW ASPECTS TO IT .
YEAH .
THAT ARE NT REALLY DESIRABLE .
YEAH I KNOW I VE ALWAYS WELL MY SISTER S INVOLVED IN ONE ALSO AND I REALLY THINK THEY REALLY DO A WONDERFUL JOB .
BUT STILL THERE S THOSE LITTLE THINGS THAT HAPPENS YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
THERE REALLY IS WHICH .
I THINK IT S A WONDERFUL PLACE YOU KNOW IF IT COMES TO THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU JUST CA NT TAKE CARE OF THEM .
ANY MORE .
WELL SOMETIMES YOU DO NT HAVE ANY OTHER ALTERNATIVE .
UHHUH THAT S IT .
FAMILY AND FRIENDS ARE USUALLY WELL .
UHHUH .
FAMILY S TIED UP WITH .
OTHER THINGS .
THEIR OWN LIVES AND THINGS AND USUALLY WORKING AND .
YEAH YEAH YEAH .
IT S HARD TO .
BUT I THINK WHEN THE TIME COMES I I HOPE TO HAVE THE TIME TO REALLY LOOK AROUND YOU KNOW .
YES .
AND PICK ONE THAT I REALLY THINK MY MOTHER WOULD BE HAPPY AT .
UHHUH I THINK THAT S IMPORTANT TOO IN FACT .
I DO TOO .
THERE S A .
OUTSIDE S AWFUL DECEIVING SOMETIMES .
YES .
YOU KNOW .
THERE S ONE CLOSE TO WHERE MY MOTHER IS BUT IN ORDER TO GET IN YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO UM WALK IN ON YOUR OWN IN OTHER WORDS YOU CA NT BE IN YOU KNOW TOO BAD A SHAPE .
YEAH .
TO START OUT WITH .
YEAH .
BUT THEN IF YOU DETERIORATE UM THEY HAVE A SEPARATE SECTION FOR THOSE .
WHO NEED CARE .
CA YEAH .
YOU KNOW ALL THE TIME .
YEAH .
BUT IT S ALWAYS WELL AND THEY HAVE A LONG WAITING LIST TOO .
SO THERE S ALWAYS THIS FEELING OF WELL GOLLY GEE YOU KNOW YOU VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO WALK IN THE DOOR SO YOU CA NT WAIT UNTIL YOU RE TOO BAD OFF .
OFF YEAH .
BUT THEN YOU DO NT WANT TO GO DO THAT WHEN YOU DO NT HAVE TO .
TO NO .
BECAUSE LIKE UH YOU HAVE TO GIVE UP YOUR AUTOMOBILE OR WHATEVER .
UHHUH AND EVERYTHING .
YOU WORKED SO HARD FOR ALL YOUR LIFE .
YEAH .
YEAH .
AND IF YOU RE STILL CAPABLE OF DRIVING AND DOING THOSE THINGS THEN YOU FEEL LIKE WELL GEE I M YOU KNOW I M ISOLATING MYSELF .
UHHUH .
HERE FOR NO REASON AT THE MOMENT .
UHHUH .
SO IT S KIND OF A THAT S A HARD ONE BUT IT IS A VERY NICE NURSING HOME .
NOW THERE IS SOME REALLY NICE ONES .
THERE S ALSO YOU KNOW SOME PRIVATE ONES YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
BUT OF COURSE I WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO PUT MY PARENTS IN SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW .
YEAH THAT S THE PROBLEM .
THAT S WAY OUT OF MY REACH .
THE EXPENSE OF IT .
ALL IS AND UH WHAT .
I ANOTHER THING .
I HATE TO SEE IS WHEN SOMEONE HAS A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY AND THEY GO INTO ONE OF THESE PLACES AND THEY JUST EAT IT .
ALL UP IMMEDIATELY .
OH YEAH .
BUT THOSE .
WHO DO NT HAVE MONEY CAN GO IN AND GET THE SAME CARE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW .
THE VERY SAME YEAH .
SO I DO NT LIKE THAT ASPECT .
NO BUT I THERE S I THINK THERE .
S WAYS AROUND IT THOUGH THAT YOU KNOW LIKE THEY COULD PUT IT IN ONE OF THEIR CHILDREN S NAMES OR SOMETHING .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
BUT STILL A LOT OF THEM DOES NT FEEL COMFORTABLE DOING THAT .
YOU KNOW IT S THEIR MONEY .
THAT S RIGHT .
YOU KNOW THAT S HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT ANYWAY .
WELL YEAH I VE TALKED TO MY MOTHER ABOUT THAT SEVERAL TIMES LATELY AND I I SAID I WANT YOU TO HAVE CONTROL OF YOUR OWN BUSINESS .

BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IF .
YEAH MY MOTHER S SEVENTY NOW SO NATURALLY SHE S RETIRED BUT SHE S STILL ON HER OWN I MEAN .
YEAH YEAH MY MOTHER S UH SEVENTYFIVE AND STILL HAS HER OWN HOME AND EVERYTHING .
I THINK THAT S WONDERFUL I REALLY DO JUST AS LONG AS THEY CAN AND THEN ON THE OTHER HAND I VE SEEN SOME PEOPLE GO INTO THE NURSING HOME AND JUST SO HAPPY .
YEAH .

THAT S TRUE .
THEY HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND TO DO THINGS WITH .
UHHUH THEY RE NOT LONELY .
SOME OF THOSE PLACES HAVE WONDERFUL ACTIVITIES AND THINGS YOU KNOW LOTS OF STUFF GOING ON .

AND THEY LL TAKE THEM PLACES .
YEAH .
SO .
I DO NT KNOW IT S NOT ALL BAD .
NO .
BUT I GUESS ONCE YOU GET ILL THEN YOU KNOW YOU REALLY HAVE SOME PROBLEMS IF YOU CA NT GET AROUND .
AROUND YEAH .
AND DO THINGS .
BUT I REALLY DO NT KNOW WHAT .
THE OTHER SOLUTION WOULD BE .
NO .
YOU KNOW I REALLY DO NT .
BUT NO WHEN THE TIME COMES I M REALLY HOPEFULLY WE LL REALLY LOOK AROUND BEFORE I DECIDE ON ONE FOR MY PARENTS .
UHHUH .
REALLY DO BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN RAISED IN ONE YOU KNOW SO THERE S LOT OF THINGS I KNOW TO LOOK FOR .
YEAH .
AND I DO NT THINK THEY D WANT TO GO WHERE THEY USED TO WORK EITHER .

WELL WHAT IS YOUR VIEW DO YOU CONSIDER THE SOVIET UNION .
A THREAT .
I DO NT KNOW THAT IT S SO MUCH A MILITARY THREAT ANYMORE AS A WELL YOU KNOW IT S IT S REAL CONFUSING RIGHT NOW TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF A OF OF A THREAT .
IT IS I GUESS .
SURE .
IT IT TAKES AWHILE TO TO GET USED TO SOMETHING YOU KNOW IF IF THEY HAVE COMPLETELY CHAIN ON THE PLACE HAS COMPLETELY TURNED THAT MUCH AROUND TO WHERE THEY RE NOT YOU KNOW NOT WHAT .
THEY USED TO BE .
RIGHT .
UH .
IT S IT S HARD TO TO KNOW ANYMORE IF IT S A A THREAT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER BECAUSE UH IT USED TO BE S SO F MUCH IN THE PAST THAT WHATEVER .
THE TOP SAID THE REST FELL YOU KNOW RANK AND FILE IN BEHIND IT .
UHHUH .
AND NOW THAT WITH GORBACHEV IS INTRODUCING MORE I GUESS FREEDOMS OR EXPRESSIONS OF FREEDOM IT DOES NT LOOK AS THOUGH YOU KNOW EVERYBODY S FOLLOWING THE SAME PATTERN .
YEAH .
AND THOSE THE PEOPLE .
WHO ARE YOU KNOW THE STAUNCH MILITARY CONSERVATIVE PEOPLE YOU NEVER KNOW WELL GORBACHEV S FUTURE IS LIKE WHEREAS .
YEAH .
WHEREAS IN THE PAST .
IT WAS SEEN AS YOU KNOW WHOEVER WAS THE HEAD OF THE THE COMMUNIST PARTY WAS SEEN AS YOU KNOW UNTOUCHABLE .
YEAH .
I THI YEAH THE THING .
THAT KEEPS HAPPENING IS HAPPENING SO FAST AND SO UH DRAMATIC THAT YOU ALMOST THINK NOW WAIT A MINUTE YOU KNOW WE RE GETTING STUCK INTO SOMETHING HERE YOU KNOW IF .
UHHUH .
IF SOMEBODY S ABOUT TO TO CLOBBER YOU THE FIRST THING .
THEY DO IS SORT OF SAY WELL YOU KNOW WE RE WE RE ASHAMED WE RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT ANYMORE .
EXACTLY .
AND UH UM YOU KNOW I D I D LIKE TO THINK THAT THAT IS NT TRUE BUT I I YOU KNOW THE EVIDENCE IS THAT UH YOU KNOW HE S HE S LET SOME SOME STUFF GO YOU KNOW THE EAST GERMAN SITUATION .
RIGHT .
IT S JUST THE WHOLE THING IS SO INCOMPREHENSIBLE YOU KNOW IF I D HAVE BEEN ASLEEP FOR FIVE YEARS .
AND READ IT IN A BOOK I SAID NO NO NO THAT DID NT COULD NT HAVE HAPPENED THAT WAY .
RIGHT .
WELL IT S AMAZING JUST BECAUSE OF THE DRAIN .
THAT S BEEN ON YOU KNOW BOTH .
ECONOMIES THAT OUR ECONOMY IS OF COURSE BEEN ABLE TO UH WITHSTAND THAT A LITTLE BETTER .
UHHUH .
BUT UH THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY .
THEY YOU KNOW THEY I DO NT KNOW WHAT .
THE PERCENTAGES ARE BUT I HEARD IT .
ONE TIME IT S JUST SOME UNGODLY NUMBER JUST TO SUPPORT THE MILITARY MACHINE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND FINALLY YOU KNOW WHO KNOWS MAYBE THEY RE FINALLY WAKING UP AND SAYING YOU KNOW WE CA NT AFFORD THIS .
UH THE U S IS NT THE THREAT THAT WE VE ALWAYS MADE THEM OUT TO BE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW EVEN IF THEY RE SAYING THAT BENEATH THE DOORS .
BUT IT S HARD TO THING THAT JUST ONE PERSON CAN BRING THAT MUCH OF A RADICAL CHANGE IN THAT SHORT OF PERIOD .
YEAH .
EVEN IF IT IS YOU KNOW THE BEST THING IN THE LONG RUN IT JUST STEPS ON TOO MANY PEOPLE S TOES .
YEAH .
WHO ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THE WAY .
THE SITUATION IS .
YEAH I I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT .
I D HAVE TO I I GUES I GUESS TO ANSWER THE QUESTION DIRECTLY I M STILL JUST A A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW LEERY OF THE WHOLE THING .
UHHUH .
WHAT .
I HAVE NT SEEN IS THE UH YOU KNOW A GREAT STEPPING BACK IN THE MILITARY .
RIGHT .
SITUATION .
YOU KNOW IT S IT S ONE THING YOU KNOW TO LET US GO AHEAD AND SORT OF DISARM AND YOU KNOW I EVEN HAD A THOUGHT ONCE THAT THE WHOLE IRAQI THING MIGHT HAVE BEEN JUST A A DEAL TO GO AHEAD AND LET US UH YOU KNOW .
EXPEND .
EXPEND SOME SOME MILITARY HARDWARE .
OF COURSE IT DID NT TURN OUT THAT WAY .
UHHUH .
AND UH UH THAT THAT MAY HAVE BEEN A A A KIND OF FAR OUT WAY OF THINKING ABOUT IT .
I DO NT KNOW .
WELL IT S INTERESTING ANYMORE THE WORLD S GETTING SO SMALL THAT IT DOES NT SEEM TO TOLERATE ANYMORE ANY KIND OF THE EXPANSIONISM .
UHHUH .
PHILOSOPHY THAT THAT WAS HERE IN .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW TWENTY YEARS AGO .
UH BUT OF COURSE THE PEOPLE .
WHO HAVE CHALLENGED THAT OR TRIED TO DO ON HAVE COR HAVE NOT BEEN WORLD POWERS .
SO IT S EASIER FOR US TO SAY YOU KNOW TO AN IRAQ YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
UH YOU CA NT DO THIS GET BACK YOU KNOW OR WE RE GOING TO FORCE YOU .
YEAH OR OR WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT .
YEAH .
WHEREAS YOU KNOW IF THE SOVIET UNION WOULD HAVE WHO KNOWS WHAT TAKING OVER MONGOLIA OR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHO IS REALLY WILL WE HAVE BEEN MORE JUST RHETORIC .
UHHUH .
UH RATHER THAN GOING IN THERE OFFICIALLY OR YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
PHYSICALLY AND TRY TO TO REMOVE THEM .
WELL THE THE CHINA SITUATION YOU KNOW THE WHEN IT LOOKED LIKE THAT THING WAS WAS TURNING AROUND AND ALL OF A SUDDEN .
IT WAS LIKE SOMEBODY IN THE IN THE RED SQUARE OR WHEREVER SAID OKAY AND THAT S ENOUGH .
UHHUH .
AND THE TANKS CAME IN AND .
EXACTLY .
YOU KNOW PRETTY MUCH TOOK CARE OF THAT .
AND .
YEAH UH THAT MUMBLEX PERSONALLY I DO NT SEE AS GORBACHEV AS BEING MAYBE A THREAT AND I THINK HE S ACTUALLY HONESTLY TRYING TO DO SOME CHANGE .
UHHUH .
BUT I DO NT BELIEVE THAT HE IN THIS FIRST PASS AROUND YOU KNOW BEING THE FIRST ONE TO REALLY TURN THINGS AROUND OR ATTEMPT TO IS GOING TO BE ALLOWED TO GET AWAY WITH IT EITHER .
YEAH .
WELL THIS WOULD BE LIKE IF SOMEBODY WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND SUDDENLY TOOK OFF TOWARD YOU KNOW JUST SOME PRETTY HARD BY THE SOCIALISM .
UHHUH .
AND UH YOU KNOW THE THE REACTION UH YOU KNOW THE THE ECONOMIC WELL THE UH THE SOCIAL STRUCTURE OF THE SOVIET UNION YOU KNOW IT IT S IT S COMING APART AT THE SEAMS .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND I VE HEARD PEOPLE SAY WELL YOU KNOW IT S JUST LIKE THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR WILL THERE BE A UNION OR NOT .
WELL NO IT S NOT THE SAME SORT OF A THING AT ALL BECAUSE THAT THE WHOLE SOVIET SYSTEM WAS PUT TOGETHER UNDER TOTAL FORCE YOU KNOW THERE WAS NO AS AS WE ARE SEEING NOW WITH A LOT OF THOSE .
RIGHT .
AREAS WANTING OUT OF IT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THEY UH NOBODY .
VO YOU KNOW A LOT MAN THOSE PEOPLE DID NT VOTE TO BECOME PART OF THE SOVIET UNION THEY HAD NO CHOICE .
YEAH THAT WAS ALWAYS KIND OF INTERESTING PEOPLE YOU KNOW A LOT OF MY FRIENDS HAVE A TAKEN US DOWN THE STANCE OF YOU KNOW THESE PEOPLE ARE JUST TRYING TO BE FREE AND TRYING TO GET AWAY AND I M THINKING MORE OF IT FROM A NATIONALISTIC YOU KNOW IF I M A SOVIET AND IF PART OF YOU KNOW SOUTH LET S SAY SOUTH DAKOTA WANTED TO SUCC YOU KNOW SUCCEED AM .
I GOING TO STAND FOR THAT .
YEAH .
NOW I REALIZE THAT THE ORIGINS ARE ARE DIFFERENT AND THAT WE .
ALL JOINED UNDER A COMMON DIRECTION AND A COMMON BOND TO BEGIN WITH .
UHHUH .
AND THAT THEY MAY HAVE BEEN FORCED I M NOT THAT FAMILIAR WITH THEIR FUTURE BUT I YOU KNOW I IT S EASY TO BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE PROBABLY MORE FORCED INTO A PACT THAN UH A VOLUNTEER OR WILLINGNESS TO JOIN .
YEAH .
BUT .
THERE THERE WAS THE WHOLE THING WAS PUT TOGETHER YOU KNOW BY FORCE .
THERE S THERE S NO NO REAL QUESTION ABOUT THAT .
UHHUH .
AND SOME OF THE COUNTRIES .
THAT WERE FORCED IN AT TH LATER DATES IS THE THREE BALTIC COUNTRIES YOU KNOW CAME IN IN THE FORTIES .
UHHUH .
AND UH IT S WELL IT S NOT THAT THEY CAME IN IT S THEY WERE CONQUERED BY THE GERMANS .
AND THEN .
AND THEN THE RUSSIANS EVEN .
JUST NEVER GIVEN BACK .
TOOK IT BACK FROM THE GERMANS AND NEVER BOTHERED TO GIVE IT BACK .
YEP .
YOU KNOW SO .
THAT S A .
WELL THAT WHOLE A .
A LITTLE DIFFERENT SITUATION .
THE WHOLE I IDEA IF YOU LOOK AT THE RUSSIAN HISTORY AND I GUESS ALL COUNTRIES .
THE WAY .
IT USED TO BE IS THE ONLY WAY TO TRULY PROTECT YOUR BORDERS WAS TO HAVE A BUFFER .
UHHUH .
AND THAT WAS THE WHOLE IDEA WHY THEY HAD SO MANY BUFFERS AND MAYBE YOU KNOW MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE SEEING OH COUNTRIES HOPEFULLY ARE SEEING THAT THAT BUFFER IS NT GOING TO HELP YOU YOU CAN WELL I GUESS LIKE .
YEAH .
WITH UH ISRAEL IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE .
THE REASON .
THEY HAVE THE ANGOLAN HEIGHTS AND THE THE UH ALL THEIR BUFFER AREA IS BETWEEN JORDAN AND THE THE SINAI AND AND LEBANON WAS JUST AS A BUFFER BUT YOU KNOW AS YOU CAN SEE WITH THE THE SCUDS GO RIGHT OVER THERE .
UHHUH .
YEAH THEY DO NT REALLY PAY A WHOLE LOT OF ATTENTION TO BUFFERS .
YEAH THERE S THERE S VERY LITTLE THAT THAT BINDS YOU ANYMORE IN TODAY S TECHNOLOGY .
I KNEW A LOT OF GUYS IN THE SERVICE WHEN THEY WERE SENT TO GERMANY THEY SAID THAT S THE SAFEST PLACE IN THE WORLD BECAUSE IF A WAR STARTS ALL THE BOMBS ARE GOING TO GO RIGHT OVER GERMANY AND THEY RE GOING TO LAND IN OTHER PLACES .
YOU KNOW THAT S GOING TO BE THE SAFEST PLACE TO BE .
THAT S PROBABLY VERY TRUE .
VE THAT S VERY INTERESTING NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT .
YEAH WELL UH I I GUESS WHAT .
THEY D HAVE TO DO TO I REALLY DO NT KNOW YOU KNOW IN IN THE IN YOU KNOW I HOPE THAT WHAT S HAPPENING IS EXACTLY THE WAY .
IT APPEARS .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW SOME REASON OR OTHER YOU KNOW IS UH IT S KIND OF A STRANGE THING .
WE VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN FOR SO LONG THAT WHEN IT FINALLY HAPPENS YOU SAY .
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT TO DO .
WHOA WAIT A MINUTE YOU KNOW .
WHAT S UH .
IS IT REAL .
WHAT S WHAT S REALLY HAPPENING HERE .
UHHUH .
BUT YOU WONDER HOW WELL THIS THING W WHO WAS IT .
BORIS YELTSIN THE GUY .
THAT S RUNNING THE UH OR EVIDENTLY WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE SOVIET .
RIGHT .
FOR THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC .
EXACTLY .
WHICH IS I GUESS THE UH THE BIGGEST .
I GET CONFUSED BETWEEN ALL THE WHICH IS THE SOVIET PROVINCES VERSUS WHICH ARE THE THE RUSSIAN PROVINCES .
UHHUH .
VERSUS WHAT ARE .
WELL IN THE CENTER BUT YOU GOT A THE THE GREAT BIG AREA .
THAT S JUST WAS TRADITIONALLY KNOWN AS RUSSIA AND THEN ALL THESE LITTLE NATIONALITY GROUPS .
UHHUH .
AROUND IT YOU KNOW THAT WERE YOU KNOW WAS THERE NINETEEN OF THEM OR OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW AND THESE WERE ALL THE SOVIET ECONOMISTS US .
YOU KNOW THEY HAD SOME REAL FANCY NAMES FOR THEM .
RIGHT .
MATTER OF FACT WHEN THE UH YEAH WHAT .
I READ WHEN THE UH LEE UH UNITED NATIONS WAS SETUP IN IN SAN FRANCISCO ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS .
THE RUSSIANS WANTED TO DO WAS BRING IN EACH ONE OF THE UH OF THESE YOU KNOW REPUBLICS .
OH AS A .
AS A SEPARATE COUNTRY YOU KNOW .
AS A VOTE .
SO THERE WOULD BE THERE WOULD BE NINETEEN .
SURE .
RATHER THAN ONE .
SURE .
AND UH THE UNITED STATES SAID WELL THAT MEAN WE GET TO BRING IN FORTYEIGHT YOU KNOW .
AND UH THAT SORT OF YOU KNOW THEY BACKED DOWN ON THAT .
DIED DOWN ON THAT .
I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING THAT RECENTLY HERE THE WARSAW PACT NO LONGER EXISTS AS A MILITOR MILITARY FORCE BUT IT S MERELY AN ECONOMIC NOW .
YEAH WELL WONDER IF THAT .
WELL I MEAN AT .
WH UH W .
YEAH EXACTLY .
WHAT DO YOU GET SHOT BY SOMETHING .
THAT S CALLED A AN ECONOMIC FORCE OR WHAT IS CALLED A MILITARY PACT YOU KNOW IT S ALL YOU CAN CHANGE THE NAME OF SOMETHING BUT I WONDER IF IT S STILL EXISTS .
UHHUH .
ALTHOUGH I VE SEEN SOME EVIDENCE THAT YOU KNOW THE UH THE RUSSIAN SOLDIERS ARE WELL YOU THE FUNNY THING .
THERE IS THEY RE NOT PARTICULARLY WELCOME BACK HOME BECAUSE THERE S THEY RE HAVING HOUSING SHORTAGES NOW .
WHAT DO YOU DO WITH ALL THESE TROOPS .
THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN CARE OF BY UH BULGARIA AND .
EXACTLY AND AND ALL THE .
AND CZECHOSLOVAKIA AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY RE GOING HOME AND SOMEBODY .
S GOT TO PAY FOR THEIR .
WELL THAT S WHAT .
THEY RE SAYING THE WHOLE PROBLEM YOU KNOW WITH IF WE WERE TO DEMILITARIZE EUROPE WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH ALL THE SOLDIERS OVER THERE .
YEAH .
WELL THAT S NOT .
WHAT S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE ECONOMIES .
THAT ARE NO LONGER HAVE A A MILLION PLUS PEOPLE IN THE INDU YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
IN EACH COUNTRY FROM THE U S .
WELL I PERSONALLY DO NT HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH UH DRUG TESTING EMPLOYEES OR POTENTIAL EMPLOYEES DO YOU .
UM .
I MEAN BASICALLY .
BASICALLY NO UM .
OKAY I DO NT I REALLY CA NT DISAGREE WITH IT .
YEAH I I UH UH THE POLICY THAT T I HAS I THINK IS UH UH VERY FAIR .
UHHUH .
UM I THEY FIRST HAD A POLICY WHERE THEY UH WOULD TEST NEW EMPLOYEES AND THEN SINCE I VE BEEN WITH THEM THE LAST FOUR YEARS UH THERE S BEEN IN THE LAST YEAR YEAR AND A HALF UM THEY RE DOING RANDOM TESTING OF ALL EMPLOYEES .
UHHUH I THINK THAT S REALLY THE ONLY FAIR WAY TO DO IT .
YES .
I REALLY THINK IT OUGHT TO BE S YOU KNOW JUNKINS ALL THE WAY DOWN .
AND IT IS IT AND FR FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND IT IS JERRY JUNKINS ALL THE WAY DOWN .
RIGHT AS A MATTER OF FACT I WANT TO THINK THEY TOOK THE TOP MANAGERS FIRST IS NT THAT A FACT I VE BEEN RETIRED FROM T I ABOUT A YEAR .
UHHUH .
BUT THE PROGRAM YOU KNOW WAS STILL FAIRLY NEW I GUESS IT HAD BEEN GOING ON MAYBE ALMOST A YEAR .
UHHUH .
BEFORE I RETIRED SO I WAS NOT UH EVER CALLED UPON TO DO A DRUG TEST I CERTAINLY WOULD NT OBJECT TO IT AND I THINK RANDOM IS PROBABLY YOU KNOW THE ONLY REALLY FAIR WAY TO DO IT .
YEAH UM I LIKE IT BECAUSE UM YOU KNOW I I I GREW UP IN THE SIXTIES I MEAN .
UHHUH .
I GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL IN SIXTYEIGHT AND .
UHHUH .
AND UH YOU KNOW I I SAW YOU KNOW I KNOW MY FRIENDS WHO WERE YOU KNOW DRUGGIES AND .
UHHUH .
FRIENDS WHO WERE NT AND .
UHHUH .
AND UH YOU KNOW IT S I THINK IT S A REAL PROBLEM .
OH I ABSOLUTELY .
AND I THINK IT AND I THINK IT S CAUSING US A LOT OF TROUBLE AND .
YEAH .
AND A LOT OF PROBLEMS .
UHHUH .
AND SO I M HOPING THAT UH A LOT OF OTHER COMPANIES WILL WILL FOLLOW THE SAME PATH .
I DO NT THINK THEY LL HAVE MUCH CHOICE DO YOU .
UM PROBABLY NOT .
ESPECIALLY IF THEY HAVE ANYTHING DO WITH YOU KNOW GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS OR ANYTHING AS MATTER OF FACT I WANT TO BELIEVE THAT THE UH DEFENSE DEPARTMENT MORE OR LESS MANDATED THAT PEOPLE YOU KNOW WHO WORK ON DEFENSE CONTRACTS YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
S DO SOME SORT OF YOU KNOW DRUG TESTING I THINK THAT S REALLY WHAT MAYBE PROMPTED T I TO DO IT I WAS IN THE UH DEFENSE ELECTRONIC DIVISION WHEN I RETIRED I KNOW IT WAS A YOU KNOW IT WAS A REAL HOT HOT ITEM THERE I THINK I WANT TO THINK MAYBE THEY YOU KNOW REALLY GOT SOME NUDGING FROM YOU KNOW D O D TO DO THIS SORT OF THING .
YEAH I USED TO BE IN D S E G MYSELF .
UHHUH .
UM A P D AS A MATTER OF FACT .
YEAH SO YOU KNE YOU KNOW THE ATMOSPHERE THEN .

THAT S RIGHT .
OR UH WHO MIGHT BE AT A POINT WHERE THEY RE TRYING TO SELL MY KID DRUGS .
THAT S R ABSOLUTELY YEAH I D I JUST CA NT DISAGREE WITH YOU WITH YOU KNOW THE BASIC PREMISE .
YEAH .
IT S TO M AS FAR AS I KNOW IT S YOU KNOW SEEMS TO BE A FAIRLY ACCURATE PROGRAM AS FAR AS UH YOU KNOW THE TESTING GOES AND UH .
AND I LIKE THE IDEA THAT THEY HAVE A UH SYSTEM WHERE THEY ALLOW YOU TO UH BE RETESTED IF FOR .
THAT S RIGHT .
SOME REASON THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM .
THAT S RIGHT .
OR SOMETHING DID SHOW UP .
AND OFFER YOU YOU KNOW HELP IF YOU NEED HELP .
YEAH YEAH .
YEAH I DO TOO .
YEAH RATHER THAN JUST UH .
PUT YOU OUT ON THE STREET YEAH .
PUT YOU OUT ON THE STREET AND LET YOU FEND FOR YOURSELF .
THAT S RIGHT .
THAT S NOT GOING TO HELP ANYBODY GET OVER THE PROBLEM .
NO AB .
I BELIEVE IT IS A A A MEDICAL PROBLEM .
THAT S RIGHT .
UM OF COURSE I ALSO THINK SMOKING IS THE MOST ADDICTIVE THING IN THE WORLD TOO .
OH ABSOLUTELY NOT TO MENTION ALCOHOL .
YEAH SO I MEAN THERE S A LOT OF THINGS OUT THERE AND .
YEP YEP .
THINGS THAT UH I M JUST GLAD THAT THEY UH DECIDED NOT TO UH TAX DRUGS OTHERWISE THEY D BE LEGAL .

OH YEAH UHHUH .
UH THEY WERE REALLY OPPOSED TO IT .
UHHUH .
AND YOU KNOW THERE WAS A FEW OF THEM THAT OBVIOUSLY WERE DOING DRUGS .
UHHUH .
AND THAT S WHY THEY WERE OPPOSED TO IT .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND UH IT RESULTED IN IN A FEW PEOPLE LEAVING .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY JUST FLAT OUT WERE NT GOING TO PUT UP WITH THE POLICY .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THEY HAD A LIFESTYLE AND THEY WERE NT GOING TO CHANGE IT .
YEAH RIGHT .
AND IT S .
YEAH I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WHEN IT FIRST BE OR AT LEAST BEGAN WAS IN THE TALKING STA YOU KNOW EVERYBODY KNEW IT WAS COMING IT JUST A MATTER OF TIME EVERYBODY WAS SCREAMING YOU KNOW INVASION OF PRIVACY AND ALL THIS STUFF BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE I THINK AFTER THEY THOUGHT ABOUT IT FOR AWHILE AND YOU KNOW WEIGHED THE PROS AND CONS DECIDED YOU KNOW IT S REALLY NOT A BAD IDEA UNLESS YOU RE DOING DRUGS OF COURSE .
YEAH I MEAN UH YOU SHOULD HAVE NO OBJECTION TO IT IT S LIKE UH GOING DOWN TO GET YOUR LICENSE AND CHECKING YOUR EYES .

AND DOWN IN SOME OF THOSE LABS AND STUFF .
YEAH ASSEMBLY PEOPLE .
YEAH I DARN IF I D WANT SOMEBODY DOWN THERE THAT I M WORKING WITH SIDE BY SIDE YOU KNOW THAT COULD KILL ME .
THAT S RIGHT .
BY DOING SOMETHING INCORRECTLY BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT EXACTLY ALL THERE BECAUSE THEY WERE ON DRUGS .
THAT S R ABSOLUTELY .
SO THERE S A THERE S A LOT OF SECTORS WHERE I THINK THAT WOULD WOULD HELP OUT AND I THINK IN THE LONG RUN WE ALL BENEFIT .
UHHUH OH ABSOLUTELY YEAH .
I MEAN IF YOU HAVE UH YOU KNOW IF YOU RE NOT WORKING WITH SOMEONE ON DRUGS WELL THEN YOU RE GOING TO HAVE LESS ACCIDENTS .
UHHUH .
AND YOU HAVE LESS ACCIDENTS AND YOU SPEND LESS MONEY ON MEDICAL .
UHHUH .
AND YOU SPEND LESS MONEY ON MEDICAL THEN THE COMPANY S MORE PROFITABLE .
YEAH .
THE COMPANY S MORE PROFITABLE .

WELL IF YOU IMPOSE UH .
UHHUH .
MANDATORY DRUG TESTING WE LL REDUCE YOUR INSURANCE COSTS BY .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW TWENTY PER CENT AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW THE COMPANY S NOT GOING TO REDUCE THE EMPLOYEE S COST OF INSURANCE TWENTY PER CENT THEY RE GOING TO REDUCE THEIR OWN .
NO NO BUT IT LL SAVE IN SOME AREAS YEAH RIGHT .
YEAH AND THAT LL COVER IT AND MAYBE SOME INSURANCE COMPANIES MIGHT START OFFERING IT AS A UH AS PART OF THE PACKAGE .
THAT S RIGHT THAT CERTAINLY COULD HAPPEN THAT S A VERY VER VERY VERY COMPETITIVE BUSINESS .

UHHUH .
AND YOU KNOW HE S EXCELLED AND IT S PAYING OFF FOR HIM IT REALLY IS HE S .
THAT S EXCELLENT .
HE IS PRETTY SMART SOMETIMES HE S A LITTLE BIT SMART MOUTHED .
UHHUH .
BUT HE IS SMART YOU KNOW .
WELL WHAT KID IS NT .
YEAH .
THESE DAYS SO .
BUT I THINK IT S IMPORTANT I THINK IT S REALLY NICE TO KNOW THAT YOU CAN FIND SOMEPLACE I DO NT KNOW YOU KNOW HOW IT IS DOWN THERE IN WACO .
UHHUH .
BUT IN LUBBOCK WE HAVE A FEW THAT YOU CAN SEND YOUR CHILDREN TO AND THEY CAN ACTUALLY LEARN SOMETHING INSTEAD OF JUST BEING BABYSAT AND .
DO THEY HAVE ANY KIND OF PROGRAM LIKE AT T I OR WHEREVER YOUR WIFE WORKS UM .
NO NOT IN .
SOME IN KIND OF DAY CARE .
HUHUH WE JUST .
HUH BECAUSE I KNOW THEY RE THEY RE PUTTING THAT INTO A LOT OF UH CORPORATIONS NOW .
YEAH THEY RE TRYING TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO INTERCEDE ON THAT TOO .
RIGHT .
SO NO WE DO NT GET .
SO MAYBE THAT WILL BE AN OPTION FOR .
WELL IT WOULD BE NICE YOU KNOW THERE .
BUT THEN I I FORESEE THAT BEING JUST A BABYSITTING THING NOT MUCH LEARNING BUT YOU KNOW .
YEAH THERE S NOT WELL .
KIND OF SOMEBODY TO JUST WATCH YOUR KID WHILE YOUR AT WORK .
YOU KNOW WHERE WHERE WE SENT MICHAEL THE FIRST FEW YEARS WAS THERE WAS DIFFERENT TEACHERS ALL THE TIME YOU KNOW SOME .
HUH .
GIRLS WERE THERE IN THE MORNING AND THEN SOME SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS IN THE AFTERNOON .
UHHUH .
AND THEY ACTUALLY TAUGHT HIM SOMETHING INSTEAD OF JUST WATCHING HIM ALL DAY .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW AND THEN MUMBLEX THEY HAD A GROUP OF KIDS AND THEY PUT ON SKITS AND THEY PUT ON PLAYS .
HUH .
AND THEY DID THE HALLOWEEN THING .
UHHUH .
AND THE VALENTINE S DAY THINGS AND IT S YOU KNOW IT WAS IMPORTANT TO US .
HUH .
SO WE YOU KNOW WE TOOK A GOOD LOOK AT IT AND MADE SURE IT WAS GOING TO GO THAT WAY .
DO YOU THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR HIM TO HAVE UM MAYBE ONE CONTINUOUS TEACHER SOMEBODY TO THAT HE COULD UH .
UM .
GET ATTACHED TO OR IS IT BETTER THE OTHER WAY WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT .
NO BECAUSE I THINK YOU KNOW AS A CHILD GROWING UP I THINK IS A TASK THAT BELONGS TO HIS PARENTS .
UHHUH .
I DO NT THINK HE NEEDED TO BE ATTACHED TO TOO EVEN THOUGH HE DID .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW HE ATTACHED HIMSELF TO A COUPLE OF THOSE .
RIGHT .
BUT I THINK HIS ATTACHMENTS AT HOME AND YOU KNOW HE GETS THE IDEA OF WHAT SCHOOL IS FOR AND UH YOU KNOW I HAVE DIFFERENT TEACHERS .
HUH .
HERE AND THIS PERSON CAN TEACH ME ONE THING AND THIS PERSON TEACH TEACH ME ANOTHER AND NO SO I I I REALLY CA NT SAY THAT IT WOULD BE IT S IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO ATTACH HIMSELF TO ANYBODY .
RIGHT HUH .
HE DID WELL .
UHHUH .
YOU WITH WITH ANOTHER CHILD I CA NT SAY THAT .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE I DO NT HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE .
YEAH EACH CHILD IS INDIVIDUAL .
YEAH SEE .
IN LIFE LEARNING AND THINGS .
BUT I DO NT HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE SO I CA NT SAY THAT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW HE DID WELL SO I DO NT THINK WE MADE TOO MANY MISTAKES .
RIGHT WELL IT SOUNDS GOOD .
WE TRIED HARD .
SOUNDS LIKE HE S DOING REAL WELL .
YEAH HE S DOING REAL WELL .
HUH GOOD .
AND HE LEARNED FROM IT SO AND THAT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT WE WANTED WAS FOR HIM TO LEARN NOT JUST TO SIT THERE AND BE BABYSAT ALL DAY YOU KNOW BABYSAT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE WELL YOU RE HERE I GUESS I LL WATCH YOU WHEN I GET TIME .
UHHUH UHHUH UHHUH .
YOU KNOW MAYBE I LL CLEAN MY HOUSE MAYBE I LL COOK YOU LUNCH .
UHHUH .
MAYBE I WO NT YOU KNOW AND .
AND THEY LL PROBABLY SIT HIM IN FRONT OF THE TELEVISION .
YEAH YEAH .
YOU KNOW WHILE THEY DO OTHER THINGS YEAH .
YEAH AND I DO NT YOU KNOW .
HUH .
I DO NT ALLOW THAT WHEN HE S AT HOME SO BUT WE HAD A GOOD EXPERIENCE .
YEAH .
AND WE REALLY DID WELL .
WELL THAT S GOOD THAT S GOOD .
SO AND HE DID HE SERVED BETTER THAN WE DID YOU KNOW HE GAINED HE ACTUALLY GAINED FROM IT YOU KNOW SURE WE GAINED FROM IT .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE WE WERE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE OUR EMPLOYMENT AND .
UHHUH .
CONTINUE OUR FAMILY BUT I THINK IN THE LONG RUN HE GAINED FROM IT JUST BEING SOMEWHERE WHERE WE LEARNED SOMETHING .
THAT S GREAT .
INSTEAD OF JUST SITTING AROUND WATCHING T V .
RIGHT RIGHT .
AND PLAYING ALL DAY AND IT S IMPORTANT .
THAT S PROBABLY WHAT I LL TRY AND LOOK FOR WHENEVER I DO HAVE MY CHILDREN .
YEAH .
I DO NT KNOW WHEN THAT WILL BE .
YEAH .
BUT UM YOU KNOW JUST REALLY LOOK INTO IT WILL IT WILL TAKE ME A LONG TIME TO FIND SOMEWHERE I M SURE .
YEAH WELL .
JUST BECAUSE I I JUST WANT TO BE I WANT TO BE SO POSITIVE THAT YOU KNOW MY CHILDREN ARE OKAY .
YEAH .
AS WELL AS THE OTHER CHILDREN IN THE CENTER YOU KNOW .
WELL YOU KNOW HIS MOM DID NT GO BACK TO WORK UNTIL YOU KNOW WHEN HE WAS SIX MONTHS OLD .
UHHUH .
AND WE JUST DID NT WANT TO DUMP HIM SOMEWHERE .
UHHUH .
AND MAKE HIM FEEL LIKE HE WAS NT WANTED .
EXACTLY .
AND WE WANTED HIS CENTER OF ATTENTION AT HOME BUT .
UHHUH .
WE DID WHAT WE COULD AND IT IT WORKED OUT REAL WELL I M GLAD .
IT S DIFFICULT THESE DAY .
WE WERE SO CAREFUL .
IT S IT S A LOT MORE DIFFICULT THESE DAYS BECAUSE YOU HAVE BOTH PARENTS WORKING A LOT OF TIMES .
OH YEAH YOU KNOW .
AND SO YOU HAVE TO FIND DAY CARE .
WELL IT .
WHEREAS YOU KNOW HERE .
MOST OF THE TIME NOW IT S A NECESSITY .
UHHUH .
YOU CA NT AFFORD .
UHHUH .
SO YOU KNOW I M NOT MAKING SEVENTY OR THIR EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR SO .
UHHUH .
IT S PRETTY TOUGH .
NO CHOICE SO CHILD CARE S A NECESSITY WHEREAS YEARS AGO YOU KNOW THE HUSBAND BASICALLY WORKED AND THE WIFE .
YEAH AND .
BASICALLY STAYED HOME .
MOM MOM WAS ALLOWED TO STAY HOME AND .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THERE WAS A FEW FAMILIES OUTSIDE OF THAT WHERE DAD STAYED HOME AND MOM WORKED BUT NOT VERY MANY THAT I KNOW OF WHEN I WAS GROWING UP .
UHHUH .
AND YOU KNOW I M FORTY NOW BUT YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS A KID MOM WAS ALWAYS AT HOME .
RIGHT .
SO WE DID NT .
I THINK THAT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH JUST JUST ALL CHILDREN HOW THEY LEARN AND THINGS JUST BECAUSE THE BASIC FAMILY IS IS BREAKING YOU KNOW .
YEAH IT IS YEAH IT IS .
THE BASIC FAMILY IS NOT THERE ANYMORE .
I LL AGREE WITH THAT IT IS IT S IT S NOT THERE .
UHHUH I THINK THAT PLAYS A BIG PART IN IN A CHILD S LEARNING AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CAN AND CAN NOT DO IN CHILD CARE .
YEAH .
I DO NT THINK .
OKAY .
OKAY WELL UH ANYWAYS I M NOT EXACTLY SURE I I WAS NT REALLY UH PAYING ATTENTION AS TO WHAT PARTICULAR UH PARTS OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT WE RE SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT BUT IT WAS UH BASICALLY WHAT S YOUR VIEWS ON WHETHER YOU THOUGHT THERE WAS CERTAIN CASES THAT SHOULD BE USED THAT SORT OF THING .
YEAH .
RIGHT AND UH I DO NT KNOW I VE I VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT ANY UH CRIME THAT UH THAT UH INTENTIONALLY WHERE SOMEONE GOES OUT AND PREMEDITATIVELY TAKES ANOTHER LIFE WOULD BE THE ONES WHERE I THINK THAT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO KEEP THAT PERSON FROM PERHAPS UH DOING IT AGAIN AND EVEN MORE SO TO GET PEOPLE ON THE OUTSIDE WHO ARE PROFESSIONALS TO REALIZE THAT YOU KNOW THERE S A A VERY STEEP PENALTY TO UH BE PAID .
UHHUH .
WHEN THAT S DONE AND UH YEAH HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IT .
UH I BELIEVE IN IT TOO .
UHHUH .
I M CATHOLIC AND WE RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BUT UH I FEEL THAT IT LIKE YOU YOU KNOW ON THE PREMEDITATED MURDERS I FEEL IF YOU RE YOU KNOW I MEAN IF IT S BEYOND A DOUBT THAT YOU DID IT YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
I WOULD SAY GO AHEAD AND EXECUTE THAT PERSON AS WELL .
UHHUH .
BUT IT S THE CASES YOU KNOW LIKE SOMETIMES YOU YOU KNOW YOU HEAR OF PEOPLE THAT THEY SAY THEY WENT TO JAIL FALSELY YOU KNOW THEY REALLY DID NT DO IT WELL YOU KNOW YOU YOU GOT YOU GOT THAT POINT WELL H YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IF A MISTAKE IS MADE AND YOU PUT SOMEONE YOU KNOW TO DEATH THAT REALLY DID NT DO IT .
RIGHT EXACTLY .
THERE S ALWAYS THAT CHANCE I DO NT KNOW BUT I WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW FOR THAT MANY PEOPLE TO ALL OF THEM AGREE THAT YOU DID IT AND IT WAS PREMEDITATED IT WOULD BE KIND OF HARD FOR YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW WHAT I M SAYING LIKE .
RIGHT IF IF THE MUMBLEX EVIDENCE WAS NT OVERWHELMING RIGHT .
YEAH .
UHHUH .
SO UH I .
WELL I THINK THAT SHOULD BE LIKEWISE DECIDED BY THE JURY YOU KNOW BECAUSE I DO NT KNOW I THINK A JURY WOULD BE LESS LIKELY TO JUST SEND A MAN TO DEATH JUST FOR ANY REASON .
UHHUH .
I DO NT KNOW A JUDGE MIGHT BE A LITTLE MORE COLDBLOODED ABOUT IT .
EXACTLY UH I M NOT SURE ABOUT PENNSYLVANIA WHETHER WE HAVE IT OR NOT FOR SOME REASON I WAS THINKING THAT WE DO BUT IT S YOU KNOW IT S NOT VERY OFTEN I THINK MAYBE LAST YEAR WAS THE FIRST TIME IN LIKE EIGHTEEN YEARS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT ANYONE .
YEAH I DO NT THINK WE .
ANYONE FROM PENNSYLVANIA HAD GOTTEN IT I DO NT DO YOU KNOW IF VIRGINIA HAS IT .
NO HUHUH NO WE DO NT .
UHHUH .
YEAH .
I KNOW FLORIDA HAS IT .
UHHUH OH YEAH .
THEY RE ALWAYS MUMBLEX IN FLORIDA FLORIDA AND LOUISIANA I THINK AND UH SOME OF THE .
UHHUH .
OTHER SOUTHERN STATES .
YEAH .
COURSE THEY HAVE SUCH A CRIME PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE SUCH A UN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE .
UH YOU KNOW .
GET THAT UNEMPLOYMENT WAY UP SO THEN PEOPLE YOU KNOW TEND TOWARDS CRIME AND THEN THEY THEY START STIFFENING THE PENALTIES .
YEAH BUT IT S FUNNY THAT UH I MEAN LIKE YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID I THINK LAST YEAR WAS THE FIRST TIME IN LIKE EIGHTEEN YEARS FOR PENNSYLVANIA I M NOT EVEN SURE OF THAT BUT FOR SOME REASON I THINK THAT YOU KNOW IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND IT SURPRISED AND EVEN FLORIDA I KNOW THEY HAVE IT AND YOU DO NT REALLY HEAR ABOUT IT REAL OFTEN HOW MANY PEOPLE .
WELL IN FLORIDA SEEMS LIKE UH TWO OR THREE TIMES A YEAR IT S CONSTANTLY ON THE .
YEAH BUT YOU YOU THINK THAT I MEAN IF YOU THINK OF HOW MANY PREMEDITATED MURDERS ARE COMMITTED .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW COMPARED TO THAT AND TO HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE BEING SENT THAT DOES NT SEEM LIKE VERY MANY .
NO THAT S TRUE COURSE THEY HAVE A REQUIREMENT THAT UH THAT EVERY SINGLE APPEAL MUST BE PERMITTED .
YEAH .
SO OF COURSE THE THE ATTORNEYS .
EVERYONE WOULD APPEAL .
TAKE THEM THROUGH THE WHOLE CHAIN .
THAT S TRUE TOO .
YOU KNOW EVEN IF THE CASE IS OPEN AND CLOSED THEY GO ALL THE WAY UP TO THE SUPREME COURT YOU KNOW .
UHHUH UHHUH .
THEY ALMOST ALWAYS GET THROWN RIGHT BACK OUT AGAIN BUT THEY HAVE TO HAVE EVERY SINGLE APPEAL MADE OPEN TO THEM AND YOU KNOW IT S SORT OF STRANGE BECAUSE IT ALMOST IT ALMOST SEEMS LIKE THE ATTORNEYS ARE DOING IT FOR THE MONEY OR SOMETHING BECAUSE I MEAN THE GUY KNOWS THAT WHETHER IT S YOU KNOW A A MONTH OR TWO OR SIX YEARS HE S STILL GOING TO GET YOU KNOW THE CHAIR WHEN IT COMES AROUND .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
SOME OF THESE GUYS ARE REALLY UH YOU KNOW VIOLENT SON OF SAM KILLERS AND STUFF LIKE THAT YOU KNOW .
YEAH UHHUH .
I MEAN THEY .
AND THEN THEY GET OUT .
EVERYONE KNOWS THEY RE GOING GET NOT GOING TO GET OUT .
YEAH THEY GET OUT IN THREE YEARS ON PROBATION .
YEAH .
AND THEY DO IT AGAIN YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
IT S LIKE A SLAP ON THE FINGERS FOR THEM .
UHHUH .
I DO NT I DO NT E E I DO NT I THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE I MEAN IF IT S BEYOND A DOUBT THAT SOMEONE DID PREMEDITATE SOMEONE A MURDER THEN I THINK YOU KNOW THAT THEY SHOULD LIKEWISE YOU KNOW SOMEONE SHOULD TAKE THEIR LIFE ALSO BUT UH BUT ARE ARE YOU WOULD YOU DRAW THE LINE THERE WITH JUST THE PREMEDITATED MURDER .
I THINK SO .
YEAH .
UH A LOT OF THE THE THE OTHER VIOLENT CRIMES I DO NT REALLY FEEL THAT STRONGLY ABOUT ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW STIFFER SENTENCES AND LESSENING THE EFFECTS OF PAROLE .
UHHUH .
I MEAN THESE GUYS ARE CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO UH BE THEY CA NT I MEAN THEY RE GETTING INTO DRUGS AND FIGHTS AND ALL THAT STUFF IN PRISON I DO NT THINK THE PAROLE SYSTEM IS REALLY HELPING THAT MUCH .
YEAH .
REDUCE THE VIOLENCE IN THE PRISONS I THINK THAT S ITS ONLY PURPOSE .
UHHUH .
IS IS YOU KNOW TO REDUCE UH THE VIOLENCE IN THE PRISONS SO PEOPLE BEHAVE THEMSELVES A LITTLE BIT BETTER IF THEY THINK THEY RE GOING TO GET OFF EARLY .
YEAH .
OFF EARLIER BUT SOME OF THESE GUYS JUST DO NT CARE .
YOU KNOW AND SO UH .
I THINK SOME OF THEM WOULD RATHER BE IN JAIL .
YEAH RIGHT UHHUH .
YEAH THEY PROBABLY HAVE IT BETTER IN JAIL THAN WHAT THEY WOULD OUT IN THE STREETS .
UM THAT S POSSIBLE I GUESS .
I DO NT KNOW UH I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY SOMETHING I FORGOT WHAT IT WAS OH I DO NT EVEN REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS NOW .
UM SO WHERE DO YOU LIVE IN PENNSYLVANIA .
IN CLARION WELL I LIVE IN BUTLER BUT I M AT C I M AT COLLEGE I M AT CLARION UNIVERSITY .
OH OKAY I DO NT THINK I REALLY KNOW THAT .
YEAH .
BECAUSE UH YOU KNOW THAT ALL DEPENDS TOO ON WHERE YOU ARE AT THAT S UH SORT OF INTERESTING TO GET OPINIONS AS TO WHERE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY ARE BECAUSE THE MORE GRASS ROOT COUNTRY UH PARTS OF THE COUNTRY TEND TO TO SUPPORT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT WHERE THE PLACES THAT ARE YOU KNOW LESS IN CONTACT WITH CRIME .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THE THE MORE MORE URBAN I MEAN LESS .
SEE YEAH OKAY WELL SEE I M I M IN KIND I M IN KIND OKAY UH WE ONLY HAVE SEVEN THOUSAND STUDENTS IN THE ENTIRE CAMPUS .
UHHUH .
YEAH AND THAT WOULD BE PUSHING IT SO I MEAN THIS IS DEFINITELY A COLLEGE TOWN UH WE RE ABOUT TWO HOURS NORTH OF PITTSBURGH IF THAT WOULD HELP YOU OUT ANY UH .
TWO HOURS WHERE .
NORTH OF PITTSBURGH PENNSYLVANIA .
OH OKAY NEAR POLK .
OH I VE NEVER HEARD OF POLK BUT .
POLK INSTITUTE IT S UH AN OLD UH UNIVERSITY THAT TURNED INTO A PLACE FOR THE MENTALLY RETARDED UH .
OH I NEVER HEARD OF THAT .
VERY OLD UH HISTORICAL PLACE THERE .
IT MIGHT HAVE A NEW NAME .
SHARON PENNSYLVANIA S UP THERE .
YEAH YEAH .
YEAH .
WE RE PROBABLY ABOUT AN HOUR AWAY FROM SHARON .
OH OKAY .
UHHUH UH SO I MOST OF THE KIDS HERE I YOU KNOW LIKE YOU KNOW JUST FROM DORM MATES AND STUFF THEY LL SAY THAT THEY DO NT BELIEVE IN IT BUT THEN AFTER I WOULD SAY MY POINT OF VIEW THEN THEY LL SAY WELL YEAH YOU KNOW DA YOU KNOW .
IN THAT CASE MAYBE YOU KNOW .
YEAH YOU KNOW I THINK PEOPLE CAN BE PERSUADED ONE WAY OR ANOTHER I VE NEVER SERIOUSLY RAN INTO SOMEONE I MEAN LIKE OTHER THAN MY PRIEST YOU KNOW WHO DEFINITELY SAYS YOU CA NT TAKE A YOU KNOW YOU CA NT TAKE ANYONE S LIFE UH ANYONE THAT IS LIKE SO AGAINST IT THAT YOU COULD NT PERSUADE THEM IN ANY INSTANCE .
RIGHT THAT S TRUE YEAH WELL IT IT YOU KNOW YOU GET CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE YOU HEAR ABOUT THESE PEOPLE THAT HAVE YOU KNOW STOLEN KIDS AND YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
DONE TERRIBLE THINGS TO THEM AND KILLED THEM AND YOU KNOW THAT SORT OF THING YOU JUST LIKE I DO NT WANT THAT PERSON SHARING THE EARTH WITH ME YOU KNOW I MEAN THAT IS JUST .
EXAC YEAH .
TERRIBLE .
UHHUH .
AND UH YOU KNOW WE HAD A CASE LIKE THAT HERE AND ON THE OTHER HAND YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT BECAUSE THE HE KNOWS BECAUSE THE CRIMINALS KNOW THAT THE UH PENALTIES CAN BE VERY SEVERE THEY UH THERE S LESS CRIMINALS THAT ARE YOU KNOW TURNING THEMSELVES IN OR YOU KNOW PLEADING OR WHATEVER BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THE JUDGE YOU KNOW IF THEY FIND THEM GUILTY IS YOU KNOW HAS THE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SENTENCE THEM YOU KNOW FOR FOR THE DEATH SENTENCE .
YEAH BUT YOU KNOW I LOOK AT THAT AND SAY WELL THEY SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT BEFOREHAND .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
WELL I M JUST SAYING THAT THAT THAT S WHAT THE THE CLIENT LAWYERS ARE SAYING THEY RE SAYING THAT YOU KNOW YOU KNOW MORE OF MY CLIENTS WOULD HAVE PLEADED GUILTY IF THEY WOULD HAVE GOTTEN A LIGHT SENTENCE INSTEAD OF POSSIBLY HAVING TO TO TO GET A DEATH SENTENCE BECAUSE YOU CA NT PLEA BARGAIN .
UHHUH .
WHAT THE SENTENCE IS GOING TO BE .
UHHUH .
YOU CAN PLEA BARGAIN WHAT YOU RE GUILTY OF BUT YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
BUT NOT HOW THEY RE GOING TO SENTENCE YOU .
THAT S SOMETHING YOU KNOW BUT UH WH WHETHER THEY PLEA BARGAIN OR NOT IF THEY RE GUILTY OF MURDER THEY RE GUILTY OF MURDER YOU KNOW .
RIGHT UHHUH .
SO I DO NT THINK THAT THEY DESERVE ANYTHING LESS .
YEAH RIGHT .
IT S JUST I DO NT I DO NT KNOW I JUST .
UHHUH I WAS JUST SAYING THAT WAY WHAT THEY RE SAYING IS THAT THEY CA NT GET PEOPLE TO TURN THEMSELVES IN THEN AND SO WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH A TRIAL THEN TO PROVE THE PERSON S GUILTY .
UHHUH AND THAT COSTS MONEY YEAH .
AND PERHAPS WE CAN AND PERHAPS WE CA NT AND SO THE GUY MIGHT GET OFF .
UHHUH .
AND UH ALTHOUGH USUALLY THE GUYS THAT ARE TURNING THEMSELVES IN ARE ARE GUYS THAT ARE YOU KNOW GOING TO GET CAUGHT ANYWAYS BUT .
THERE S ALWAYS A FEW OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE YOU KNOW LOST THEIR HEAD OR WHATEVER .
YEAH .
ANYWAYS BUT UH YEAH WE JUST HAD A TERRIBLE CASE IN VIRGINIA WHERE SOME GIRL DISAPPEARED AND AND THE GUY LIKE I SAID HE JUST UH SAID THAT HE TOOK HER BUT HE WO NT ADMIT THAT SHE DIED OR WHATEVER AND HE WO NT SAY WHERE THE BODY IS BECAUSE HE KNOWS THE PENALTY S VERY S S YOU KNOW MANDATORY LIFE SENTENCES FOR MURDER .
ALL RIGHTY UH I GUESS OUR TOPIC TODAY IS AIR POLLUTION AND WE ARE TO JUST DISCUSS WHAT SUBSTANCES DO YOU THINK THAT CONTRIBUTE MOST TO AIR POLLUTION AS WELL AS WHAT SOCIETY CAN DO TO IMPROVE THE AIR QUALITY OF THE ATMOSPHERE AROUND US .
RIGHT .
UM DOES YOUR WORK ENTITLE UH ANYTHING OF ENVIRONMENTAL ALONG THESE LINES .
ME I M IN THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT AND UM WE DO HAVE UH A GROUP OF ATTORNEYS WHO HANDLE OUR ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES .
UHHUH .
AND I DO NT KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT THE AIR POLLUTION THING I DO KNOW FOR OTHER TYPES OF POLLUTION LIKE THE TOXIC WASTE AND SUCH THAT T I HAS TO DISPOSE OF THAT WE NORMALLY PUT IN THE GROUND YOU KNOW WE RE COMING UP WITH A UH A NEW SOLUTION WE HAVE BEEN FINDING A LOT OF TOXIC PLACES TO DUMP AND WE JUST TRANSPORT TO THESE PLACES BUT AFTER AWHILE IT ALWAYS SEEMS THAT THE UM OH THE SITE STARTS TO LEAK AND THEN YOU HAVE TO CLEAN IT UP AND SUCH BUT THE NEW IDEA IS TO TAKE EVERYTHING UP TO SHERMAN AND WE RE GOING HAVE THAT YOU KNOW INCINERATION PLACE UP THERE AND .
RIGHT .
DUMP EVERYTHING THERE AND SUPPOSEDLY THAT FACILITY WILL NOT GENERATE AIR POLLUTANTS FROM WHAT I VE HEARD THAT EVERYTHING WOULD BE IN IN YOU KNOW A CONFINED KIND OF INCINERATOR AND JUST BURN IT ALL UP AND THAT WE WO NT BE POLLUTING THE AIR I M SURE WE HAVE TO HAVE UH PERMITS YOU KNOW FOR THAT PLACE AND THAT THERE S YOU KNOW LIMITS AS TO WHAT WE CAN UH LET YOU KNOW GO INTO THE AIR .
YEAH IT S UH HAV UH UH WELL I WORK IN MUMBLEX I WORK IN ENVIRONMENTALS UH PROJECTS RIGHT NOW .
OH OKAY .
AND SO THE SHERMAN DEAL IS UM UH LOST A LOT OF HAIR OVER THAT PROJECT .
OH .
UH WHAT WE RUN INTO UM IS WE HAVE THE TEXAS AIR CONTROL BOARD T A C B THAT SEND OUT UH JURISDICTIONS UNDER WHICH WE HAVE TO UH UH REPLY TO .
UHHUH .
AND A LOT OF THEIR RULES AND REGULATION ARE NT REAL CLEAR SO WE HAVE OUR MANAGER OF ENVIRONMENTAL WHO ASSIST THE T A C B WHICH IS LOCATED IN AUSTIN IN WRITING AND HEY LOOK WHAT WE VE DONE HERE AT T I .
UHHUH .
AND UH WE ARE PRESENTLY UH IN RECEIPT OF A SITE PERMIT WHICH WILL ALLOW US TO UM UH THIS IS OUR SIDE A .
UHHUH .
ALLOW TO HAVE CERTAIN EMISSIONS UP TO A CERTAIN TONNAGE IT S IN .
OKAY .
IN IN TONS PER YEAR UM AND SO W W YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS SO THAT BASICALLY WE GO AND DO THINGS LIKE PUT IN HIGHTECH SCRUBBER SYSTEMS UH THAT UH SCRUB OUT THE N O X AND UH V O C S AND AND AMMONIA COMPOUNDS UH LIKE ALL THE ACIDS TO A CERTAIN LEVEL WE .
UHHUH .
ARE VERY UM AWARE OF THE OPACITY WHICH IS THE THICKNESS OF A STACK EMISSIONS SO IF YOU DO NT SEE ANYTHING COMING OUT OF A STACK THE OPACITY IS ZERO OR TWENTY OR THEREABOUTS AND SO WHAT WE GO THROUGH IS UH IF YOU SEE IT SMOKING THERE S A PROBLEM AND HAVING WORKED WITH SOME OF THE LEGAL FOLKS VERY CLOSELY UH IT BECOMES A REAL ISSUE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT S SMOKING AND YOU HAVE TO GET IT FIXED EL PRONTO .
UM .
AS YOU KNOW THEY THEY RE ALLOWED TO COME ON SITE THE FEDERALDES ANYTIME THEY WANT DRIVE THROUGH AND SEE AND INSPECT .
UM .
SO IT S A FULL TIME UH EVERYBODY HAS THEIR HOME PHONE NUMBER TYPE OF JOB UM .
NOW IS THAT PLACE BUILT OR YOU RE STILL ON THE MAKINGS OF IT .
THE SHERMAN FACILITY WE ARE STILL IN THE CLOSER TOO BUT STILL HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF UM FINALIZATION TO DO RIGHT IT S BEEN PITCHED TO THE SHERMAN CITY COUNCIL WITH UM .
UHHUH .
OPEN ARMS AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC WE HAD OPEN FORUM AND AND UH UH TOM JONES OUR ENVIRONMENTAL CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL GUYS HANDLE THE PROJECT .
UHHUH .
AND UH ITS REAL UH GOING REAL WELL I THINK IT S MATTER JUST A MATTER OF FUND .
UHHUH .

RIGHT .
IT WAS HUMAN NATURE BUT IT WO NT HAVE CAN ANY UH ANY BAD STUFF SO UH I THINK T I WE SPEND OF ALL THE MAJOR SEMICONDUCTOR FIRMS WE PROBABLY PUT SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ON THE UTMOST FOREMOST UH UH FIRST THING WE ALWAYS LOOK AT AND WE PROBABLY PUT MORE MONEY INTO THE SYSTEMS AND ENGINEERING BEHIND THE SYSTEM OF ANY OTHER FIRM I KNOW OF WE EAT AND SLEEP THE STUFF EVERYTHING WE DO OVER HERE .

RIGHT WHEN I WAS UH YOUNGER WE I LIVED IN THE EAST I M FROM THE EAST REALLY AND IT SEEMED LIKE THERE WERE SEVERAL PEOPLE THAT I KNEW THAT HAD THEIR UH PARENTS I GUESS THEY WOULD BE BUT WELL IN THEIR SEVE LIVING WITH THEM .
UHHUH .

RIGHT .
AND IT S JUST NOT A CUSTOM ANYMORE TO HAVE UH YOU KNOW THE GRANDPARENTS LIVE WITH YOU ANYMORE I GUESS THAT UH .
I THINK .
WELL WE ARE NT GETTING AWAY FROM THAT WHICH IS NOT RIGHT .
RIGHT I THINK IT S NEAT I THINK UH YOU LEARN A LOT FROM THEM .
OH YEAH .
FROM ALL THEIR EXPERIENCES AND AND THAT S ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS TO DO IS SIT AROUND AND LISTEN TO THEIR STORIES .
OH RIGHT RIGHT .
I THINK THAT S NEAT BECAUSE THEY REALLY HAVE A LOT OF GOOD I INSIGHTS .
YEAH .
THAT MY FA MY HUSBAND S FATHER IS REALLY OLD HE HE HAD HIM LATE IN LIFE AND HE S HE LL BE EIGHTY THIS YEAR .
OH .
AND I JUST UH HE LIVES WITH DIFFERENT YOU KNOW PEOPLE IN THE FAMILY HE LL SWITCH FROM TIME TO TIME I JUST .
WELL THAT S NICE IN A LOT OF WAYS .
YEAH I JUST COULD NT IMAGINE LOCKING NOT LOCKING HIM UP BUT PUTTING HIM IN A HOME AND JUST .
BET YOU WERE SURPRISED THAT YOU SAID THAT BY MISTAKE YEAH RIGHT .
LOCK HIM UP .
THAT S WHAT I THINK ABOUT IT FOR ME I THINK WELL MY KIDS BETTER NOT DO THAT TO ME .
I KNOW I KNOW .
I DO NT WANT THAT YOU KNOW SO I I THINK OF IT WELL HOW WOULD I WANT TO BE TREATED .
RIGHT EXACTLY .
RATHER THAN WELL IT S EASY TO SAY OH YEAH LET S PUT THESE OLD FOLKS IN A HOME BUT WHEN I THINK I DO NT WANT TO DO THAT YOU KNOW I DO NT WANT TO BE .
THAT S RIGHT .
I D WANT TO HAVE MY LITTLE HOME I ALWAYS THREATEN MY DAUGHTERS I SAY WELL I M GOING TO BUILD A LITTLE HOUSE BEHIND YOURS .
AND I LL TAKE CARE OF YOUR LAWN HE SAYS BUT I M NOT GOING TO ONE OF THOSE PLACES .
OH YOU RE GOING TO PUT ME AWAY .
RIGHT YEAH .
THAT S WHAT MY MOTHER SHE ALWAYS YOU RE GOING TO LOCK ME UP ONE DAY ARE NT YOU .
I CAN TELL YOU RE GOING TO LOCK ME UP .
THAT S WHAT WE THAT S THE WAY WE CALL IT WHICH IS REALLY WRONG .
I KNOW .
BUT MY WIFE S MOTHER AND THE ONE SHE S IN SAN ANT IT S EVERYTHING BUT THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU VE SEEN I MEAN .
RIGHT .
IT S A LITTLE HOTEL YOU MIGHT SAY .
THAT S GREAT .
AGAIN A SWIMMING POOL AND GROUNDS AND SHE HAS ENOUGH ROOM SHE HAS TWO BEDROOMS AND A AND A .
GOSH .
SEPARATE LIVING AREA THEY DO NT HAVE KITCHENS OR ANYTHING .
RIGHT .
BUT THEY HAVE LITTLE IT S LIKE UH ON EACH FLOOR THEY HAVE A LITTLE KITCHEN AREA .
YES .
WHERE YOU CAN GO DOWN AND HAVE A .
PREPARE YOUR .
MAKE A MEAL YOU KNOW .
WELL THAT S GREAT NOW CAN SHE LEAVE UM ON A DAY BY HERSELF .
OH YEAH IT S IT S IT S NOTHING LIKE THAT IT S LIKE LIVING IN THE HOTEL I MEAN .
OH MAN .
SHE S TOTALLY ON HER OWN .
THAT S NEAT .
UH AND SHE STILL DRIVES WHICH WE DO DOES SCARE US SOME BECAUSE SHE HAS DENTED A FEW THINGS YOU KNOW .
AND WE KEEP THINKING ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE SHE THEY GET LESS ALERT AND THEY DO NT CARE AND I VE SEEN SOME OF THESE ELDERLY PEOPLE ON T V YOU KNOW THE ONES FROM FLORIDA THAT JUST RUN INTO PEOPLE AND THEY DO NT EVEN .
RIGHT .
UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED YOU KNOW .
I KNOW BLESS THEIR HEARTS YOU HATE TO HURT THEM BY DOING THAT THAT S .
I KNOW .
LIKE THEIR ONE LAST THING THAT THEY CAN STILL DO AND YOU TAKE AWAY THAT DRIVING ABILITY AND THAT WOULD REALLY BE HARD WE VE .
I I KNOW GO AHEAD I M SORRY .
WELL WE VE THOUGHT ABOUT DOING THAT FOR MY HUSBAND S FATHER BECAUSE HE .
OH HE STILL DRIVES .
YEAH .
THAT S GRE WELL IT S WONDERFUL IN ONE RESPECT BUT I DO NT KNOW IF YOU CAN AFFORD THE INSURANCE YEAH .
WELL LUCKILY HE DRIVES A BIG OLD TANK .
YEAH .
SO HE I MEAN I DO NT THINK HE HE COULD GET HURT I JUST HOPE TO GOD HE DOES NT EVER HURT ANYONE BUT HE .
RIGHT .
HE HAS NT HAD ANY ACCIDENTS LUCKILY .
THAT S GOOD I MEAN PEOPLE ARE ALL DIFFERENT .
YEAH YEAH .
I I WONDER IF THEY SHOULD GIVE THEM A TEST OR AT LEAST MAYBE NOT TAKE THEIR LICEN MAYBE GIVE THEM A REFRESHER DRIVING COURSE AND JUST TO SEE HOW WELL THEY ARE EVERY FIVE YEARS .
I SAW THAT ON TWENTY TWENTY .
ARE THEY DOING IT .
THEY UM YOU KNOW THEY RE TESTING THAT THEY RE YOU KNOW THINKING OF DOING THAT AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE A GREAT IDEA BECAUSE I THINK THEY DO COME BECOME LESS AWARE AND THEY JUST I DO NT KNOW THEY AND THEY DO NT HEAR AS WELL FOR ONE THING .
YEAH .
AND THAT DOES NT HELP .
WELL EVERYBODY NEEDS RETRAINING IT DOES NT HURT UH .
YOU KNOW THE BEST FOOTBALL PLAYERS AND ALL THE OPERA SINGERS STILL HAVE COACHES AND I DO NT KNOW WHY YOU COULD NT AFTER SIXTYFIVE EVERY FIVE YEARS HAVE A REFRESHER COURSE AND THEN TAKE ANOTHER DRIVING .
RIGHT .
IT WOULD SURE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WOULD WOULD PROBABLY HELP PAY FOR SOME OF THAT YOU KNOW .
AT LEAST THAT WAY THE BURDEN IS NOT ON THE FAMILY OF TAKING THEIR LICENSE OR THEIR CAR AWAY .
RIGHT THERE YOU GO THERE S A GOOD POINT .
IT S ON THE STATE .
VERY GOOD POINT VERY GOOD POINT BUT I THINK THEY MAYBE SHOULD DO THAT AND THEN THE FAMILIES .
SO UH WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT OUR INVOLVEMENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST .
WELL ACTUALLY I THINK IT S GOOD I I I HOPE THAT WE UH UH GET A CHANCE TO UH PROMOTE PEACE OUT THERE UH BECAUSE I THINK WITHOUT PEACE WE RE NOT GOING TO GET STABLE OIL PRICES AND AND UH I D I D REALLY LIKE TO SEE STABILITY IN THAT AREA BECAUSE I M ALWAYS AFRAID THAT S WHERE ANOTHER BIG WAR IS GOING TO START NOT THAT DESERT STORM WAS A SMALL ONE .
YEAH WELL YEAH THAT S PROBABLY TRUE I I SUSPECT THAT IF ANY WORLD WAR IS COMING AT THIS POINT IN TIME THEY RE GOING TO COME FROM THERE UH I WOULD THINK ANYWAY JUST SEEMS TO BE THAT THAT S THE MOST UNSTABLE PART OF THE WORLD AS FAR AS I CAN TELL .
I SAW UM JUST RECENTLY WHERE UH UH THE U S IS SUPPOSEDLY GOING TO BE UH PUTTING PRESSURE ON ALL THE YOU KNOW THE ISRAELIS SUPPOSEDLY TO COME TO A BARGAINING TABLE TO ACTUALLY I HEARD THAT THE ISRAELIS WERE EVEN TALK AT LEAST MENTIONED ABOUT GIVING UP SOME OF THE GOLAN HEIGHTS .
REALLY .
YEAH .
THAT WOULD BE INTERESTING BECAUSE I AM ACTUALLY UM UM I M I M I M JEWISH AND I M ACTUALLY SORT OF NOT NOT NOT REALLY A ZIONIST PER SE YOU KNOW .
OKAY .
BUT I HAVE A UM I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS YOU KNOW WHO ARE SORT OF ADAMANT YOU KNOW ISRAEL IT S HIS RIGHT AND DO WHATEVER THEY WANT AND I THINK THEY VE BEEN SORT OF HARD NOSED ABOUT THE ENTIRE THING AND YOU KNOW IN SOME SENSE M THE MODERATES MAY BE RIGHT THEY MAY YOU KNOW MAY BE BETTER IF THEY GIVE UP JUST A LITTLE BIT TO SETTLE THINGS DOWN .
WELL UH I GUESS IT S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT UH IF IT S GOING TO REALLY PROMOTE A LASTING PEACE IF THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE A PEACE .
RIGHT THEN THEN THEN THEN IS IT WORTH IT AT ALL .
YEAH .
I MEAN I COULD THE WAY I MEAN THE ONLY WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT IS WELL THEY WON YOU KNOW THEY SORT OF TOOK OVER THE UM THEY RE ONE OF THE ONLY COUNTRIES IN HISTORY THAT HAS BEEN TOLD THAT THEY HAVE TO GIVE BACK WHAT THEY TOOK IN A WAR WHICH THEY DID NT START BASICALLY SO .
OH YEAH .
SO I DO NT I DO NT KNOW HOW TO I DO NT I DO NT KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT BUT I THINK THAT THAT YOU KNOW IN GENERAL THE REGION IS REALLY IN BAD SHAPE .
DO YOU THINK THE U S IS GOING TO WIND UP KEEPING UH MILITARY BASES OVER THERE .
UM PROBABLY OH IS NT IS NT THERE A PLAN NOW TO MAKE A COMMAND CENTER THERE OR SOMETHING .
I I HAVE NT HEARD THAT I WATCH C N N EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE BUT I I HAVE NT SPECIFICALLY HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT THAT .
I JUST HEARD SOMETHING ABOUT MOVING RECENTLY ABOUT MOVING UM THERE THERE THERE S SOME CENTRAL COMMAND POST IN TAMPA I THINK THAT THEY NOW WANT TO MOVE TO SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE EAST ACTUALLY THERE WAS UM A SMALL COUNTRY OR SMALL CITY I THINK OR EVEN NOT ACTUALLY IN SAUDI ARABIA OR ANYTHING BUT A LITTLE BIT OFF TO THE UM EAST OF IT I THINK AND I THEY WANT TO KEEP SOMETHING OVER THERE SO THAT THEY DO NT HAVE TO UM I GUESS IT S I GUESS IT S SORT OF SO THEY DO NT HAVE TO MOVE TROOPS OUT SO QUICKLY OR SOMETHING I M NOT QUITE SURE EXACTLY WHY THEY WANT TO DO IT BUT THEY WANT TO KEEP SOME SORT OF CENTRAL COMMAND POST THERE .
WHAT I THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING IS THAT UH APPARENTLY THE FORMAL CEASE FIRE HAS NOT ACTUALLY BEEN SIGNED YET .
THAT S TRUE .
AND UH THEN I GUESS THERE S STILL THE POSSIBILITY THAT UH HOSTILITIES WITH UH U S TROOPS COULD STILL BREAK OUT .
YEAH THAT S THEY CLAIM THAT S WHY WE RE STILL THERE I MEAN YOU KNOW WHY ONLY YOU NOTE IT S ONLY ONLY A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVE ACTUALLY COME BACK YET .
YEAH .
BUT I THINK THAT S ACTUALLY THE SCARIEST PART BECAUSE WHEN IN THE WAY WHAT WHAT S HAPPENING IN IRAQ RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW IN ITSELF IT BEING SO CRAZY THERE I HAVE NO IDEA I MEAN WHAT DO YOU KNOW JUST TO IMAGINE THAT ONE DAY THEY RE JUST GOING TO TURN AROUND AND SOMEONE IS GOING TO SAY WE DO NT LIKE YOU AND START ATTACKING AGAIN AND IT S GOING TO BE WORSE I DO NT KNOW UM .

IT WAS A REAL PRETTY RUG AND I THOUGHT WELL I COULD USE THIS AS A GIFT OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW AND OH IT WAS SO IT WAS BEAUTIFUL BUT I DID NOT REALIZE HOW LONG IT TOOK AND I GOT ABOUT TWO TWOTHIRDS OF IT DONE .

YEAH YOU TOO .
AND I HOPE YOU ENJOY YOUR CAMPING TRIP .
OH THANK YOU AND THANKS FOR CALLING .
UHHUH BYE .
BYEBYE .
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE BENEFITS IN JOBS .
UM I M I M RELATIVELY SATISFIED WITH THE BENEFITS I HAVE I THINK THAT UM OUR HEALTH INSURANCE IS TERRIBLY EXPENSIVE .
UHHUH .
I D RATHER THAT WE GOT A BIT MORE COVERAGE FOR A LOT LESS MONEY BUT UM YOU KNOW THAT S THAT S MY MAJOR COMPLAINTS I GUESS WHAT ABOUT YOU .
YEAH AND A LOT OF TIMES THEY TURN DOWN YOUR CLAIMS SO THAT LEAVES YOU PAYING FOR ALL OF IT .
UHHUH OR OR MAYBE THAT IT S NOT UNDERSTOOD WHAT SHOULD BE COVERED AND WHAT IS NT .
UHHUH YEAH RIGHT THE .
YEAH I .
HEALTH INSURANCE I HAVE IS MET LIFE AND IF IT S THE TYPE THAT IF YOU GO TO A CERTAIN DOCTOR THEN UH YOU JUST PAY TEN DOLLARS AND THEN UH THE INSURANCE PAYS THE REST OF THE BILL OR IF YOU GO OUTSIDE YOU GET UH SEVENTY THIRTY .
I SEE NOW WE I HAVE JUST THE REGULAR INSURANCE SO THAT ANY DOCTOR IS COVERED BUT WHAT I FOUND RECENTLY IS WHAT THEY VE BEEN DOING IS THEY THEY POLL SOMEHOW THE AREA AND THEN THEY HAVE WHAT THEY CONSIDER A JUSTIFIABLE PRICE FOR THE AREA WHERE YOUR DOCTOR IS LOCATED BASED ON ZIP CODE .
UHHUH .
AND SO RECENTLY WHEN WHEN WE HAD A CLAIM UM THEY DID NT PAY THE EIGHTYFIVE PERCENT THEY PAID MUCH LOWER AND WHEN I CALLED THEY SAID OH WELL THAT S BECAUSE YOUR DOCTOR IS CHARGING MUCH MORE THAN THE NORM FOR THE AREA AND I WAS REALLY SURPRISED BECAUSE EITHER THERE ARE NT THAT MANY OF THAT TYPE OF DOCTOR WITHIN THAT ZIP CODE SO THAT YOU KNOW TWO DOCTORS COULD BALANCE EACH OTHER OUT OR THEIR YOU KNOW THEIR STATISTICS ARE NT VERY ACCURATE .
RIGHT AND AND THEY RE PROBABLY DOING IT TO THEIR BENEFIT ANYWAY SO .
YEAH I WOULD ASSUME THAT YOU KNOW WHATEVER DOCTORS ARE WILLING TO DO THE PAPERWORK AND SEND IT IN .
UHHUH .
BUT IT S IT S DIFFICULT WHAT ABOUT OTHER OTHER BENEFITS ARE THERE OTHERS THAT YOU RE DISSATISFIED WITH .
WELL I WORK FOR SEARS AND AND UM THAT S ABOUT THE THE ONLY REAL BENEFIT YOU HAVE IS HEALTH INSURANCE .
WELL YOU HAVE VACATION I MEA .
YEAH YEAH BUT EVERYBODY GETS VACATION I MEAN LIKE UH T I AND SOME OTHER PLACES YOU KNOW THEY HAVE SO RECREATIONAL FACILITIES AND THEY HAVE A DRIVING RANGE AND WEIGHT ROOM AND YOU KNOW I THINK THEY EVEN HAVE A SWIMMING POOL .
HUH .
AND I DO NT KNOW IF THEY HAVE ANY TENNIS COURTS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT .
YEAH I M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT SORT OF THING BUT YOU KNOW TO ME VACATION IS IS AN ISSUE AND I MEAN DIFFERENT PLACES HAVE DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF VACATION I WOULD ASSUME .
RIGHT .
AND UM YOU KNOW THE LENIENCY WITH WHICH THEY LET YOU TAKE LEAVE WITHOUT PAY PERHAPS OR UM I DO NT KNOW I SUPPOSE UM SICK DAYS SOME PLACES COUNT THE NUMBER OF HOURS AND SOME PLACES JUST SORT OF BELIEVE YOU .
UHHUH .
UM OURS IS BASED ON NUMBER OF DAYS AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE TRY TO BUILD THEM UP IN CASE THEY REALLY DO GET SERIOUSLY ILL .
RIGHT .
RIGHT BUT UM OTHERWISE I M NOT AWARE OF ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE BENEFITS AROUND HERE SO MAYBE THAT COVERS THE TOPIC THEN .
YEAH WELL I DO NT KNOW THE WORK THE WORKING CONDITIONS YOU KNOW IF YOU COULD INCLUDE THAT IN BENEFITS SOME PLACES ARE NT VERY SAFE TO WORK .
UHHUH .
AND AND SOME PLACES DO NT COMPENSATE YOU FOR THE HAZARDS THAT YOU THAT YOU HAVE TO WORK UNDER .
UHHUH OR MAYBE A BEN UH NOT REALLY A BENEFIT EITHER BUT WOULD BE THE ALLOWING YOU TO USE THE TELEPHONE FOR PERSONAL CALLS .
RIGHT UHHUH .
UM BUT YOU KNOW I SUPPOSE SOME PLACES ARE ARE MORE STRINGENT ABOUT THAT THAN OTHERS .
YEAH I THINK SO .
AND AND MAYBE ARRIVING LATE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW HOW HOW THEY ENFORCE THE RULES .
UHHUH .
BUT OTHER THAN THAT I DO NT HAVE MUCH FEELING FOR FOR THE BENEFITS SINCE LIKE I SAID UM I DO NT HAVE A BIG PROBLEM WITH WITH THEM .
UM WORK WORKMEN S COMP IS A BIG THING NOW IN IN TEXAS BECAUSE UM UM HOW MUCH IT COSTS THE EMPLOYERS .
UHHUH .
AND A A LOT OF THEM ARE GOING TO THEIR OWN INSURANCE NOW AND IT REDUCES SOME OF THE LENGTH OF THE BENEFITS AND UH AND I DO NT KNOW BESIDES THAT BUT I I NOTICED RIGHT OFF THAT WAS A YEAR LESS THAN WHAT THE STATE WAS ALLOWING .
OH I I DID NT KNOW THAT SOMEBODY COULD AVOID WORKMEN S COMPENSATION .
WELL WELL THEY STILL HAVE TO PAY IT BUT THEY BUY THEIR OWN INSTEAD OF GOING THROUGH THE STATE .
OH I SEE .
SO APPARENTLY IT COSTS LESS THAT WAY .
UHHUH UHHUH I SUPPOSE THAT WHENEVER COMPANIES CAN AVOID UM BENEFITS IT S TO THE TO TO THE BENEFIT OF THE COMPANY .
UHHUH .
AND AT LEAST YOU KNOW FINANCIALLY IN THE SHORT RUN BUT I WOULD THINK THEY WOULD GET A MUCH GREATER TURNOVER AND THAT PEOPLE WOULD BE DISSATISFIED WORKING FOR THEM .
YEAH THAT S WHAT I WHAT I THINK THE THEY SHOULD BE ABLE THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO JUDGE THEIR BENEFITS ON HOW HAPPY THEIR EMPLOYEES ARE AND HOW MUCH PROFIT THEY RE MAKING INSTEAD OF TRYING TO CUT EVERYTHING DOWN AND THEN HAVE EVERYBODY BE UNHAPPY AND AND HAVE A CONSTANT TURNOVER OF PEOPLE .
RIGHT I MEAN SURE THE PAYROLL IS LOWER THAT WAY BUT I WOULD ASSUME THAT THE PRODUCTIVITY IS WAY DOWN ALSO .
YEAH THE PRODUCTIVITY AND THE TRAINING COSTS IF THEY HAVE TO TRAIN THE SAME EMPLOYEE A NEW EMPLOYEE EVERY SIX MONTHS THEN I DO NT SEE HOW THEY CAN SAVE MONEY .
UHHUH UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND ONCE THEY ONCE THEY GET SOMEBODY GOOD THEY OUGHT TO HANG ONTO THEM .
THAT S RIGHT NO I AGREE .
OKAY IT WAS NICE TALKING TO YOU .
WELL THANK YOU FOR CALLING BYEBYE .
YEAH BYEBYE .
BYEBYE .
SO UH WHAT DO YOU THINK .
I THINK WE RE OVERTAXED TO THE HILT .
YEAH .
YEAH I MEAN WE RE WE RE TAXED ON TAXES AND UM UH MOST ALL GOVERNMENT ENTITIES ARE JUST TRYING TO GIVE US A STATE INCOME TAX FOR THOSE WHO DO NT HAVE IT THAT IS I MEAN WE DO NT HAVE ONE YET BUT EVENTUALLY THEY MAY TRY TO PUSH IT THROUGH .
OH REALLY SO THEY HAVE N I DID NT REALIZE THEY HAD NO STATE TAX IN TEXAS .
NO NO STATE INCOME TAX .
OH THAT S GREAT BECAUSE THEY DO NT HAVE IT IN FLORIDA IN NEW YORK THEY HAVE IT .
UHHUH .
I MEAN YOU KNOW LIKE I SAY I M IN NEW YORK AND WE HAVE A STATE TAX AS WELL SO THAT JUST CUTS EVEN MORE .
YEAH I THINK WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IS THEY NEED TO CONTROL THEIR SPENDING HABITS .
RIGHT I I THINK THAT I I MEAN I WOULD NT BE SO UPSET ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF TAXES PAID IF IT WERE NT FOR THE FACT THAT THEY DO NT THEY DO NT GO TO ANY PLACE YOU KNOW Y YOU DO NT SEE IT GOING TO ANY PLACE WHERE IT BELONGS .
RIGHT .
I THINK IF IT WERE TO BE UH IF IT WERE TO BE UM IF IT WERE TO BE HOLD HOLD ON A SECOND PLEASE SOMEONE JUST WALKED IN THE RO .
YEAH .
IF IF IT WERE TO BE SPENT IN THE RIGHT WAY I THINK I WOULD NT BE SO UPSET ABOUT IT BUT GIVEN THAT IT THAT IT S NOT SPENT PROPERLY I THINK IT S A MAJOR PROBLEM .
WELL WE RE REALLY OVERBURDENED FROM FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL .
UHHUH .
THAT IT TAKES SUCH A SIZE OUT OF YOUR PAYCHECK THAT THERE S NOT A WHOLE LOT YOU CAN ALWAYS DO WITH YOUR PAYCHECK .
WELL THAT S CERTAINLY TRUE WELL WHAT IS IT THEY WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT UM SORT OF MIDDLE INCOME YOU KNOW HOW HOW MIDDLE INCOME PEOPLE WHAT WINDS UP HAPPENING IS FOR INSTANCE HAVING KIDS YOU KNOW THEY WIND UP HAVING KIDS AS A DEDUCTION AND AFTER BUT THE DEDUCTION IS SO LITTLE FOR KIDS THAT THEY WIND UP HAVING TO PAY MORE IN TAXES THAN IT COSTS TO RAISE A KID FOR THE YEAR OR SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
I THINK THA SO THEY WANT TO YOU KNOW TRY AN I THINK THEY RE TRYING I THINK THA I THINK THAT MOST OF THE POLITICIANS UNDERSTAND THIS THEY JUST DO NT THEY RE JUST NOT VERY GOOD AT DOING WHAT THEY RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING .
WELL THEY RE KIND OF PUT INTO A TRAP OF BEING OUT THERE TO PLEASE THE SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS AS WELL .
RIGHT .
AND UH I THINK THE ONLY WAY THAT CAN BE CHANGED FOR US TO GET A A BETTER TAX REVENUE THAT S FAIRNESS AND ALL IS FOR US TO LIMIT THEIR TERMS .
UHHUH .
AND BY DOING SO THEY RE NOT OBLIGATED TO ANYBODY .
I AGREE I AGREE .
AND UH I DO NT KNOW HOW WE RE GOING TO DO THAT RIGHT AWAY THOUGH BUT WHAT WHAT IN GENERAL THOUGH THAT TAXES ARE DOING TO US IS IT S JUST TAKING UH A BITE OUT OF OUR SAVINGS .
RIGHT EXACTLY AND THEN AND THEN UH I M I M JUST NOT SURE IF I SEE YOU KNOW IF I SEE IT GOING LIKE I SAY TO THE RIGHT PLACES I MEAN IT D BE IT D BE ONE THING IF IT WERE TAKING A BITE OUT OF YOUR SAVINGS AND THEN YOU WERE GETTING IT ALL BACK WHEN YOU GOT OLDER .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW BUT I M NOT CONVINCED THAT S A THA THAT SOCIAL SECURITY IS DOING AS WELL AS IT SHOULD AND YOU KNOW AND AND AND UH AND AND THAT YOU KNOW THOSE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT FOR WELFARE AND SO FORTH WHO REALLY NEED IT FOR WELFARE NOT THE EIGHTYFIVE TO NINETY PERCENT OF THEM WHO DO NT NEED IT BUT I MEAN THE REAL PEOPLE WHO REALLY NEED IT YOU KNOW SHOULD BE GETTING IT BUT INSTEAD I THINK IT S GOING TO THE WRONG PLACES .
AND I BELIEVE THE SOCIAL SECURITY TAX IS A GREAT MUMBLEX SCHEME .
YOU THINK SO .
YEAH IT S UH YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW THEY RE ROBBING FROM IT TO PAD THE FEDERAL DEFICIT .
I KNOW AND THAT SCARES THE HELL OUT OF ME .
YEAH THA THAT S ILLEGAL SEE IF UH MOST COMPANY UH C E O S WERE TO DO THAT WITHIN THEIR PRIVATE COMPANY THEY D BE IN JAIL .
YEAH .
SO HOW ARE WE LETTING THEM GET AWAY WITH IT .
YEAH I DO NT I DO NT WELL BECAU BECAUSE THEY RE THE ONES WHO MAKE THE LAWS .
RIGHT .
SO WHO S GOING TO YELL AT THEM YOU KNOW IT D BE NICE IF WE SORT OF AS ONE BAND TOGETHER AND AND UH AND AN PERFORMED A CITIZENS ARREST I GUESS .
YEAH .
TO SEE IF WE COULD SORT OF CLEAN THEM UP AND YOU KNOW BUT I DO NT KNOW IF WE CAN DO THAT OR NOT .
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BECOME TOO COMPLACENT AND BELIEVE EVERYTHING IS JUST THE NORM AS TO THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING AND FEEL ABSOLUTELY HELPLESS TO OPPOSE A LOT OF THE SITUATIONS GOING ON .
UHHUH .
IN THE TAXING SYSTEM .
I AGREE I AGREE BUT UM YEAH LIKE LIKE YOU SAID I WONDER YOU KNOW IF IF IT S CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO BE A SLOW CHANGE PROCESS AND I WONDER IF IT LL EVER BE A CHANGE PROCESS .
YEAH .
I SORT OF I SORT OF GET DISCOURAGED WHEN I THINK ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT I THINK ARE WRONG YOU KNOW ALL THOSE THINGS THAT REALLY COULD BE CHANGED THAT ARE NT YOU KNOW THAT THAT ARE NT AND TAX IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT JUST SORT OF SITS WAY UP THERE ON THE LIST .
YEAH UHHUH .
SO I DO NT KNO I I I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT .
WELL THERE S NO QUICK SOLUTION OR NO SURE FIRE EASY ANSWER IT S JUST GOING TO TAKE UH UH REALLY UH UH UH A COMBINATION EFFORT I THINK OF THE MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO COME TO A DECISIVE ANSWER .
OR VOTE TO LIMIT THE WAY IT S SPENT .
YEAH .
SEE WE WE RE WE HAVE NO SAY SO AS TO WHERE THE MONEY GOES IN THE FIRST PLACE .
RIGHT WE DO NT I MEAN THE ONLY SAY SO WE HAVE IS SUPPOSEDLY BY ELECTING PEOPLE WHO WE THINK ARE GOING TO VOTE ONE WAY OF ANOTHER .
RIGHT AND THEY ARE CONTROLLED OR PRETTY MUCH DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO .
RIGHT I VE NEVER QUITE UNDERSTOOD THAT I VE NEVER UH YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH UM I I VE NEVER BEEN UH SORT OF POLITICALLY MINDED BUT IT S NEVER BEEN CLEAR TO ME AS TO SORT OF UM YOU KNOW HOW CONGRESSMEN AN CAN CAN JUST SORT OF GO AHEAD AND VOTE THEIR OWN CONSCIENCE AS THEIR OWN IDEAS WHEN CLEARLY THEIR CONSTITUENCY DOE DOES NT BACK THEM UP ON ANYTHING YOU KNOW AND OFTEN TIMES THAT WILL HAPPEN .
WELL THEY FEEL INVU INVULNERABLE TO UH ANY WRATH OR .
RIGHT .
UH IT S IT S OCCURRED SO MANY TIMES THAT THEY FIGURE PEOPLE WILL USUALLY FORGET AND DO NT THINK ABOUT IT WHEN THE ELECTION TIME ARISES .
RIGHT .
AND GENERALLY IT DOES WORK OUT THAT WAY .
THEY DO FORGET IT S TRUE COUL BECAUSE EVERYBODY THINK OF WHAT HAPPENS IS WHENEVER THE POLITICI WHENEVER TH THE ONE WHO MADE THAT SUPPOSED MISTAKE TURNS AROUND AND UH HIS HIS OR HER OPPONENT CAN SAY WELL LOOK THEY DID THIS AND THEY CAN TURN AROUND AND SAY WELL MY OPPONENT DID THIS .
UHHUH .

UHHUH .
I MEAN HER BONUS IS NT THAT MUCH BUT THEY TAX IT AS I I GUESS THEY TAX IT AS IF THAT WERE HER WEEKLY CHECK OR SOMETHING .

SO .
YES .
IT IT WAS NT UH IT WAS NT CONDITIONS TO BEING OUT IN IT AND I HAD JUST GOTTEN HOME WE HAD A LOT OF TORNADO WARNINGS ALSO AND I HAD GOTTEN HOME SHORTLY BEFORE THAT UH THE RAIN STARTED SO UH I FELT A LITTLE MORE SECURE THAT I WAS AT HOME RATHER THAN HAVING TO BE OUT DRIVING IN IT .
UHHUH WELL UH I HEARD ON THE NEWS THIS MORNING THAT UM ONE OF OUR LOCAL SCHOOLS UH LOST THE ROOF OF THEIR GYMNASIUM .

UMHUM .
THEY THEY HAVE TO GET UH A TRUCK OF SAND AND UH UH FOUR OR FIVE LABORERS UP THERE JUST SPREADING IT BY HAND .
RIGHT WELL UH WELL HERE WHAT THEY DO AND I I CONTEND THAT IT S CERTAINLY NOT THE RIGHT THING TO DO THEY SPREAD SALT AND OF COURSE THE SALT DOES MELT THE ICE BUT THEN WHAT MELTS IMMEDIATELY FREEZES AND BECOMES UH A PERPETUAL PROBLEM .

OKAY .
ARE YOU A T I ER OR .
NO I M NOT .
OH REALLY THAT S GREAT UH MY DAUGHTER TALKED TO A STUDENT UH IN GENERAL MOST OF THEM UH PEOPLE DOING THIS ARE T I ERS BUT I GUESS CUSTOMERS TOO HUH .
AND I THINK A GREAT NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO GOT WORD OF IT AND PARTICIPATED IN GENERAL AND VOICED WHO HEARD ABOUT THE PROGRAM .
YEAH T I S GOT UH A LOT OF ADVANCES IN IT REALLY UH HOPEFULLY THIS WILL TURN OUT TO BE A GOOD PROGRAM FOR US WE SURE NEED UH THE BUSINESS OKAY CURRENT EVENTS UH YOU YOU VE GOT THE QUESTION YOU CAN GO FIRST THERE SINCE I CALLED .
I RELY PRIMARILY ON UH NEWSPAPER COMBINED WITH TELEVISION .
HUH THAT YOU RE THE OPPOSITE OF ME I DRIVE AN HOUR EACH WAY TO WORK AND SO IF I JUST USE TIME AND NOT SAY ONE WHICH QUALITY IS THE BEST I GUESS THAT WOULD BE TWO HOURS ROUGHLY OF TALK SHOWS AND NEWS ON RADIO AND THEN NEWSPAPERS AND T V WOULD BE TIED AFTER THAT BECAUSE MAYBE I LL CATCH THE THE EVENING NEWS LIKE TEN OCLOCK ON T V AND I .
UH .
SO THAT S A HALF AN HOUR ROUGHLY THE SAME WITH NEWSPAPER .
OKAY .
I REALLY OF COURSE YOU YOU RE IN A DIFFERENT PART OF THE COUNTRY I I REALLY LISTEN TO A LOT OF THE TALK SHOWS I DO NT MEAN THE GOSSIP ONES BUT THERE S A LOT OF ON THE WEEKENDS WHEN I DO CHORES OR WHATEVER I M A RADIO HOUND I GUESS I TAKE THE RADIO WITH ME WHEN I M WORKING ON MY CAR THE LAWN OR WHATEVER AND TURN ON THEY HAVE EVERYTHING FROM LAWN WORK LAWYERS NEWS UH VETERINARIANS ALL KINDS OF ITEMS UH SO I M I M A REAL RADIO BUFF ESPECIALLY ON THE W WHEN I M DOING CHORES .
THAT S RATHER INTERESTING .
YEAH I FIND IT SURPRISING BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES IT HERE YOU KNOW I LL TALK TO SOME PEOPLE HERE AND I LL MENTION SOMEONE S SOME TALK HOST AND I LL EXPECT THEM TO HAVE AN OPINION ON WHY I DO NT LIKE HIM AND DO NT LISTEN THEY DO NT EVEN KNOW .
YOU KNOW WHAT THE GUYS NAME IS UH BRUCE WILLIAMS WHO DOES FINANCIAL WORK ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES MOST PEOPLE HAVE NT HEARD OF BRUCE WILLIAMS YOU PROBABLY HAVE NT EITHER UNLESS YOU RE A RADIO BUFF .
I D I D HAVE TO SAY I HAVE NT EITHER .
HE IS IN NEW JERSEY AND IS ENTREPRENEUR AND KIND OF A SELFMADE MILLIONAIRE AND HE HAS IT I WELL IT S FIVE SEVENTY HERE I M TRYING TO IT S ON CLIFF I DO NT KNOW WHAT THE HE S ON ALL STATIONS YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THE NAME BRUCE WILLIAMS AND HE HE IS AGAIN NATIONAL AND TALKS ABOUT A LOT OF FINANCIAL THINGS BUT THE HERE I JUST GET A KICK OUT OF UH WELL WE DO A LOT OF GARDENING HERE SO THERE S WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT GARDENER HERE HAS THREE HOURS ON SUNDAY AND THREE HOURS ON SATURDAY OF COURSE THAT S NOT EXACTLY CURRENT EVENTS BUT I I M I AM KIND OF A RADIO BUFF .
I LISTEN TO THE RADIO UH PROBABLY G FIVE OR SIX HOURS A WEEK BUT ALMOST INEVITABLY TO A STATION THAT IS A CLASSICAL UH STATION HERE MUMBLEX .
FOR MUSIC .
FOR MUSIC PURPOSES WE DO NT USE THE RADIO AS A WAKE UP WE HAVE OUR A TELEVISION CONNECTED TO A UH UH ELECTRONIC ALARM .
YEAH .
UH SYSTEM THAT KICKS IN AND IT COMES ON WITH C N N IN THE MORNING .
OH YEAH THAT S GOOD ACTUALLY .
THAT WE WE WAKE UP TO TELEVISION NEWS AND UH UH SHOWER AND DRESS AND WHATEVER TO THAT AND THEN BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT MY WIFE AND I RIDE TO WORK TOGETHER UH IN A CAR .
OH THAT S GOOD .
WE WE CHAT AT EACH OTHER RATHER THAN THAN SOMETHING ELSE UH AND OCCASIONALLY WHAT WE LL EACH DO DEPENDING ON WHOEVER IS DRIVING IS HAVE THE NEWSPAPER SORT OF ON OUR LAP ON THE WAY IN IN THE CAR SO WE HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING ABLE TO UH READ AND DRIVE ALTHOUGH THERE SEEMS TO BE FROM WHAT I VE SEEN ON THE FREEWAY RECENTLY THAT A FAIR NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE READING AND DRIVING .
MY WIFE ALWAYS WONDERS ABOUT THAT SHE SAYS LOOK AT THAT PERSON HE S DRIVING AND READING AT THE SAME TIME .
SO WE WE RELY PRETTY PRETTY HEAVILY I THINK ON A COMBINATION OF THE OF THE TWO I ALSO UH USE UH NEWSWEEK MAGAZINE UH .
YEAH .
WE TEND TO ALTERNATE BETWEEN NEWSWEEK AND TIME AND WHATEVER HAPPENS TO BE THE .
RIGHT .
THE UH NEWS MAGAZINE OF THE YEAR FOR US .
W WE GET .
AND UH I READ SPORADICALLY OF COMMENTARY AND A COUPLE OF OTHER YOU KNOW TRADE MAGAZINES AND UH UH SUCH AS THAT UH WHERE I MIGHT READ THE THE OCCASIONAL SOCIAL AND EVEN CURRENT EVENT COMMENTARIES AND AND EVERYTHING AS DIVERSE AS A C M TO UH UH SOME OF THE UH SOME OF THE OTHER TABLOIDS I GET SO UH I GUESS I USE ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT WRITTEN IS PROBABLY MY INPUT AND TWENTY PERCENT UH TELEVISION I .
GO AHEAD .
I THINK I RESPECT THE FROM A JOURNALISTIC PERSPECTIVE CURRENT EVENTS I VE ALWAYS SAID THAT IT IT S REALLY NOT INTERESTING UNLESS IT S THREE WEEKS OLD AND FOUND ITS WAY INTO A NEWS WEEKLY HEADLINE .
GOOD POINT THAT S A GOOD POINT .
UH OTHER THAN THAT IT WAS A MUMBLEX AT BEST .
OH YEAH IT COMES AND GOES .
UH WE RE PROBABLY NOT THRILLED WITH OUR ONLY NEWSPAPER THAT WE HAVE IN RALEIGH THERE THERE ARE OTHER UH UH I M NOT SURE WHAT YOU WOULD CALL THEM THEY CO THE SMALL UH COMPETING INDEPENDENT SORT OF NEWSPAPERS LITTLE SMALL WEEKLY THINGS BUT THERE S ONLY ONE DAILY UH CALLED THE NEWS AND OBSERVER FONDLY REFERRED TO HERE BY SOME AS THE UH UH SOMETIMES THE NOISE AND OBSERVER .
YEAH .
UH IT DEPENDS IT IT S HAS DECENT NATIONAL COVERAGE BUT HAS AN EXTREMELY FOCUSED POLITICAL COVERAGE PROBABLY STEEPED IN .
LOCAL YOU MEAN .
THE SOUTHERN HISTORY AND THE FACT THAT THIS IS A DEMOCRATIC STATE AND UH CONSEQUENTLY EVERYTHING IS FILTERED THROUGH THAT UH REPUBLICAN DEMOCRATIC SORT OF .
YEAH .
GLASS ALMOST UNNECESSARILY SO .
YEAH DO NT THEY HAVE CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS AND ALL THAT ARE YOU INTO ANY OF THAT WHAT WHAT S GOING ON IN THE CITY COUNCIL AND THE AND THE SCHOOL BOARDS AND ALL THAT WE HAVE THAT ADDITION TO OUR PAPER .
YEAH WE WE HAVE THAT IS UH AS A MATTER OF FACT THEY UPDATE IT ONCE A WEEK WITH A SPECIAL SECTION WE AND WE PAY IT SORT OF GLANCING NOD WE UH HAVE A VERY GOOD FRIEND WHO IS UH TAPPED INTO THE CITY PLANNING STRUCTURE UH OUR DEVELOPER ARCHITECT FRIEND AND .
OKAY YOU GET IT FROM PEOPLE THEN .
RIGHT SO I THINK WE FIND OUT WHAT S HAPPENING IN THE CITY UH ON A FAIRLY FREQUENT BASIS OVER A OVER A GIN AND TONIC SORT OF THING .
YEAH RIGHT .
UH AND THAT PROBABLY GIVES US A BETTER INSIGHT AS TO THE CITY OF RALEIGH THAN THAN THE PAPER WOULD HAVE ANYWAY .
MY WIFE AND I YOU KNOW AS MENTIONED THE QUESTION WAS UH DO YOU GET IT FROM PEOPLE TOO AND AND I CAN SAY THE SAME THING YOU DO THAT UH MY WIFE IS UH SHE READS THE PAPER FROM FRONT TO BACK AND SO SHE LL TELL ME SOME STUFF AND SHE LL ALWAYS GET MAD AND SAY YOU DID NT READ THE UH WELL I ALWAYS READ THE SPORTS UH WHAT AM I THINKING OF UH THE COMMENTARIES I CA NT EVEN THINK OF WHAT IT IS OFFHAND AND SHE S ALWAYS READING SOMETHING AND SHE SAYS WHY HAVE NT YOU READ THAT AND I SAY I NEVER HAVE TIME TO READ IT LIKE YOU DO BUT I ALWAYS GET A LOT OF MY INFORMATION FROM THE .
UHHUH .
NEWSPAPER THROUGH HER .
UHHUH .
UH SO I GUESS WE DO GET IT FROM PEOPLE TOO OH YOU MENTIONED C N N OF COURSE I MENTIONED RADIO AND THE C N N T V NEWS YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
IT S THE SAME THING THAT S ON THE RADIO WORD FOR WORD .
IS THAT RIGHT I .
YEAH IT .
I LL HEARD THERE WAS SOME STUFF ON THE ON THE RADIO THAT WAS EQUIVALENT TO C N N .
WELL IT IS C N N EXACTLY .
OKAY .
UH BECAUSE UH AND IT BECAUSE UH WE HAVE IT HERE AT WORK AS A MATTER IF FACT AT T I .
OKAY .
WE HAVE IT IN THE BREAK AREA C N N AND BUT THE REASON I SAY THAT IS ON THE RADIO THEY LL SAY AND LOOK AT THIS YOU KNOW AND WHEN I FIRST HEARD C N N IT ONLY STARTED ABOUT UH SINCE THE WAR YOU KNOW OR RIGHT BEFORE THAT AND THEY WOULD ALWAYS SAY AND LOOK AT THIS AND THERE WOULD BE A PAUSE YOU KNOW .
WOULD BE MUSIC AND STUFF AND I REALIZED THAT IT S THE EXACT COMMENTARY THAT YOU HAVE .
OH .
ON THE UH THE NEWS .
THAT DID NT UH .
YEAH YEAH BUT IT S STILL GOOD IT S STILL UH UH YOU KNOW YOU DO NT REALLY MISS ANYTHING .
UHHUH .
BUT I DO DO ENJOY SINCE THE GULF WAR LISTENING TO C N N RADIO TOO AS WELL AS WATCHING C N N ON T V HERE AT WORK I DO NT HAVE C N N AT HOME LET ME TURN THIS MIC RADIO OFF I M ACTUALLY AT WORK RIGHT NOW BELIEVE IT OR NOT UH WHERE WAS I I M GO AHEAD YOUR YOUR TURN .
UH WE PROBABLY WERE LISTENING TO C N N FAIRLY HEAVILY BEFORE THE WAR BROADCASTS BEGAN UH WE ALMOST LIVE AND AND BREATHED IT FOR BECAUSE DURING THE WAR ITSELF TO THE POINT WHERE WE BEGAN TO SORT OF HAVE HOUSEHOLD PACT OF LETS TURN THE WAR OFF AND GET SOMETHING DONE .
YEAH I VE I VE HEARD THAT YEAH .
UH ALMOST AN ADDITION UH AND AND AND WE COULD EQUATE OR RELATE RELAY WELL TO SOME OF THE NEWSPAPER AND TELEVISION ARTICLES ABOUT THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WHERE HAVING THIS PROBLEM IN IN UNHOOKING UNCOUPLING FROM THE EVENTS AND GOING ON WITH THEIR SO .
RIGHT .
INSTEAD OF BEING WATCHING THE MISSILES AND BEING GLUED TO THE TUBE OR WHATEVER UH AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE BEGAN TOWARDS THE MIDDLE AND OF THE WAR I GUESS ABOUT TWO AND A HALF OR THREE WEEKS IN WE BEGAN TO RESTRICT OUR NEWS ALMOST DELIBERATELY WHERE WE WOULD UH WATCH UH FIFTEEN MINUTES BEFORE FIFTEEN MINUTES AFTER SIX OUR TIME WHICH WOULD BE NATIONAL NEWS OR OUR LOCAL NEWS WE WOULD WATCH C N N UNTIL SIX THIRTY THEN WE WOULD WATCH UH A ROTATING NETWORK NEWS OF EITHER UH A B C C B S OR N B C AND WE WE SORT OF JUST ROTATED AROUND THE DIAL EACH NIGHT A DIFFERENT ONE AND .
RIGHT .
WE WOULD WATCH THE FIRST FIFTEEN MINUTES AND THEN WE WOULD TURN THE TELEVISION OFF AND WE WERE SORT OF LIMITING OR DIETING OURSELVES ON ON NEWS THAT WAY AND THEN WE WOULD DO A SIMILAR THING UH AT UH TEN FORTYFIVE BECAUSE UH C N N WOULD BE WRAPPING THEIR HOURLY COVERAGE UP AND THEN WE WOULD GET THE LOCAL COVERAGE UH AND THEN I THINK THE LOCAL COVERAGE WE WOULD TEND TO WATCH THE SAME STATION THAT WOULD WOULD HAVE BETTER STATE COVERAGE RATHER THAN LOCAL COVERAGE UH THREE OF THE NETWORKS HERE ON THEIR LOCAL NEWS UH THAT IF IF YOU WISH TO LISTEN AT ELEVEN OCLOCK YOU CAN FIND OUT WHO RAPED WHO MURDERED WHO OR STOLE WHAT .
OH YEAH .
FROM WHOM AND THAT WAS THE SORT OF THING THAT I WOULD SAY IS THE BEST MUMBLEX AND NOT NEWS .

OH MUMBLEX .
FROM CHAPTER ONE TEA .
OKAY .
TELL ME ABOUT YOUR HOME .
WELL IT S AN OLDER HOME .
IT WAS MADE BACK IN THE EARLY SIXTIES .
IT S A PIER BEAM HOUSE .
HUHUH .
GOT THREE BEDROOMS ONE BATH AND THAT JUST MAKES ME SCREAM .
THAT S PRETTY TOUGH .
WHAT AREA DO YOU LIVE IN .
I LIVE IN HOUSTON .
OH OKAY .
I SEE .
IS THAT PRETTY TYPICAL FOR YOUR AREA .
WELL FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD .
I M IN YEAH .
YEAH .
THIS IS ONE OF THE MORE ESTABLISHED NEIGHBORHOODS .
HUHUH .
THAT SOUNDS REAL INTERESTING .
I LIVE IN A SUBURB OF DALLAS AND UH I LIVE IN THE BASIC THREE BEDROOM TWO BATH HOME .
SO AT LEAST I HAVE TWO BATHROOMS .
THAT S NOT SO BAD BUT UH IT S PRETTY TYPICAL FOR THE AREA AS WELL .
UH I VE ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED IN OLDER HOMES PERSONALLY .
SO I THINK YOU CAN END UP DOING MORE WITH THEM IT SEEMS LIKE .
WHAT ABOUT YARD SPACE .
DO YOU HAVE LOT OF A BIG LOT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT .
THE WHOLE LOT .
I M SITTING ON IS ROUGHLY HALF AN ACRE .
OH I SEE .
ABOUT HALF OF THAT ABOUT A QUARTER ACRE OF THAT I VE GOT A GARDEN .
HUHUH .
OH THAT S NICE .
BECAUSE I HAVE JUST LIKE A VERY SMALL YOU KNOW THOSE BASIC TRACT HOUSES LIKE THAT .
WE HAVE A VERY SMALL YARD AND UM I DO HAVE GARDEN BUT IT S EXTREMELY SMALL BUT UH IT SEEMS LIKE THOUGH FOR YOUR AREA THAT THAT IS SORT OF DIFFERENT .
IN A BIG CITY LIKE THAT MOST HOUSES I WOULD THINK WOULD BE SORT OF LIKE WHAT .
WE LIVE IN .
JUST A .
YOU KNOW BASIC TRACT HOUSE .
WELL IN THE UH NEWER NEIGHBORHOODS AND DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITIES THE HOUSES ARE SO CLOSE TOGETHER .
YEAH .
IF YOUR NEIGHBOR IS HAVING AN ARGUMENT .
YOU CAN HERE IT BLOW FOR BLOW .
THAT S EXACTLY RIGHT .
THAT S THE WAY .
WE ARE .
WE HAVE UH ONE THING .
WE HAVE THAT WE REALLY ENJOY HERE IS WE HAVE A HOT TUB IN THE BACK .
SO WE HAVE WE HAVE QUITE A FEW PARTIES AND UH SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE .
THAT LIVES AROUND US ENDS UP YOU KNOW HEARING EVERY CONVERSATION .
THAT GOES ON OUTSIDE WITH EVERYONE .
SO UH THAT S TRUE THAT IS ONE THING THAT I DO NT ENJOY ABOUT IT IS THE HOUSES ARE TOO CLOSE TOGETHER .
BUT UH YOU KNOW IT S FINE FOR NOW HOPEFULLY EVENTUALLY WE LL MOVE IN A LARGER HOME .
THE ONLY THING THAT I DO NT LIKE ALSO IS THE ROOMS ARE SO SMALL .
YOU KNOW IT S VERY DIFFICULT TO ARRANGE FURNITURE AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO .
ARE YOUR ROOMS IN YOUR HOUSE BIGGER SINCE IT S A SIXTIES HOME .
BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THEN THAT THEY BUILT THE HOMES MUCH LARGER IS THAT TRUE .
YEAH .
AND THEY VE GOT BETTER CLOSET SPACE .
YEAH .
MUMBLEX NEW HOUSES THAT I VE SEEN .
YEAH .
YEAH .
THAT S REALLY IT .
THAT S A PLUS .
AT LEAST WE DO HAVE LIKE THREE WALKIN CLOSETS HERE .
SO THAT S THAT S MAYBE NOT SO TYPICAL BUT UH .
IT HELPS A BUNCH .
YEAH .
IT REALLY DOES EXCEPT WHEN YOU HAVE TO FILL THEM UP AND THEN YOU GET THOSE VISA BILLS IN .
AND .
YEAH .
SO ANYWAY UM ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT THE AREA ABOUT UM YOU KNOW CAN YOU COMPARE YOURSELF TO ANY THING AROUND THERE .
MOST OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD .
I M IN IS PRETTY TYPICAL .
THIS WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS BUILT BETWEEN SIXTY AND SIXTYFIVE .
YEAH .
SO IT S IT S .
EVERYBODY HAS GOT A MUMBLEX PRETTY GOOD SIZE YARD .
YEAH .
I MEAN I GOT PROBABLY THE BIGGEST IF NOT THE BIGGEST YARD I VE GOT PRETTY CLOSE TO IT .
YEAH .
IN THE ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD .
THAT S NICE .
THAT IS NICE .
BUT YOU KNOW TOO THE ONLY BAD THING TOO IS THAT THEN YOU HAVE TO KEEP UP YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO .
WELL I .
THE YARD TO DEAL WITH AND .
I ENJOY THAT THOUGH .
DO YOU .
YOU MUST HAVE MORE TIME THAN THAN I HAVE .
I M SITTING OUT HERE RIGHT NOW .
WE HAD THIS TERRIBLE RAIN AND I M LOOKING AT THE YARD AND SEEING HOW TALL THE GRASS HAS GOTTEN AND IT SEEMS LIKE NOW THAT S THAT S I ALMOST WISH I WAS IN AN APARTMENT OR SOMETHING .
YOU KNOW .
IT .
S RAINED MUMBLEX .
YEAH .
WELL UM I DO NT KNOW DO WE JUST TERMINATE THIS OR DO YOU HAVE TO TALK FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME .
DO YOU KNOW .
NO WE CAN AFTER YOU GO TO SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FIVE AND TEN MINUTES THEY LL GET A LITTLE MASTER RECORDING ON .
OKAY .
THIS .
OKAY .
WELL CAN YOU TELL ME .
ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT THE HOUSE .
ARE YOU WORKING ON IT .
I MEAN DO PEOPLE AROUND THAT AREA SEEM TO DO A LOT OF RENOVATION .
YEAH .
THIS ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD EVERYBODY KEEPS THE PLACES UP REAL NICE .
YEAH .
THAT S THAT S NICE .
YEAH THE TOWN THAT I CAME FROM IS UH IS A UH OLDER TOWN IT LIKE THE TYPICAL THE TYPICAL HOMES .
THERE ARE LIKE YOU KNOW EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS LATE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS .
WOW .
AND I RENOVATED A HOUSE THERE AND THAT WAS SO MUCH FUN .
I MEAN THERE IF YOU DO NT LIVE IN A HOUSE .
THAT S AT LEAST SEVENTYFIVE TO HUNDRED YEARS OLD YOU KNOW YOU RE JUST NOBODY PRACTICALLY .
AND THAT WAS REALLY THAT WAS A GOOD EXPERIENCE FOR ME TO LEARN A LOT OF DISCIPLINE AND UH MUMBLEX WAS CONSIDERED TYPICAL FOR THAT AREA .
SO UH IT WAS QUITE A CHANGE FOR ME TO COME TO A HOUSE LIKE THAT NOW THAT S JUST YOU KNOW A VERY SQUARE LITTLE BOX AND YOU KNOW THERE S NOT A WHOLE LOT .
YOU CAN DO WITH IT .
BUT UH ANYWAY .
LIVING IN THE CITY HAS SOME ADVANTAGES .
YEAH .
THAT S TRUE .
IF GIVEN THE CHOICE I M GETTING OUT .
OH REALLY .
WELL I HAVE LIVED IN A SMALL TOWN FOR YOU KNOW THIS THIS TOWN WAS LIKE LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE AND IT WAS ABOUT SIXTY MILES SOUTH OF DALLAS .
AND YOU KNOW I DID NT MOVE OUT OF THERE UNTIL I WAS YOU KNOW TWENTYSEVEN AND THAT WAS JUST YOU KNOW SO I LOVE THE BIG CITY .
YOU KNOW I HAD LIVED IN A RURAL AREA FOR FOR SO LONG SO I VE ENJOYED IT BUT UH IT CAN IT CAN GET KIND OF TOUGH .
ITS LIKE A RAT RACE SOMETIMES .
THAT S JUST SOMETHING .
I LL NEVER ADAPT TO .
I DO NT I DO NT WANT TO BE A PART OF THE RAT RACE .
I WANT TO BE BASICALLY JUST KIND OF LEFT ALONE .
YEAH .
IF I WANT TO SIT AROUND AND MESS WITH MY GARDEN I LL MESS WITH MY GARDEN .
YEAH .
IF I WANT TO WORK IN THE FLOWER BEDS .
YEAH .
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ENJOY WORKING OUTSIDE AS WELL .
I I .
VERY MUCH .
YEAH .
I REALLY DO ENJOY THAT .
BUT I HAVE NT PLANTED ANYTHING YET OR YOU KNOW I USUALLY HAVE GOTTEN FLOWERS COMING OUT THE GAZOO BUT I I HAVE NT DONE THAT YET .
I VE HAD FINALS .
THIS WEEK .
SO UH .
HUHUH .
YOU KNOW I M JUST KIND OF TRYING TO TRYING TO STICK IN WITH THAT BUT UH SINCE THAT S OVER WITH NOW MAYBE I CAN I CAN GET THIS YARD IN SHAPE .
DO YOU DO A LOT OF GARDENING .
UH LANDSCAPING IS MORE THAN THE GARDENING .
YEAH .
IN THE GARDEN .
I VE GOT MY BEANS PEAS .
YEAH .
I VE GOT SOME ONIONS OUT .
YEAH .
TOMATOES I M NOT REAL SURE WHAT .
THEY RE GOING TO DO THIS YEAR .
I NEVER HAVE MUCH LUCK WITH TOMATOES .
I DO PLANT A LOT OF BEANS BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THE UH BUGS GET ON THEM SO EASILY AND I HAVE A REAL PROBLEM WITH ANYTHING LIKE PESTICIDES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT SO THE ONLY THING THAT I USE IS SOAP .
I WATER YOU KNOW SPRAY THE PLANTS BECAUSE THEY SAY SUPPOSEDLY THAT WILL KEEP THE BUGS OFF THEM .
BUT UH I DO NT HAVE LUCK WITH THAT TOMATO PLANT SO I HATE TO SPRAY THEM WITH ANYTHING .
UM WHAT DO YOU DO .
DO YOU HAVE ANY TIPS YOU COULD GIVE ME .
UM MY FAVORITE .
ONE IS PUTTING ON THE UM TOMATO PLANT IS TO PUT UH MUMBLEX DUST .
YEAH .
YEAH .
AND THAT STUFF HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME .
THAT S TRUE .
THAT S TRUE .
MY DAD IS A FARMER SO I VE HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT THAT FOREVER .
I GUESS IT WORKS BUT UM YOU HAVE TO REALLY WASH YOUR VEGETABLES AFTER THAT SO IT WO NT MAKE YOU SICK .
LET S SEE WHAT ELSE DO YOU DO TO YOUR HOUSE .
WELL I VE DONE SOME REWIRING ON IT .
YEAH .
EVENTUALLY IF WE STAY HERE I M GOING TO HAVE TO REWIRE THE ENTIRE HOUSE .
OH REALLY .
DO YOU PLAN ON LIKE ADDING ANY ROOMS OR YOU HAVE ENOUGH SPACE .
YOU COULD PROBABLY DO THAT .
OR IS IT .
I VE TALKED ABOUT ADDING AT LEAST ONE MORE ROOM AND DEFINITELY ADDING ANOTHER BATH ON .
YEAH .
I WOULD THINK SO IF YOU ONLY HAVE ONE BATHROOM FOR THREE BEDROOMS THAT S TOUGH .
DO YOU NOT LIKE HAVE A HALF BATH .
NOT EVEN A HALF BATH .
YEAH .
YEAH .
THAT S ROUGH .
THE HOUSE THAT I USED TO LIVE IN HAD ONE BATH AND A HALF .
AND THAT WAS EVEN JUST WITH TWO PEOPLE .
THAT WAS A PAIN .
THE ONLY THING .
THAT SAVES IT WITH THE SCHEDULE .
I WORK AND THE SCHEDULE MY WIFE WORKS WE RE GETTING READY TO GO TO WORK AT TOTALLY DIFFERENT TIMES .
THAT S GOOD .
SO THAT .
IT S NOT LIKE WE RE TRIPPING OVER EACH OTHER IN THE MORNING .
REALLY .
THAT COULD ACCOUNT FOR A LOT OF MARITAL PROBLEMS .
I THINK .
YOU GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER VERY WELL IF YOU HAVE TO SHARE A BATHROOM .
IT DOES NT WORK IF YOU RE TRYING TO SHAVE AND SHE S TRYING TO PUT HER EYELINER ON AND .
NO .
YOU RE BOTH FIGHTING OVER THE MIRROR .
THAT S RIGHT .
IT DOES NOT MAKE FOR A HAPPY SITUATION .
THAT S TRUE .
WELL DO YOU HAVE ANY CHILDREN .
I VE GOT ONE .
ONE CHILD .
AND THEY ENJOY WHERE THEY RE LIVING .
WE LL HE S NINE MONTHS OLD .
OH SO HE DOES NT KNOW RIGHT .
I GUESS HE S A BIG HELP OUT IN YOUR GARDEN .
RIGHT .
HE LIKES TO DIG AROUND A LITTLE BIT .
HIS MOTHER COMES IN AND SAYS WHY DID YOU LET HIM PLAY IN THE DIRT .
I GUESS HE S ENJOYING HIMSELF .
THAT S RIGHT .
IT S HEALTHY WHY NOT .
YEAH .
HE WAS EATING THE DIRT I WOULD NT WORRY ABOUT IT .
NO .
IT WO NT HURT THEM .
I WAS A BIG DIRT EATER SUPPOSEDLY WHEN I WAS A CHILD AND I TURNED OUT OKAY .
SO DO NT WORRY ABOUT IT .
JUST LET HIM ENJOY HIMSELF .
SO YOU THINK THAT YOU WANT TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE BIG CITY UH .
WELL THAT S WHAT .
I VE ALWAYS I WAS RAISED UP IN A TOWN .
THAT WAS ABOUT TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE .
YEAH .
SO YOU RE JUST THE OPPOSITE FROM ME .
YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO THAT UH .
AFTER WE GOT MARRIED WE MOVED ENDED UP MOVING TO THE HOUSTON AREA .
YEAH .
YEAH .
SO ARE YOU FROM TEXAS .
YEAH .
YOU ARE .
SO IT S NOT YOU KNOW THAT S TRUE HOUSTON IN ITSELF IS A PRETTY TOUGH PLACE .
OKAY THIS TOPIC IS IS RUSSIA .
A THREAT TO OUR SECURITY .
I THINK THEY ARE MORE OF A THREAT TO THEIR OWN PEOPLE AT THIS DAY AND TIME .
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IT .
WELL THEY DO HAVE UH A MAJOR INTERNAL PROBLEM .
EVERYBODY WANTS TO DEFECT AND I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY .
UM I THINK THEIR BIGGEST PROBLEM IS JUST YOU KNOW OBTAINING FOOD TO LIVE SO WHEN YOU HAVE THE BASIC NEEDS UH .
BEING UNMET I DO NT THINK YOU THINK GLOBALLY AS FAR AS YOU KNOW BEING A THREAT TO OTHER PEOPLE IN THE WORLD .
SO AS SOON AS THEY GET THEIR THEIR OWN HOME COUNTRY TAKEN CARE OF THEN THEY LL CONSIDER .
WHAT .
THEY CAN DO WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD .
I BELIEVE COMMUNISM IS VERY MUCH WANING .
IT .
S UH PRETTY MUCH ON THE WAY OUT OF THE DOOR INSOFAR AS THE STRONG HOLD THAT THEY USED TO HAVE AND THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE ARE ALL REALIZING THAT THE COMMUNIST SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK TO THEIR SATISFACTION OR THEIR WAY OF SURVIVING IN THIS WORLD AND THEIR REBELLIONS RIGHT NOW IS THE RESULT OF THAT .
IF THEY CAN GET THE ARMY .
OR THE MILITARY TO SWAY TO THEIR SIDE I THINK THAT UH IT WILL BE ON THE WAY OUT EVENTUALLY .
IT S JUST A MATTER OF TIME BECAUSE .
IN THE BALTIC STATES THEY HAVE ALREADY MASSACRED SO MANY PEOPLE .
WHO PROTESTED .
AND THAT HAS NT SET TOO WELL WITH THEIR DIPLOMACY FOR THE REGARDING THE UH OUTCOME OF THEIR AFFAIRS .
WHAT S YOUR SYNOPSIS .
WELL I DO I DO REALIZE THAT UH UH THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION IS NT TOO HAPPY WITH WITH HOW THEY RE HANDLING THEIR INTERNAL UH STRIFE YOU KNOW AS FAR AS DIPLOMACY IS CONCERNED .
I THINK IT S BEEN A GOOD A GOOD POSITIVE DIRECTION FOR UH THE SOVIETS AS FAR AS YELTSIN IS CONCERNED .
YOU KNOW HE WAS UH ALLOWED TO WHAT WH IN HIS IN THE CONGRESS THEY THEY GAVE HIM MORE POWER AS FAR AS HIS REPUBLIC IN RUSSIA IS CONCERNED WHICH IS GIVES HIM MORE POWER OVERALL WHICH .
I THINK IS A GOOD SIGN THAT THERE WILL BE SOME YOU KNOW POLITICALLY SPEAKING YOU KNOW HE S GOING TO HAVE MORE POWER AND I THINK IT S A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION .
I THINK GORBACHEV REALIZES THAT HE S GOT A A MAJOR UH UH POWER FIGURE YOU KNOW COMPETING AGAINST HIM AND I THINK IT S GOING TO BE PRETTY CLOSE TO HIS DEMISE IF HE DOES NT FOLLOW SUIT WITH YELTSIN AS FAR AS UH REALIZING WELL HE DOES REALIZE IT YOU KNOW WITH THE FACT THAT THEY REDUCED THE UH OR THEY INCREASED THE PRICES ON THEIR FOOD FOOD AND GOODS .
UHHUH .
UH .
I THINK THAT IT WENT UP A THOUSAND PERCENT ON MOST .
IT YEAH .
THA THAT S INCREDIBLE BUT THEY HAD TO UH GO IN THE DIRECTION OF A MARKET DRIVEN ECONOMY AND AND THEY HAD TO BITE THE BULLET FOR THAT .
SO THAT S A GOOD MOVE ON ON GORBACHEV S PART IN DOING THAT .
UHHUH .
SO .
BUT GORBACHEV HAS STILL NOT FULLY CONVINCED EVERYONE THAT .
HE S MOVING TOWARDS A TWO TO THREE PARTY SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT THAT NOR ELIMINATING OR DIMINISHING THE COMMUNIST POWER AND I GUESS THAT S WHERE YELTSIN STEPS IN SO FAR AS HIS POLITICS OF GOVERNMENT GOES UH BUT I DO NT KNOW HOW CONVINCED THE PEOPLE ARE OF HIM YET MYSELF .
WELL THAT S ALL .
THEY GOT RIGHT NOW .
THAT S THEIR RAY OF HOPE .
UHHUH .
SO YOU KNOW THEY LL GO WITH .
YOU KNOW WHOEVER COMES THROUGH FOR THEM .
I IT IT S JUST THAT .
THE WEIRD THING IS IS THAT GORBACHEV IS THE ONE .
THAT OPENED THE FLOODGATES AS FAR AS WITH GLASNOST AND POISTRO PERESTROIKA AND STUFF AND I THINK HE S GOT BETWEEN THE OLD GUARD AND AND THE NEW UH GLASNOST .
UH I THINK IT S KIND OF ESCALATED TO A POINT WHERE IT S OUT OF CONTROL .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK HE HAD TO PULL IN THE REINS .
THE ONLY WAY .
HE KNEW HOW IN ORDER TO KEEP THE PEACE ON PEACE ON BOTH .
SIDES .
SO I THINK THAT S WHERE YOU KNOW KIND OF WHERE HE S STUCK .
YOU KNOW WHAT .
I M SAYING .
YEAH .
UH I UNDERSTAND .
AND THAT S THE THAT S THE SITUATION THAT HE FINDS HIMSELF IN AND YOU KNOW HE S A TOUGH GUY I MEAN HE S BEEN THROUGH IT .
SO I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT HE LL I MEAN I I THINK OVERALL .
HE S BEEN A A GOOD FIGURE FOR THE SOVIET UNION .
I MEAN I THINK HIS INTENTIONS AND HIS IDEALS ARE ARE UH WELL INTENTIONED .
UHHUH .
AND IN THE LONGTERM BUT I JUST THINK THAT BECAUSE OF THE BASIC NEEDS THAT THE PEOPLE DO NT HAVE I THINK THAT UH MAKES THE PROBLEM MOST SEVERE AND MAKES HIM LOOK LOOK WORSE THAT WHAT .
HIS UM WHAT .
HIS IDEALS ARE .
PERSONALLY .
I AGREE .
WHAT S BAD FOR THE SOVIET SYSTEM IS THAT THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO GROW AND PRODUCE THEIR FOOD BUT SOMEHOW IT JUST DOES NOT GET OUT TO THE MARKET .
THE WAY .
IT SHOULD .
I THINK IT S I THINK IT S A LOT OF UH OH HOW DO YOU PUT IT BUREAUCRACY AND AND UH ONE THING AND THEN ALL THE CORRUPTION .
I THINK THERE S A A LARGE AMOUNT OF CORRUPTION ON THE THE HAVE AND THE HAVENOTS .
YEAH .
THAT S PROBABLY MORE TRUE THAN .
YOU KNOW I .
A LOT OF PEOPLE REALIZE .
I KNOW YOU RE GOING TO HAVE THAT WITH EVERY SOCIETY .
AT LEAST WE RE MORE BLATANT ABOUT IT BUT IT S VERY SECRET AND IT S BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS .
I MEAN YOU CA NT CHANGE THINGS OVERNIGHT .
UHHUH .
AND BUT IF IT GETS TO A POINT WHERE PEOPLE CA NT SURVIVE I MEAN THERE S REVOLUTION .
YOU KNOW AND THAT S .
IT SEEMS TO BE HEADED IN THAT DIRECTION TOO .
YEAH BIG TIME MAJOR BUT YOU KNOW THAT S THAT S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU KNOW THE CORK BLOWS AND YOU CA NT HANDLE IT ANYMORE .
I MEAN THAT S .
UHHUH .
THAT S THE WAY .
THE WORLD UH YOU KNOW REVOLVES THAT WAY .
ANYWAY .
WELL THEIR KNOWLEDGE WITH UH BETTER COMMUNICATION PROCESSES IN THIS WORLD NOW THAT S REACHED THEM IS MORE EDUCATED THAN TO THE UH WAYS OF THE WESTERN WORLD AND UH I THINK THAT WAS A BIG STEPPING STONE FOR THEM TO INITIATE ALL THEIR RIGHTEOUS WAYS OF CHANGING THINGS TOO .
I REALLY QUESTION THOUGH HOW MUCH TECHNOLOGY .
THE AVERAGE SOVIET IS EXPOSED TO .
THEY PROBABLY NOT ENOUGH BUT I M SURE I .
LOT OF IT S FILTERED DOWN ENOUGH TO THE COMMON FOLKS THAT THEY HAVE GOTTEN WIND OF WHAT .
THEY RE MISSING OUT ON .
YEAH I THINK THEY RE STARTING TO REALIZE BUT I I JUST DO NT THINK THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES IF YOU WERE TO COMPARE UH THE AMERICANS TO THE SOVIETS AS FAR AS HOME COMPUTERS ARE CONCERNED OR FACT MACHINES FAX MACHINES AND CELLULAR PHONES AND STATE OF THE ART EQUIPMENT THAT WE ARE SO USED TO .
I DO NT THINK THEY EVEN REALIZE WHAT S OUT THERE AND TO WHAT EXTENT .
YEAH I M SURE A LOT OF THEM ARE MISSING THOSE HOUSEHOLD ITEMS .
YEAH THE MAJOR CONVENIENCES OF LIFE .
YEAH WHAT .
WE CONSIDER JUST I DO NT NORMAL EVERYDAY THINGS TO THEM IS REAL LUXURY .
YEAH .
WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE FOR THEM AND OF COURSE MOST OF US WE DO NT REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT .
WE VE GOT BECAUSE WE VE BEEN SO USED TO IT .
THIS IS TRUE .
THIS IS VERY TRUE .
AND WE IT S HUMAN IT S HUMAN NATURE THOUGH TO TAKE THINGS FOR GRANTED AND IT .
KIND OF .
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU VE LOST SOMETHING OR OR UH UH DO NT HAVE WHAT .
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE THAT S WHEN YOU TEND TO REALIZE YOU KNOW WHAT S OUT THERE AND WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT .
YOU HAVE AND WHAT .
YOU DO NT HAVE .
YEAH I AGREE .
SO THE ORIGINAL QUESTION DO WE THINK THEIR A THREAT TO OUR YOU KNOW A SECURITY THREAT .
YEAH .
UM YES AND NO .
YEAH I CAN GO WITH THAT ANSWER TOO .
THE ONLY YES I COULD GO TO IS IF UH A RENEGADE CREW DECIDES TO LAUNCH AN ATTACK OR AN ACCIDENTAL LAUNCHING OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT TO TO A NUCLEAR EXCHANGE BUT I DO NT EVEN SEE THAT OCCURRING .
UM NO .
UH BECAUSE THEIR INTERNAL STRIFES ARE MORE IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW THAN CONCENTRATING ON ANY KIND OF OUTSIDE AFFAIRS THAT THEY USED TO BE ADAPTED TO I GUESS .
WELL I DO NT REALLY FEEL THAT THE SOVIETS REALLY WANT TO BLOW UP THE WORLD .
I MEAN UM WE PAINTED THEM BACK IN THE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES AS AS NONFEELING MACHINE TYPE PEOPLE AND THEY RE PEOPLE JUST LIKE US .
I MEAN .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THEY GET UP EVERYDAY AND THEY PUT THEIR PANTS ON THE SAME WAY AND THEY HAVE TO EAT AND EVERYTHING ELSE AND I JUST DO NT FEEL THAT .
OKAY UM DO YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE FOR COLLEGE I M I M I M FULL OF ADVICE I M STILL A GRADUATE STUDENT SO .
UHHUH WELL HAVING BEEN THERE NOT TOO LONG AGO AND MY WIFE HAVING ONLY RECENTLY COMPLETED A DOCTORATE .
UM .
I M FAIRLY FULL OF IT OF IT MYSELF .
UH THE MAIN POINT THAT I HAVE ABOUT CHOOSING WHERE YOU WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL IS THAT DEF YOU HAVE TO EARLY ON DEFINE WHAT IT IS YOU WANT TO DO .
YEAH .
OR AT LEAST WHAT AREA YOU WANT TO BE IN UH I HAD THE UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE OF GOING THROUGH SEVERAL SCHOOLS THAT WERE VERY SPECIALIZED I WENT THROUGH A NUMBER OF THEM .
UM .
UH UNDERGRADUATE SCHOOLS BEFORE I FOUND A A GOOD SCHOOL THAT WAS MORE GENERAL UH TO GIVE ME TIME TO MAKE UP MY MIND .
OH THAT S INTERESTING I WENT TO A A LIBERAL ARTS SCHOOL ACTUALLY AT FIRST AND YOU WERE NT REALLY EVEN UM .
THEY DID NT EXPECT YOU TO CHOOSE ANY SORT OF MAJOR OR ANYTHING AT ALL UNTIL YOU WERE IN YOUR SECOND YEAR AND THEN YOU YOU KNOW YOU HAD I THINK YOU HAD TO PICK IT BY BY BY THE END OF THE SECOND YOU HAD TO PICK SOME SORT OF MAJOR BUT UNTIL THEN THEY DID NT SORT OF FORCE YOU THEY THEY SORT OF FORCED YOU TO RUN AROUND TAKING CLASSES IN EVERYTHING UNTIL THEN CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS SO THAT SO THAT YOU HAD TO SORT OF GET A GENERAL FEEL FOR EVERYTHING SO IT WAS NT THAT SPECIALIZED SO THAT .
THAT S WONDERFUL I M A GREAT CO PROPONENT OF LIBERAL ARTS EDUCATION .
YEAH .
FOR ANYBODY .
YEAH .
UH BEING AN ENGINEER NOW I BELIEVE IN IT EVEN MORE STRONGLY THAN I DID BEFORE .
UHHUH I WAS JUST ON A COMMITTEE RECENTLY ACTUALLY SPONSORED BY UH THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE TRYING TO SORT OF YOU KNOW WHERE WHERE THEY WERE JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO FIT SCIENCE AND LIBERAL ARTS TOGETHER YOU KNOW BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE GETTING JUST WONDERFUL SCIENCE EDUCATIONS AND NOT GETTING ENOUGH LIBERAL ARTS AND THEN THE OTHER WAY AROUND AS WELL PEOPLE ARE GETTING PURE TECHNICAL SCIENCE EDUCATIONS AND NOT GETTING VERY GOOD LIBERAL ARTS SORTS OF ISSUES SO .
WELL THUS FAR IT S WORKING TO MY ADVANTAGE UH THE GREAT GAP HISTORICALLY HAS WITH ENGINEERS HAS BEEN WHILE THEY MAY HAVE ALL THIS TECHNICAL INFORMATION THEY HAVE NO WAY OF IMPARTING IT TO EXCEPT TO ANOTHER ENGINEER .
UHHUH .
AND I HAVE THE ABILITY TO LISTEN TO THEM AND THEN TRANSLATE THAT INTO SOMETHING THAT NONENGINEERS CAN UNDERSTAND .
WELL THAT MUST BE HELPFUL .
WELL IT S .
THAT COULD BE VERY HELPFUL .
A LOT OF FUN AT THE MOMENT .
YEAH WELL I FIGURE THAT THAT THAT S PROBABLY THE THING I WOULD MOST TELL ANY PARENT YOU KNOW TO TELL THEIR KIDS I THINK PROBABLY MAKE SURE THE KID GOES TO A SCHOOL WHERE THEY GET SORT OF A GENERAL EDUCATION AND SAVE SPECIALIZATION I GUESS FOR GRADUATE SCHOOL UNLESS THEY RE SURE THEY WANT EARLY ON THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHING LIKE ENGINEERING OR SOMETHING OR THEY CAN .
EVEN AT THAT I HAVE A SON THAT WHO S ONLY NINE AT THE MOMENT BUT I SEE HIM VERY RAPIDLY BECOMING THE ENGINEERING PERSONALITY AND UH IF HE DECIDES TO PURSUE THAT I M GOING TO INSIST THAT HE SPEND TWO YEARS AT A LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGE BEFORE I LL EVEN LET HIM GO TO AN ENGINEERING COLLEGE .
UM .
AND YES THAT LL ADD ONE YEAR TO HIS EDUCATION EXPERIENCE .
YEAH BUT BUT THAT S A GOOD IDEA WELL WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW ACTUALLY I M AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER AND THAT S A PRETTY GOOD ENGINEERING SCHOOL I THINK I THINK WE DO SOME .
YES IT IS .
THEY HAVE PRETTY GOOD ENGINEERING HERE THEY ALSO HAVE PRE A FAIRLY LARGE LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGE AS WELL A SORT OF A SEPARATE YOU KNOW ARTS AND SCIENCES COLLEGE UM AND I BELIEVE THE ENGINEERS ARE SORT OF REQUIRED TO TAKE CLASSES IN IN EVERYTHING AND I KNOW PEOPLE I DO UH I DO WORK IN LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND AND AND AT LEAST ONE PERSON WHO S IN MY FIELD STARTED OFF AS AN ENGINEER STARTED OFF AS AN ELEC ELEC AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER STUDENT AND THEN SWITCHED OVER AT SOME POINT INTO LANGUAGE PROCESSING BECAUSE HE FOUND THAT HE ENJOYED IT MORE SO THEY DO FORCE THEM PEOPLE ARE FORCED TO SORT OF TAKE ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF CLASSES HERE WHICH I THINK IS WONDERFUL .
OH I AGREE UH I HAVE THE EXPERIENCE UH THE LAST SCHOOL THAT I WENT TO WAS MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY .
UHHUH .
WHICH IS HISTORICALLY AN ENGINEERING AND AGRICULTURAL SCHOOL .
RIGHT .
UH THE TYPICAL LAND GRANT UNIVERSITY EVERY STATE S GOT ONE .
UHHUH .
ANYWAY WHILE IT HAS BOTH ENGINEERING AND LIBERAL ARTS THE ENGINEERING STUDENTS TEND TO CLUSTER TOGETHER .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW THEY RE IN CLASSES TOGETHER EVEN WHEN THEY RE OUTSIDE OF THE ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT .
UHHUH .
AND THEY DO NT LEARN THE COMMUNICATIONS THEY DO NT LEARN THE THOUGHT PROCESSES OF OTHER FIELDS OF OF ENDEAVOR .
UM .
IT S YOU KNOW IT THAT S KIND OF LIKE IF I WERE KING FOR A DAY AND GOT TO AND GOT TO MAKE ONE RULE .
MY RULE WOULD BE NO ONE COULD GET OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL WITHOUT AN ENTIRE YEAR OF PHILOSOPHY .
UM UHHUH THAT WOULD .
AND IT S .
BE VERY GOOD ACTUALLY .
THAT S NOT EVEN TRUE IN OUR COLLEGES .
RIGHT YOU YOU DO NT NEED ANY PHILOSOPHY AT ALL IN SCHOOL UHHUH OR SO YEAH OR OR OR OR SOME OTHER THOUGHT PROVOKING AREA YOU KNOW VERY TRUE WE HAD UH WHEN I WENT TO UNDERGRADUATE WE HAD UH WENT TO BRANDEIS DO NT KNOW IF YOU KNOW OF IT OR NOT UH WE HAD UH UH A REQUIREMENT FRESHMAN YEAR OF JUST HUMANITIES THEN YOU WERE GIVEN A CHOICE OF UM YOU KNOW THERE WERE TEN OR TWELVE OR WHATEVER FIFT OR FIFTEEN DIFFERENT COURSES THAT YOU COULD TAKE BUT THEY ALL CENTERED THEY ALL CAME OUT OF PHILOSOPHY ENGLISH AND LITERATURE DEPARTMENTS AND THEY WERE THEY WERE THEY WERE A SET OF ASSIGNED READINGS EVERYBODY HAD TO READ YOU KNOW FOR SO THE FIRST YEAR HUMANITIES COURSES EVERYONE HAD TO READ THE ILIAD AN AND SO FORTH .
RIGHT .
AND WHAT THEY DID DO WAS THEY ALL APPROACHED IT FROM FROM VERY DIFFERENT SO THAT YOU COULD HAVE ONE CLASS IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF SOMETHING THAT THE PHILOSOPHY OF GREEK MYTHOLOGY OR SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY APPROACHED THIS OR UM ONE LITERATURE YOU KNOW OR A A LITERATURE COURSE OR JUST ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON IT AND PEOPLE GOT TO CHOO PICK AND CHOOSE BUT BUT BY THE END EVERYONE HAD A GOOD SAMPLE OF OF OF SORT OF HOW TO THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS NONSCIENTIFICALLY YOU KNOW AND UH AND THAT SORT OF FORCED THEM BUT I BELIEVE THAT THAT THAT YOU ONE OF THE ONE OF THE BEST THINGS TO DO AT LEAST FOR ME IN SCHOOL WAS WAS I WAS SORT OF FORCED TO TAKE LOTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF COURSES UM I WAS FORCED TO TAKE I THINK YOU KNOW SOME SORT OF ART HISTORY COURSE AND WE ALL GRUMBLED ABOUT IT AT FIRST BUT THEN AFTERWARD WE ALL WOUND UP TAKING EXTRA ART HISTORY CLASSES BECAUSE IT JUST SEEMED LIKE SOMETHING SOMETHING WE DID NT TOTALLY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT BUT JUST ENJOYED VERY MUCH DOING .
YES I RE .
AND SOMETHING I WOULD NEVER WOULD HAVE DONE IF IF I WAS NT FORCED TO TAKE IT .
I REMEMBER THAT EXPERIENCE .
UHHUH .
THAT AND UH EXTRA MUSIC CLASSES .
YES UHHUH AND THAT AND THAT REALLY IS SOMETHING THAT THAT I NOTICE LIKE I TALK TO A LOT OF MY FRIENDS AT SCHOOL THAT ARE MORE SPECIALIZED AND THEY DO NT HAVE THAT THEY JUST YOU KNOW THEY WENT IN AND TOOK THEIR COURSES THAT THEY WERE EXPECTED TO TAKE AND THAT WAS ALL THEY NEVER HAD SOME OF THE MORE FUN CLASSES I GUESS MUMBLEX I FEEL A LITTLE MORE WORLDLY NOW .
WELL THAT WILL CONTINUE TO GROW EVEN AS YOU GO BEYOND GRADUATE SCHOOL .
YES I M I M I M HOPING I M HOPING .
HAVE HAVE YOU GONE STRAIGHT THROUGH .
YES I I GRADUATED UM COLLEGE IN EIGHTYSEVEN AND I JUST WENT STRAIGHT THROUGH UM I M FINISHING UP NEXT YEAR SO YEAH I DID NT TAKE ANY BREAK OR ANYTHING YET I VE BEEN TRYING ACTUALLY IN GRADUATE SCHOOL I VE BEEN TRYING TO DO THE SAME THING TAKE COURSES OUT COMPLETELY OUTSIDE MY AREA AND I M FINDING IN GRADUATE SCHOOL IT S A LOT HARDER BECAUSE UH I JUST DO NT HAVE THE TIME ANY MORE TO SORT OF SIT IN A COURSE THAT I M NOT GETTING GRADED FOR WHEREAS BEFORE I WOULD JUST SIGN UP FOR CREDIT FOR IT NOW I CA NT SIGN UP FOR AN ART HISTORY COURSE FOR CREDIT NECESSARILY SO I HAVE TO TRY AND GO MYSELF AND I WENT FOR LIKE TWO OR THREE WEEKS AND REALIZED NOT ENOUGH TIME FOR THE WORK UNFORTUNATELY .
THAT S TRUE ARE YOU PURSUING A MASTER S OR A DOCTORATE .
I M PURSUING A DOCTORATE IN PSYCHOLOGY SO I M JUST WIND UP SPENDING A LOT OF TIME DOING THAT INSTEAD UH WHAT ELSE I I THINK I .
WELL LET ME LET ME ENCOURAGE YOU TO STOP AND EXPERIENCE LIFE ALONG THE WAY .
OH .
I I FIRST ENROLLED IN COLLEGE IN NINETEEN SIXTYSIX .
UHHUH .
UH SIX YEARS AND A AND A WAR LATER UH I GOT A DEGREE AN UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE AND THEN FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER THAT I GOT THE FIRST OF A SET OF MASTER S DEGREES AND FOUR YEARS AFTER THAT I GOT ANOTHER MASTER S DEGREE .
UM YOU HAD REAL WORLD EXPERIENCE IN THE MIDDLE THERE .
OH YES .
AND THAT HELPED YOU THINK OR THAT WAS .
IT IT CERTAINLY MAKES ACCEPTANCE OF DIFFERENT IDEAS A LOT EASIER .
UHHUH UM YEAH I M GETTING SOME OF THAT UM I HAVE I HAVE SORT OF SOME .
WORK EXPERIENCE MUMBLEX MY WIFE IS NOT AN ACADEMIC AT ALL MY WIFE IS SORT OF IN THE REAL WORLD AND SO I SORT OF HINGE HALFWAY OUT IN THE REAL WORLD AND I GETTING YOU KNOW REAL WORLD MUMBLEX ESPECIALLY SHE WORKS IN UH UH SHE WORKS IN THE SHE WORKS FOR A TEMPORARY AGENCY AC AND I NEVER WOULD HAVE HAD SHE S THE OFFICE SUPERVISOR I NEVER WOULD HAVE HAD ANY I VE I VE LEARNED MUCH JUST SORT OF BY WATCHING HER AND HER AND HER BUSINESS AS WELL SO YEAH SO I I CAN I CAN SEE WHERE THAT MIGHT BE A .

IT CERTAINLY MEANS THAT WE DO NT HAVE TO EXPERIENCE EVERYTHING BUT EXPERIENCE IS A WONDERFUL .
THAT S MY OH YEAH .

ALL RIGHT .
WHAT WHAT CHANGES DO YOU THINK HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THE LAST GENERATION .
I GUESS THE BIGGEST ONE IS NUMBER OF WOMEN IN THE WORK FORCE .
YEAH .
FEW ARE UH BASICALLY STAYING HOME AND BEING HOMEMAKERS AND RAISING KIDS EXCLUSIVELY .
UHHUH .
YEAH I I I GREW UP IN UH SIXTIES AND EARLY SEVENTIES AND UH MY MOM DID NT WORK AT ALL WHEN I WAS GROWING UP .
SHE DID NT START WORKING UNTIL I WAS UM WELL INTO HIGH SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
SO I I HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING A MOM AT HOME .
THAT NOWADAYS KIDS IT S A LUXURY ITEM FOR MOTHERS TO BE HOME WITH THEIR KIDS .
YEAH TRUE .
WELL MINE TAUGHT KINDERGARTEN BUT SHE WAS ALWAYS UH I GUESS HER SCHEDULE WAS SHORTER SO SHE WAS ALWAYS UH .
ALWAYS HOME BY THE TIME .
YOU GOT HOME .
HOME YEAH .
YEAH THAT THAT STATISTIC .
I GUESS HAS BEEN GROWING EVERY YEAR .
IT .
S LIKE SOMETHING AROUND SIXTY SIXTYFIVE PERCENT OR SO NOW .
UHHUH .
UH I M NOT SURE WHAT .
THE FUTURE HOLDS FOR THAT WHETHER .
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE S IT SEEMS THAT THERE S A GRASS ROOTS UM EFFORT OR WHATEVER GOING ON I I UM CLEAN HOUSES PARTTIME .
UHHUH .
AND ALMOST ALL THE PEOPLE THAT I CLEAN FOR BELIEVE IT OR NOT ARE MOTHERS .
THAT DO NT WORK .
HUH .
UM .
THAT S UNUSUAL .
THEY ARE TH THEY RE ALL UM IT S AND IT S I THINK IT S KIND OF A NEW MOVEMENT .
IT S GOING BACK TOWARDS YOU KNOW WOMEN HAVE COME INTO THE WORK FORCE IN THE LAST TWENTY THIRTY YEARS AND NOW THEY RE WANTING TO GO BACK TO THE OLD DAYS WHERE YOU KNOW WOMEN STAYED HOME WITH THE KIDS YOU KNOW AND TRY TO GIVE THE KIDS QUALITY TIME .
UHHUH .
AND I I THINK THAT IN THE FUTURE .
YOU RE I THINK YOU RE GOING TO SEE A LOT MORE UM WOMEN CHOOSING TO NOT WORK AFTER THEY HAVE A BABY .
YEAH .
UM I THINK WITH UH THE UH THE WORK FORCE WITH THE THE SALARIES THAT A LOT OF A LOT OF THE WOMEN THAT I WORK FOR HAVE HUSBANDS .
WHO ARE UM VICEPRESIDENTS OF COMPANIES AND I THINK WITH UH UM THIS IT SEEMS LIKE IT S MORE THE UPPERCLASS PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
UM I DO NT SEE IT AS MUCH THE LIKE IN MY SITUATION WHERE I DO NT I DO NT HAVE CHILDREN YET BUT IDEALLY I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO STAY HOME WITH MY KIDS .
BUT REALISTICALLY THAT S I M I M REALIZING THAT S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE POSSIBLE UM FOR MIDDLECLASS PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO LIVE JUST ON ONE INCOME .
YEAH THAT IS TOUGH .
YEAH WE RE LOOKING AT THAT NOW MY WIFE S ABOUT SIX MONTHS ALONG .
UHHUH .
I THINK IT S GOING TO BE A LUXURY ITEM TO BE ABLE TO STAY HOME WITH YOUR KIDS .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW IT S GOING TO KIND OF KIND OF GO ALONG WITH THE B M W IN THE DRIVEWAY AND OR IN THE GARAGE OR WHATEVER .
TRUE .
UM AND THE QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLAR HOME OR WHATEVER .
YEAH .
I M SURPRISED THAT THE MAIN PEOPLE YOU WORK FOR ARE WOMEN .
THAT DO STAY HOME .
I WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE WOMEN .
THAT WERE WORKING FULLTIME .
YEAH BELIEVE IT OR NOT THOUGH THE ALL THE WOMEN .
THAT STAY HOME ARE REAL BUSY WHEN THEY ARE HOME .
HUH .
UM THEY RE REAL ACTIVE IN VOLUNTEER WORK .
UHHUH .
UM ONE OF THE WOMEN IS REAL ACTIVE WITH UH MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY .
AND UH DOES A LOT OF OF WORK WITH THEM ON A VOLUNTEER BASIS BUT IT S STILL IT S ALMOST LIKE A JOB SHE JUST DOES NT GET PAID FOR IT .
HUH .
WELL I GUESS THAT S GOOD THAT THEY THEY VE GOT SOMETHING TO KEEP THEM ACTIVE .
YEAH .
WHEN WHEN YOUR WIFE HAS HER BABY IS SHE GOING TO STAY HOME OR IS SHE GOING TO .
YEAH WE RE .
GO BACK TO WORK .
WE RE GOING TO TRY AND HAVE HER STAY HOME FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE .
WHAT DO YOU THINK .
THAT THAT THAT I WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT .
YEAH WE THINK IT S UH THAT IMPORTANT AND I I .
KIND OF HOPE THAT THE TREND GOES BACK IN THAT DIRECTION .
I M A A COUNSELOR AND A THERAPIST .
UHHUH .
AND I WORK WITH ADOLESCENTS AND I SEE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS .
THE KIDS HAVE WHEN THEY DO NT HAVE A REAL GOOD FAMILY STRUCTURE .
YEAH I I SEE A DIFFERENCE IN THE GENERATION OF EVEN THE GENERATION BEFORE ME .
UHHUH .
UH WERE YOU KNOW MOM WAS LIKE UM MRS .
CLEAVER UH YOU KNOW JUNE CLEAVER OR WHATEVER WHERE THE THE ATTITUDES WERE A LOT DIFFERENT .
UM AS FAR AS I THINK THE KIDS BACK THEN SEEMED TO BE A LOT MORE UM THER THERE WAS NT A LOT OF THE DRUGS AND ALCOHOL AND .
UHHUH .
UM A LOT OF THE THE THINGS .
THAT ARE GOING ON IN TODAY S SOCIETY I THINK MORALLY UM IT SEEMS LIKE THERE WAS PEO PEOPLE WERE A LOT BETTER BACK THEN AS FAR AS HIG HIGHER STANDARDS .
TRUE .
WELL THE HUSBANDS ROLES ARE ALMOST NONEXISTENT IN FAMILY ANYMORE IN TERMS OF BEING THE FATHER FIGURE AND WITH WOMEN WORKING SO MUCH THEY RE KIND OF PULLED OUT OF IT TOO .
YEAH .
SO KIDS ARE RAISED AROUND THEIR FRIENDS AND BY THE MEDIA .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
AND THAT S YOU KNOW THAT S CONTRIBUTED .
AND I THINK I THINK YOU RE GOING TO SEE A LOT MORE OF THAT IN THE FUTURE .
YEAH MAYBE THAT S CONTRIBUTED TO A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE SEE ALL THE TIME SO .
IF THERE WAS SOME WAY FOR FOR WOMEN TO TO STAY HOME EVEN IF THEY COULD WORK YOU KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF JOBS .
THAT ARE COMING ABOUT LIKE IN COMPUTERS AT HOME .
UHHUH .
AND THOSE TYPES OF THINGS THAT WOULD AT LEAST IN SOME WAYS UM BRIDGE THE GAP .
YEAH I I THINK THAT UM IN THE FUTURE UM THE THE FAMILY UNIT AS IT AS IT ONCE WAS KNOWN IS IS GOING TO BE NONEXISTENT .
WHAT HOW DO YOU WHAT DO YOU THINK .
ABOUT .
THAT AS FAR AS DO DO YOU THINK THERE S GOING TO BE STILL A FAMILY UNIT OR OR DO YOU THINK THAT UM THE TREND IS GOING MORE TOWARDS SINGLE PARENTING .
THE BALANCE .
I DO NT THE THE DIVORCE RATE KEEPS HOVERING AROUND FIFTY PERCENT OR SO AND IT GOT HIGHER THAN THAT FOR A WHILE .
UM THAT S HARD TO SAY .
FAMILIES ARE SUCH A STRANGE CONFIGURATION ANYMORE .
UM I I SEE A LOT OF FAMILIES WHERE YOU KNOW IN THE IN THE BACK I GREW UP ABOUT THE SAME TIME .
YOU DID .
UHHUH .
AND BACK IN THOSE TIMES WE PRETTY MUCH WERE TAUGHT HOW TO BE RESPONSIBLE .
UHHUH .
UH NOWADAYS IT S NOT THE CASE KIDS DO NT KIDS ARE BOMBARDED WITH ALL KINDS OF JUNK AND ONE OF THE REASONS I GUESS IS BECAUSE THERE S SO MUCH MORE INCOME IN THE FAMILY WITH BOTH .
PARENTS WORKING .
THEY GET BOMBARDED WITH JUNK AND THEY DO NT HAVE TO DO ANYTHING AROUND THE HOUSE .
THEY NEVER LEARNED TO BE RESPONSIBLE WHEN .
YEAH .
THE BIGGER TREND CALLED THE BOOMERANG KIDS WHERE THEY MOVE OUT FOR A WHILE AND THEY COME BACK AND YOU GOT TWENTY AND THIRTY YEAR OLDS .
WHO ARE LIVING AT HOME WITH MOM AND DAD SO .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW YOU CREATE A BIGGER BIGGER FAMILY GENERATION AFTER GENERATION BUT NOT REALLY ON PURPOSE .
YEAH .
SO .
IT S NOT NOT A REAL FUNCTIONAL SITUATION ANYWAY .
SO YOU KNOW I DO NT KNOW IT S I DO NT KNOW THAT THAT TREND S GOING TO CHANGE THE SINGLE PARENT TYPE FAMILIES AND THE MUMBLEX FAMILIES AS LONG AS WE VE GOT SO MANY OTHER CRAZY THINGS GOING ON IN SOCIETY .
YEAH I I THINK THAT EVENTUALLY THE THE FAMILY UNIT S JUST NOT GOING TO EVEN EXIST ANYMORE .
MUMBLEX LIKE YOU SAID THE DIVORCE RATE IS GETTING SO HIGH THAT I THINK THERE S GOING TO BE MORE SINGLE PARENT FAMILIES THAN THERE ARE UM YOU KNOW TWO PARENT FAMILIES .
UHHUH .
THAT S PRETTY SAD .
YEAH IT IS I GUESS UNLESS UNLESS THERE S A A MAJOR SWING IN THE CHANGE OF WHAT S IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE YOU KNOW PROBABLY KEEP GOING DOWNHILL .
AND I I DO NT KNOW WE WE FEEL LIKE THAT THAT WE CAN MAKE IT ON ONE INCOME .
IT IT MAY BE TOUGH BUT WE MAY HAVE TO GIVE UP ON SOME SOME THINGS .
I I THINK IN THE LONG RUN THOUGH YOUR CHILD WILL BENEFIT FROM THAT .
YEAH .
AND IT WILL IT WILL MAKE THE THE STRAIN WORTHWHILE .
YEAH I THINK SO TOO .
WELL I I NEED TO GO AHEAD AND AND WRAP IT UP .
OKAY .
UM IT WAS REALLY NICE TALKING TO YOU .
WELL I VE ENJOYED IT STEPHANIE .
AND UH THANKS A LOT .
UHHUH .

I THINK THAT S TRUE .
THE UH THE BERMUDA GRASS IS GREENING UP IN MARCH AND SOMETIMES DOES NT REALLY START DOING THAT UNTIL THE FIRST PART OF APRIL .
SO .
YEAH .
SO I THINK WE RE A LITTLE HEA AHEAD OF SCHEDULE ON THAT .
YEAH I WAS OUT IN MY YARD YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AND I NOTICED ALL THAT GRASS COMING UP AND I THOUGHT OOH WE VE GOT TO START THIS MOWING BIT SOON .
THAT S TRUE .
IT S BEEN A A FUN BREAK BUT THE BREAK IS OVER .
YEAH .
WELL UM OH I GUESS ANOTHER THING .
I VE NOTICED TOO HERE LATELY IS THAT EVEN THOUGH WE VE HAD SOME .
PRETTY WARM DAYS IT S BEEN AWFULLY GRAY YOU KNOW JUST .
YEAH NOW THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKENDS HAVE BEEN NICE AND SUNNY .
YEAH .
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME AT WORK .
I LOOK OUT MY WINDOW .
IT S GRAY .
WELL YEAH BUT I D RATHER HAVE A SUNNY WEEKEND THAN A GRAY WEEKEND .
OH I GO FOR THAT YEAH .
YEAH .
IN FACT I M A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT THIS ONE COMING UP HERE .
WE HAVE A LONG WEEKEND AND IT SOUNDS LIKE IT S GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT ON THE COOL SIDE .
YEAH .
I HAVE NT HEARD WHETHER IT S GOING TO RAIN OR NOT .
I THINK THERE S AN EIGHTY PERCENT CHANCE .
THIS EVENING BUT IT S SUPPOSED TO BE CLEARED OUT AT LEAST BY NOON TOMORROW AND THEN THE REST WILL BE WITHOUT RAIN .
WELL THAT S GOOD .
BUT I THINK THE HIGHS ARE GOING TO BE IN THE SIXTIES AND THE LOWS IN THE FORTIES .
THAT S GETTING BACK TO A LITTLE BIT CHILLIER .
YEAH THAT PROBABLY IS A LITTLE BIT UNDER WHAT .
IT IS FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR .
I THINK I HAVE NT SEEN THE WEA THE WEATHER ON THE NEWS IN THE EVENING LATELY BUT I THINK THE AVERAGE HIGH WOULD BE SHOULD BE ABOUT SEVENTY .
YEAH .
I M NOT CERTAIN EITHER BUT YOU RE PROBABLY RIGHT .
YEAH .
WELL I LIKE IT WHEN IT S SORT OF A MEDIUM TEMPERATURE UH MAYBE SEVENTYFIVE TO EIGHTY SOMEWHERE IN THERE .
I DO NT LIKE IT WHEN IT S TOO COOL OR TOO WARM .
I M MUCH MORE APT TO GET THINGS DONE WHEN IT S AT THAT SORT OF IN BETWEEN TEMPERATURE .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
UM ONE OF THE REMARKABLE THINGS ABOUT THE WEATHER IN THE SUMMERTIME HERE IS THAT QUITE OFTEN THE AVERAGE DAYTIME HIGH OF SAY NINETYNINE DEGREES IS WITHIN FIVE OR SIX DEGREES OF THE ALL TIME RECORD HIGH .
UM .
AND WHAT .
THAT TELLS ME IS THAT THE SUMMER WEATHER IS VERY PREDICTABLE THAT IT DOES NT VARY VERY MUCH .
YEAH .
YOU RE PROBABLY RIGHT .
I MEAN ANY OTHER TIME OF YEAR THAT S NOT THE CASE BECAUSE IT COULD BE VERY WARM OR VERY COLD .
YES AS A MATTER OF FACT I HEARD THE WEATHER .
THE OTHER DAY ON T V AND I THINK IT WAS ONE DAY .
THIS WEEK .
A YEAR AGO .
UHHUH .
THEY SAID THAT WE HAD A FREEZE AND SOME KIND OF BAD WEATHER .
YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
IT WAS NT JUST A SUPER BAD STORM BUT IT WAS .
RIGHT .
IT WAS THAT SORT OF THING THAT WE NEVER LIKE TO SEE IN THE THE LATE SPRING TIME .
YEAH .
ONE OF THE WEIRDEST THINGS I SAW I THINK IT WAS AROUND THIS TIME LAST YEAR WAS A TWENTYSIX DEGREE LIGHTENING STORM .
OH WOW .
I YOU KNOW I WAS GOING INTO THE GROCERY STORE AND A A LIGHTENING BOLT WAS ALMOST DIRECTLY OVERHEAD AND IT WAS TWENTY SIX DEGREES OUT .
UM .
AND I THOUGHT WELL GEE I VE I VE NEVER KNOWN IT TO LIGHTENING AT THAT TEMPERATURE .
YEAH THAT THAT IS PRETTY UNUSUAL .
AND YOU REALLY TAKE NOTICE OF IT TOO .
THAT S RIGHT .
IT UH IT PROBABLY WAS A LOT WARMER UP HIGH .
SOMETIMES THEY GET THOSE INVERSIONS LIKE WHEN WE HAD THAT TWELVE AND A HALF DAYS .
A FEW YEARS AGO THAT IT NEVER GOT UP AS HIGH AS FREEZING .
THE AIR TEMPERATURE AT FIVE THOUSAND FEET WAS FIFTY DEGREES .
UM .
THE COLD WEATHER WAS JUST SIMPLY TRAPPED ALONG THE GROUND AND COULD NT GET AWAY .
WOW .
I DO NT DO NT LIKE THAT SUPER COLD STUFF .
NOPE .
I JUST DO NT MOVE VERY WELL WHEN IT S THAT COLD .
YEP I I M REALLY ENJOYING THIS NOW .
WELL THIS HAS BEEN INTERESTING .
YEAH WELL .
NOT TOO CHALLENGING TO THE BRAIN .
NOT NOT A REAL IN DEPTH TOPIC BUT .
NOPE .
ENJOYED TALKING TO YOU .
ALL RIGHT ELLEN WELL YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY .
OKAY .
BYE .
BYEBYE .
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCES IS THE COMPUTER REVOLUTION .
YEAH .
AND I CAN VERY CLEARLY REMEMBER TEN YEARS AGO I WAS JUST BEGINNING TO EXPLORE COMPUTERIZING MY OFFICE AND AND TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT KINDS OF COMPUTERS MIGHT BE USEFUL AND WE DID END UP WITH UH I B M P C S WHICH .
I NOW WOULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN .
REALLY .
BUT THAT WAS BEFORE THE MACINTOSH .
YEAH .
AND TWENTY YEARS AGO I WAS UH IN GRADUATE SCHOOL PECKING OUT A DISSERTATION ON A MANUAL TYPEWRITER .
OH I KNOW IT .
SO I WOULD SAY THAT S ONE OF THE LARGEST CHANGES IN AT LEAST IN MY LIFE .
YEAH I I VE SEEN THAT JUST IN THE LAST UH EVEN FIVE YEARS HOW MUCH THEY VE IN UH INCREASED IN USE .
OR PROBABLY EIGHT YEARS WHEN I WAS A FRESHMAN IN COLLEGE .
UHHUH .
UH MY DEGREE WAS IN COMPUTER UH TECHNOLOGY ORIGINALLY AND IT SEEMED LIKE IT WOULD THEY WERE JUST GETTING OUT WITH THE YOU KNOW THE DISKS AND ALL THAT GETTING AWAY WITH THE CARDS .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW DOING AWAY WITH THE THE PROGRAMMING CARDS .
RIGHT .
AND UH .
YEAH THIRTY YEARS AGO I I HAD A COLLEGE JOB UH WORKING AS A PROGRAMMER AND WE HAD TO WRITE CODE IN BINARY AND UH HAVE IT PUNCHED IN ON THOSE LITTLE CARDBOARD CARDS .
WHICH .
I KNOW .
I DO NT THINK EXISTS ANYMORE .
NO .
YOU NEVER SEE ONE OF THOSE PUNCH CARDS ANYMORE .
UH I THINK T V HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THE CHANGES TOO .
DO NT YOU .
IN LIKE PEOPLE S ATTITUDES .
WELL VERY POSSIBLY .
UH I M NOT SURE IN THE LAST TEN YEARS .
IT S BEEN VERY DIFFERENT FROM BEFORE .
UH CERTAINLY IN THE LAST THIRTY .
I WOULD SAY THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES .
EVEN EVEN THE CHANGE FROM BLACK AND WHITE TO COLOR TELEVISION .
YEAH .
THIRTY YEARS AGO I GUESS THERE WERE COLOR T V S BUT I SURE DID NT HAVE ACCESS TO ONE .
OH .
AND UH BUT TWENTY YEARS AGO PRACTICALLY EVERYBODY HAD A COLOR T V AND NOW I THINK THEY RE AS ALMOST AS MANY WELL THERE ARE MORE T V S THAN HOUSEHOLDS SO .
YEAH .
IT S CLOSE TO GETTING UH ONE T V PER PERSON .
THEY SAY .
AND NOW EVERYBODY UH HAS V C R S AND TWO OR THREE V C R S .
UHHUH .
AND THAT KIND OF THING .
YEAH .
CERTAINLY TEN YEARS AGO UH V C R S WERE JUST COMING ON THE MARKET SO THAT S MADE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY .
I WATCH TELEVISION FOR INSTANCE BECAUSE UH NOW I ALMOST NEVER WATCH A T V PROGRAM WHEN IT S ON .
YEAH .
I KNOW .
I TAPE IT AND THEN WATCH IT WHEN IT S CONVENIENT AND THAT WAY .
I DO NT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BEING INTERRUPTED .
I CAN JUST PUT IT ON PAUSE .
YEAH AND YOU CAN YOU CAN FLIP THROUGH THE COMMERCIALS SO YOU DO NT HAVE TO WATCH THE COMMERCIALS .
RIGHT .
THAT S ALWAYS H CONVENIENT .
UHHUH .
YES YOU CAN WATCH A PROGRAM IN FORTYFIVE MINUTES INSTEAD OF AN HOUR .
YOU SKIP THE COMMERCIALS .
UHHUH .
SO WHAT WAS OUR QUESTION ABOUT DECLINE IN SOCIO .
WAS NT THE DECLINE SO MUCH .
I THINK THEY JUST SAID THE CHANGES IN UH SOCIAL SOCIAL CHANGES IN THE UNITED STATES .
YEAH .
HOW WAS LIFE DIFFERENT TEN TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS AGO .
SO .
WELL I CA NT REALLY REMEMBER BACK THAT FAR BUT TEN YEARS AGO UH I DO NT KNOW .
I D SAY LIKE IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES YOU REMEMBER HOW KIDS WOULD WALK AROUND WITH A M WHAT DO YOU CALL THOSE LITTLE A M RADIOS .
YES .
AND NOW PEOPLE HAVE JAM BOX WITH C D PLAYERS IN THEM YOU KNOW .
YES .
THAT S CERTAINLY .
AND .
A DIFFERENCE .
HAND HELD T V S AND CAR PHONES .
YEAH THAT S ANOTHER .
ONE YEAH CAR PHONES IS A GOOD POINT AND UH CELLULAR PHONES OF ALL TYPES AND BEEPERS .
UH .
YEAH .
TEN YEARS AGO I WAS WORKING IN A JOB AT A MEDICAL CENTER AND I HAD TO CARRY A BEEPER AROUND AND THEY WERE KIND OF BULKY AND ALL .
THEY DID WAS JUST UH MAKE A BEEP NOISE AND THEN YOU HAD TO GO FIND A TELEPHONE AND CALL IN TO FIND OUT WHAT .
THEY WANTED YOU FOR AND WHO .
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO CALL .
UHHUH .
THESE DAYS THEY HAVE THESE TINY LITTLE THINGS .
THAT ARE ONLY ABOUT THE SIZE OF TWO OR THREE PENCILS AND THEY FIT IN YOUR SHIRT POCKET AND THEY HAVE A LITTLE DISPLAY SCREEN .
THAT SHOWS YOU .
A MESSAGE AND EITHER TELLS YOU .
A PERSON OR A A PHONE NUMBER TO RESPOND TO AND .
THOSE ARE COOL .
YEAH THOSE ARE PRETTY NEAT .
AND THEY HAVE THE KIND .
THAT JUST VIBRATES SO YOU CAN SHUT THEM OFF .
YEAH .
IN A THEATRE OR SOMETHING AND YOU CAN STILL GET YOUR MESSAGES .
YEAH .
BUT LET S SEE SOCIAL CHANGES UH UH .
WHERE DO YOU THINK IT S WHERE DO YOU THINK IT S GOING TO GO IN TWENTY YEARS .
I HAVE NT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA .
I WAS JUST THINKING THOUGH ABOUT A A HUGE SOCIAL CHANGE IN THE LAST TEN YEARS IS AIDS .
YEAH .
IT WAS JUST BEGINNING TO BE RECOGNIZED AND NOTICED TEN YEARS AGO .
I I KNOW THAT BECAUSE I WAS WRITING A PAPER ABOUT IT .
UHHUH .
I WAS WRITING A A JOURNAL ARTICLE .
UH AND THEY STILL DID NT EVEN KNOW WHAT CAUSED IT OR ANYTHING .
AND UH THERE WAS A SUSPICION .
WOW .
THAT IT WAS A VIRUS BUT NOBODY HAD IDENTIFIED IT AND THEY WERE REALLY JUST GOING ON EPIDEMIOLOGICAL UH .
UHHUH .
UH GUESSWORK UH BECAUSE THE WAY .
IT WAS TRANSMITTED MADE IT LOOK AN AWFUL LOT LIKE UH HEPATITIS AND THEN .
YEAH .
FROM FROM THE SPREAD PATTERN OF HEPATITIS THEY COULD WORK BACKWARDS TO THE TRANSMISSION BY UH BLOOD AND SEMEN .
AND THEN I .
I M CURIOUS WHAT WAS YOUR UH GRADUATE STUDY IN .
WELL I I WAS IN ENGLISH AS A MATTER OF FACT AND .
OH WOW .
MEDIEVAL STUDIES .
UHHUH .
UH BUT I WENT TO WORK AS AN EDITOR AND WRITER SO UH UH THE TEN YEARS AGO I WAS WORKING IN THE MEDICAL CENTER UH PUBLISHING A JOURNAL AND WRITING ABOUT MEDICAL TOPICS .
YEAH .
AND LET S SEE TWENTY YEARS AGO I GUESS WE RE WERE JUST BEGINNING TO GET INTO WHAT .
THEY WERE CALLING THE UH THE SEX REVOLUTION WHERE UH .
YEAH .
AFTER THE PILL AND UH UH FREED PEOPLE UP FROM WORRIES ABOUT UH ILLEGITIMATE PREGNANCY AND I GUESS IN THE SEVENTIES IS THE THE TIME WHEN THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE EXPLODED .
THIRTY YEARS AGO THERE WAS NO PILL .
UHHUH .
YOU THINK THAT S CAUSED A LOT OF PRESSURE ON LIKE YOUNGER KIDS TODAY .
YES .
TO MAKE CHOICES THAT THEY PROBABLY SHOULD NT HAVE TO MAKE .
I DO .
I REALLY DO .
I HAVE UH .
YEAH .
FOUR KIDS IN COLLEGE RIGHT NOW CHILDREN AND STEPCHILDREN AND I KNOW THAT THE EXPECTATION FOR THEM WAS UH TO HAVE SEX AND MUCH EARLIER .
UHHUH .
THAN THE EXPECTATION WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE .
YEAH .
IN MY DAY WE TALKED QUIETLY BEHIND OUR HANDS ABOUT PEOPLE THAT WE SUSPECTED MIGHT BE .
YEAH .
SLEEPING WITH THEIR BOYFRIENDS .
YEAH .
BUT THEY CERTAINLY DID NT EXPECT EVERYBODY TO AND IT WAS REALLY ONLY UH ACCEPTABLE IF YOU WERE ENGAGED AND PLANNING TO GET MARRIED IN IN THE RELATIVELY NEAR FUTURE .
UHHUH .
AND I CERTAINLY KNOW FROM TALKING TO MY STEPDAUGHTER THAT GIRLS IN HIGH SCHOOL WERE UNDER A WHOLE LOT MORE PRESSURE NOWADAYS .
OH YEAH .
IT .
S KIND OF SCARY WHEN I THINK OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN TWENTY YEARS YOU KNOW WHEN I HAVE KIDS AND THEY RE GROWN AND UH JUST KIND OF SOME OF THE CHANGES .
THAT WILL HAPPEN EVEN MORE SO .
AND I GUESS THE ANSWER .
SEEMS LIKE IT CA NT GET MUCH WORSE .
IS IS STAY FLEXIBLE BECAUSE NOBODY CAN PREDICT WHAT S GOING TO HAPPEN IN TWENTY YEARS .
YEAH .
I CERTAINLY WOULD NT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TWENTY YEARS AGO TELL YOU .
WHAT UH MY KIDS WERE LIKELY TO BE LIKE .
COURSE ONE OF THEM WAS JUST A A A BRAND NEW BABY TWENTY YEARS AGO SO .
UHHUH .
I SURE WOULD NT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PREDICT FOR HIM .
UM .
AND SOME OF THE OTHER ONES WERE NT BORN .
YEAH .
SO SOUNDS LIKE AMERICA S GOING TO BECOME EVEN MORE COMMUNICATION SOCIETY WITH FAXES AND CELLULAR PHONES AND .
YEAH .
WORLDWIDE COMMUNICATION AND .
ELECTRONIC MAIL .
YEAH .
I JUST GOT ON THAT THIS PAST ABOUT A YEAR AGO AND THAT S MADE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY .
I DO MY JOB BECAUSE IT S SO MUCH EASIER TO GET HOLD OF PEOPLE AND GET QUICK ANSWERS TO THINGS .
YEAH .
EVEN WHEN THEY RE ON ANOTHER CONTINENT .
IT S PRETTY WILD .
YEAH .
EVEN YOU KNOW THAT REMINDS ME FEDERAL EXPRESS WAS AROUND TEN YEARS AGO BUT IT WAS USED AS KIND OF AN EXTREME EMERGENCY .
UHHUH .

THE ONE IT S KIND OF LIKE UH AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE THE ONES UH THAT I THINK ARE THE HIGHEST AND IMPORTANT TO ME UH I HOPE I NEVER HAVE TO USE THEM REALLY PER SE ALTHOUGH I VE USED MEDICAL A LITTLE BIT .
UHHUH .
THAT WELL THAT ONE CERTAINLY IS HIGH I I WORRY THAT IT S WEAKENING RATHER THAN STRENGTHENING SO I LIKE TO REVERSE THAT TREND AND SAY I D LIKE TO GET THOSE TO STRENGTHEN YOU KNOW .
BE BETTER AND BETTER .
WELL .
THEN SAL SAL SALARY CONTINUANCE I VE NEVER USED THAT ONE I HOPE I NEVER WILL BUT THAT S KIND OF LIKE AN INSURANCE THING I SURE LIKE THAT ONE .
OH YES .
THAT S LIKE AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE YOU NEVER WANT TO GET IN AN ACCIDENT BUT IT YOU LIKE TO HAVE IT THERE .
UHHUH WELL UH LIKE I SAY I WORKED FOR SEVERAL DIFFERENT COMPANIES AND THERE S NOTHING TO COMPARE WITH UH T I HERE .

OH RIGHT YEAH .
AND I GOT CAUGHT UP IN A LAYOFF .
UM .
NOW UH COURSE YOU GET SIX MONTHS UH UNEMPLOYMENT FROM THE STATE .
YEAH .
BUT WHAT T I DID FOR US IS IS UH I VE NEVER HEARD OF IT BEFORE THEY FIXED US UP WITH AN OFFICE WITH UH TELEPHONES ACCESS TO LONGDISTANCE UH COMPUTERS A SECRETARY TO TAKE MESSAGES FOR US OR TYPE UH LETTERS .
RIGHT .
FOR US UH THEY HAD OUT OF TOWN NEWSPAPERS AND THEN .
AND OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS DID NT THEY HAVE AN OUTSIDE CONSULTANT TOO .
I BEG YOUR PARDON .
DID THEY HAVE AN OUTSIDE CONSULTANT LIKE A THE EMPLOY .
UH YES THEY DID HAVE UH SEMINARS EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE .
YEAH .
UH COURSE THAT WAS NOT UH RESTRICTED JUST TO JUST US .
RIGHT .
BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WAS THAT UH THEY HAD MADE UP THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UH UNEMPLOYMENT PAY AND SEVENTYFIVE PERCENT OF MY NET PAY AND THEY THEN T I PAID ME THAT .
OH REALLY .
SO UH I WAS ABLE TO UH NOT JUST EXIST I MEAN I I LIVED JUST AS COMFORTABLY AS I DID BEFORE I WAS LAID OFF .
YEAH THEY SEEM TO BE DO DOING A GOOD JOB OF THAT I M IN FACILITIES AND OUR ORGANIZATION BUILT BUILDS THOSE FACILITIES OVER IN PARK CENTRAL NOW .
UHHUH .
AND I GUESS THEY VE BEEN USING THEM FOR SIX MONTHS NOW AND I VE KNOWN SEVERAL ENGINEERS THAT GOT LAID OFF AND THEY SAID IT S LIKE GETTING A PH D ALMOST THEY THE MUCH THEY LEARN OVER THERE YOU KNOW AFTER THEY VE BEEN LAID OFF UH ONE ENGINEER SAID IT WAS REALLY AN EDUCATION HE HE JUST LEARNED LIKE YOU HE SAID HE LEARNED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT THAT HE NEVER WOULD HAVE ABLE TO PICK UP ON HIS OWN HE WAS VERY THANKFUL FOR THAT TOO .
WELL THIS WAS NOT A LEARNING THING BY ANY MEANS IT WAS JUST A UH .
TO HAVE AN OFFICE YEAH .
AN ASSISTANCE TRYING TO FIND ANOTHER JOB .
YEAH WELL HE SAID HE LEARNED SO MUCH AND HOW HE THOUGHT HE THOUGHT HE HAD A PH D IN HOW TO GET A JOB AFTER HE WAS .
OH .
THROUGH THE WHOLE PROCESS .
UHHUH .
FOR FOR SEVERAL MONTHS HE DID EVENTUALLY GET A JOB .
WELL COURSE I WENT THROUGH THIS UH WHAT ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO THEY MAY HAVE IMPROVED IT CONSIDERABLY .
YEAH APPARENTLY IT S VERY SOPHISTICATED AND I GUESS IT MAY BE ONE OF THE BEST UH THAT ANYONE S DOING .
WELL THAT S ONE OF THOSE LITTLE UH UH LITTLE EXTRAS THAT YOU DO NT SEE IN THE UH THE THE THE HANDBOOK YOU KNOW .
RIGHT YOU RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT S A GOOD ONE .
IT .
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT PENSIONS ANYTHING ON THAT OR .
WELL NOW I HAVE UH UH I M GETTING CLOSE TO RETIREMENT .
YEAH .
AND OF COURSE I VE BEEN LOOKING INTO IT BUT UH SINCE I M ONLY A YELLOW BADGER .
UHHUH .
I WO NT BE GETTING A WHOLE HECK OF A LOT FROM T I .
RIGHT .
AS FAR AS RETIREMENT IS CONCERNED .
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF A PENSION THAT GOES FROM ONE COMPANY TO THE OTHER LIKE AN ACCOUNT LIKE A FOUR O ONE ACCOUNT I I VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THAT FOR YEARS UH .
I VE NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING .
I KNOW THAT S WHAT I M SAYING THAT THAT PENSIONS YOU SEE JUST LIKE YOU WERE YOU RE SAYING YOU VE ONLY GOT UH SO MANY YEARS SAY YOU WORK FOR TWO THREE COMPANIES YOU TAKE YOUR PENSION WITH YOU AFTER YOU RE VESTED .
UHHUH .
AND THEN JUST ADD THE MONEY TOGETHER LIKE YOU DO WITH A FOUR O ONE ACCOUNT YOU KNOW .
UH YEAH .
UH IT S YOUR ACCOUNT PERIOD IT DOES NT MATTER WHERE YOU GO OR ANYTHING THAT S YOUR ACCOUNT TO ROLL OVER .
I THAT THAT SOUNDS LIKE A HELL OF AN IDEA I DID NT KNOW THERE WAS SUCH A THING .
NO NO THERE IS NT I I M SAYING THAT S THE QUESTION WHAT DO YOU THINK COULD BE BETTER AND I M SAYING THAT PENSIONS SAY IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND OR MORE WHEN SOCIAL SECURITY GOES AWAY WHICH IT PROBABLY WILL I THINK THEY OUGHT TO HAVE A PENSION AT LEAST THAT YOU D NEVER LOSE SO YOU WORK FOR A COMPANY SEVEN YEARS .
YES BY ALL MEANS WELL WHAT WOULD BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AND SOCIAL SECURITY .
UH WELL SOCIAL SECURITY S GOING TO GO TO WAY I THINK AND YOU CAN OR YOU CAN INVEST YOUR OWN MONEY YOU HAVE NO CONTROL OVER YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY AND IT S NOT PAID FOR BY THE CURRENT LIKE WHEN SAY WE RETIRE AFTER THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND SOCIAL SECURITY S PAID FOR BY THE TWENTYFIVE YEAR OLDS YOU KNOW THEY MAY REBEL AND YOU WO NT HAVE ANY SOCIAL SECURITY WHERE IF YOUR MONEY WAS IN YOUR ACCOUNT I MEAN YOU CAN NEVER LOSE IT IT S THERE .
YEAH YEAH .
YOU DO NT HAVE TO DEPEND ON ANYBODY TO BE PUTTING THAT MONEY IN FOR YOU YOU KNOW THAT S JUST A THOUGHT I MEAN I .
UHHUH .
IF THEY SAY WHICH .
NO I I LIKE THE IDEA .
YEAH .
COURSE THAT S THAT S SOME SOMETHING LIKE AN I R A .
YEAH AND INSTEAD OF HAVING A A SOCIALIZED PENSION IT JUST WOULD BE REALLY MONEY THAT YOU AND YOUR COMPANY MAYBE YOU HAD TO PUT SOME MONEY IN IT TOO I DO NT REALLY KNOW BUT I .
UHHUH .
I CAN SEE WHERE THEY D NEED TO DO SOMETHING ON THAT BECAUSE THE STATISTICS ARE YOU DO NT WORK FOR A COMPANY TWENTY YEARS THROUGH NO FAULT OF YOUR OWN YOU KNOW YOU WORK FOR FIVE SIX SEVEN AND Y Y A LOT OF PEOPLE I KNOW GUYS .
YEAH THAT THAT S WHAT I VE DONE I I VE BOUNCED AROUND ABOUT EVERY TEN YEARS .
YEAH .
I CHANGE .
I HAVE TOO BUT NOT NOT QUITE THAT OFTEN BUT UH YEAH I VE ONLY GOT UH I VE GOT I GUESS FOURTEEN NOW HERE AT T I AND I HOPE TO MAKE TWENTYFIVE WHICH SAY IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO ME I MEAN YOU KNOW THEY LAY ME OFF SO YOU HAVE A PENSION BUT THEN YOU D HAVE TO TRY TO GET A PENSION IN ANOTHER ONE IT WOULD BE NICE IF THEY COULD GET THEM TOGETHER .

THAT S INTERESTING I DO NT I I SUSPECT THEY RE NOT OUR BIGGEST THREAT ANYMORE .
PROBABLY NOT NO .
I SUSPECT IT S PROBABLY SOME CRAZY MAN LIKE SADDAM HUSSEIN .
RIGHT .
WHO S OUR BIGGEST THREAT BUT UM I WONDER IF THEY RE I WONDER HOW MUCH OF A THREAT THEY ARE I AGREE WITH YOU THAT THAT THEY LL ALWAYS BE SOMEWHAT OF A THREAT GIVEN THAT THEY HAVE THAT THERE S JUST IT S JUST SO BIG AND THERE S JUST SO MUCH MILITARY MACHINE THERE .
UHHUH AND AND IT S RECOGNIZED THAT THE TWO GREAT POWERS .
RIGHT .
ARE US AND THEM AND AND THE GREAT POWERS ARE ALWAYS PITTED AGAINST EACH OTHER .
BUT I WONDER HOW MUCH LONGER THEY RE GOING TO BE A THEM .
I DO NT KNOW THEY THEY RE GOING DOWNHILL PRETTY STEADY .

ACTUALLY I FEEL KIND OF SORRY FOR THEM RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THE PEOPLE ARE ARE ARE UH WANTING THINGS THAT WE HAVE THAT THEY RE NOT ALLOW I MEAN JUST SOME BASIC FREEDOMS AND AND THEIR GOVERNMENT IS NOT ALLOWING IT AND GORBACHEV SEEMS TO BE GOING BACK ON SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HE S BEEN TRYING TO PUSH .
YEAH ACTUALLY I NOTICED THIS I MEAN THIS THIS THIS MOST RECENT SCARE OF HIS WHERE HE SAID OR HE JUST DECIDED THAT INSTEAD OF HAVING UH INSTEAD OF HAVING I CA NT THINK OF THE WORD NOW .
IF THERE ARE ANY DEMONSTRATIONS FOR IN FAVOR OF BORIS YELTSIN HE DECIDED WELL I LL JUST CANCEL ALL DEMONSTRATIONS ALTOGETHER .
UHHUH .
SO I I I THINK THAT HE HE HE S ACTUALLY HE I THINK IS BECOMING VERY DANGEROUS .
YEAH .
BECAUSE HE S MAKING THOSE PEOPLE ANGRY AT HIM AND HE S ALSO I THINK HE S ALSO MAKING UM THE MILITARY ANGRY AT HIM .
YEAH .
I MEAN I VE HEARD STORIES NOW WHERE THE WHERE THE UM THE MILITARY IS RUNNING AROUND AND THEY RE SORT OF GETTING RESTLESS AND A RESTLESS MILITARY IS THE KIND OF THING THAT HAPPENS YOU KNOW LIKE WITH THE BALTIC STATES WHEN THEY JUST GO IN THERE .
YEAH .
DIVVY THE PEOPLE UP .
SEE I M CONCERNED THAT THAT SINCE HE S BANNED DEMONSTRATIONS ALTOGETHER THAT HE S GOING TO DO THE TYPE OF THING THAT HAPPENED IN TIANANMEN SQUARE AND HE S GOING TO WIPE OUT NO TELLING HOW MANY OF HIS .
UHHUH .
OWN COUNTRYMEN UH RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF RED SQUARE AND UH IT S GOING TO CAUSE A MORE CIVIL WAR THAN IS ALREADY OCCURRING .
THAT S INTERESTING I I WONDER I DO NT KNOW IF HE S HE HE SEEMS THE THING ABOUT GORBACHEV STRIKES THAT HE WOULD NT BE THAT DUMB I DO NT KNOW THOUGH .
I DO NT KNOW I MEAN AND IT IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT HE WOULD NT BE ABLE TO CONTROL .
THAT S THAT THAT S SOMETHING THAT REALLY TRUE MUMBLEX SORT OF A MILITARY THING I WAS SPEAKING OF BEFORE .
UHHUH .
THAT S THAT S CERTAINLY TRUE I MEAN HIS MILITARY MAY JUST GO OUT AND SAY WELL WE JUST GORBACHEV SAID YOU CA NT DO IT AND WE RE TO NOT LET YOU DO IT YOU KNOW SO .
YEAH .
YEAH THAT THAT S REAL SCARY ACTUALLY .
YEAH .
I MEAN I I I WOULD EXPECT THEIR OWN PROBLEMS WOULD KEEP THEM AWAY FROM US FOR A WHILE BUT IT COULD BE REAL DANGEROUS .
YEAH WE VE GOT OUR OWN WORRIES AT THE MOMENT .
YEAH RIGHT WE DO NT NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THEM .
I GUESS AS LONG AS UH THEY RE FIGHTING EACH OTHER WE DO NT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THEM WASTING THEIR TIME WITH US .
YEAH BUT WOULD NT IT BE NICE IF NO ONE HAD TO FIGHT ANYBODY ELSE .
WELL SURE THAT BUT THAT S A THAT S AN IMPOSSIBILITY I THINK .
YEAH .
GIVEN THE DIFFERENCES IN THE WORLD AND PEOPLE ARE JUST TOO DIFFERENT .
WELL I DO NT I DO NT KNOW I THINK THAT UN UNDERLYING WE RE ALL PRETTY PROBABLY NOT AS AS DIFFERENT AS EVERYBODY THINKS .
BUT UNFORTUNATELY PEOPLE PEOPLE ARE NT THAT INSIGHTFUL .
RIGHT WELL THAT S THAT S CERTAINLY TRUE OF IT .
THEY JUST SEE THAT THIS GUY PRAYS DIFFERENTLY AND TO SOMEONE ELSE THAN I DO SO THEREFORE HE S WRONG AND HE S BAD AND WE HAVE TO WIPE WIPE HIM OUT .
THAT S TRUE I WAS I WAS DISCUSSING WITH SOMEONE BEFORE UM THIS SOMEONE BEFORE ACTUALLY ONE OF THESE CALLS .
UHHUH .
MATTER OF FACT ABOUT ANOTHER TOPIC BUT IT CAME UP ONE OF THESE CALLS .
UHHUH .
MATTER OF FACT ABOUT UM ANOTHER TOPIC BUT IT CAME UP ONE OF THESE THIS THIS POEM EVERYTHING I WANTED TO KNOW I LEARNED IN KINDERGARTEN OR SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
YOU VE READ THAT ONE BEFORE .
NO I HAVE NT READ IT I VE HEARD ALL ABOUT IT THOUGH .
THAT THIS THIS IS THE IDEA THAT I THINK IS ACTUALLY VERY IS IS WHAT I THINK WE SHOULD ALL REVERT TO THE IDEA THAT UM BASICALLY THEY SAID EVERYTHING HAPPENED IN KINDERGARTEN AND IN KINDERGARTEN WE LEARNED TO SHARE AND WE LEARNED TO UM PLAY WITH EACH OTHER WE LEARNED TO TAKE NAP AND TO TAKE NAPS AND WHENEVER WE D START A FIGHT WE D ALL APOLOGIZE AND HUG EACH OTHER .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW AND THAT WOULD BE ALL IF WE COULD JUST DO THE SAME THING SORT OF WITH WITH WITH EVERYBODY ELSE I SUSPECT WE D WE D BE FINE .
YES BUT PEOPLE GROW UP AND THEY FORGET .
YEAH UNFORTUNATELY .
WELL .
BECAUSE I OFTEN I OFTEN SORT OF WONDER HOW HAVING NEVER BEEN TO THE SOVIET UNION UM HOW DIFFERENT THE PEOPLE THERE REALLY ARE YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MUMBLEX .
THAT S ONE OF THE PLACES I WOULD MOST LIKE TO GO NOT RIGHT NOW OF COURSE .
YEAH .
BUT AT SOME POINT I WOULD LIKE TO GO TO MOSCOW AND AND TO JUST TO SEE ALL THESE THINGS THAT YOU CAN SEE ON TELEVISION NOW AND CAN READ ABOUT THAT TEN YEARS AGO WE DID NT HAVE THIS KIND OF INFORMATION .
RIGHT .
AND WE DID NT KNOW WHAT THINGS WERE LIKE SO .
I WOULD I WOULD LOVE TO GO THERE I MEAN LIKE AGAIN NOT NOW BUT AT SOME POINT TO GO SEE WHAT WHAT THIS IS LIKE I MEAN THIS THIS IS AMAZING BECAUSE THIS IS THIS IS AN THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT CULTURE THAT WANTS TO BE LIKE US LIKE YOU SAID BEFORE MUMBLEX SO IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO WATCH .
YEAH I AND I THE THE PEOPLE I JUST FEEL SO SORRY FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY THAT THEY CA NT I MEAN THEY THEY CA NT DO ANY THEY CA NT CHANGE IT THEY TRY THEY AND THEY THERE S NOTHING THAT THEY CAN DO .
YEAH THAT S THAT S AND THE ONES I EVEN FEEL SOMEWHAT WORSE FOR EVEN UM THE ONES IN LIKE THE BALTIC STATES .
UHHUH .
WHERE THEY DO NT HAVE A STRONG LEADER THEN YOU KNOW AT LEAST AT LEAST RUSSIA HAS SOME SORT OF STRONG LEADER I MEAN THEY HAVE YELTSIN WHO MAY WHO MAY YET SORT OF HELP RUSSIA .
YEAH .
BUT UM I MEAN THE BALTIC STATES I THINK ARE JUST SORT OF TRAPPED I MEAN THEY WERE TAKEN OVER COUPLE YOU KNOW NOT TOO LONG AGO .
YEAH .
AND THEN JUST SORT OF TOLD WELL YOU RE HERE NOW YOU RE PART OF OUR COUNTRY YOU BE THIS WAY IT S A I THINK IT S A SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS BUT .
IT S IT S PROBABLY NOT DISSIMILAR FROM THE UH WHAT ARE THEY THE THE THE I M TRYING TO THINK OF THE NAME OF THE THE MUMBLEX SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN NORTHERN IRAQ .
OH YEAH YEAH .
WHO ARE ACTUALLY COUNTRYMEN OF I MEAN SOME OF THEM WERE SPLIT OFF INTO ISRAEL I BELIEVE AND SOME OF THEM ARE IN TURKEY .
UHHUH .
WHEN ACTUALLY THEY THEY DO NT THEY RE THEIR OWN PEOPLE AND THEIR BELIEFS AND THEIR OWN CULTURE SYSTEM .
RIGHT .
AND THEY WERE SPLIT UP INTO THREE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES .
UHHUH YEAH WELL YEAH AND THAT .
AND AND THEY RE VERY DISSATISFIED AND THEY RE THEY RE CAUSING WARS RIGHT NOW AND I DO NT THINK IT S THAT DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THE BALTIC STATES ARE ARE GOING THROUGH .
UM UM UM UH ACTUALLY IT SOUNDS VERY I MEAN VERY SIMILAR THEY RE SORT OF BEING THEY WERE SORT OF FORCED AND NOW THEY JUST WANT TO SORT OF SPEAK UP AND SAY HEY WE WANT OUR PIECE .
YEAH .
AND THEY HAVE LIKE A PROBLEM THEY HAVE MUMBLEX MUSLIMS TO DEAL WITH .
UHHUH .
AS WELL AS SADDAM HUSSEIN I I MEAN I THINK THEIR BIG PROBLEM UP THERE IS YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY NOT ONLY ARE THEY VIC THERE S MORE THAN ONE GROUP FIGHTING FOR THE SAME PLACE THEY ALL WANT THE YOU KNOW WHEREAS THE BALTICS ARE SAYING OH WE WANT OUR OWN WE JUST WANT THIS LITTLE TINY PIECE OF LAND .
YEAH THE THE ONE THAT I THINK ONE OF THE WOM WOMEN THAT I WORK FOR IS MARRIED TO AN IRANIAN AND SO SHE HAS A LOT OF INSIGHT BECAUSE SHE KNOWS A LOT OF THE HISTORY .
UHHUH .
OF THE COUNTRIES OVER THERE AND WITHIN FIVE OR SIX COUNTRIES THERE ARE PROBABLY TEN CULTURES OF PEOPLE .
YES YES .
AND THAT S THEY DO NT ALL HAVE THEIR OWN COUNTRY AND AND SOME OF THEM ARE MAD ABOUT IT .
UHHUH UM ACTUALLY MY WIFE IS SYRIAN SO I I ALSO I KNOW SOME OF THE HISTORY MUMBLEX .
OH .
AND ACTUALLY THE OTHER FUNNY THING IS THAT I M I M JEWISH WE RE SORT OF LIKE THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE TALKS OURSELVES .
OH UHHUH .
SO WE I I KNOW I VE BEEN TO ISRAEL AND I KNOW AND I SORT OF TOURED THE AREA AND I KNOW THAT IT REALLY IS VERY LOTS OF DIFFERENT CULTURES IN ONE PLACE I MEAN .
UHHUH .
AND IT S THE SAME THING I THI IT S IT S ALMOST THE SAME THING OUT OUT IN THE SOVIET UNION RIGHT NOW THERE YOU KNOW THERE ARE YOU CA NT TAKE A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO JUST ARE NT THE SAME PEOPLE AND DO NT WANT TO BE TOGETHER AND PUT THEM TOGETHER FORCIBLY .
YEAH .
I MEAN WE DID IT COUPLE OF HUNDRED YEARS AGO HERE BUT THEY WANTED TO DO IT SO .
YEAH AND I DO NT THINK THE PEOPLE HERE TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO WERE THAT DIFFERENT I REALLY DO NT .
THAT S THAT S CERTAINLY TRUE .
I MEAN THEY HAD THE SAME IDEALS AND THE SAME BASIC BELIEFS .
RIGHT UH I WONDER I WONDER IF NOW THE PEOPLE IN THE SOVIET UNION DO NT HAVE IDEAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THAT .
THE THE THEY MIGHT THE BALTIC STATES MIGHT BE FEELING THE SAME WAY THAT OUR FOREFATHERS FELT WHEN THEY WERE LEAVING TO COME HERE .
AND SHE S EXPECTING THE END OF THIS MONTH AND SHE S THE ONLY ONE THAT LIVES NEAR BY .
OH WELL THAT WILL BE NICE THOUGH .
SO THE REST LIVE IN ONE LIVES IN CONNECTICUT AND COUPLE LIVES IN PITTSBURG AND ONE LIVES NEAR D C SO UH .
BUT STILL SORT OF UP IN THAT GENERAL .
YEAH .
AREA OF THE COUNTRY .
YEAH .
SO YOU CAN PROBABLY SEE THEM SOMETIMES .
YEAH WE SEE THEM ONCE IN A WHILE A COUPLE OF TIMES A YEAR AT LEAST .
YEAH .
AND THE ONES IN PITTSBURG OF COURSE WE SEE MORE OFTEN .
YEAH .
SO UH .
OKAY .
ALL RIGHT I M READY TO GO .
WELL UH WHAT KIND OF RECYCLING DO YOU HAVE IN YOUR AREA .
WELL THEY VE BEEN TRYING DIFFERENT THINGS ONE ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS SEEMS TO BE WE DO NT THEY DO NT HAVE ANYPLACE TO PUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT NEED RECYCLED .
UHHUH .
RIGHT NOW WE VE RECYCLED GLASS FOR YE BE YEARS BECAUSE WE HAVE A GLASS INDUSTRY IN OUR COMMUNITY .
OH WHAT WHICH ONE IS THAT .
OWENS .
OH UHHUH .
OWENS MUMBLEX UM SO GLASS HAS BEEN RECYCLED FOR A LONG TIME UH WE HAVE A CYCLING AREA SET UP HERE AT OUR HOUSE THE BOY SCOUTS HAVE AND THEY VE DONE THAT FOR YEARS UH THE STORES ARE RECYCLING THEIR PLASTIC BAGS NOW YOU CAN TAKE THEM BACK IN AND THEY HAVE BINS TO COLLECT THOSE .
UHHUH .
UH THE ALUMINUM CANS THEY TRY TO DO THE UH NEWSPAPERS AND UH THEY HAD TO CLOSE THEIR AREA DOWN BECAUSE THEY COULD NT SELL IT THEY WERE WHAT THEY WERE DOING WAS SHREDDING IT AND TRYING TO SELL IT TO FARMERS FOR BEDDING FOR THEIR ANIMALS .
UHHUH .
AND THAT TYPE OF THING AND THAT DID NT WORK BUT BUT SOMEBODY TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE CHARGING AS MUCH FOR IT AS THEY DID FOR STRAW .
OH .
WHICH IS WHY THEY COULD NT SELL IT .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW BECAUSE THE FARMERS WOULD BUY THE STRAW IF IT S A YOU KNOW SIMILAR PRICE .
SURE .
AND LET S SEE IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE OKAY I THINK BY THIS FALL IT S GOING TO BE REQUIRED THAT THE TOWN OF CLARION WHICH WE LL LIVE NEARBY WILL HAVE MANDATORY RECYCLING STARTED SO .
ON JUST PARTICULAR THINGS OR .
UH MAINLY THE GLASS THE ALUMINUM THE PLASTICS .
UHHUH .
UH .
WELL IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY RE DOING QUITE A BIT .
WELL WE RE WORKING HARD ON IT BECAUSE WE RE FIGHTING ALSO IN OUR AREA A LARGE HAZARDOUS WASTE INCINERATOR .
UH .
WHICH WE DO NOT WANT BUILT AND UH WE WOULD LIKE INDUSTRY TO DO MORE BEFORE THEY BUILD THESE BIG HUGE INCINERATORS .
YEAH .
AND UH WE WE JUST FEEL THEY SHOULD THEY SHOULD OFFER INDUSTRY SOME INCENTIVES TO DO MORE REDUCING OF THEIR WASTE PRODUCTS AND REUSING .
UHHUH .
THEM BECAUSE SOME OF THOSE COMPANIES THAT ARE DOING IT HAVE SAVE MONEY EVENTUALLY AT FIRST APPARENTLY IT COSTS MORE TO GET STARTED .
RIGHT .
BUT ONCE THEY GET ESTABLISHED THEN IT S A MONEY SAVING THING .
WELL OUR COMPANY DOES SOME THINGS ALL OF WHICH I COULD NT EVEN TELL YOU ABOUT I DO NT KNOW ALL OF THEM BUT .
AND WHAT IS T I .
UH TEXAS INSTRUMENTS .
OH OKAY .
YEAH .
GEE MY MY SON WORKS FOR NO NOT FOR THAT OKAY EXCUSE ME GO AHEAD .
WELL I I WAS JUST CURIOUS AS HOW YOU GOT HOOKED UP WITH THIS THIS SPEECH TYPE OF THING .
WELL MY SON WORKS IN UH FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HE S HE WORKS IN A COMPUTER LABORATORY .
OH AND HE .
AND UH IT WAS THROUGH HIM THAT THAT UH .
YEAH WELL HERE AT WORK UM EACH ONE OF US HAS TWO TRASH BASKETS IN OUR OFFICE AND ONE OF THOSE IS DESIGNED FOR ANY KIND OF PAPER PRODUCTS THAT UM THEY WANT TO USE YOU KNOW FOR RECYCLING THEY CA NT DEAL WITH EVERY TYPE .
UH MAYBE YOU COULD TELL ME WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OFFICE PAPER WASTE AND JUST LIKE NEWSPAPERS .
WELL I GUESS I DO NT KNOW SPECIFICALLY EXCEPT THAT UH FOR THE PAPER THAT THEY WANT TO RECYCLE THEY DO NOT WANT ANY NEWSPAPER UM AND THINGS LIKE CANDY WRAPPERS OR UH THAT TYPE OF THING LET S SEE I HAVE A LIST HERE UM THEY DO NT WANT LUNCH SACKS OR BROWN ENVELOPES UH PHONE BOOKS SO THERE ARE YOU KNOW A LOT OF KINDS OF THINGS THAT THEY DO NT WANT BUT THEN ANY KIND OF COMPUTER PAPER LETTERS UH BOOKLETS THEY LL EVEN TAKE THINGS THAT ARE BOUND .
UM .
UM AND IT DOES NT ALL HAVE TO BE LIKE WHITE THEY LL TAKE COLORED FOLDERS .
OH REALLY .
AND AND UH EVEN SOME OF THOSE CAN HAVE PLASTIC TABS ON THEM .
UM .
SO IT S IT S HARD TO KIND OF FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW WHICH THINGS ARE THE RIGHT ONES .
UM .
I MEAN I I LL FREQUENTLY HAVE TO LOOK AT THE LIST .
MUMBLEX .
IF IT S SOMETHING THAT I DO NT THROW AWAY ALL THE TIME .
YEAH .
BUT UM THEY DO THAT AND THEN WE USE UH DIFFERENT CHEMICALS AND THINGS AND I KNOW THAT ABOUT HOW THEY TAKE CARE OF THAT SORT .
RIGHT YEAH .
OF THING I I DO NT KNOW ALL THE DETAILS .
RIGHT YEAH .
BUT THEY RE REALLY ON TOP OF THAT .
YEAH .
AND THERE PROBABLY SOME OTHER THINGS THAT I DO NT ABOUT BECAUSE WE RE A REAL LARGE COMPANY .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND I JUST DO NT HAVE CONTACT WITH THEM .
UHHUH .
BUT IN OUR UH CITY WELL I LIVE IN A SUBURB OF DALLAS .
UHHUH .
AND THEY HAVE INITIATED A NEWSPAPER RECYCLING .
UHHUH .
WHEREBY THEY PICK IT UP FROM YOUR ALLEY UH ONE DAY A WEEK .
UHHUH .
AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS BUNDLE IT .
UHHUH .
UH ALL AROUND DALLAS THERE ARE A LOT OF RECYCLING CENTERS WHERE YOU CAN TAKE THINGS SOMETIMES FOR MONEY .
UHHUH .
UM BUT MOST OF THOSE ARE REAL FAR AWAY FROM LIKE WHERE I LIVE AT ANY RATE .
WELL IT WOULD BE INCONVENIENT TO IN OTHER WORDS TO .
VERY INCONVENIENT AND UM IT S JUST YOU KNOW HAS NT BEEN VERY PRACTICAL TO GET INTO A LOT OF THOSE THINGS IF THEY WOULD MAKE IT SOMETHING WHERE THEY YOU KNOW WOULD PICK IT UP AT THE CURB OR AT LEAST MAKE IT YOU KNOW DOWN THE STREET AND AT THE CORNER .
RIGHT .
TYPE OF THING UH .
MORE AREAS WHERE THEY WOULD PICK IT UP .
YEAH .
YEAH .
THAT WOULD NT BE SO BAD .
YEAH .
UM OUR GROCERY STORE LIKE YOURS WILL TAKE THE UH PLASTIC BAGS AND THEY LL ALSO TAKE THE THE PAPER BAGS BACK .
UM UHHUH .
BUT UM UH YOU MENTIONED THE UH GLASS TYPE OF STUFF THE REASON I ASK YOU ABOUT THAT IS YEARS AGO AND IT IT CHANGED NAMES SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE BUT UM MY DAD USED TO WORK FOR KNOX GLASS IN .
OH WELL KNOX IS JUST OVER THE HILL HERE .
KNOX PENNSYLVANIA OH REALLY .
YES UHHUH THEY .
YEAH IT S .
THEY NO LONGER ARE YOU KNOW ACTIVE .
YEAH THEY WERE TAKEN OVER BY GLASS CONTAINERS YEARS AGO .
YEAH .
AND BUT HE WORKED FOR THEM FOR LIKE THIRTYONE YEARS .
OH FOR HEAVEN S SAKE .
AND HE USED TO TRAVEL UP THERE TO KNOX QUITE A BIT .
YEAH .
AND AND I EVEN DID ONCE WHEN I WAS A CHILD .
OH FOR HEAVEN S SAKE .
YOU KNOW SO .
WELL WE ONLY LIVE PROBABLY ABOUT FIFTEEN TWENTY MILES FROM KNOX .
OH REALLY .
YEAH UHHUH .
YEAH WE I WAS LOOKING THROUGH OUR PHOTO ALBUM NOT LONG AGO AND THEY HAD .
HAD SOME PICTURES AND THINGS IN THERE OF KNOX .
I LL BE DARN YEAH .
BUT UH I GUESS THAT S ABOUT IT YOU KNOW AS FAR AS WHAT GOES ON THAT I KNOW ABOUT .
UHHUH UHHUH I THINK PEOPLE ARE GETTING MORE INTERESTED AND THEY ARE MORE CONCERNED AND WE RE JUST WE RE JUST REAL CONCERNED ABOUT THIS INCINERATOR BECAUSE WE REALLY THEY WANT TO PUT IT RIGHT IN UH IN BETWEEN TWO OF OUR MAIN WATER SHEDS THAT FEED THE CLARION RI RIVER .
UM .
AND UH WE WE JUST WE JUST DO NT WANT IT ANYPLACE WE FEEL THAT WE THAT THEY SHOULD GIVE BUSINESSES MORE INCENTIVES TO DO MORE RECYCLING AND MORE REDUCTION AND AND MORE REUSE AND ALL THOSE THINGS THAT COULD BE DONE .
YEAH .
WE WE JUST DO NT THINK WE DO NT THINK SOME OF THE POLITICIANS ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN OUR BEST INTERESTS .
YEAH THAT S .
AND UH IT S IT S BEEN A REAL STRUGGLE AND A HARDSHIP FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IN OUR AREA THAT WE VE HAVE YOU KNOW HAVE BEEN FIGHTING AGAINST THIS THING IN TRYING TO HAVE THINGS CHANGED .
UHHUH .
TO MAKE THEM MORE MORE RIGHT BUT UH .
WELL I THINK PROBABLY MORE PEOPLE YOU KNOW WOULD PARTICIPATE IF THEY JUST MADE IT A LITTLE EASIER .
UHHUH .
AND LIKE YOU SAY MAKE IT UM BETTER FOR COMPANIES TO DO THESE THINGS .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND GET INVOLVED IN IT WITHOUT HUGE COST TO THEM .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY .
RIGHT .
NO ONE WANTS TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY .
UH WELL .
JUST TO DEAL WITH TRASH YOU KNOW .
WE RE WE RE GOING TO PAY FOR THAT THAT WHETHER WE PAY INDUSTRY OR .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
PAY WE WE VE ALREADY PAID INDUSTRY FOR LIKE THESE SUPER FUND THAT S CLEANING UP WE PAID INDUSTRY FOR IT WE PAY ALL HELP TO PAY TO HAVE THEM HAUL IT AWAY FROM THEIR PLACE AND WHERE THEY PUT IT NOW THEY FOUND IT S NOT A SAFE PLACE IT S LEAKED AND NOW THEY HAVE TO CLEAN THOSE UP AND IT S OUR MONEY THAT S CLEANING THIS .
THAT S RIGHT .
STUFF UP AND NOW THEY WANT TO PUT IT IN THEY BURN IT AND THAT WILL MAKE ANOTHER HAZARDOUS DUMP .
UHHUH .
AND EVENTUALLY THEY LL HAVE TO DO SOMETHING WITH THAT WE LL PAY FOR IT AGAIN .
THAT S TRUE .
SO WHY NOT PAY INDUSTRY THIS IS MY FEELING WHY NOT PAY INDUSTRY A LITTLE MORE .
UHHUH .
AND REDUCE IT YOU KNOW AND AND NOT HAVE AS MUCH OF IT .
ALSO PROBABLY LOOK AT PACKAGING AND .
OH .
THAT SORT OF THING .
DEFINITELY .
WE DO NT WE DO NT NEED THREE QUARTERS OF .
HUHUH HUHUH .
WHAT WE GET .
NO BUT THEY THINK AND PROBABLY THEY RE RIGHT PEOPLE BUY IT EASIER .
I UH THAT S THEIR MARKETING .
YEAH YEAH .
WELL .
AND I KNOW PEOPLE WOULD BE WILLING TO DO MORE LIKE SAVING THEIR NEWSPAPERS AND THAT IF THEY HAD A PLACE TO TAKE THEM WE DO NT HAVE ANYPLACE RIGHT NOW THAT WILL TAKE THEM .
YEAH I I M GUESS OUR CITY YOU KNOW IN PICKING THEM UP MUST TAKE THEM SOMEWHERE ELSE .
UHHUH .
AND GET SOMETHING FOR THEM .
PROBABLY YEAH .
BUT I DO NT THAT IT S A BIG MONEY .
ARE YOU A VIETNAM VETERAN DUDLEY .
UH NO .
NO .
DO YOU HAVE FAMILY WHO WERE IN THE VIETNAM WAR .
UH NO MY FATHER WAS UH CAME IN RIGHT AFTER WORLD WAR TWO .
OKAY SO HE WAS TOO OLD AND YOU WERE TOO YOUNG RIGHT .
I AM TOO YOUNG YEAH .
ALL RIGHT DO YOU KNOW SOME FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN THERE .
UH YES .
OKAY .
A COUPLE .
OKAY HOW DID IT INFLUENCE THEM .
UH THE THE ONE GUY I WORKED WITH DOWN IN AUSTIN HATED IT UH HE WAS A LINEMAN DOWN THERE .
UHHUH .
AND WHILE HE WAS THERE HE CAUGHT SOME KIND OF A STRANGE DISEASE .
UHHUH .
AND UH ALL HIS HAIR FELL OUT AND HE HAD LIKE A HUNDRED AND FIVE FEVER FOR A WHILE AND .
UHHUH .
AND UH .
UH WHAT ABOUT LONG LASTING EFFECTS ON HIM HAS HE STILL SUFFERING FROM THOSE PROBLEMS .
I DO NOT THINK HE WAS IN COMBAT .
UHHUH .
SO .
WELL I HAVE TALKED WITH A NUMBER OF VIETNAM VETERANS AND I REALLY I HAD NO ONE DIRECTLY RELATED TO ME INVOLVED .
UHHUH .
BUT UH MY SISTER S HUSBAND WAS IN VIETNAM AND IT IT REALLY MADE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MAN OUT OF HIM .
UHHUH .
HE WENT TO VIETNAM ONE MAN AND CAME BACK ANOTHER NOT BETTER .
YEAH .
THEN UH ANOTHER FRIEND OF MINE WENT AND HE WAS IN COMBAT BUT HE CAME BACK AND HE SAID OKAY THAT IS IT THAT IS BEHIND ME I AM GOING ON WITH MY LIFE MUCH LIKE WHAT ROGER STAUBACH DID .
RIGHT .
HE WAS UH HE WAS A VIETNAM WAR VETERAN .
YEAH .
AND UH .
BUT HE WAS IN THE NAVY THOUGH .
YEAH .
HE WAS .
THAT IS TRUE .
IT MAKES A LOT OF DIFFERENCE .
RIGHT AND BUT UH MOST OF THE FOLKS THAT I HAVE MET THAT WERE ACTUALLY ON THE LAND OR IN COMBAT ARE STILL STILL CARRY A LOT OF ANGER .
UHHUH .
THEY REALLY DO AND UH I I I I REALLY DO NOT THINK THAT WE DID THOSE YOUNG MEN RIGHT .
HUH .
I THINK THAT UH DESERT STORM .
SHOWS A LOT OF LEARNING SINCE THAT TIME .
OH YEAH .
UH .
WELL THE ARMED FORCES DID SO MUCH TO YOU KNOW AGENT ORANGE THEY DID SO MUCH TO THEIR OWN PEOPLE ALL DURING THAT TIME .
YEAH THAT IS TRUE .
YOU KNOW AND THEY TA THEY TAKE A .
YEAH .
EVEN NOW UH THEY TAKE A FREE HAND AS FAR AS MEDICINE AND UH YOU KNOW HOW THEY TREAT THE WAR CASUALTIES YOU KNOW IF YOU COME BACK AND YOUR LEG IS BLOWN OFF .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW OR OR IT IS HANGING BY A THREAD THEY STILL CA NT PUT IT BACK TOGETHER NOW BUT .
UHHUH .
BUT WHAT THEY DO AFTERWARDS AND HOW THEY RE REHABILITATE YOU .
WELL YOU KNOW ONE OF THE MOST TROUBLESOME THINGS THAT I HAVE ENCOUNTERED AS A RESULT IS THE INCREDIBLE INFLUX OF SOUTHEAST ASIANS INTO THIS COUNTRY .
UHHUH .
SINCE THAT CONFLICT .
YEAH .
UH NOT SO .
MUCH THAT I SAY .
I DO NOT WANT YOU HERE BUT THERE IS JUST SUCH A SURGE OF SOUTHEAST ASIANS IT HAS AFFECTED THE CULTURE OF THIS COUNTRY UH .
OH YEAH IT S AB .
VERY MUCH .
IT S ABOUT NINE OR TEN PERCENT NOW .
YEAH YEAH YEAH WELL UH THE CULTURE IS CHANGING LOOK HOW MUCH MORE ORIENTAL FOOD WE HAVE RESTAURANTS NOW .
UHHUH .
FOR EXAMPLE UH EVEN TEN YEARS AGO THERE WERE NOT THAT MANY A LOT OF SHOPS ARE ARE OPERATED BY SOUTHEAST ASIANS .
THAT S TRUE .
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE COMPLAINED IN THE SCHOOLS THERE IS A CULTURE CHANGE THERE THE SOUTHEAST ASIANS SEEM TO BE VERY HUNGRY THERE SEEM TO BE VERY STUDIOUS AND UH TENDS TO CAUSE OUR KIDS TO REALLY HAVE TO BUCKLE DOWN TO KEEP UP WITH THEM WHICH IS NOT BAD .
NO .
NOT REALLY UH BUT IT MIGHT IN THE LONG RUN YOU CAN SEE WHERE SCHOLARSHIPS FOR EXAMPLE .
UHHUH .
UH EVEN JOBS UH JOBS THAT WOULD NORMALLY GO TO AN AMERICAN WITH A LESSER EDUCATION MIGHT BE GOING TO TO SOME OF THESE PEOPLE HERE AND THAT IS ALL A RESULT OF OF OF VIETNAM AND AND YOU SEE A LOT OF .
A LOT OF MEN THAT WERE OVER THERE BROUGHT FAMILIES BACK .
YEAH THAT IS .
UH AND IT CONCERNS ME THAT THERE IS PROBABLY A LOT OF MIXED BREED YOUNGSTERS STILL THERE .
UHHUH .
AND I WOULD BE CONCERNED OR INTERESTED TO FIND OUT HOW THEY ARE DOING NOW .
WELL THEY ARE PROBABLY NOT DOING VERY WELL AT ALL .
I KNOW THAT THERE .
BECAUSE I KNOW THERE IS THERE IS STILL PEOPLE EVEN IN THE DALLAS AREA THERE ARE THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE TRYING TO GET SOME MEMBER OF THEIR FAMILY BACK FROM UH VIETNAM .
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT P O W S .
UH .
OR .
UH .
MISSING IN ACTIONS .
NA NATIVE VIETNAMESE PEOPLE .
NATIVE VIETNAMESE PEOPLE .
YEAH .
OKAY .
THEY WERE LOST YOU KNOW WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE AND AND THEY C NEVER DID GET BACK OR .
OH I HAD NOT THAT THAT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO ME .
YEAH .
THAT WOULD BE .
AND UH .
AN INTERESTING CONCEPT .
AND AS IS REALLY A BIG WASTE BECAUSE THEY DID NT THEY DID NT WIN THEY DID NT REGAIN ANY OF THE LAND THAT THEY HAD IT SPILLED OVER INTO UH NOW I CA NT EVEN THINK OF THE COUNTRY BUT .
CAMBODIA .
YEAH CAMBODIA .
UHHUH .
AND TO LAOS AND .
UHHUH .
AND ALL THEY DID IS RUN AND HIDE .
UHHUH .
AND THEY WERE NOT REALLY FIGHTING YOU KNOW IT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME AS DESERT STORM IF ALL THEY HAD BEEN FIGHTING WAS NORTH VIETNAM .
UHHUH .
BUT AND I AM NOT EVEN SURE WHO WAS INVOLVED MORE WHETHER IT WAS CHINA OR RUSSIA .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THEY WERE POURING THEY WERE POURING WEAPONS IN THERE AND AND ADVISING WELL DIGGING TUNNELS FOR THEM .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND THERE IS NO WAY THAT THEY COULD EVER CATCH THEM .
WELL I THINK THE TERRAIN HAD A LOT TO DO WITH THE THE SUCCESS OF DESERT STORM AS OPPOSED TO THAT IN VIETNAM .
YEAH THAT IS RIGHT .
YOU KNOW THERE IS INCREDIBLE COVER .
UHHUH .
IN VIETNAM AND YOU CA NT FIND MUCH COVER ON IN A SAND .
YEAH .
DUNE .
YEAH ALL THEY CAN DO IS DIG IN AND THEY .
THAT IS RIGHT .
YOU KNOW AND THEN THEY TRY TO CAMOUFLAGE THE TOP .
UHHUH UHHUH .
WELL NOW EVEN I THINK EVEN NOW AND IN VIETNAM THEY COULD PROBABLY HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB BECAUSE THEY COULD THEY COULD KILL ALL THOSE PLANTS YOU KNOW WHICH WOULD DEVASTATE THE COUNTRY AS FAR AS FARMING FROM THEN ON BUT AND THE AND THE CORPS OF ENGINEERS I THINK DO A BETTER JOB NOW LIKE THEY DID IN DESERT STORM BECAUSE .
WELL .
THEY HAD HE HE DUG A BUNCH OF MOATS AND FILLED THEM WITH OIL .
UHHUH .
AND HE SET A LOT OF BOOBY TRAPS ALL ALONG THE WAY AS THEY WENT AND THEY HAD TO YOU KNOW THEY HAD TO BLOW THEM UP OR .
UHHUH .
OR DISARM THEM .
UHHUH .
AND THEN THEY HAD TO FILL IN LITTLE BRIDGES ALL THE WAY WHERE HE WHERE HE HAD MADE THOSE MOATS .
WHAT WORLD WAR DO YOU THINK THEY FOUND THE EXPERIENCE FOR THAT .
UH .
DO NT YOU THINK THEY LEARNED FROM THE MISTAKES IN VIETNAM .
W YEAH PARTIALLY .
PART OF IT IS THAT .
UHHUH .
PART OF IT IS TECHNOLOGY .
YEAH PART OF IT IS TECHNOLOGY YEAH .
BUT .
BECAUSE .
WHEN WHEN .
ALL GO AHEAD .
WHEN YOU GET INTO TROUBLE LIKE THAT IN A PLACE LIKE VIETNAM YOU DO TEND TO ANALYZE THE PROBLEMS THAT YOU GET INTO AND YOU SAY NEVER MORE .
YEAH .
AND AND YOU OVERCOME THOSE PROBLEMS AND YOU ARE PREPARED NEXT TIME .
I THINK THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THEY HAVE THEY HAVE PRETTY MUCH AVOIDED GETTING INVOLVED IN SOUTH AMERICA BECAUSE .
UHHUH .
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THEY WERE LOOKING FOR NORIEGA AND THEY LOST HIM FOR FOUR HOURS WHEN THEY WERE RIGHT ON TOP OF HIM .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
HE PROBABLY JUST WENT RIGHT DOWN INTO A TUNNEL .
SURE SURE SURE WELL I KNOW THAT UH FROM A PERSONAL STANDPOINT PEOPLE WAS ONE OF THE FINEST ASSETS THAT WE LOST WE DID NOT ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY LOSE THEM THEY DID NOT LOSE THEIR LIVES BUT THEY LOST A WHOLE LOT OF THE LIFE THEY MIGHT HAVE HAD .
YEAH THAT IS RIGHT .
UH BEING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PEOPLE I HAD DINNER MONDAY NIGHT WITH A VIETNAM VETERAN WHO IS JUST NOW BEGINNING TO RECOVER FROM THE DRUG AND ALCOHOL STRUGGLE THAT HE HAD .
UHHUH .
THAT IS A LONG TIME TO SUFFER .
YEAH AND THEY THEY REALLY NEED EVERYBODY THAT HAS THAT HAS STOOD THERE IT S WHEN I IN VIETNAM I THINK IT WAS MUCH CLOSER CONTACT YOU STAND THERE WITH A RIFLE AND BLOW A A PIECE OF SOMEBODY APART .
UHHUH .
OR BLOW THEIR HEAD OFF .
UHHUH .
AND THAT HAS TO AFFECT YOU IF YOU ARE HUMAN YOU KNOW .
OH YEAH YEAH .
SO THEY HAD TO .
I CA NT UH .
WORK ALL THAT THAT ANGER OUT AND THE AND THE NIGHTMARES THAT COME ALONG WITH IT .
OH YEAH YOU BET .
I DO NOT .
YOU BET .
I DO NOT REALLY THINK THAT ANYBODY CAN EVER FOR FORGET THAT BUT THEY CAN THEY CAN REASON AND .
UHHUH .
AND TRY TO ADJUST TO TO WHY THEY WERE THERE .
YEAH WELL YOU SEE THAT IS WHAT THE VETERANS ARE SO ANGRY ABOUT NOW THEY SAY WELL WE RE .
GOING TO LISTEN TO THIS AND WE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT THIS FIND OUT WHAT OUR MISTAKES WERE AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE THEM AGAIN BUT THAT DOES NOT UNDO THE ONES THAT WERE DONE AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES THE VETERANS ANGRY .
RIGHT .
AND I CAN NOT BLAME THEM I DO NOT KNOW A SOLUTION .
UHHUH .
BUT I SURE CAN NOT BLAME THEM FOR BEING ANGRY ON THE OTHER HAND YOU KNOW YOU CAN BE ANGRY ABOUT SOMETHING FOR A VERY LONG TIME OR YOU CAN SAY WELL THAT IS THE WAY IT IS AND GO ON WITH YOUR LIFE UH .
RIGHT .
FOR THE MOST PART I WISH THAT IT HAD NOT HAPPENED .
YEAH .
BUT IT DID .
AND THAT .
SO .
AND THAT WAS THAT WAS IN THE IN THE ERA WHEN KENNEDY WAS PRESIDENT THAT THEY WERE AFRAID OF EVERYTHING .
THAT IS RIGHT .
YOU KNOW AND AND AND THEY F INITIALLY GOT INTO IT BECAUSE OF EISENHOWER AND HE JUST HE DID NOT WANT TO BE IN IT ANY MORE THAN THAN WHAT WE STARTED OUT IN AUGUST WITH DESERT STORM .
OH YEAH .
AND THEN IT JUST BLEW UP INTO THE WAR .
WELL IT HAS BEEN THAT WAY FOR A VERY VERY LONG TIME THOUGH I CAN REMEMBER WHEN I WAS IN THE SIXTH GRADE AND THAT WAS MANY YEARS AGO .
UHHUH .
WE WERE READING ABOUT THE FRENCH .
FRENCH YEAH .
STRUGGLING WITH THAT .
UHHUH .
IN SOUTHEAST ASIA SO AND AND AND THE ASIANS HISTORICALLY HAVE ALWAYS HAD THESE KINDS OF WARS GOING ON .
RIGHT YEAH .
THERE THERE HAS NOT BEEN A LOT OF PEACE IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD .
UHHUH .
I REALLY I DO NOT KNOW I WE SHOULD NOT HAVE MAYBE GOTTEN INVOLVED BUT IF WE DID WE CERTAINLY SHOULD HAVE SUPPORTED OUR PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE .
YEAH .
MORE SO SUPPORTED THEM WHEN THEY GOT HOME .
RIGHT .
AND UH I AM AFRAID THAT THEY WERE TREATED AS CASTAWAYS FOR THE MOST PART .
EXACTLY .
AND I I SAW THE MOVIE .
BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY AND I THINK IT DID A GOOD JOB DEPICTING THE TEMPERAMENT OF THE TIMES .
UHHUH YEAH MORE THAN WHAT WAS APOCALYPSE NOW .
UHHUH WELL DUDLEY HAVE WE PRETTY WELL DISCUSSED THE SUBJECT .
YEAH I THINK SO .
WELL I THINK SO I ENJOYED TALKING TO YOU .
YES IT WAS NICE TALKING TO YOU .
UHHUH .
OKAY BYEBYE .
BYEBYE .
THERE YOU GO .
UHHUH .
WELL JEAN THE SUBJECT IS JURY TRIALS AND SHOULD THE JURY RECOMMEND UH SENTENCING .
UHHUH .
NOW MY PERSONAL OPINION I DO NT KNOW UH UH HERE LATELY IT SEEMS WELL UP UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO I GUESS THERE JUST TOO MANY LIBERALS ABOUT AND PERMITTING TOO MANY OH THEY JUST BROADEN THE HUMAN RIGHTS TO TO COVER JUST ABOUT EV EVERYBODY AND I DO NT THINK THOSE GUILTY OF COMMITTING CAPITAL CRIMES SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO GO SPEND A FEW YEARS IN JAIL AND BE TURNED LOSE ON PAROLE .
UHHUH .
IT S JUST NOT RIGHT .
I THINK I AGREE WITH THAT VERY MUCH .
AND THEREFORE .
I DO YOU .
I THINK JURIES SHOULD BE ABLE TO RECOMMEND SENTENCING .
DO YOU THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE LISTENING TO A TRIAL PUT THEMSELVES IN A POSITION LIKE THAT AND SAY I WOULD NEVER DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND IT S FOR THEM TO BELIEVE THAT SOMEBODY ELSE COULD DO THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE .
YES VERY POSSIBLY SO MANY OF US HAVE LED SHELTERED LIVES .
UHHUH .
THAT UH WHEN WE GO INTO A SIT IN ON A JURY I VE NEVER DONE IT MYSELF .
I NEVER HAVE EITHER .
UNFORTUNATELY I WISH I COULD HAVE .
IS THERE A REASON WHY YOU HAVE NEVER .
I VE JUST NEVER BEEN CALLED UP .
UHHUH MY HUSBAND WORKS AS A POLICE MAN SO I ALWAYS ASSUMED THAT THAT WAS WHY I WAS NEVER CALLED .
WELL NOW THAT S POSSIBLE .
UHHUH .
BUT UH I WAS CALLED UP AS AN ALTERNATE ONCE BUT I .
UHHUH .
NEVER MADE IT TO THE JURY .
UHHUH UH DO THEY HAVE SUCH A THING NOW AS A SIX MAN JURY .
NOT THAT I KNOW OF .
SOMEBODY TOLD ME THE OTHER DAY THAT THERE IS MUMBLEX WHAT THEY CALL A SIX MAN JURY AND I HAD NEVER HEARD OF SUCH THING AND I WONDERED IF IT WAS TRUE .
UHHUH UH I VE NEVER HEARD OF IT .
I NEVER HAD EITHER BUT I JUST WONDERED UH ANOTHER QUESTION WAS SHOULD A CRIMINAL CASE SHOULD THE JURY BE UNANIMOUS ON THEIR DECISION AND THAT I WAS NT SURE ON EITHER WHETHER IT SHOULD BE UNANIMOUS OR NOT .
UH WELL THERE AGAIN UH I SUPPOSE IT SHOULD BE .
THAT WOULD MEAN THEY ALL WOULD HAVE TO DECIDE .
EXACTLY .
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER .
IS IT GUILT OR INNOCENCE BUT THEN AGAIN SO MANY TIMES YOU GET ONE OR TWO HOLDOUTS AND AND .
UHHUH .
IT PERMITS THE CRIMINAL TO GET A RETRIAL .
YEAH YEAH .
AND THERE THAT S NOT TOO BAD IN THIS SENSE BECAUSE YOU MIGHT GET SOMEONE IN THEIR THAT S A VICTIM OF CIRCUMSTANCES .
UHHUH .
I MEAN THAT S HAPPENED .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND GIVING THEM ANOTHER TRIAL MIGHT GIVE THEM ADDITIONAL TIME TO UH PROVE THEIR INNOCENCE .
BRING SOME OF THESE THINGS OUT .
YES .
UHHUH .
WE CA NT OVERLOOK THE FACT THAT THERE ARE INNOCENT PEOPLE THAT DO GET INVOLVED IN JURY TRIALS .
UN APPARENTLY THERE ARE I I I SINCE MY HUSBAND WORKED AS A POLICEMAN I CA NT BELIEVE THERE ARE VERY MANY PEOPLE THAT COME TO TRIAL THAT HAVE ARE NOT GUILTY OF SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
SOME PART OF WHATEVER THEY RE ACCUSED OF .
UHHUH .
I HAVE I STILL HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A PROBLEM WITH THAT UH BUT I WOULD SUPPOSE THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES YOU RE IN THE WRONG PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME OR KNOW THE WRONG PERSON AT THE RIGHT TIME .
OH THAT S IT AND YOU JUST MIGHT RESEMBLE SOMEBODY .
UHHUH .
UH OUT HERE IN TEXAS WE HAD A A A GREAT MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE IT WAS FINALLY AFTER NINE YEARS IT WAS FINALLY UH TAKEN CARE OF .
UHHUH .
WE HAD A BLACK MAN WAS ACCUSED SIMPLY BECAUSE HE RESEMBLED .
OH .
UH SOMEONE WHO STUC WHO HELD UP A SEVEN ELEVEN I THINK IT WAS .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND EVEN THOUGH HE HAD WITNESSES THAT SAID THAT UH HE WAS AT WORK AND HE HAD ALL SORTS OF CHARACTER WITNESSES AND WHAT NOT .
THEY STILL FOUND HIM GUILTY .
THEY FOUND HIM GUILTY .
WHEN PEOPLE SAID HE WAS AT WORK .
WELL THEY SAID IT W THIS THIS HAPPENED DURING LUNCH TIME .
UHHUH .
AND HE COULD HAVE DISAP GOTTEN AWAY AT LUNCH TIME .
UHHUH .
AND COMMITTED THE ROBBERY .
YEAH .
BUT AFTER NINE YEARS WELL AS A MATTER OF FACT THEY MADE A T V SHOW ABOUT IT AFTER NINE YEARS THEY FINALLY CAME UP WITH EVIDENCE AND PROVED TO PROVE THAT HE WAS INNOCENT .
OH FOR HEAVEN S SAKE SO THERE S NINE YEARS OF THAT MAN S LIFE GONE .
EXACTLY .
UHHUH .
NOW THAT JUST WAS NOT FAIR .
NO HUHUH .
SO .
YEAH I GUESS THAT S WHERE A LOT OF THE PROBLEM LIES WE RE WE BEND OVER BACKWARDS PROTECTING THE GUILTY PEOPLE THE ONE S THAT ARE ON TRIAL .
YES .
AND .
UNFORTUNATELY THAT S WHAT HAPPENS .
AND WE OFTEN FORGET ABOUT THE ONE THE INJUSTICE HAS BEEN DONE TO BECAUSE I BET THEY STILL SAY OUR SYSTEM IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD .
WELL IT S NOT THE UH UH IT S NOT THE BEST SYSTEM BUT IT S THE BEST ONE IN THE WORLD .
YEAH IT S THE BEST ONE THAT EXISTS I GUESS .
UHHUH AND UNFORTUNATELY WE JUST HAVE TO PUT UP WITH A LOT OF THINGS AND THEY TRY TO SOLVE THEM AND EVERYTHING BUT UH I DO NT KNOW THE SUPREME COURT WELL I M I M I M STILL RANCLED ABOUT THEIR DECISION TO PERMIT BURNING OF THE FLAG .
OH I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE I THINK THEY VE LOST SIGHT OF SOME THINGS THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR COUNTRY .
WELL IT THE THE THE FIRST AMENDMENT DEFINITELY SAYS FREEDOM OF SPEECH .
UHHUH .
NOT FREEDOM OF ACTION .
YEAH .
AND UH UH WELL THAT JUST RANCLES ME NO I SWEAR IF I EVER SAW SOMEBODY TO UH BURNING A FLAG I D I D TRY TO KILL THEM I WOULD .
THAT BAD HUH I WOULD NT LIKE IT BUT I DO NT KNOW IF I D GO THAT FAR .
WELL I HAPPEN TO BE A FLAG FREAK I SERVED I WAS IN THE SERVICE .
UHHUH .
I WAS IN KOREA .
UHHUH .
AND UH WELL I SAW WHAT THE RED IN THE FLAG REPRESENTS .
YEAH WELL I THINK PRIDE IN OUR COUNTRY AND OUR FLAG IS SO IMPORTANT IT S IMPORTANT IN SO MANY FACETS OF OUR LIVES .
UHHUH .
AND UH I I FEEL LIKE IF THEY DO NT PEOPLE DO NT LIKE WHAT OUR FLAG STANDS FOR THEY RE WELCOME TO GO SOME PLACE ELSE .
YEAH SEE WHAT THEY .
THERE S NOBODY HOLDING THEM HERE .
SEE HOW THEY D LIKE IT UNDER ANOTHER FLAG .
RIGHT THEY D SOON BE BACK I M SURE .
UHHUH .
YEAH .
WELL JEAN WE SEEM TO BE OF THE SAME OPINIONS HERE .
UHHUH .
I HOPE THEY GET SOMETHING OUT OF THIS .
YEAH I DO NT KNOW ABOUT THE JUDGE MAKING THE DECISION IF THAT S DO YOU THINK THAT S GOOD .
OH .
YOU KNOW LIKE IF A JURY .
PASSING SENTENCE .
UHHUH .
WELL UH UH YES BUT I THINK THE JURY SHOULD BE ABLE TO RECOMMEND .
MAKE A RECOMMENDATION .
YES .
DO THEY SOMETIMES MAKE A RECOMMENDATION .
OH YES YES .
THAT S WHAT I WAS THINKING THEY THEY SOMETIMES DO .
I DO NT KNOW IF THAT S A REGULAR PROCEDURE OR WHAT BUT I KNOW I M ALWAYS HEARING THAT UH WELL THE JURY CAME IN WITH A GUILTY VERDICT AND THEY RECOMMENDED .
AND THEY RECOMMEND .
TWENTY YEARS OR SOMETHING .
YEAH AND THEN THE JUDGE HAS THE FINAL DECISION .
YES .
ON WHAT DOES REALLY HAPPEN YEAH .
OF COURSE NOW THE JURY MAY NOT BE COMPLETELY AWARE OF ALL THE RAMIFICATIONS OF A SENTENCE .
UHHUH .
THEY MAY NOT KNOW THAT IF YOU GIVE HIM TWENTY YEARS HE CAN GET OUT IN FIVE .
WELL I THINK THAT S WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK BOY THEY RE GETTING PUT AWAY FOR A LONG TIME BUT ACTUALLY THEIR CHANCE COURSE WHEN A LOT OF TIMES WHEN THEY COME UP FOR PAROLE THEY RE DENIED IT DEPENDS ON .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY RE WHAT THEY D BEEN GUILTY OF AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS I GUESS .
YEAH BUT TOO MANY TIMES THEY THEY ARE PERMITTED TO GO OUT ON PAROLE AND .
UHHUH A LOT SLIP THROUGH THE PROTECTIVE WHATEVER THEY HAVE TO DO AND THERE ARE BAD ONES THAT DO SLIP BACK OUT AND END UP HURTING SOMEBODY AGAIN .
YES THEY JUST GO OUT AND REPEAT THEIR CRIMES .
UHHUH UHHUH .
WELL THERE WELL THEY SAY AFTER THREE OFFENSES ITS AUTOMATICALLY LIFE IN PRISON BUT I THINK THEY OUGHT TO MAKE IT TWO OFFENSES .
UHHUH I ALWAYS THOUGHT THERE WAS THERE WAS WRONG IT SEEMS SOMETIMES THAT LIKE SOMEBODY WHO IS STEALING A LOAF OF BREAD TO FEED HIS FAMILY GOT MORE JAIL SENTENCE THAN SOMEBODY MAYBE THAT KILLED SOMEBODY .
UHHUH .
IT SEEMED LIKE THERE SOMETIMES THERE S NOT A GOOD THE BALANCE IS NT RIGHT IT DOES NT MAKE SENSE .
YEAH VERY TRUE WELL HERE AGAIN NOW THERE IS WHERE RACE SEEMS TO REAR ITS UGLY HEAD SO FREQUENTLY .
UHHUH .
RACE OR NATIONALITY EVEN .
UHHUH YEAH .
BUT UH LIKE YOU SAID IT S IT S NOT THE BEST SYSTEM BUT IT S THE BEST ONE WE VE GOT .
YEAH RIGHT SO LET S PUT UP WITH IT I GUESS .
UHHUH .
IMPROVE IT IF WE CAN IF WE EVER GET A CHANCE .
SURE ENOUGH .
SO .
JEAN IT S BEEN AWFUL NICE TALKING TO YOU .

YEAH .
YOU KNOW AND AND UH SO I M ABOUT FORTY AND WHATEVER .
UHHUH AROUND THERE HUH .
SO YEAH .
WELL YOU RE YOU RE JUST A YOUNGSTER THEN .
YEAH I M JUST A .
I PASSED THE FIFTY .
SPRING CHICKEN I GUESS .
SO I GUESS OUR TOPIC S GOING TO BE CHANGES IN THE WOMEN S ROLES SO .
WELL .
IT SHOULD BE REAL INTERESTING .
RIGHTO .
SO YOU THINK WE RE READY .
I THINK I M READY .
OKAY OKAY UH YOU WANT TO START OFF .
WELL LET S SEE THE CHANGES I VE SEEN IN WOMEN S ROLES UH SINCE I AM IN THE FORTY AGE I M A FIFTIES BABY .
UHHUH .
UH AND FROM MY MOTHER S GENERATION TO MY GENERATION IT S JUST A VERY VERY WIDE UH IT S BEEN A BIG CHANGE .
VERY MUCH YEAH YEAH .
VERY MUCH AND I THINK YOU LL HAVE TO AGREE AND .
YES .
AND SINCE WE WERE IN UH SORT OF THE GROUND LEVEL THE BRA BURNING OF THE SIXTIES .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND AND WE DID NT REALLY KNOW WHAT THE AGENDA WAS GOING TO BE .
UHHUH .
UH AND I THINK YOU KNOW IT GOT OFF TO A REALLY RADICAL IT HAS A RADICAL FRINGE TO IT THAT UH I VE SORT OF BACKED AWAY FROM .
I THINK ALL THINGS GET STARTED SOMETIMES IN THAT MANNER .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW THEY COME IN THAT WAY .
AND TO MAKE A CHANGE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO MAKE A SPLASH .
UHHUH UHHUH .
BUT TO CONTINUE IN THAT VEIN I THINK IT GOT A LITTLE BIT WARPED AND OFF THE TRACK .
UHHUH .
IN SEVERAL AREAS BUT I REALLY DO THINK THAT WOMEN HAVE MADE A CONTRIBUTION .
UHHUH .
UH TO HUMAN BEINGS I MEAN TO BE HUMAN AND WHAT IT S LIKE AND HAVE FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS AND IT S OKAY AND I THINK UH YOU KNOW ON THE OTHER HAND I DO NT KNOW THAT MEN HAVE CHANGED THAT MUCH SO IN IN CONTRAST TO THE WOMEN S CHANGES UH YOU KNOW THE MEN STAY STEADY .
UHHUH .
AND THEN THE WOMEN CHANGE AROUND THEM .
I HAD NT THOUGHT MUCH ABOUT THAT BUT THAT IS TRUE THAT .
UH I THINK MEN ARE TRYING .
UHHUH SOME OF THEM .
BUT THEY DO NT HAVE A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF MEN .
NO .
TO UH HELP THEM OUT AND .
NO .
UH WHAT S CHANGING THEM THOUGH IS THE ECONOMIC SITUATION .
UHHUH .
WHERE BOTH .
VERY MUCH .
TEAM IT HAS TO BE A TEAM PARTNERSHIP NOW .
UHHUH .
AND THEY BOTH HAVE TO WORK .
UHHUH .
AND THEY BOTH HAVE TO RAISE THE CHILDREN .
UHHUH .
IF WE RE GOING TO HAVE ANY KIND OF FUTURE AT ALL .
UHHUH .
AND AND THAT I THINK HAS BEEN THE DOWNFALL OF THE LAST TEN YEARS .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THE ME OH I DO NT KNOW THE THE YUPPIEDOM .
UHHUH .
THE WHATEVER IT WAS THE YOU KNOW WOMEN DID NT KNOW HOW TO GO ABOUT DOING THE CAREERS AND THEY WANTED TO COMPETE WITH MEN THEY WANTED TO BE LIKE MEN .
UHHUH .
AND THAT S WRONG .
YEAH .
I THINK THEY FINALLY DISCOVERED THAT THEY DO NT WANT TO BE LIKE MEN MEN .
NOT NO THEY THEY HURT THEMSELVES A LITTLE BIT IN THAT WAY .
ABSOLUTELY AND SO THAT S YOU KNOW THEY SORT OF THREW THE THING BACK ANOTHER YOU KNOW TEN YEARS .
UHHUH .
THAT THEY VE HAD TO YOU KNOW RESTRUCTURE BUT I SAW THE GREATEST TSHIRT THE OTHER DAY .
I GOT TO GET SOME FOR ALL MY MEN FRIENDS .
IT SAYS LET MEN RUN THE WORLD WOMEN HAVE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO .
THERE YOU GO THERE S A LOT OF TRUTH IN THAT .
RIGHT .
YEAH .
BUT UH I THINK MEN AND WOMEN BOTH HAVE VALUABLE VALUABLE ASSETS TO OFFER .
UHHUH .
AND YOU KNOW WE SHOULD NT WE WERE MADE DIFFERENTLY .
THAT S RIGHT .
HOWEVER YOU COME TO THAT CONCLUSION WE WERE BIOLOGICALLY PHYSIOLOGICALLY MADE DIFFERENTLY AND THERE IS GREAT WONDERMENT .
UHHUH .
IN THAT AND UH YOU KNOW WE SHOULD RESPECT THAT IN EACH OTHER SO .
YES IT SHOULD NT BE DESTROYED .
RIGHT .
YEAH YEAH .
AND AND YOU KNOW JUST SORT OF ALL S SWOOSHED INTO ONE CHANNEL .
UHHUH UHHUH .
SORT OF THING IT S IT S VIVA LA DIFFERENCE .
YEAH YEAH .
SOMEONE SAID THAT .
YEAH .
AND I THINK THAT YOU CAN TRULY RESPECT THE OTHER PERSON I MEAN YOU KNOW TOM IS JUST ALWAYS SAYING WHAT A MYSTERY YOU ARE YOU KNOW YOU KNOW DEPENDS .
WELL THAT S KIND OF MAKES IT EXCITING .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
WELL THAT DEPENDS ON WHAT DAY OF THE MONTH IT IS .
YEAH .
BUT UH I DO NT KNOW I GUESS WE VE GOTTEN MORE OF A IN IN TERMS OF THAT I THINK WE VE GOT MORE OF A SENSE OF HUMOR ABOUT EACH OTHER .
UHHUH .
AND OUR ROLES AND BUT IT S STILL A CHALLENGE BEING IN A MARRIAGE AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THOSE ROLES AND .
I THINK NOW WHEN BOTH ARE WORKING THEY HAVE A MORE CH MORE OF A CHANCE OF WORKING TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY RE STARTING OUT THAT WAY .
YEAH WELL THAT S THAT S A VERY DIFFERENT WAY TO DO .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW THE WOMAN DOES NT START OFF AT HOME .
RIGHT .
RAISING THE KIDS AND GOES BACK INTO HER CAREER YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
TWENTY YEARS LATER .
YEAH .
UH .
BECAUSE YOU GET SET IN YOUR WAYS AND IT S .
YOU DO .
REALLY HARD BECAUSE TO TO REALLY TO GET HELP .
YEAH .
UH D YOU KNOW TO GET THE WORK LOAD SHARED .
ARE ARE YOU MARRIED .
YES UHHUH OUR .
DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN .
I WE HAVE FIVE CHILDREN THEY RE .
OH MY GOODNESS .
THEY RE ALL GROWN AND ON THEIR OWN SO .
OH MY .
THEY RE UH .
HOW DID YOU DO .
UH HOW DO YOU MEAN THAT .
WELL I MEAN OKAY WELL DID YOU HAVE BOYS GIRLS HOW DID HOW .
UH WE HAVE UH TWO GIRLS AND THREE BOYS AND OUR .
OH MY .
OUR BABY GIRL JUST HAD A BABY GIRL .
OH MY .
LAST WEEK WAS HER FIRST BABY .
OH HOW EXITING .
SO IT S BEEN REAL EXCITING .
I I TELL YOU WHAT I DO NT KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO WITHOUT MY FRIENDS HAVING ALL THEIR KIDS .
UHHUH .
I JUST LOVE THE BABIES .
UHHUH .
AND AND SINCE I M SORT OF IN A MEDICAL SITUATION WHERE I CA NT DO THAT IT S .
YEAH HAVE YOU BEEN THAT WAY LONG .
JUST EIGHT YEARS JUST .
JUST EIGHT YEARS .
THE MOST IMPORTANT YEARS OF MY LIFE YOU KNOW .
THAT S THAT S A LONG EIGHT YEARS THOUGH .
YEAH IT HAS BEEN .
UHHUH .
AND UH SO THERE HAVE BEEN MAJOR MAJOR ADJUSTMENTS .
UHHUH .
BUT THAT S ANOTHER STORY .
UHHUH .
BUT YOU KNOW MY HUSBAND HAS REALLY REALLY FILLED IN THE GAPS I MEAN I .
THAT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE .
I COULD NT ASK FOR A BETTER LIFE .
UHHUH .
I MEAN IF THIS IS THE WAY IT HAD TO BE .
UHHUH .
THIS IS THE BEST WAY .
UHHUH .
I COULD POSSIBLY DO IT AND AND THAT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH HIS STRENGTH AND HIS JUST PITCHING IN AND AND HIS BEING ABLE TO YOU KNOW ALL ALL EGO ASIDE DO A LOT OF THINGS .
UHHUH UHHUH .
THAT REALLY SO WHEN I SAY MEN HAVE NT CHANGED I GUESS I SHOULD LOOK AT MY OWN BACKYARD SORT .
YES .
OF THING AND .
WELL PROBABLY YOUR ROLE AND AND THE WAY YOU ARE ALSO HAS CHANGED THOUGH .
OH YEAH .
YOU KNOW COMPARED TO WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TWENTY FIFTY YEARS AGO .
YEAH THAT S TRUE I MEAN BOY I MEAN I I WOULD HAVE HAD SO I HAD SO MUCH GUILT TO BEGIN WITH AND THE CHANGES THAT HAD TO TAKE PLACE YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
WHERE I COULD NT DO A LOT OF THINGS .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND UH JUST ADJUSTING TO THAT .
UHHUH UHHUH .
THAT UH YEAH THAT WAS A MAJOR CHANGE .
UHHUH .
BUT SO I GUESS UH IN THE END YOU KNOW YOU EACH TAKE YOUR OWN SITUATION AND YOU AND YOU DEAL WITH IT THE BEST YOU CAN BUT .
THE BEST YOU CAN YEAH .
BUT BUT WOMEN I THINK ARE A WHOLE YOU KNOW SORT OF RIDING THE COURSE THEY RE THEY RE GOT A LITTLE WOBBLY AND A LITTLE SHAKY THERE I THINK THE FUTURE OF THIS WHOLE THING IS GOING TO BE WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE DAY CARE SITUATION .
I YEAH THAT S THE ONLY THING I WORRY ABOUT IS THE THE CHILD S LOVE AND SECURITY THAT I THINK THAT S BEING DAMAGED UH .
I THINK .
A LOT .
WE RE GOING TO SEE A GENERATION OF KIDS THAT YOU KNOW ARE JUST GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT UH OH NOT VERY NURTURING .
UHHUH .
I THINK .
I DO TOO I I THINK UH NOW SOME SOME WOMEN CAN CAN DO BOTH THEY RE VERY CAPABLE OF WORKING AND AND .
YEAH BUT I WISH THEY WERE NT SO MANY I I WISH THEY WERE NT ROLE MODELS FOR EVERYBODY .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE IT S SO DANGEROUS .
IT IT REALLY IS YEAH .
IT S DANGEROUS FOR THE WOMAN TOO TO THINK THAT SHE CAN DO THAT AND THEN WHEN SHE CA NT YOU KNOW THE FAILURE OF THAT IS .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW HER LIFE SORT OF FALLS APART AND SHE DOES NT KNOW WHO SHE IS AND SHE S .
SO MANY HAVE TO WORK TO MAKE A GO OF IT IT SEEMS .
ABSOLUTELY .
OR THEY SAY THEY DO ANYWAYS AND BUT I THINK ONES THAT DO NT HAVE TO THE IT S NOT AS MUCH OF A STIGMA NOT TO WORK AS IT WAS FOR A WHILE THERE .
WELL YOU KNOW I THINK THAT S THAT S REALLY I THINK IT DEPENDS ON WHAT PART OF THE COUNTRY YOU RE IN .
WELL THAT COULD BE .
UH I I WOULD ALMOST JUST SAY THAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW DOWN HERE IN THE SOUTH .
UHHUH UHHUH .
YOU KNOW A WOMAN S ROLE IS .
UH .
A WOMAN S ROLE .
YEAH .
SORT OF THING .
YEAH .
AND YOU KNOW .
YOU MEAN IT S STRONGER THERE .
UH OH YEAH YEAH .
MUCH STRONGER .
AND AND I THINK THAT UH YOU KNOW CAREER WOMEN STILL HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS HERE .
YEAH .
WITH THE GOOD OLD BOYS .
RIGHT .
HERE IN TEXAS SORT OF THING .
RIGHT .
MAKING CAREER MOVES BUT .
RIGHT .
UH YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF WOMEN STAYING HOME AND BEING APPRECIATED FOR THEIR TALENTS UH IT S JUST LIKE THE WAY IT IT HAS BEEN FOR YEARS .
UHHUH .
I MEAN YOU KNOW SINCE THE DAYS OF THE PIONEERS AROUND HERE .
YEAH YEAH .
THAT S THE WOMAN S ROLE .
YES .
AND IT AND IT S HARD FOR HER TO UH YOU KNOW WATCH HER PEERS BE APPRECIATED I THINK SOMETIMES BUT THEN I M NOT THERE SO I DO NT KNOW THAT .
YEAH YEAH .
AND I HAVE WOMEN THAT DO BOTH AND I SEE A LITTLE JEALOUSY ON THE PART OF YOU KNOW THE WOMAN WHAT HAS TWO LITTLE BOYS AND AND SHE HAS AN AU PAIR WHICH IS A LIVEIN COLLEGE KID WORKING FOR HER AND THEN SHE HAS HER BUSINESS IN THE BACK .
UH .
AND THEN MY OTHER GIRLFRIEND THAT HAS YOU KNOW JUST RUNS THE WHOLE HOUSEHOLD HERSELF AND JUST HAS TWO KIDS AND GOES CRAZY .
UHHUH UHHUH UHHUH .
ALL THE TIME AND SO I SEE I LITTLE BIT OF THAT AND I ALWAYS WISH THERE WAS A BALANCE YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
WITH THE ONE AND AND WISH SHE COULD SPEND MORE TIME WITH HER KIDS AND THE OTHER GAL I WISH SHE COULD JUST GET OUT OF DODGE .
RIGHT .
FOR A WHILE .
BUT THEY RE BOTH .
GET SOME PEACE AND QUIET .
YEAH THEY RE BOTH DIFFERENT PEOPLE TOO THAT S .
YEAH DEFINITELY SO YOU RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT .
THAT S WHERE THE TROUBLE LIES .
YEAH .
SOME PEOPLE SOME PEOPLE CAN ADJUST AND HAVE BOTH DO BOTH WELL .
AND THAT S .
AND OTHERS CA NT .
THAT S TRUE THAT S SO TRUE HOW HOW DID YOUR DAUGHTER DO IT .
UH WELL UH I HAVE ONE DAUGHTER THAT WORKS FULLTIME SHE HAS TWO LITTLE BOYS .
UHHUH .
AND THEY SEEM TO DO FINE SHE HAS BEEN TALK HAS TALKED ABOUT QUITTING YOU KNOW AND STAYING HOME FOR A FEW YEARS BUT THEN IT S REAL HARD BECAUSE SHE S GOT AN EXCELLENT JOB .
RIGHT .
UH .
UH I GUESS MY FEELINGS ARE THAT UH WE ALMOST HAVE A UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM UH TO A GREAT DEGREE EXCEPT THAT NOW I READ WHERE WE VE LEFT OUT ABOUT THIRTYFOUR MILLION PEOPLE .
OH .
AND UH I DO NT KNOW EXACTLY HOW WE RE GOING TO COVER MANY OF THESE PEOPLE BECAUSE I M SURE THAT SOME OF THEM DO NT UH DO NT HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL TO DO IT THEMSELVES SO UH I I HAVE A FEELING SINCE I HAVE JUST ABOUT AS GOOD A HEALTH CARE COVERAGE THAT ANYBODY CAN GET THAT THIS UH THEN BECOMES AN OBLIGATION OF THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE IT S GOING TO BECOME AN OBLIGATION OF EITHER STATE LOCAL OR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ANYWAY .
YEAH BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE CA NT PAY THEY END UP GOING TO CLINICS OR YOU KNOW TO PUBLIC HOSPITALS AND THAT KIND OF THING AND YOU KNOW .
WELL IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT I M PAYING ANYWAY BECAUSE WHEN I GO OR MY INSURANCE CARRIER ANYWAY WHEN I PAY SOMETHING THE BILLS SEEM INORDINATELY HIGH .
OH DEFINITELY .
AND THE REASON THAT THEY RE INORDINATELY HIGH IS BECAUSE THAT HAS .
TO COVER THE COSTS FOR THE INDIGENT PEOPLE WHO APPARENTLY .
RIGHT .
DO NT HAVE THE MONEY OR THE WHEREWITHAL TO DO THAT .
YEAH YEAH .
IT WOULD SEEM TO SPREAD IT OUT A LITTLE BETTER IF THE EMPLOYERS WHO UH EMPLOY THESE PEOPLE AND PAY THEM UH YOU KNOW SUBMINIMUM WAGES OR WHATEVER .
YEAH .
WERE ASKED TO SH SHARE THEIR FAIR BURDEN OF THIS TOO JUST AS MY EMPLOYER IS .
YEAH YEAH .
AND MYSELF I GUESS .
YEAH THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA MY ONLY CONCERN IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TURN THINGS OVER TO THE GOVERNMENT I DO NT KNOW .
WELL .
DO THEY WIND UP WITH MORE RED TAPE AND MORE PROBLEMS THEN .
WELL WHO WHO ELSE IS GOING TO DO THIS THEN .
YEAH YEAH .
I MEAN IT S WORKED SUCCESSFULLY IN EUROPE .
UHHUH .
I VE HEARD ALL THESE STORIES ABOUT I TRAVEL EXTENSIVELY AND SPEND UH MAYBE HALF A YEAR IN EUROPE EVERY YEAR .
OH .
AND I FIND THAT THE HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS THERE UH ARE ADMINISTERED WITH UH AT LEAST PEOPLE I TALK TO WITH UH A GREAT DEAL OF INTEGRITY AND UH PEOPLE DO NT SEEM TO BE RELUCTANT TO USE THEM TO ANY DEGREE .
YEAH .
AS A MATTER OF FACT IF I M INJURED OR HAVE AN EMERGENCY WHEN I M SAY IN GERMANY OR FRANCE UH THAT I M AUTOMATICALLY TAKEN CARE OF .
WOW .
I MEAN I DO NT EVEN HAVE TO PAY A .
YEAH WELL I THINK PART OF THE THE TREMENDOUS BENEFIT OF THAT IS THAT THERE S SO MANY PEOPLE WHO WAIT NOW BECAUSE THEY DO NT HAVE THE MONEY UNTIL YOU KNOW THEY HAVE NO PREVENTATIVE MEASURES PEOPLE UM YOU KNOW JUST GO ON AND ON AND ON I MEAN SO MANY PEOPLE DO NT EVEN GET PRENATAL CARE OR AND IT JUST EXTENDS WITH I IF IT W WHAT WOULD BE A MINOR PROBLEM TO DEAL WITH IF THEY HAD A HELP AVAILABLE EARLY ON BECOMES JUST THIS HORRENDOUS YOU KNOW BURDEN ON THE TAXPAYERS THEY RE SAYING NOW THAT ONE OUT OF EVERY TEN CHILD BORN I IN PUBLIC HOSPITALS IS ADDICTED TO CRACK .
WELL I .
WELL YOU KNOW .
UH UH I KNOW IT I HAVE A SOLUTION YOU SEE M MY SOLUTION EVEN THOUGH I M RAPIDLY APPROACHING THE UH THE AGE WHEN I LL QUALIFY FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID I I MY MOTHER AND FATHER BOTH UH UH WELL MY FATHER S NOT LIVING BUT MY MOTHER IS .
UHHUH .
AND THEY ARE UM OF AN ADVANCED YEARS AND WHEN I SEE THE MONEY THAT S POURED DOWN THE DOWN THE DRAIN ON MEDICARE AND MEDICAID I MEAN THE .
YEAH .
ABSOLUTE UNCONTROLLABLE SITUATION THAT WE FIND OURSELVES IN AND THE EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNTS I KNOW THAT BECAUSE THOSE PEOPLE VOTE I MEAN THEY RE THE ONES WHO GET OUT AND VOTE THAT S WHAT S ROBBING A POOR MOTHER OF THE P PRENATAL CARE THE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE NT GETTING THE PROPER CARE THAT THEY NEED AND NUTRITION I THINK .
YEAH YEAH .
AND WE RE SPENDING ON THESE USELESS MANY TIMES USELESS AND INORDINATELY COMPLEX UNNECESSARY TESTS IN HOSPITALS FOR OLDER PEOPLE .
OH IT S UNBELIEVABLE HOW MUCH YOU GO THROUGH WHEN I JUST HAD A PROBLEM WITH MY NECK AND THEY ENDED UP DOING A SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLAR CAT SCAN AND I MEAN A CHIROPRACTOR GOT IT IN ONE TIME .
THAT S RIGHT I MEAN IT DOES .
IT WAS JUST STRANGE .
SEEM LIKE WE RE TH TH TH NOW I NOTICED JUST THE OTHER DAY IN THE PAPER THAT THAT MEDICARE WILL BE BASED PAYMENTS WILL BE BASED NOT UH JUST ON COST BUT ON COST EFFECTIVENESS SO I GUE .
OH WELL THAT SHOULD HELP .
WELL I DO NT KNOW UH WE LL SEE HOW THAT GOES .
YEAH .
I THINK THAT WAS JUST A REGULATION THAT WAS UP FOR COMMENT BUT WE LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS .

OH OH .
AND UM I M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT DOWNTOWN .
UH THAT S YEAH THAT S A BUMMER .
YEAH .
WE .
WELL SEE BASEBALL HERE THOUGH IS THE CHEAPEST GAME IN TOWN .
BECAUSE THE COWBOYS IT S OUT IT S OUTRAGEOUS .
UHHUH .
TO GO TO THE COWBOY GAME .
AND THE MAVERICKS ARE T IT S HIGH TOO .
UHHUH .
SO BASEBALL S CHEAP .
WERE NT .
YOU GUYS .
COMPARED TO OTHER GAMES .
SUPPOSED TO GET A STADIUM IN DOWNTOWN DALLAS .
WELL THAT DID NT GO S OVER .
OH IT .
D IT DID NT .
NOW .
THEY THEY .
GO THROUGH .
THEY DECIDED YOU KNOW GEORGE BUSH WHO WHO S THE MAIN OWNER OF THE RANGERS DECIDED THAT UH THEY D STAY IN ARLINGTON .
SO ARLINGTON S GOING TO BUILD A STADIUM A BIGGER ONE .
OH OKAY .
SO WE RE GOING TO THEY RE GOING TO STAY THERE .
WHICH IS FINE BECAUSE ARLINGTON S GOT A LOT OF THINGS TO OFFER .
AND AND THAT WAS THEIR MAIN MAIN MONEY MAKING YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
DEAL FOR THE CITY .
AND IT WOULD HAVE DEVASTATED THEM IF THEY WOULD HAVE TAKEN IT AWAY .
YEAH .
BECAUSE EVERYTHING THERE .
S SIX FLAGS RIGHT BY THE STADIUM THERE S A WET N WILD AND .
UHHUH .
AND IT YOU KNOW THAT S ALL THE TOURISTS COME THERE .
UHHUH .
AND AND THEY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED THEY WOULD HAVE COLLAPSED .

THAT S THAT S WHAT .
I D ALWAYS HEARD I VE UH .
YEAH .
WE YOU KNOW WE I LIKE IT THERE .

SO I M GLAD THAT THEY RE STAYING IN ARLINGTON .
UHHUH .
AND IT S TAKES US MAYBE UH WE WELL THIRTYFIVE TO FORTY MINUTES TO GET THERE FROM PLANO WHICH IS NOT TOO BAD AT ALL .
YEAH .
THAT S ABOUT WHAT .
IT TAKES ME TO GET TO MEMORIAL .
YEAH .
UM .
SO .
IT .
S ACTU IT ACTUALLY FUNNY THAT UM I LIVE JUST OUTSIDE OF BALTIMORE .
AND IT TAKES ME ALMOST THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME TO GO TO FREDERICK BUT AS IT DOES TO GO TO THE THE BALLPARK IN ME IN UH BALTIMORE .
IS THAT RIGHT .
BECAUSE UM TO GO OUT TO FREDERICK I JUST JUMP ON THE INTERSTATE AND BECAUSE I LIVE JUST SOUTH OF THE INTERSTATE .
UHHUH .
H HOP ON THE INTERSTATE AND THE STADIUM S RIGHT OFF THE INTERSTATE .
OH GOSH .
SO IT S LIKE I DRIVE WEST AND I M THERE .
AND YOU KNOW AND THEN TO GO INTO BALTIMORE I MEAN IT WELL IT .

DO YOU READ UM I GUESS YOU READ SPORTS ILLUSTRATED BUT YOU DO NT READ MANY SPORTS BOOKS OR .
WELL NOT REALLY .
NOW MY SON DOES I HAVE I HAVE A SON .

HE GETS HE GETS HIS GET HIS HANDS ON .
HE S READING A DICK VITELLE BOOK RIGHT NOW BECAUSE HE S A REAL BIG DICK VITELLE FAN .
UM .
HE S A BASKETBALL FAN BECAUSE HE HE PLAYS FOR THE HIGH SCHOOL .

UH JUST LOVES D DICK VITELLE WHICH NOT MANY PEOPLE DO .
SO BUT HE S READING IT AND HE S R AND HE SAYS HE S SO INTERESTING MOM .
YOU JUST CA NT BELIEVE ALL THE THINGS .
HE S DONE .
AND HE S REALLY ENJOYING THAT .
AND I AND HE SAID MOM YOU NEED TO READ IT AFTER I GET FINISHED .
SO MAYBE I WILL .
THERE WAS UH I UNDERSTAND THERE WAS A REALLY GOOD BASKETBALL B BOOK CALLED UH A SEASON ON THE BRINK .
I NEVER HEARD THAT ONE .
YEAH I M NOT SURE .
I DO NT KNOW .
I M TRYING TO THINK OF THE GUY S NAME .
IT WAS LIKE JOHN FEINSTEIN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
WROTE IT .
I JUST HEARD ABOUT IT .
THE OTHER NIGHT .
HUH .
UH I WAS LISTENING TO SOMETHING ON THE RADIO .
UHHUH .
ABOUT UH .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW A TALK SHOW ABOUT SPORTS BOOKS AND THEY AND THEY MENTIONED THAT ONE .
I LL HAVE TO TELL MY SON ABOUT THAT .
I M SURE HE D LIKE IT .
YEAH .
AND UH I WAS THINKING ABOUT THERE WAS A I SAW A BOOK KICKING AROUND ON THE HISTORY OF THE .
A B .
A WHICH .
OH THAT WOULD BE GOOD .
YEAH .
I GET IN TO EVEN WHEN I DO NT LIKE THE SPORT SO MUCH I GET INTERESTED IN THE HISTORY OF SPORTS FRANCHISES .
OKAY WE WE CAN UH BE RECORDED WHILE WE TALK ABOUT IT .
OKAY WELL IS YOUR DOES YOUR CITY HAVE MANDATORY UH RECYCLING .
NO WE DO NT HAVE MANDATORY WE ACTUALLY WE RE KIND OF SLOW UP HERE AND WE VE JUST STARTED DOING RECYCLING PROBABLY LAST SUMMER AND IT S ALL VOLUNTARY SO THAT S INTERESTING CITIES HAVE A MANDATORY RECYCLING .
UM THERE THERE RE SOME PLACES THAT ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGING IT AND THAT THEY CITY WILL PICK IT UP THAT S BEEN ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS HERE I M JUST SITTING HERE LOOKING WE VE GOT FOUR BINS OF GLASS AND PLASTICINE STUFF BUT WE HAVE TO CARRY IT UH SOME DISTANCE AND SOME PLACES UM YOU CAN SELL YOUR UH RECYCLABLES AND FOR EXAMPLE OUR CHURCH WAS COLLECTING NEWSPAPERS .
YEAH WHEN I WAS A KID WE USED TO COLLECT NEWSPAPERS AND BRING THEM TO A RECYCLE THING WE GOT LIKE A PENNY A POUND FOR THEM .
WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT SO MUCH THE PROBLEM IN TEXAS IS THAT UH THEY VE GOT SO MUCH PAPER NOW FROM PEOPLE RECYCLING THAT THEY VE GOT NO WAY TO UH REPROCESS IT .
OH MY .
IT REQUIRES AN EX IT REQUIRES ESSENTIALLY A PAPER MILL TO RECYCLE IT AND SO THE VALUE HAS GONE DOWN IT TURNS OUT IT WAS NT WORTH FOR THE CHURCH TO DO .
OH I DID NT REALIZE YOU WOULD THINK NOW UP HERE I I SUPPOSE THEY SEND IT ALL BACK TO THE MILL AND THERE ARE PAPER MILLS WITHIN A COUPLE OF HUNDRED MILES OF UH ACTUALLY THERE IS ONE IN NORTHERN VERMONT SO THERE S PROBABLY A PAPER MILL THAT S SIXTY MILES FROM HERE I DID NT THINK THAT YOU KNOW IN THE LARGE CITY THAT IF THE NEXT RECYCLING IF THE NEXT MILL IS MORE LIKE FIVE HUNDRED MILES AWAY .
WELL .
IT S A LOT OF MONEY TO TRANSPORT .
YEAH WELL SEE THAT S IN IN DALLAS THERE NO PLAN TO BUILD I THINK THERE THERE S SOME IN EAST TEXAS THERE S SOME PULP MILLS BUT UH YOU HAVE TO GO TO HOUSTON AND IT S INTERESTING AND THEN THERE S PLACES THAT WILL BUY METAL AND THEY STILL BUY ALUMINUM CAN AND LIKES THAT .
DO YOU HAVE TO BUY METAL LIKE COPPER IS A VERY GOOD ONE TO COLLECT EVEN ALUMINUM YEAH SO .
WELL DO YOU DO DO YOU DO RECYCLING .
UH WE DO THE RECYCLING AND OUR CITY WILL PICK UP OUR RECYCLABLES .
OH .
THEY HAVE THESE LITTLE BLUE BINS UM I DO NT RECYCLE PERSONALLY I I M SAYING I WANT TO DO IT BUT I DO NT GET A LOT OF MAGAZINES I DO NT GET A I DO NT BUY THE NEWSPAPER BUT I DO HAVE A LOT OF UH MY TRASH HAS A LOT OF TIN CANS AND A LOT OF CART A LOT OF DIFFERENT PAPERS AND CARDBOARDS .
WELL DO YOU DRINK SODA AND SUCH IN ALUMINUM CANS .
YES BUT WE HAVE A BOTTLE RETURN A LOT OF THE NORTHERN STATES AND A LOT OF THE EASTERN STATES HAVE BOTTLES WE VE HAD FIVE CENT DEPOSITS ON OUR BOTTLES FOR YEARS .
OH SO IT S WORTH TAKING THEM BACK WELL SEE WE DO NT HAVE WE HAVE WE HAVE MOST OF OUR SOFT DRINKS ARE IN PLASTIC LITER OR TWO LITER BOTTLES .
OH THEY SHOULD DEFINITELY GET UM THE NICKEL RETURNABLE IT S GREAT FOR THE KIDS BECAUSE SEE A LOT OF THE KIDS GET THE MONEY FROM IT AND IT S GREAT FOR THE BOY SCOUTS RUNNING AROUND THEY KNOCK DOOR TO DOOR AND THE COLLECT THE BOTTLES SOMETIMES .
OH THAT S IT YOU LL YOU LL THERE IS A DOWN SIDE TO ALL THIS YOU KNOW ABOUT NO GOOD DEED GOING UNPUNISHED .
THAT UH MY MOTHER SELLS UM TREES THAT THEY MAKE PAPER OUT OF AND SO EVERY TIME I RECYCLE NEWSPAPERS IN FACT THERE S A THERE S A UH KIMBERLY AND CLARK THE MAKERS OF KLEENEX AND SUCH .
YEAH .
HAS A UH A BIG PAPER MILL IN FACT I ALMOST WENT TO WORK FOR THEM I WAS OFFERED A JOB AND TURNED IT DOWN BECAUSE MY MOTHER GOT IT FOR ME IT S TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES FROM MY HOUSE EVERY TIME YOU RECYCLE THAT S ONE LESS TREE MY MOTHER CAN SELL AND UH SO IT S A QUESTION SHOULD I BE DILIGENT AND UM .
AND RECYCLE .
AND AND RECYCLE AND PUT MY MOTHER OUT OF HER LIVELIHOOD .
OH YES I SEE THAT .
BUT IT S AN INTERESTING POINT THOUGH THAT YOU KNOW EVERYBODY S SO ANXIOUS TO RECYCLE AND I SUPPOSE IT DOES PROVIDE SOME GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT BUT .
BUT IT TAKES AWAY EMPLOYMENT FROM THE RESOURCE AND ITS MUMBLEX .
WELL BUT IN GENERAL I THINK IT S A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE .
I DO TOO .
LIKE THE GLASS YOU CA NT ARGUE THAT THE GLASS IT DOES NT BIODEGRADE AND AND UH THE PLASTICS OBVIOUSLY .
THEY DO NT EITHER .
SO WE MIGHT AS WELL RECYCLE THOSE .
YEAH LIKE I SAY IT S NOT A VERY CONTROVERSIAL THING EVERYONE THINKS WE SHOULD DO IT IT S JUST THAT WE RE SO LAZY I MEAN LIKE PERSONALLY I DO NT WANT TO CLEAN MY I JUST HAVE CAN CAT FOOD I DO NT WANT TO CLEAN THE CAN AND TAKE THE LABEL OFF IT AND PUT IT IN A SEPARATE BIN .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW I D JUST RATHER GET RID OF THAT THING AND THROW IT IN THE TRASH .
WELL THAT S WHAT WE VE GOT WE STARTED ABOUT NEW YEAR S WE DECIDED WE D GET AMBITIOUS WELL WE TOOK ONE LOAD OVER THERE AND NOW WE VE GOT THESE CONTAINERS FILLING UP WITH STUFF AND YOU KNOW IT S NOT A VERY HIGH PRIORITY THING TO GO HAUL THESE CONTAINERS OVER THERE .
YEAH I THINK I WOULD BE LIKE WHEN I BRING MY BOTTLES BACK IF THEY RE PRETTY CLEAN AND STUFF SO THEY CAN SIT IN MY CELLAR FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS AND I GET A WHOLE BUNCH OF THEM AND BRING THEM OV AND BRING THEM OVER NOW IF I HAD A RECYCLING CENTER AND I KEPT IT CLEAN LIKE IF I WASHED ALL THE CANS AND THINGS I WOULD NT MIND IF IT SAT AROUND TOO MUCH BUT IF IF IT STUNK OR SOMETHING I WOULD NT LIKE DOING IT BUT UM I PRODUCE QUITE A BIT OF TRASH MY YOU KNOW HOUSE AND I SEE IT BUT I DO NT SEE SO MUCH THAT I CAN RECYCLE .
YEAH .
LIKE I SAY IT S A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPE PAPER AND CARDBOARD I M NOT A REAL PLASTIC PERSON USER BUT A LOT OF PAPER UM PRETTY MUCH AND I DO NT KNOW HOW THEY SORT THAT BUT IF IF I USED A LOT OF CAN GOODS AND I DO USE A LOT OF LAUNDRY DETERGENT AND A LOT OF PLASTIC BOTTLES I WOULD THINK THAT I WOU I WOULD HAVE A RECYCLING CENTER BUT NOW IT S JUST ME AND MY HUSBAND SO I DO NT KNOW .
BUT EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS RIGHT .
YEAH I KNOW WHAT YOU RE SAYING BUT WE HAVE WE HAVE A VERY AGGRESSIVE RECYCLING AT WORK AND I M THE ONE WHO WILL PICK THE NEWSPAPER OUT OF THE TRASH AND BRING IT TO THE RECYCLE BIN SEE SOME PEOPLE IT S THE RECYCLE BIN IS ON THEIR WAY OUT INSTEAD OF CARRYING YOUR NEWSPAPERS WHEN THEY GET DONE WITH THEM AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY THROW THEM IN THE TRASH .
WELL DO YOU HAVE SEPARATE TRASH CANS AT YOUR DESK .
UM NO WE DO NT BUT OTHER OTHER OFFICES DO THEY HAVE A BOX FOR PAPERS .
WELL WE HAVE WE HAVE ONE THAT S RECYCLABLE AND AND THEN FOR UH LUNCH SACKS AND WASTE FOOD AND THEY GAVE US A LIST OF THINGS THAT ARE NT RE AND IT TURNS OUT IT S NOT SO BAD I I GET A LOT OF REPORTS THAT THAT ARE COVERED IN PLASTIC OR PLAS LIKE SARAN WRAP OR SOMETHING ANYWAY AND THEN UH CARDBOARD THERE S A FEW IT S INTERESTING THAT WE RE WE RE RECYCLING COMPUTER TYPE PAPER .
YEAH .
AND AND UH ONE DAY THEY LL PICK UP UH THE CLEANING PEOPLE COME THROUGH AND THEY LL PICK UP RECYCLED PAPER AND THEN THE NEXT DAY THEY LL PICK UP THE OTHER SO .
OH .
DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH YOU KNOW AND THERE S A LOT OF ACTUALLY IT WORKS PRETTY WELL AND THEN WE HAVE A UH WASTE UH CANS FOR ALUMINUM IN THE IN THE BREAK AREAS AT WORK .
WELL THAT S THAT S A REALLY GOOD IDEA BECAUSE UM LIKE OUR UH FRUIT JUICES FOR SOME REASON WHEN THEY RE IN A CAN DO NT COME WITH A DEPOSIT .
YEAH .
AND THEY RE THINKING ABOUT PUTTING A DEPOSIT ON THEM BECAUSE PRETTY MUCH YOU HAVE TO YOU RE HAVING A WHOLE SEPARATE RECYCLABLE BIN JUST FOR THESE FRUIT CANS WHERE THEY RE .
YEAH .
SO MUCH EASIER JUST TO PUT A DEPOSIT ON IT BECAUSE MOST PROBABLY NINETY PERCENT OF THE ALUMINUM CANS DO HAVE DEPOSITS BECAUSE THEY RE BEER AND SODA BUT WHEN THEY SELL JUICE IT S SOME STRANGE QUIRK IN THE LAW YOU DO NT HAVE TO HAVE A DEPOSIT ON IT AND EVEN LIKE THE A VERY FINE JUICE JAR DOES NOT HAVE TO HAVE A DEPOSIT ON IT BUT IF IT S GOT SODA IN IT IT DOES SO IT S A STRANGE .
THAT S AN INTERESTING DISTINCTION .
YEAH THEY SHOULD THEY SHOULD CLEAN CLEAR THAT UP IT WOULD NT TAKE THEM MUCH TO PUT A STAMP ON THE UH JUICE CANS AS EASILY AS THE SODA .
YEAH .
SO BUT REDEMPTION CENTERS ARE A BIG THING UP HERE THEY GET A PENNY A CAN THEY HANDLE THEY GIVE YOU FIVE CENTS WHEN THEY RETURN THE CAN TO THE DISTRIBUTOR I THINK THEY EITHER GET A PENNY OR TWO PENNIES A CAN .
WELL SEE WELL SEE THOSE OF US THAT DO NT HAVE STATE INCOME TAXES YET .
YEAH .
THAT S THE BIG DEBATE HERE IN TEXAS THAT THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO PUT ONE IN AND IT S INTERESTING WHAT PEOPLE GET UPSET ABOUT UH IT REALLY IS .
IS BOT IS BOTTLE RETURN DOWN THERE A HEATED DEBATE .
WELL NO THE THE BIG ISSUE WAS IS IS WHEN WE MOVED HERE A FEW YEARS AGO IS WHETHER IT WAS OKAY FOR YOU TO UH DRINK BEER WHILE YOU WERE DRIVING YOUR PICKUP TRUCK .
OH YEAH .
AND THROW IT OUT AT THE IN UH .
WELL WE WELL HERE YOU CA NT DRINK .
WE RE NOT CIVILIZED NOW YOU CAN NO LONGER YOU CAN NOT DRINK BEER AND DRIVE BUT .
WELL .
BUT IT WAS IT WAS ACTUALLY LEGAL .
YES WELL I KNOW I WAS IN ATLANTA AND YOU COULD WALK OUT THE BAR WITH YOUR DRINK IN YOUR HAND BUT HERE LET ME PUT THAT IN A PAPER CUP FOR YOU .
SO THAT WAS STRANGE BUT I THINK IF SOME PEOPLE THEY HAVE THEY SAY WELL WE RE NOT GOING TO START A CAN DEPOSIT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GET ALL THESE UM THE THE RECYCLE CENTER YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE CAN AND THEN YOU HAVE TO TO RECYCLE IT AND THEIR PROBLEM S ALREADY SOLVED BECAUSE THEY CAN JUST COME TO STATES THAT DO HAVE BOTTLE DEPOSITS .
YEAH .
SEE HOW THEY HANDLE IT AND SEE IF IT S A GOOD WAY AND THEN DO IT THAT WAY BECAUSE AS LIKE I SAY PEOPLE ARE MAKING MONEY ON IT .
WELL YOU KNOW THE OTHER .
THE CANS DO ARE WORTH SOMETHING .
WELL THE OTHER THING IS IT ALSO IS IS A IS A A GOOD HABIT UH TO UH JUST TO CONSERVE RESOURCES YOU KNOW WHERE THEY YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU GET IN THE HABIT OF THAT YOU THINK IN TERMS OF OF UH OF OF THINGS LIKE SAVING .
OKAY UM LET S SEE .
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT CREDIT CARDS .
PERSONALLY I DO NOT CARE FOR THEM .
UH ALTHOUGH I FIND THEM .
A NECESSITY IN BUSINESS AND SO FORTH I I TRY TO REFRAIN FROM THEIR USE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE .
UM FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS ONE OF WHICH IS THE YOU KNOW EXTREME INTEREST RATE ON MOST OF THEM .
UHHUH .
THE ONE .
I USE UH OF COURSE FOR MOSTLY ONLY FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES IS UH YOU KNOW AMERICAN EXPRESS .
RIGHT .
AND UH I M NOT I M NOT TERRIBLY IN FAVOR OF THEM .
NOT FOR MY OWN PERSONAL UH POINT OF VIEW .
RIGHT .
PLUS IT UH HAS YOU KNOW FROM AN ECONOMIC POINT OF VIEW .
IT HAS INCREASED OUR DEBT .
YEAH .
TREMENDOUSLY .
RIGHT .
TO THE TUNE OF SOMEWHERE ON THE ORDER OF FIVE TO TEN BILLION I BELIEVE .
WOW .
UH AT LEAST THAT S ONE NUMBER FOR THIS RANGE OF NUMBERS I HAVE I HAVE HEARD .
RIGHT .
DO YOU USE THEM FREQUENTLY OR .
WELL WE UH ME AND MY WIFE WHEN WHEN WE HAVE LIKE EXTRA MONEY THAT WE KNOW WE RE GOING TO HAVE AND WE CAN PUT IT IN OUR BUDGET YEAH WE LL WE LL USE IT .
BUT LIKE LAST YEAR I THINK WE PAID I THINK IT WAS LIKE TWENTY .
SOMETHING .
CENTS INTEREST .
ON OUR VISA .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK THIS THIS YEAR .
WE UH I THINK WE USED IT FOR CHRISTMAS AND WE GOT CAUGHT JUST A FEW DAYS ON OUR GRACE PERIOD .
AND UH SO WE LL PAY A LITTLE INTEREST .
THIS YEAR BUT MAYBE TWO DOLLARS .
BUT WE DO NT LIKE TO DO THAT AT ALL .
YES .
AND YOU KNOW WE I THINK WE FEEL ABOUT THE SAME WAY .
YOU DO REAL STRONGLY .
WE UH WE HAVE SEVERAL CREDIT CARDS THOUGH .
WE HAVE A GAS CARD OUR VISA AND THEN OF COURSE THE AMERICAN EXPRESS AND I THINK WE HAVE A COUPLE OF DEPARTMENT STORES .
UHHUH .
BUT WE USE IT .
THE SAME WAY AND UH .
I FIND THE ONE .
I USE MOSTLY UH ASIDE FROM THE AMERICAN EXPRESS I DO USE MY SEARS CARD .
UHHUH .
BUT UH I TRY A AS WITH THE AMERICAN EXPRESS I TRY TO PAY IT YOU KNOW AS IT COMES IN .
RIGHT .
RIGHT .
SO UH .
IT S IT S NOT UNCOMMON FOR US TO HAVE PAID IT BEFORE WE EVEN GET THE BILL .
THAT S USUALLY HOW WE DO IT .
I KNOW WHEN I TRAVEL OR WHEN I USED TO TRAVEL OVERSEAS QUITE A BIT WHAT .
I WOULD DO ON MY AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD IS BEFORE I WOULD BEFORE I LEFT I WOULD MAIL A CHECK TO TO AMERICAN EXPRESS .
UHHUH .
AND YOU KNOW HAVE SOME IDEA OF HOW MUCH WAS THERE YOU KNOW I D SENT THEM YOU KNOW SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS OR WHATEVER .
UHHUH .
I FELT I WOULD SPEND .
YEAH .
AND THEN USE IT THEN .
YEAH .
BUT UH FOR HOTELS AND AND SO FORTH .
BUT UH BUT I KNEW THAT IT WAS PAID .
I KNEW .
RIGHT .
I KNEW THAT I HAD THAT MUCH .
YEAH .
CREDIT GOING IN .
SOMETIMES YOU KNOW SOMETIMES I WOULD GO OVER BUT IT WOULD NT YOU KNOW IT WOULD NT HIT ME IN A BIG IN A BIG WAY BECAUSE .
RIGHT .
I KNEW THAT UH I WOULD HAVE IT COVERED IN THAT RESPECT .
RIGHT .
THAT S GOOD .
I VE I DO NT THINK WE VE GONE THAT FAR MUMBLEX .
TO PAY IT IN AD YOU KNOW IN ADVANCE BEFORE WE SPEND IT BUT I GUESS IF YOU FORESAW THAT YOU WERE GOING TO HAVE TO USE IT THAT LIKE THAT .
WELL I FOUND .
THAT MAY BE GOOD .
I FOUND IN UM IN TRAVELING OVERSEAS .
UHHUH .
THAT UH OFTEN IT WOULD UH IT WOULD EXPEDITE THINGS TO HAVE AN AMERICAN EXPRESS CREDIT CARD .
OH REALLY .
FOR HOTEL BILLS AND SO FORTH .
YEAH .
PLUS I WOULD UH WHEN THEY UH WOULD SEND THE BILL THEY WOULD AUTOMATICALLY CONVERT TO THE EXCHANGE RATE .
RIGHT RIGHT .
SO NOW THE ONLY TIME .
THAT GOT TO BE A PROBLEM WAS IF THE EXCHANGE RATE CHANGED DRASTICALLY .
UHHUH .
UH FOR EXAMPLE I REMEMBER ON ONE TRIP TO FRANCE WHEN I STARTED PLANNING THE TRIP I THINK UH A DOLLAR WAS WORTH NINE OR TEN FRANCS .
UHHUH .
AND JUST IN A MATTER OF A WEEK OR TWO .
THE DOLLAR FELL AGAINST THE FRANC DRASTICALLY .
AND WHE WHEN I FINALLY GOT OVER THERE IT HAD FALLEN UH TWO OR THREE FRANCS TO THE DOLLAR .
SO THE .
WOW .
SO I GOT CAUGHT A LITTLE SHORT .
WOW .
IN THAT REGARD BUT UH .
YEAH .
UH I I WAS ANTICIPATING YOU KNOW MY ROOM WOULD COST UH LET S SAY IF IT WERE SAY SIXTY OR SEVENTY FRANCS .
A NIGHT .
RIGHT .
THAT WOULD MEAN IT WOULD BE ABOUT TEN DOLLARS OR SO OR MAYBE TWENTY DOLLS MAYBE IT WOULD BE MORE THAN THAT .
IT WAS MORE THAN .
IT WOULD AVERAGE OUT TO THIRTYFIVE OR FORTY DOLLARS .
A NIGHT .
RIGHT .
WHICH IS A REASONABLE RATE .
RIGHT .
BUT THEN WHEN I GOT BACK AND I WAS WORKING FOR THE GOVERNMENT AT THE TIME .
UHHUH .
OF COURSE .
THE GOVERNMENT WAS SEVERAL MONTHS BEHIND IN .
RIGHT YEAH .
THEIR ON ITS PER DIEM FOR EXCHANGE RATE .
RIGHT .
SO THERE S A LITTLE CONSTERNATION YOU KNOW IN TRYING TO GET THEM TO COMPENSATE .
YEAH .
FOR THE DIFFERENCE IN THE EXCHANGE RATE .
RIGHT .
YEAH ESPECIALLY .
THAT WAS THE ONLY TIME .
I REALLY GOT CAUGHT SHORT .
AND I .
YEAH .
BUT AS I SAID MOST MOST OF ALL .
I TRY NOT TO USE THEM UH TO ANY YOU KNOW LAVISHLY IN THAT REGARD .
YEAH WELL THA THAT S GOOD .
WELL FROM WHERE ARE YOU CALLING .
OH FROM THE DALLAS AREA .
SO YOU RE FROM DAL OKAY I M FROM MARYLAND .
OH REALLY .
YEAH .
WOW .
DO YOU WORK FOR T I .
NO .

AND SO THAT S HOW I GOT INVOLVED .
YEAH .

THANK YOU VERY MUCH .
BUT AS JACK SAID I M ONE OF THE THE OLD HANDS IN THE SPEECH BUSINESS .
OH REALLY .
YEAH UH .
YES I I VE BEEN DOING IT FOR TWENTY .
SOME ODD YEARS .
WOW .
AND SO UH I WAS VERY MUCH INTERESTED UH IN GETTING INVOLVED IN UH SWITCHBOARD .
YEAH .
SO UH YOU WORK FOR T I .
RIGHT .
I WORK IN MUMBLEX .
OH REALLY .
YEAH .
I GUESS WE RE SUPPOSED TO DO THIS PART OF IT BEFORE WE STARTED THE RECORDING .
YEAH .
I THINK WE TALKED FOR A GOOD EIGHT MINUTES ABOUT THE SUBJECT SO I THINK YOU GET TEN SO I THINK WE RE OKAY .
ALRIGHT .
OKAY FINE .
WELL YOU HAVE A GOOD EVENING .
WELL YOU TOO .
IT S BEEN PLEASANT TALKING TO YOU .
SAME HERE .
TAKE CARE .
GOOD NIGHT .
BYE .
OKAY SO UM YES WE DO KEEP UH WELL WE STARTED OUT KEEPING A BUDGET ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO WE HAVE A COMPUTER HERE AT THE HOUSE .
UHHUH .
AND I MADE A LOTUS SPREADSHEET AND WENT THROUGH THE YEAR USING ALL OF OUR OUR CHECKBOOK TO FIGURE OUT WHAT .
WE SPENT EACH TIME AND WHETHER WE WERE OVER OR UNDER FOR EACH MONTH AND THEN BASICALLY SINCE THEN WHAT .
I VE DONE IS IS KEEP TRACK OF IT THROUGH THE CHECKBOOK SO THAT BASED ON WHATEVER .
WE VE GOT COMING IN THE CHECK COMING IN THEN HOW MUCH I M SPENDING EACH .
HALF OF THE MONTH AND THEN TRYING TO ALSO SPE BECAUSE OUR HOUSE PAYMENT IS ONCE A MONTH THAT S OUR OUR BIGGEST UH EXPENSE SO I TAKE HALF OF THAT AMOUNT OUT OF MY CHECKBOOK .
EACH WITH EACH PAYCHECK .
UHHUH .
EVEN THOUGHT IT S REALLY STILL THERE .
UHHUH .
SO THAT I CAN KEEP UH UH GOOD BALANCE .
A RUNNING TOTAL .
A RUNNING TOTAL YEAH THROUGH THE MONTH .
YEAH .
WHAT DO YOU .
ALL DO .
UH WE VE WE VE UH TAKEN HOW MUCH WE HAVE YOU KNOW WRITE DOWN HOW MUCH WE HAVE COMING IN EACH MONTH AND THEN UH WE VE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR .
WE SAT DOWN AND DETERMINED HOW MUCH WE COULD SPEND .
WE SAT DOW MADE UP DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS LIKE YOU KNOW WE VE SET A BUDGET FOR EACH YOU KNOW HOUSEHOLD EXPENSES OR FOOD AND CLOTHING AND ENTERTAINMENT AND THEN OUR OUR OWN FUN MONEY AND JUST STUFF LIKE THAT AND THEN WE WRITE DOWN EACH EACH TIME .
WE SPEND SOMETHING WE WRITE DOWN IN A BOOK AND AT THE END OF THE MONTH .
WE TALLY IT UP TO SEE HOW CLOSE WE YOU KNOW WE WE TRY TO STAY WITHIN A CERTAIN BUDGET SO .
IS IT IS IT HARD TO KEEP TRACK OF IT OR DOES IT WORK OUT PRETTY WELL .
UM IT TAKES SOME IT TAKES SOME DEDICATION TO DO IT BUT IT IT WORKS OUT REAL WELL SO .
AND AND YOU RE STAYING WITHIN YOUR BUDGET AND KEEP .

YOU DO NT HAVE TO GO OUT AND BORROW IT SOMEWHERE AND DO THAT .
RIGHT YEAH BECAUSE WE DO NT YOU KNOW WE DO NT CHARGE ANYTHING THAT WE CA NT PAY OFF BY THE END OF THE MONTH .

TO BE OUT OF THAT .
THAT BY DOING THAT WE LL BE FREE .
FREE .
AND CLEAR .
YEAH THE ONLY THING .
WE HAVE IT TO PAY OFF IS OUR IS A AUTOMOBILE LOAN AND OUR HOUSE PAYMENT AND THAT S THE ONLY THING .
WE EVER .
THAT S GOOD TO BE IN THAT KIND OF SHAPE .
WE TRY TO STAY OUT OF DEBT .

WE JUST HE HA YOU KNOW HIS RETIREMENT PLAN AND THEN TO CODA AND STUFF LIKE THAT THAT S ALL .
WE AND YOU KNOW WE JUST HAVE OUR LIFE INSURANCE FOR RIGHT NOW .

YEAH MOSTLY WHAT .
WE RE DOING WE VE WORKED WE VE DONE THE UH CODA ACCOUNT WITH T I WHERE THEY WE PUT IN SO MUCH A MONTH AND THEN THEY OR SO MUCH A PAY CHECK AND THEN THEY MATCH IT .

WE RE DOING .
SO THAT S THAT S WORKED OUT PRETTY GOOD AND THEN I USED TO WORK FOR T I AND I HAVE WHEN I RETIRED FROM THERE OR LEFT I TOOK THE MONEY .
I THAT I HAD IN MINE AND PUT IT IN AN .
I R .
A AND WE HAD AN OUT WE HAD AN EXISTING I R .

WE HAVE BOTH OF US HAVE SOME MONEY IN AN .
I R .

YEAH WHEN EVER WE GET ENOUGH SAVED WE STICK IT IN A C D FOR A WHILE AND THEN UH YOU KNOW AND THEN WHEN IF WE NEED IT .
WE WAIT UNTIL IT IT S EXPIRED AND THEN SO .
YEAH .
THE OTHER THING THAT WE VE DONE THAT THAT WAS REALLY NICE TO SEE WE HAD ONE OF THE FINANCIAL COMPANIES UM HAN UH JOHN HANCOCK COMPANY CAME OUT AND THEIR AGENT DID A LONG TERM ANALYSIS BASED ON SALARY AND UH WHAT .
WE WERE PLA WHAT WHAT .
OUR UH GOALS WERE ON A LONG TERM BUDGET IN TERMS OF RETIREMENT KIDS COLLEGE PAYING OFF THE HOUSE BUYING A DIFFERENT HOUSE .
UHHUH .
UM SPECIAL THING BUYING LAND AND BUILDING OUR OWN HOUSE AND THEY DID AN ANALYSIS FOR US BASED ON WHAT .
WE WERE PUTTING IN AND THE TIME FRAME THAT WE WANTED TO LOOK AT .
UHHUH .
AND THEN GAVE US .
A GOOD IDEA BACK YOU KNOW SOME GOOD INFORMATION BACK ON WHETHER OR NOT WE WERE GOING TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS .
OR NOT YEAH .
AND OR NOT AND WHAT .
WE NEEDED TO DO SO THAT WE COULD ACHIEVE THEM AND THE MONEY .
WE COULD PUT IN AT WHAT TIME .
UHHUH .
THAT SOUNDS INTERESTING WE VE NEVER DONE ANY WE HAVE YOU KNOW JUST OUR OUR LIFE INSURANCE GUY HAS COME OUT YOU KNOW AND HE S SET UP UH YOU KNOW DETERMINED HOW MUCH WE NEED TO YOU KNOW WE NEED IF SOMETHING WERE TO HAPPEN .
YEAH THAT THAT S THE OTHER FINANCIAL THING .
I GUESS THAT WE VE DONE IS WITH OUR LIFE INSURANCE IS SINCE I M AT HOME NOW IS IS FIGURING OUT UH WHAT .
WE WOULD NEED IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO MY HUSBAND OR WHAT .
HE WOULD NEED IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO ME THAT S A A BIG THING TO THINK ABOUT .
RIGHT YEAH YOU KNOW IF I WOULD SELL THE YOU KNOW IF HE SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN TO HIM I WOULD NT STAY IN TEXAS I WOULD UH SELL THE HOUSE AND MOVE BACK HOME YOU KNOW TO MY HOME TOWN AND AND UH I WOULD NT STAY HERE IN TEXAS SO YOU KNOW I DO NT KNOW WHAT .
HE WOULD DO .
OKAY I GUESS THAT S MOST OF MY UM FINANCIAL PLANS RIGHT NOW .
YEAH MINE TOO .
IS IS THERE ANYTHING .
YOU D LIKE TO ADD .
NO THAT S ABOUT ALL FOR MINE .
WELL IT S BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU .
NICE TALKING TO YOU TOO .
BYE BYE .
BYE BYE .
OKAY UH WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT UH THE IDEA OF HAVING VOLUNTEER SERVICE FOR EVERYONE .
UH I THINK THAT UH REALLY IT WOULD NT HURT MOST OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY TO HAVE TO GO AND DO VOLUNTARY SERVICE .
UH AND YOU KNOW I MEAN .
MUMBLEX .
THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY PEOPLE .
THAT HAVE DONE IT AND I VE TALKED WITH SEVERAL AND I THINK THEY VE GOTTEN A LOT OUT OF IT .
WELL ARE YOU DOING ANY KIND OF VOLUNTEER WORK NOW .
NOT RIGHT NOW BUT I HAVE DONE UH RED CLO CROSS WORK AND UH I VE TAUGHT C P R TRAINING A .
WHAT ABOUT WHEN WHEN WOULD PEOPLE DO IT WHEN THEY FINISHED HIGH SCHOOL .
I THINK PROBABLY AS SOON AS THEY FINISHED HIGH SCHOOL .
IT WOULD BE IDEAL BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES I IF THEY GO STRAIGHT INTO COLLEGE .
I THINK THEY RE GOING IN TOO QUICK BUT .
I THINK PARTICULAR BOYS THAT THE MATURITY IN FACT .
I WAS NT VERY MATURE WHEN I LEFT HIGH SCHOOL AND I THINK THERE S A THERE S A REAL CHALLENGE THERE .
THERE S ALSO THIS THIS ISSUE OF OF UH YOU KNOW WHETHER YOU RE REALLY READY AND I THINK IT GIVES A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE .
RIGHT UH Y I I THINK IF YOU VE BEEN OUT OF SCHOOL .
A YEAR YEAR AND A HALF BEFORE YOU START TO COLLEGE YOU APPRECIATE COLLEGE MORE .
THAN SOMEONE .
THAT JUST GOES RIGHT STRAIGHT INTO COLLEGE .
THE ONLY COMPLICATION IS IS IS HOW DO YOU FUND SOMETHING LIKE THIS .
WELL A LOT OF PARENTS FUND THEIR CHILDREN .
THERE ARE UH SOME GROUPS .
THAT HAVE THEIR CHILDREN YOU KNOW GO AWAY FOR A YEAR .
EVEN THE RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS .
YEAH I THINK THE MORMON CHURCH HAS SENDS OUT MISSIONARIES .
THAT .
RIGHT .
AND THE PARENTS FUND .
THEM FOR THE WHOLE YEAR YEAR AND A HALF THAT THEY RE GONE .
THAT S UH IT S INTERESTING .
IT GETS THEM AWAY FROM HOME AND AND GETS THEM TO DO SOMETHING USEFUL ALTHOUGH THE KIDS TODAY THOUGH IT IT SEEMS THAT ALMOST THAT THEIR CONCERN FOR MONEY I WE WERE DOING SOME .
INVESTIGATING COLLEGES AND SAID THE KIDS ARE MUCH MORE INTERESTED TODAY IN IN TRYING TO FIND A JOB STUDY SOMETHING .
THAT WILL GIVE THEM .
A JOB AS OPPOSED TO BE CURIOUS BE CURIOUS AS TO IF IF THERE WAS IF THERE WAS MANDATORY YOU COULD CHOOSE THE OPTION OF EITHER .
A MANDATORY MILITARY SERVICE OR VOLUNTARY DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE REASONABLE .
I THINK IT WOULD .
IN IN ISRAEL THE EVEN THE WOMEN ARE ARE REQUIRED TO TO BE IN THE MILITARY FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME .
UH I WAS IN THE MILITARY AND I PERSONALLY FEEL IF IF THEY HAVE DRAF THE DRAFT THAT THEY SHOULD DRAFT WOMEN AS QUICKLY AS THEY DO THE MEN .
WELL BUT THE THE ISSUE OF OF OF WHICH WHAT WHAT WOULD WHAT WOULD YOU FIND WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE THEM DO .
YOU KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND WITH THERE S A LOT OF UNEMPLOYMENT RIGHT NOW .
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE THESE PEOPLE DO IF THEY WERE BROUGHT IN .
WHAT INTO THE SERVICE .
WELL YEAH .
OR .
OR SAY SAY THE VOLUNTEER SAY THAT .
WELL I .
SAY THAT IT WAS MANDATORY .
I I THINK THAT THEY OUGHT TO HAVE SOMETHING FOR THE THE UNEMPLOYED IN A VOLUNTARY FIELD LIKE THE UH I DO NT KNOW IF YOU KNOW REMEMBER ABOUT THE W P .
A .
YES MY FATHER WAS IN THE C C C MUMBLEX .
HE WAS IN THAT .
I MEAN YOU KNOW UH IT S NOT THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD BUT UH IT GAVE THEM .
SOMETHING TO DO .
WELL IT SEEMS THAT THERE S SOME THINGS LIKE THE UH THE PROGRAMS AT LEAST JUST GO AROUND AND AND AND CLEAN UP STREETS AND AND AND PICK UP TRASH AND EVEN ALUMINUM CANS AND SOME OF THESE KINDS OF THINGS .
R OR GO INTO THE THE MORE DEPRESSED AREAS AND HELP REPAIR THE HOUSES .
YEAH IN FACT WE WE HELPED WITH UH OH HELP TO HELP HUMANITIES AND THAT WAS A THAT WAS A GOOD EXPERIENCE BUT YOU TAKE THE KIDS OUT AND AND A LOT OF THE BUILDINGS IN DOWNTOWN AREAS .
THAT THAT EITHER NEED DEMOLISHING OR NEED FIXING UP SO .
UHHUH .
IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA .
UH WE VE BEEN DOING THIS THREE OR FOUR MINUTES .
I THINK THAT UH DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER FURTHER COMMENTS .
NO NOT REALLY .
WELL IT WAS GOOD TALKING TO YOU BETTY .
O OKAY I LL TALK TO YOU LATER .
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT .
BYE .
OKAY HE DID REALLY DECIDE TO GO .
UM TO WILLIAMS COLLEGE IN MASSACHUSETTS .
UHHUH SURE I M FAMILIAR WITH IT .
AND THAT HE WAS TRYING TO DECIDE BETWEEN UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA AND WILLIAMS AND IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT CHOICE AND UH .
AND HE WELL HE MUST KNOW IS HE INTERESTED IN LAW OR MEDICINE HE MUST HAVE A DEFINITE PROFESSION IN MIND .
NO BUT THAT S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY HE CHOSE WILLIAMS .
OH OKAY .
THAT IT HAS SOLID LIBERAL ARTS .
MEDIUM SIZE ARE NT THEY .
ABOUT TWO THOUSAND .
IS HE EXCITED .
VERY EXCITED YES UH .
WOW I CAN I .
I HAVE ANOTHER SON WHO S AT THEIR CHIEF RIVAL AMHERST COLLEGE .
UHHUH WHILE THEY RE EAST COAST I MEAN I DO NT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THEIR FOOTBALL BUT THERE YOU GO .
WELL THEY RE THEY RE THEY RE REALLY VERY STRONG ACADEMIC RATHER THAN YOU KNOW BIG SPORTS .
YEAH THAT S WHERE WHERE YOU AT .
WE RE OUTSIDE OF UH WASHINGTON IN MARYLAND HOW ABOUT YOU .
OH OKAY I M IN UH SUBURBAN DALLAS .
UHHUH DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN IN .
NO I DO NT I HAVE A HUSBAND WE DO NT HAVE ANY KIDS YET .
OKAY UM .
ABOUT ALL I CAN SAY IS I GUESS ABOUT PICKING SCHOOLS UM I GUESS UH IF YOU DO NT KNOW WHAT YOU RE GOING TO DO LIBERAL ARTS PROGRAM IS A GOOD IDEA .
WELL I I ONE OF THE THE ADVICES WE VE GIVEN OUR CHILDREN IS THAT YOU CAN ALWAYS LEARN A JOB .
THIS IS TRUE .
UH BUT WHAT YOU CA NT LEARN UH ON A JOB IS A GOOD SOLID WELL WELLROUNDED EDUCATION .
RIGHT THE HUMANITIES THE HISTORY YEAH .
THAT S RIGHT YOU KNOW THE RENAISSANCE MAN .
RIGHT RIGHT NO NO NO .
AND UH AND IF YOU GET THAT YOU CAN AND IF YOU DO WELL YOU CAN YOU CAN LEARN A JOB .
YEAH BUT THEY YOU KNOW IF THEY LEARN THE JOB AND THEY CAN GO INTO GRADUATE SCHOOL .
THAT S EXACTLY RIGHT .
USUALLY A COMPANY IT WILL IF IT S WORTH IT S WEIGHT WILL SUBSIDIZE .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND .
SO THE ADVICE WE GAVE TO THEM .
UHHUH .
WAS NUMBER ONE VISIT THE COLLEGES .
THIS THIS IS TRUE .
THAT YOU RE THINKING ABOUT .
YES .
DESCRIBE FIRST OF ALL THE SIZE SCHOOL THAT YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN .
AND IF YOU WANT TO GO AWAY RIGHT .
DO YOU WANT TO GO AWAY HOW FAR FROM HOME DO YOU WANT TO BE .
RIGHT .
WHAT DO YOU WANT IN A COLLEGE NOW MY SON IS A NATIONAL LEVEL COMPETITIVE SWIMMER .
GOOD .
SO HE WANTED TO SWIM IN SCHOOL BUT HE DID NOT WANT TO BE IN A SWIM FACTORY .
OKAY SO HE WOULD NT HAVE GONE TO SOMETHING LIKE WHERE WE RE AT THEY D IN AUSTIN TEXAS UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS .
THAT S RIGHT THAT S THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN OR .
RIGHT .
STANFORD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
TEXAS AQUA YEAH .
SO HE DID NT EVEN CONSIDER THOSE .
OKAY WELL THAT S I THINK THE OTHER THING IS TOO UM I KNOW I WENT TO A UH CITY HIGH SCHOOL IN CHICAGO .
UHHUH .
AND A LOT OF THE KIDS WERE NT AS FORTUNATE AS SAY MY BROTHER AND I WERE AND ECONOMICS WAS THE CHOICE .
UHHUH .
UM SOUNDS LIKE YOUR SON HAS ACADEMICALLY THE STANDING TO GET INTO THAT TYPE OF SCHOOL .
HE IS VERY VERY STRONG ACADEMICALLY YEAH SO WE VE JUST BUT YOU KNOW HE HAD TO LOOK TO SEE .
UHHUH .
WHAT KIND OF ENVIRONMENT HE LIKED AND YET HE HE DID WIND UP HAVING TO MAKE A CHOICE HE DID APPLY TO A LARGE YOU KNOW LARGE GROUP .
YEAH UNIVERSITY OF PENN I M ORIGINALLY FROM PENNSYLVANIA PENNSYL UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA .
IT S GOT ABOUT NINE THOUSAND UNDERGRADUATE .
YEAH THAT S STRONG I MEAN THAT S .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
AND IT S IT S WELL IT S A LITTLE BIT I DO NT WANT TO USE THE WORD WILDER THAT S NOT THE WORD I WANT UM MORE DIVERSE .
YES AND IT BUT IT DOES HAVE THE UNDER YOU KNOW THAT S TOTAL UNDERGRADUATE WITH FIVE HUNDRED GRADUATE SCHOOL SO THAT THE UH THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES IS YOU KNOW I GUESS ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND .
AT WILLIAMS OR PENNSYLVANIA AT WILLIAMS .
AT PENNSYLVANIA .
AT PENNSYLVANIA WELL HOW LARGE IS WILLIAMS .
WILLIAMS IS AN UNDERGRADUATE SCHOOL ONLY .
RIGHT .
UM AND IT S A TOTAL OF TWO THOUSAND .
WELL THAT S NOT BAD .
YEAH SO HE KNEW THE FEELING BECAUSE MY OTHER SON IS AT AMHERST WHICH IS .
WHICH IS A LOT .
FIFTEEN HUNDRED .
YEAH .
AND HE HAD VISITED HIS BROTHER AT AMHERST AND KNEW .
UHHUH .
THAT HE LIKED THE ENVIRONMENT .
UHHUH .
BUT HE DID GO ON COLLEGE VISITS AND HE LIKED .
THAT S THE THING TO DO I MEAN I NOT HAVING ANY CHILDREN MY HUSBAND WAS AN OHIO STATE PERSON AND UH THAT HAS SOMETHING LIKE EITHER THE FIRST OR SECOND LARGEST STUDENT POPULATION LIKE FIFTY THOUSAND .
YES YES .
COMBINED MUMBLEX .
IT S LARGE AND THEY BOTH BOYS HAD DECIDED NO THAT THEY DID NOT WANT THAT .
YEAH THAT IS TOO MUCH AND I MEAN I UM I CAN ONLY SAY IT S STRANGE YOUR SON PICKED THOSE KINDS OF COLLEGE BECAUSE I SPENT A YEAR AT BENNINGTON IN VERMONT .
OH IT S SO YOU .
UM AND THAT WAS THIS WAS TWENTY YEARS AGO .
UHHUH .
SHOWING MY AGE .
AND DID YOU EVER EAT AT THE BLUE BIN DINER .
YES OH MY GOD WHERE ARE YOU FROM WELL LET S NOT TALK ABOUT THAT .
NO BUT WE VE BEEN THERE WHEN MUMBLEX WHOSE GONE UP THERE .
IT S UM IN THAT AREA I MEAN I JUST CA NT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT IT .
OH IT S IT MUMBLEX WE WENT AND HE WAS YOU KNOW IMPRESSED BY THE CLEAN AIR AND HE HE MET THE STUDENTS AT BOTH SCHOOLS AND HE LIKED THEM .
WELL YOU KNOW UM MY HUSBAND S AN ENGINEER AND A STRONG MUMBLEX A STRONG LIBERAL ARTS BACKGROUND WITH UH A GRADUATE DEGREE IN A TECHNICAL FIELD .
UHHUH .
WILL GET HIM MUCH FURTHER THAN SAY LIKE A A STRONG UM BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION DEGREE THAN WITH ANOTHER M B A .
THAT S IT .
ON TOP OF IT .
THE THING IS IF IF A PERSON REALLY KNOWS VERY EARLY ON .
UHHUH .
THAT THEY WANT TO GO .
AND THEY USUALLY .
IN A TECHNICAL FIELD THAN YOU RE NOT THEN IT S PROBABLY GOOD TO GO TO YOU KNOW TO APPLY TO A SCHOOL .
YEAH BUT THEY USUALLY DO NT .
WITH A GOOD TECHNICAL PROGRAM BUT UH FOR IF YOU RE GOING INTO IF YOU KNOW ENGINEERING IS THE THING IF THEN YOU VE GOT TO AT LEAST TAKE ENGINEERING .
RIGHT BUT THEY NO BUT WHO DOES I MEAN I THINK .
THAT S RIGHT .
I THINK ALL I THINK THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE JUST DO NT KNOW NO HE LOOKED AT CRITERIA SUCH AS LOCATION SIZE OF SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
UH .
NO HE DID NT APPLY TO ANY SCHOOL FURTHER THE FURTHEST AWAY WAS BOWDOIN IN MAINE WHICH IS ABOUT TWELVE HOURS .
THAT S STILL PRETTY FAR THOUGH I MEAN A LOT OF KIDS JUST DO NT EVEN WANT TO GO .
YEAH THAT WAS THE FURTHEST AND THEN KENYON IN OHIO WHICH WAS ABOUT SIX AND A HALF HOURS AND WILLIAMS IS ABOUT SEVEN .
OH THAT S NOT TOO BAD .
YEAH SO WELL I MEAN HE SO IT WAS NT HE YOU KNOW THEN THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA IS LIKE TWO HOURS FROM HERE BY TRAIN AND THEN BUCKNELL IN MIDSTATE PENNSYLVANIA .
MUMBLEX YEAH HE WILL ENJOY WILLIAMS I THINK AND MUMBLEX IS A GOOD ACADEMIC .
YEAH AND HE WILL AND IF IT CAME DOWN I MEAN AS HE HE CAME HE S BEEN TALKING TO THEM AND .
AND HE CAME DOWN AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HE SAID IS HE WENT TO PENNSYLVANIA THIS WEEKEND AND HE HAD AN ABSOLUTELY MARVELOUS TIME .
UHHUH .
HE HAD A GREAT TIME BUT THEN HE SAID YOU KNOW IT WAS SUCH A GOOD TIME THAT I ALMOST GOT THE FEELING THAT THEIR EMPHASIS IS ON HAVING FUN .
THAT COULD VERY WELL BE AND .
AND HE SAID IT ALMOST BACK I THINK IT BACKFIRED .
SO HE S DEVELOPING HIS HIS UH INTERNAL INSTINCTS RIGHT NOW THAT S GOOD BECAUSE .
SO .
I MEAN I M SURE WHAT HE SAID WAS TRUE THAT UH YOU WELL ACTUALLY THAT S ONE OF THE REASONS I WENT TO MUMBLEX KENYON HE WE HE MADE A GOOD CHOICE I WENT I WELL MUMBLEX I WAS SUPPOSED TO BUT I SPENT A YEAR IN VERMONT MY FRESHMAN YEAR IT WAS JUST TOO FAR AWAY IT WAS TOO DIFFERENT .
UHHUH .
UH THE LEVEL OF INCOME OF LOT OF THE STUDENTS AND THEIR ATTITUDES WAS JUST UM BEYOND MY .
YEAH YEAH .
UM IN TERMS OF DRUGS ET CETERA WHICH I THOUGHT WAS SHOCKING .
OF COURSE THAT PERIOD TOO WAS PROBABLY DIFFICULT .
RIGHT YEAH YOU RE RIGHT BUT THEN I WENT .
BUT I DID UH MY ADVICE TO HIM .
YEAH .
AND MY HUS WAS THAT UH HE HAD TO REALLY DECIDE WHAT HE WANTED OUT OF COLLEGE HE HAD TO LOOK AT HIMSELF UH IN A LARGER SCHOOL HE HAD TO REALIZE THAT IF HE WAS GOING TO SCREW AROUND IT HE COULD PROBABLY SLIP AND IT WOULD NT BE CAUGHT UP UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE WHERE IN A SMALLER SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
WHERE ESPECIALLY IN A KENYON OR A WILLIAMS WHERE YOU SEE THE PROFESSORS AROUND TOWN ALL THE TIME YOU SKIP CLASS IN THE MORNING AND THEY SEE YOU .
AND YOU RE GOING TO GET A LITTLE BIT MORE INPUT THAN .
THAT S YEAH YEAH .
DISCIPLINE YEAH .
AND A SWIM COACH IS GOING TO BE RIGHT ON TOP OF YOU UH SO THAT AND HE WILL KNOW THE PROFESSORS IN A SMALL .
WELL I DO NT KNOW HOW TO PUT THIS EITHER IN THIS WAY AND THEN IT DOES NT SOUND LIKE YOUR SONS WOULD NEED THIS BUT I JUST THINK THE OTHER THING IS WITH THE WAY A LOT OF THE YOUTH IS TODAY I THINK THE REFINEMENT THAT THEY GET .
UHHUH .
I DO NT MEAN SPECIFICALLY MUMBLEX OR CULTURE BUT JUST WHAT YOU RE SAYING JUST A SOLID BACKGROUND .
YEAH YEAH .
BECAUSE I JUST DO NT THINK AT THAT AGE I JUST DO NT THINK THAT YOUNG PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THEY WANT TO DO .
THAT S RIGHT THAT S RIGHT .
YOU KNOW AND UM .
AND UM AND IT S JUST THE PERSONAL CONTACT WHERE IF YOU NEED HELP .
THAT S RIGHT .
HE HAD I TOLD HIM TO LOOK TO YOURSELF ARE YOU THE KIND OF PERSON THAT WILL GO INTO A LARGE COLLEGE AND IF THE PROFESSOR SAYS I VE GOT OFFICE HOURS BUT YOU REALLY DO NT FEEL THAT YOU KNOW HIM BECAUSE YOU RE IN A CLASS OF A HUNDRED .
RIGHT MUMBLEX .
THAT YOU RE REALLY GOING TO LOOK HIM UP .
YEAH .
BUT IF IT S A CLASS OF FIFTEEN .
THIS IS VERY VERY .
AND YOU NEED HELP YOU KNOW THAT IT S MUCH EASIER TO DO IT AND ESPECIALLY IN THE LARGE SCHOOLS THEY HAVE LECTURES .
OH .
AND EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY BREAK IT UP INTO SMALLER GROUPS PENN IS KNOWN FOR HAVING .
THEY HAVE VIDEO LECTURES .
GRADUATE ASSISTANCE TEACHING .
YEAH VIDEO LECTURES .
THEY HAVE GRADUATE ASSISTANTS TO TEACH THE SMALLER GROUPS .
THIS IS TRUE AND I MEAN THAT IS VERY IRONIC TOO THAT YOUR SON JUST MADE THE DID HE JUST MAKE THE DECISION TODAY .
MUMBLEX HE MADE THE DECISION UH I D SAY ABOUT UH AN HOUR AND A HALF AGO .
HOW FUNNY .
YEAH I MEAN THAT S SO FUNNY I MEAN AND AND IN FACT HE HAD JUST AN HOUR BEFORE THAT TWO UH RECENT GRADUATES FROM KENYON SPENT CLOSE TO TWO HOURS TALKING WITH HIM .
THAT S FUNNY .
AND UH I MEAN AND HE THEY WERE REALLY NICE AND BUT HE SAID IS THAT THEY DID NT TELL HIM ANYTHING THAT HE DID NT KNOW BUT THEY HELPED CONFIRM HIS DECISION THAT A SMALLER SCHOOL WAS BETTER .
IT WAS EASY FOR HIM TO RULE OUT HE KNEW WHAT HE DID NT WANT .
YEAH YEAH .
THAT S EXACTLY YEAH NOW IS YOUR OTHER I MEAN WE RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT YOU THINK BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU RE EXPERIENCING IT UH .
MUMBLEX .
DID YOUR OTHER SON UM .
MY OTHER SON IS JUST AS HAPPY AS A BED BUG .
A CLAM .
HE THE MOMENT HE KNEW HE HE DECIDED EARLY ON THAT AMHERST WAS THE SCHOOL HE S A CLASSICAL GUITARIST .
OH WONDERFUL .
AND HE DECIDED HE ALSO GOT INTO THE GRADUATE SCHOOL OF MUSIC AS AN UNDERGRADUATE .
UHHUH .
FOR CLASSICAL GUITAR BUT HE DECIDED HE WAS GOING TO GO TO THE UM .
THE SMALLER AND THE .
THE SMALLER NOW AND THEN GRADUATE SCHOOL LATER .
AND THEY LL DO FINE IN THEIR STUDIES AND I M SURE THEY LL GO ON TO GRADUATE SCHOOL AND .
WELL HE S REALLY MY OLDER BOY S REAL HAPPY AND HE S MINORING IN ENGLISH AND HE HAD THOUGHT ABOUT ECONOMICS AND HE TOOK A COUPLE OF COURSES IN ECONOMICS AND DECIDED THAT WAS NT .
AND NOW HE S A SEN HE S A SENIOR OR IS THIS EARLY ADMISSIONS .
HE S UM HE S GOING TO BE A JUNIOR HE LL BE HE S FINISHING HIS SOPHOMORE YEAR .
SO HE S .
SO HE S DOUBLE MAJORING .
SO HE S YEAH WELL SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE TWO TALENTED SONS .
WELL YOU KNOW SEE THE ADVICE WE GIVE IS TO NOT LIMIT YOURSELF ESPECIALLY THIS YOU KNOW GO TO A SCHOOL WHERE YOU RE NOT FORCED TO MAKE TOO MANY IRREVOCABLE DECISIONS YOUR FIRST YEAR OR TWO .
I THINK AND A LOT OF PEOPLE TALK ABOUT AND IT S NOT THE ECONOMICS I SOLELY ZEROED IN ON BUT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THE TUITION LEVEL AND WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU GETTING IN RETURN .
YEAH .
AND I THINK THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE SHY AWAY FROM THE SMALLER COLL COLLEGES BECAUSE OF THAT AND I THINK IT S RATHER SAD .
WELL ONE OF THE THINGS WE SAID IS THAT THEY SHOULD PICK THE COLLEGE THIS WAS OUR ADVICE TOO IRRESPECTIVE OF THE COST THAT SOMEHOW WE WOULD MANAGE .
YOU ARE WONDERFUL PARENTS .
WELL WE PLACE A REAL HIGH PRIORITY ON EDUCATION IN OUR FAMILY .
NO AND I AGREE I MEAN MY HUSBAND AND I IN FACT I M TAKING MY L S A T S UM I M THIRTY SOMETHING .
OH GOOD THAT S WONDERFUL .
AND TAKING MY L S A T S ON JUNE TENTH .
OH THAT S GREAT .
THE POINT BEING AND YOUR SONS WILL LEARN THIS FROM YOU I M SURE THAT UH NO MATTER WHAT AGE YOU ARE YOU CAN LEARN .
THAT S RIGHT THAT S EXACTLY .
AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY RE GOING TO YOU KNOW THEY RE .
I THINK YOU GOT IT .
OKAY UH MY FIRST THOUGHTS ON CAPITAL PUNISHMENT I I THE FIRST THING I WANT TO SAY I IS NO JUST SIMPLY BECAUSE WE AS HUMAN BEINGS DO NT HAVE THE RIGHT TO TAKE ANOTHER HUMAN BEING S LIFE .
UHHUH .
UH WE ARE PUNISHING SOMEONE FOR TAKING SOMEONE S LIFE OR IN SOME CASES WE ARE PUNISHING S ONE A PERSON FOR TAKING SOMEONE S LIFE AND SO IN EFFECT WE ARE COMMITTING THAT SAME CRIME .
WELL IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE REALLY STRONG VIEWS ON IT .
UHHUH .
AND I CAN SEE THAT POINT BUT I ALSO HAVE THIS YOU KNOW I I QUESTION I GUESS I CAN LOOK AT IT BOTH WAYS AND JUST TO PLAY DEVIL S ADVOCATE .
RIGHT .
IT NEVER SEEMS RIGHT TO ME THAT UH WE TAKE IN PEOPLE THAT ARE CRIMINALS .
UHHUH .
AND PEOPLE THAT ARE YOU KNOW LOW INCOME OR EVEN MIDDLE INCOME THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES .
UHHUH .
OUR TAXES ARE PAYING TO FEED AND SHELTER THOSE PEOPLE .
AC .
AND IT JUST THAT THAT I FIND VERY DIFFICULT TO SWALLOW .
UHHUH .
SOMETIMES .
ONE THING I DO NT UNDERSTAND IS THE THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF DEATH ROW .
UHHUH .
OKAY THESE PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSEDLY I GUESS WAITING TO DIE RIGHT .
I M WITH YOU THERE .
OKAY AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS UPON .
UHHUH .
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ON .
UHHUH .
DEATH ROW AND I M NOT SAYING THAT OH I GUESS I AM KIND OF SAYING WHAT WHAT ARE WE DOING I MEAN I GUESS THAT S THE SAME THING YOU WERE SAYING WHAT WHAT ARE WE DOING WITH THESE PEOPLE .
HA .
THEY RE THERE WE SHOULD EITHER TAKE SOME KIND OF ACTION .
RIGHT .
OR TAKE ENOUGH OR .
EXACTLY .
GO A DIFFERENT ROUTE BUT THEY RE JUST .
AND THEN WHEN YOU THINK OF THE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS THAT GET BURNED IN COURT COSTS .
OH EXACTLY .
YOU KNOW WE COULD BE PAY FEEDING POOR PEOPLE AND HELPING YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
HELPING THE ENVIRONMENT I MEAN PRISON IS SUCH A WASTE OF A HUMAN BEING .
UHHUH .
IT DOES NT DO ANYONE ANY GOOD .
EXACTLY .
YES PEOPLE NEED TO BE PUNISHED .
UHHUH .
AND I DO AGREE WITH YOUR STATEMENT THAT TO TAKE A HUMAN LIFE IS WRONG .
RIGHT .
UM BUT YOU KNOW .
BUT ACT .
BUT LOCKING SOMEONE UP AND NOT GETTING YOU KNOW ANY BENEFIT .
UHHUH .
FROM THAT FOR THE PERSON OR FOR SOCIETY TO ME IS WRONG TOO .
AND I GUESS I SEE BOTH SIDES IN THAT AT THE AT THE SAME TIME THAT I M SAYING THAT YOU KNOW WE RE COMMITTING THE SAME CRIME .
UHHUH .
I ALSO AGREE THAT I MEAN IF THERE IS SOMEBODY OUT THERE THAT S CRAZY AND CRUEL ENOUGH .
UHHUH .
TO KILL SOMEBODY OR .
OH EXACTLY W .
IN SOME CASES KILL SEVERAL PEOPLE AT ONE TIME UH THERE WAS A CASE IN DALLAS WELL I M SURE THEY HAVE NT GONE TO COURT YET BUT UH APPARENTLY TWO TEENAGE BOYS HELD UP A TACO BELL THEY PUT FOUR PEOPLE IN A FREEZER AND SHOT THEM ALL NOW TO ME THAT IS INHUMANE AND FOR TWO PEOPLE TO BE OUT IN THE WORLD LIKE THAT I DO NT I DO NT WANT THEM IN MY WORLD .
THAT S RIGHT .
YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I AM SAYING .
THAT S RIGHT .
I M I M I MEAN I M NOT FOR KILLING ANYONE .
UHHUH .
BUT I DO NT WANT THESE PEOPLE AROUND .
WE WANT A .
AT THE SAME TIME .
SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR OURSELVES AND WE WANT TO REMOVE THEM .
EXACTLY .
BUT BUT I THINK THAT THE WHOLE CRUX OF THE PROBLEM IS .
UHHUH .
NO ONE HAS COME UP WITH A SOLUTION .
RIGHT .
THAT IS ACCEPTABLE .
AND .
THAT DOES YOU KNOW BASICALLY YOU KNOW I I THINK YOU KNOW THAT THE WHOLE IDEA OF UH THE DEATH PENALTY WAS INVENTED FOR TWO REASONS IT REMO REMOVES THEM FROM SOCIETY .
UHHUH .
AND NUMBER TWO IT S IT S KIND OF UH IT S THE PUNISHMENT IT S THE ULTIMATE PUNISHMENT .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY VE HARMED SOMEONE AND AND YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO APPEASE THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE SUFFERED .
RIGHT .
BUT IT IT REALLY DOES NT TAKE THEIR PAIN AWAY .
UHHUH AND AT AND AT THE SAME TIME LIKE YOU SAID IT DRAINS SOCIETY .
UHHUH BUT IT S A .
WE I THINK WE SHOULD BE WE THE SAME MONEY THAT WE RE USING TO BUILD MORE PRISONS AND MAKE MORE PRISON SPACE AND PU KEEP THESE PEOPLE IN PRISON THAT SAME MONEY OR HALF OF THAT MONEY COULD BE USED TOWARDS UH REHABILITATION PROGRAMS OF SOME SORT SOMETHING .
RIGHT .
TO GET TO TO PUT THESE PEOPLE BACK IN SOCIETY BUT PREPARE THEM FIRST .
EXACTLY BUT THAT THE PRO THE PROBLEM IS SO INCREDIBLY COMPLEX I HAVE A FRIEND WHO WORKS ON THE PARDON AND PATR PARO PAROLES AND SHE INTERVIEWS .
UHHUH .
INMATES ALL THE TIME THAT ARE COMING UP FOR PAROLE .
UHHUH .
AND SHE SAYS IT IS JUST REALLY FRIGHTENING HOW EASY IT IS TO YOU KNOW HAVE THE PRISONS RELEASE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY RE OVERCROWDED .
EXACTLY .
AND THESE PEOPLE HAVE NOT BENEFITED FROM THE STAY THERE SHE SAYS JUST THEIR EMOTIONAL STATE AND THEIR WAY OF THINKING IS SO INCREDIBLY WRONG .
UHHUH .
AND THERE S NOT ANYTHING SHE CAN DO TO KEEP THEM IN YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
IF THEY MEET CERTAIN GUIDELINES .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW AND THOSE GUIDELINES KEEP GETTING LESSENED AND LESSENED BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO DO IT TO MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK SO IT S .
UHHUH AND Y YOU WANT PEOPLE OUT OF PRISON AND YOU WANT PEOPLE TO GET JOBS AND .
UHHUH .
AND LIVE HAPPY LIVES BUT THEY CA NT JUST WALK OUT OF PRISON AND DO THAT THEY CA NT JUST .
THAT S RIGHT .
WALK OUT OF PRISON AND SAY OKAY I M GOING TO GO A DIFFERENT ROUTE .
THAT S RIGHT .
THERE HAS TO BE SOME SORT OF BUFFER .
UHHUH .
IN THERE SOME SORT OF PROGRAM OR AND I KNOW THIS COSTS MONEY BUT IT COULD NT COST ANY MORE MONEY THAN WE RE ALREADY SPENDING .
I KNOW I KNOW I I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE MONEY THAT S BEEN BUDGETED BUDGETED FOR NEW PRISONS BEING PUT INTO THE RESEARCH OF OF ALTERNATE SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEM .
UHHUH .
HOW ARE WE GOING TO FIX THAT TANYA HOW ARE WE GOING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN .
REALLY HOW WHAT CAN WE DO .
WHAT POWER DO WE HAVE .
OH GOODNESS I MEAN YOU KNOW EVERYONE S TRYING TO MAKE IT YOU KNOW IN THEIR OWN LITTLE WORLD .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW I M TRYING TO MAKE IT WITH MY JOB AND MAKE YOU KNOW MYSELF OKAY AND MAKE MY .
THAT S RIGHT .
FAMILY OKAY AND IT S SO HARD TO YOU KNOW TRY AND BE ONE OF THE MOVERS AND SHAKERS I GUESS YOU WOULD CALL THEM .
REALLY I KNOW I KNOW .
UHHUH .
BUT IT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE UH YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
INTERESTED IN WHAT S GOING ON AROUND YOU .
OH YES .
AND UH YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE A A VOICE YOU DO CONTRIBUTE AND I GUESS THAT S YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WE RE MEANT TO DO .
RIGHT .
MAYBE AN OPPORTUNITY WILL COME BY THAT WE WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO MAKE A REAL CHANGE .
UHHUH AND I I M A BROADCAST JOURNALIST AND SO I FEEL LIKE ONE DAY I PROBABLY WILL WRITE A BOOK OR OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW AND SOME OF THESE VIEWS .
WHERE DO YOU WORK .
WILL BE ABLE TO COME OUT I WORK AT CHANNEL SIX HERE I M I M A .
OH YOU DO .
NEWS REPORTER .
THAT S GREAT .
AND SO I I GUESS I M I M PRETTY EMOTIONAL ABOUT CRIME THINGS LIKE THAT NOW I VE ONLY BEEN IN IT FOR A YEAR BUT I GET .
UHHUH .
TO SEE PRETTY MUCH UH CLOSE UP YOU KNOW A LOT OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN THAT PEOPLE DO NT SEE UH I GOT TO S GET TO SEE A LOT OF CRIMES .
EXACTLY .
AND I GET TO SEE YOU KNOW PEOPLE S UH PAIN AND THINGS AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT .
UHHUH MOST OF US ARE SO SHELTERED YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
AND A FEW PEOPLE IN THE NEWS THAT BRING IT TO US .
EXACTLY .
AND MAKE US SEE WHAT S OUT THERE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
WELL THAT S YOU RE YOU RE REALLY PERFORMING A A BENEFIT TO SOCIETY .
A SERVICE .
IN DOING THAT .
YEAH BUT STILL YOU KNOW WE CA NT SH WE CA NT I DO NT KNOW I I GUESS I WOULD LIKE TO PROBABLY EDITORIALIZE MORE WE HAVE TO JUST REPORT WHAT S HAPPENING WE .
UHHUH .
CA NT SAY WELL THIS IS WHAT I THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
THE SITUATION SOMETIMES YOU REALLY WANT TO SAY THAT YOU REALLY WANT TO SAY YOU THINK OR WHAT YOU THINK SHOULD BE DONE OR HOW YOU THINK THIS COURT CASE SHOULD HAVE GONE OR YOU KNOW THAT S A .
I I M JUST I M JUST AGREEING WITH YOU WHEN I THINK OF IT HOW DIFFICULT IT MUST BE TO JUST TO JUST GIVE THE FACTS BECAUSE USUALLY ON AN ISSUE THAT YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT UH YOU WANT YOU WANT TO YOU KNOW PERSUADE PEOPLE TO YOUR VIEWPOINT .
UHHUH .
AND YOU RE RIGHT THAT HAS GOT TO BE A CHALLENGE SOMETIMES .
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE DEALING WITH A A SUBJECT LIKE UH CAPITAL PUNISHMENT OR SOMETHING OR .
RIGHT .
ABORTION OR SOMETHING WHERE THERE S AN AN NO OR YES SIDE AND YOU .
UHHUH .
HAVE YOUR SIDE AND YOU HAVE TO REPORT BOTH SIDES .
RIGHT .
BUT YOU REALLY DO NT WANT TO BECAUSE YOU HAVE YOUR SIDE .
AND YOU HAVE TO WALK RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE WITH IT .
YEAH YEAH .
YEAH .
SO SOMETIMES THAT S HARD BUT .
I M SURE WELL THAT S THAT SOUNDS INTERESTING .
UHHUH .

UHHUH .
I DO NT THINK THAT MEN REALLY TOOK THE TIME TO WORK ON THAT SORT OF THING .
YEAH EVEN IN WASHINGTON YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT MORE WOMEN INVOLVED .
HOPEFULLY THE NEXT GENERATION IT WO NT EVEN BE AN ISSUE I MEAN PEOPLE WILL JUST LOOK AT YOU AS A PERSON AND NOT AS A MAN OR A WOMAN .

UHHUH AND THEN .
AND THEN IF YOU GET IT YOU KNOW THEN .
UHHUH ALSO WITH UH WOMEN IN THE WORK FORCE .
THEY VE GOTTEN A LOT MORE OPTIONS AS FAR AS YOU KNOW WHAT S IT CALLED JOB SHARING .

AND THAT S A REAL ATTRACTIVE OPTION IF YOU HAVE THE THE TECHNOLOGY FOR IT .
UHHUH .

IT REALLY IS AND THAT WAY .
WE RE NOT REALLY MISSING ANY THING OUT YOU KNOW .
EITHER WAY .
OF MUMBLEX CHILDREN UHHUH .

THE COWBOYS GOT THE BEST END OF THAT DEAL .
DEFINITELY .
WELL HE WAS A GOOD PLAYER .
I GUESS WELL I DO NT KNOW HE JUST NEVER I DO NT KNOW FOR A WHILE THERE MUMBLEX .
I VE NEVER BEEN OVER IMPRESSED WITH HIM .
WELL HE COULD ALWAYS GET PAST YOU KNOW HE D GET PAST LIKE SIX OR SEVEN TACKLES AND JUST KEEP SPINNING AROUND AND GET ON INTO THE END ZONE .
BUT UM I GUESS YOU NEVER COULD REALLY SEE HIM PLAY BECAUSE WITH THE COWBOYS WHILE HE WAS WITH THE TEAM THE REST OF THE TEAM WAS PRETTY POOR SO YOU COULD NT REALLY TELL IF IT WAS JUST HIM OR THE TEAM AND I ALWAYS JUST ASSUMED THAT HE WAS TOO GOOD FOR THE REST OF THE TEAM .
BUT I DO NT KNOW .

UM I HAVE NO IDEA .
BU JERRY BURNS .
NO EARTHLY IDEA .
GOIN KE HE WAS GOING TO KEEP HIM AS THE COACH SOMEHOW BUT UH I DO NT KNOW I D LIKE TO SEE THE VIKINGS GET REVAMPED SOMEHOW .
HOW DID THEY END UP THIS YEAR .
DID THEY DID THEY MAKE IT TO THE PLAYOFFS AT ALL .
WELL THEY STARTED OUT REALLY BAD THEY WENT LIKE ONE AND SIX AND THEN THEY WON FIVE OR SIX IN A ROW .
UHHUH .
SO THEY WERE IN A SHOT TO MAKE THE PLAYOFFS AND THEY SCREWED UP THE LAST COUPLE OF GAMES .
KIND OF LIKE THE COWBOYS HUH .
YEAH I GUESS YOU CAN .
EXCEPT I THINK THE COWBOYS ARE ON THE UPSWING .
I DO NT KNOW ABOUT THE VIKINGS .
YEAH .
JUST HAD NT HEARD MUCH ABOUT THEM LATELY .
AND THE CARDINALS WERE KIND OF LIKE THE COWB IN FACT .
THEY WERE DOING BETTER THAN THE COWBOYS AND THE COWBOY COWBOYS CAME ON STRONG AT THE END OF THE SEASON AND THE CARDINALS GOT KILLED BY THE COWBOYS SO .
YEAH .
WELL THE CARDINALS I DO NT KNOW .
I THINK THE COWBOYS PROBABLY HAVE A A BETTER TEAM .
THEY JUST AT THE END OF THE SEASON THE KIND OF GOT MESSED UP WITH AIKMAN GETTING HURT BECAUSE UH LAUFENBERG JUST COULD NT EVER REALLY GET IT TOGETHER AT ALL .
OF COURSE HE SAT ALONG THE SIDELINES ALL SEASON HE NEVER REALLY GOT IN A GAME NEVER DID A WHOLE LOT .
OH DO NT MADE ANY EXCUSES FOR HIM .
WELL I M JUST SAYING I SHOULD NT I SHOULD NT BLAST HIM LIKE THAT SAY OH WELL LAUFENBERG GOT OUT THERE AND BLEW IT FOR THEM I MEAN HE DID NT GET TO SEE MUCH ACTION .
BUT TOO BAD .
BECAUSE NOW NOW YOU KNOW HE HAD A SHOT AND AND DID NT LOOK TOO GOOD AND SO NO ONE S GOING TO HAVE MUCH FAITH IN HIM .
ANY MORE .
UHHUH .
IN FACT I THINK THEY RE GETTING A DIFFERENT GUY FOR A BACKUP QUARTERBACK .
I HAVE NT UH I HAVE NT KEPT UP WITH IT LATELY BUT I REMEMBER READING SOMETHING A FEW MONTHS AGO ABOUT THEM SIGNING SOMEBODY ELSE ON OR OR TRYING TO GO AFTER SOMEBODY OR TRADE FOR SOMEBODY BUT IT WAS NT ANYBODY .
I D REALLY HEARD OF .
BUT I HEARD ON THE RADIO .
THIS MORNING OR YESTERDAY MORNING THAT UH AIKMAN S BACK IN PRACTICING DOING REAL REAL WELL .
UM WHO IS IT MICHAEL IRVIN .
UHHUH .
MUMBLEX .
HE SAID THAT UH AIKMAN WAS HITTING HIM RIGHT ON THE NUMBERS .
EVERY TIME .
SO SOUNDS LIKE HE S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT FOR NEXT SEASON .
THEY RE JUST TRYING NOT TO OVERWORK HIM RIGHT NOW UNTIL HE GETS HIS SHOULDER UH BACK IN SHAP IT WAS HIS SHOULDER WAS NT IT THAT HE HAD THE PROBLEMS WITH .
I DO NT KNOW .
YEAH I THINK IT WAS .
I THINK IT I THINK IT WAS HIS SHOULDER .
HE HAD SURGERY ON .
BUT ANYWAY THEY RE TRYING TO KEEP HIM YOU KNOW KEEP HIM UH FROM REINJURING ANYTHING BUT ANYWAY .
BUT UH WELL I GOT MY THIRTY DAY NOTICE YESTERDAY .
THIRTY DAY NOTICE FOR WHAT .

OH REALLY .
SO ANYWAY I GUESS WE CA NT TALK MUCH MORE ABOUT THAT BUT I JUST THOUGHT I D THROW THAT IN THERE .
WHAT .
OH OKAY MAYBE I LL CALL YOU BACK AFTER AFTER THE RECORDING IS FINISHED .
ACTUALLY I THINK WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT FOOTBALL FOR FIVE MINUTES .
I CA NT REMEMBER .
OH W I VE ALWAYS RAN OUT OF TIME EVER SINCE I VE DONE THIS .
REALLY .
I USUALLY HAVE TOO .
THEY ALWAYS SAY YOU VE TALKED YOUR TEN MINUTE LIMIT .
YEAH I VE DONE THAT ONCE OR TWICE .
I DID NT LOOK AT THE CLOCK WHEN WE STARTED TALKING SO I GUESS WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT FOOTBALL .
A LITTLE BIT LONGER JUST TO BE SURE WE GOT FIVE MINUTES IN .
MAKE SURE WE GET OUR CASH FLOW .
YEAH .
SO OTHER THAN THE VIKINGS WHO DO YOU LIKE .
UM ACTUALLY WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I WAS A CARDINAL FAN TOO .
UH OH .
REMEMBER JIM HART .
JIM HART WAS PLAYING .
TERRY METCALF WAS ON THE CARDINALS .
THIS WAS A LONG TIME AGO .
YEAH .
UM I DO NT KNOW WHO ELSE I VE EVER .
THAT S ABOUT IT I WAS ALWAYS A VIKING FAN .
I THINK I WAS INTO THE CARDINALS FOR A LITTLE BIT AND .
UHHUH .
BACK WHEN THEY WERE IN SAINT LOUIS .
YES OH OF COURSE .
SINCE THEY VE BEEN TO PHOENIX .
THEY HAVE NT BEEN UH ALL THAT IMPRESSIVE I GUESS .
I GUESS I VE ALWAYS BEEN A COWBOY FAN .
OTHER THAN THAT I MEAN YOU KNOW WHEN I VE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GROW UP IN A CITY .
THAT HAS THE YOU KNOW ONE OF THE GREATEST FOOTBALL TEAMS UNTIL THE LAST FEW YEARS YOU .
KIND OF TEND TO GET CAUGHT UP IN IT .
YEAH WELL THE COWBOYS WERE TH AMERICA S FOOTBALL TEAM .
YEAH .
THERE S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT SO .
YEAH I MEAN IT IT WAS REALLY EXCITING .
GROWING UP WHEN WHEN THE COWBOYS WERE REALLY BIG .
BECAUSE MY PARENTS WOULD ALWAYS HAVE SEASON TICKETS AND THEY D GO TO ALL THE GAMES AND YOU KNOW THE HYPE WERE JUST UNBELIEVABLE .
IT S JUST YOU KNOW THE LAST OH I GUESS PROBABLY SINCE ABOUT EIGHTYFOUR ABOUT EIGHTYFIVE WAS WHEN THEY STARTED KIND OF GOING DOWNHILL REALLY BUT YOU KNOW I M JUST USED TO ALWAYS GROWING UP AND HEARING COWBOYS COWBOYS COWBOYS AND YOU KNOW SUPER BOWL AND ALL THIS OTHER STUFF .
SO I CA NT YOU KNOW I M NOT GOING TO DECIDE I DO NT LIKE THEM JUST BECAUSE THEY RE HAVING A FEW BAD YEARS .
I MEAN I THINK THEY LL PULL OUT OF IT AND YOU KNOW THEY LL THEY LL WIND UP BEING GOOD AGAIN .
THEY VE GOT SOME LOT OF REALLY GOOD YOUNG PLAYERS .
THAT ARE GOING TO THAT ARE GOING TO UH DO PRETTY GOOD I THINK .
BUT THEY RE RAISING PRICES ON THEIR TICKETS .
SO THEY RE BANKING ON DOING GOOD NEXT SEASON .
I THINK TICKETS ARE .
AGAIN .
YEAH .
WHAT ARE THEY GOING UP TO THIRTY BUCKS OR SOMETHING .
THIRTY OR THIRTYTWO FOR REALLY GOOD TICKETS .
SEE THEY THEY SECTIONED IT OUT EVEN MORE .
THEY USED TO JUST HAVE LIKE UH FIRST OF ALL IT WAS ALL ONE PRICE .
AND THEN THEY SECTIONED IT OUT TO END ZONE AND THEN EVERYTHING ELSE .
AND NOW THEY RE SECTIONING IT OFF TO LIKE FROM THE FROM ONE TWENTY YARD LINE TO THE OTHER ONE JUST ON THE LOWER LEVELS IS THE HIGHEST PRICE AND THEN THE NEXT HIGHEST PRICE IS THAT SAME AREA BUT ABOVE IT ON THE UPPER LEVEL AND THEN LIKE FROM THE TWENTY TO THE TEN YARD LINE .
AND THEN THEY RE SOME SECTIONS KIND OF IN THE CORNER AREAS AND THEN THE CHEAPEST OF COURSE IS GOING TO BE THE END THE DIRECT END ZONES .
BUT UM THEY HAVE ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE DIFFERENT PRICES NOW THAT THEY RE STRUCTURING IT WITH BUT OBVIOUSLY YEAH THEY RE ALL GOING UP MUMBLEX MORE OR LESS IS WHAT .
IT S GOING TO DO .
SO NOW THE TICKETS EVEN GOT LOWER THAN THE LOWEST ONE LAST YEAR .
UM YOU KNOW I M NOT SURE I M NOT POSITIVE I DID NT I DID NT REALLY THINK ABOUT THAT .
I JUST REMEMBER TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE YOU COULD GET THAT WAS REAL CLOSE TO THE GOOD SECTION BUT IN THE LITTLE BIT CHEAPER .

I WENT TO THE COWBOYS GAME WAS DURING THAT UM N F L STRIKE OR THE WHEN THEY HAD THE SCAB TEAM TEAMS IN THERE AND IT WAS THE UH DALLAS AND WASHINGTON REDSKINS GAME .

UH I HAVE UH I GUESS A LOT OF THOUGHTS ABOUT THE VIETNAM WAR UM I I GUESS I FEEL LIKE I WAS PRETTY YOUNG WHILE IT WAS GOING ON AND SO THERE S PROBABLY A LOT OF THINGS I REMEMBER AND A LOT OF THINGS THAT I REALLY DID NT HAVE A CLUE AS TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING .
YEAH .
UM LOOKING BACK LIKE MAYBE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I KNOW NOW I I M NOT SURE I DO BELIEVE IT WAS WORTH THE COST IN DOLLARS AND LIVES .
THAT WAS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT SHE ASKED US TO THINK ABOUT BECAUSE I BECAUSE WE NEVER WENT TO WAR .
I DO NT THINK WE WERE COMMITTED TO WINNING IT AND GETTING OUT AND I .
RIGHT .
I FEEL LIKE IT WENT ON AND ON .
AND I I GUESS I SEE SUCH A CONTRAST LIKE AS OPPOSED TO THE MIDDLE EAST WAR WE JUST HAD WHERE PRESIDENT BUSH WENT OUT AND GOT WORLDWIDE SUPPORT FOR FOR WHAT WAS HAPPENING .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW I JUST FEEL LIKE MAYBE WE WENT IN TO BE POLICEMAN AND I M NOT SURE THAT S OUR ROLE BUT .
YEAH I I AGREE WITH THAT I WAS I WAS FAIRLY YOUNG AT THE TIME TOO I I REALLY DO NT HAVE VERY MANY MEMORIES ABOUT IT AT ALL IN FACT .
UHHUH .
AND UH MY HUSBAND IS A VIETNAM VETERAN AND I YOU KNOW HE IN LOOKING AT THE PERSIAN GULF WAR .
THAT JUST WENT ON HE I IT FRUSTRATES HIM BECAUSE OF THE SUPPORT THAT THEY HAVE AND THE SUPPORT THAT THE VIETNAM VETS DID NOT HAVE FROM THE PEOPLE OR THE ADMINISTRATION EITHER ONE .
DO NT YOU THINK THAT MAYBE THAT S WHY WE HAD IT .
THIS TIME .
I MEAN I DO THINK THAT I I IT S BEEN TOO LONG IN COMING BUT I FEEL LIKE MAYBE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND AND THE GOVERNMENT ARE AWARE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID WRONG THAT WE DID NT SUPPORT THAT .
RIGHT .
THAT THOSE SO MANY PEOPLE WERE OPPOSED TO THE WAR WHAT .
IT TRANSLATED INTO WAS THEY WERE OPPOSED TO THE FOLKS .
THAT WERE THERE FIGHTING IT AND THOSE GUYS WERE THERE DOING THEIR DUTY .
THAT S RIGHT I MEAN THEY WERE NT THERE BY CHOICE AND AND .
YEAH AND I I THINK THAT WE LEARNED FROM THAT AND I THINK IT IT S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT YOU LEARN THE HARD WAY .
IT WAS A TRAGIC MISTAKE .
RIGHT .
THE WAY THAT THEY HAVE BEEN TREATED OVER THE YEARS AND I BELIEVE THAT S JUST NOW TURNING AROUND .
JUST NOW YOU KNOW TRYING TO BE RECTIFIED AND I M AND I M NOT SURE YOU CAN UNDO THE DAMAGE .
THAT WAS DONE EMOTIONALLY .
RIGHT .
ON SO MANY OF THE PEOPLE .
NO I DO NT THINK YOU CAN AND I I AGREE WITH YOU THAT I I THINK THAT THE THE TIME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO WARS HAS ALLOWED A LOT OF PEOPLE TO SEE THE MISTAKES .
THAT WERE MADE IN IN IN EVERY ASPECT OF IT AND I I AGREE WITH YOU ALSO THAT I FEEL LIKE IT WAS NOT WORTH THE MONEY SPENT OR THE LIVES LOST TO FIGHT THAT WAR .
I MEAN THEY RE STILL NOT SETTLED OVER THERE .
NO THEY RE NOT .
AND I HAVE A FEELING THAT THE PERSIAN GULF CRISIS IS GOING TO BE THE SAME WAY .
YEAH .
I THINK WE RE GOING TO END UP BACK THERE IN A FEW YEARS OR IF IF NOT SOONER .
WELL I I APPRECIATE THE FA I FEEL LIKE PRESIDENT BUSH IS IN A HARD SPOT .
HE WENT OVER THERE TO GET THEM OUT OF KUWAIT WHICH .
HE DID .
UHHUH .
AND THEN HE HAS BACKED OUT HE HAS PULLED OUT .
AND I REALIZE THEY RE STILL SAYING WELL HERE YOU RE ENCOURAGING US TO GET RID OF SADDAM HUSSEIN SO WHY ARE NT YOU HELPING US .
AND YOU SEE I THINK HIM GOING IN AND DOING THAT WOULD BE PUTTING US IN ANOTHER VIETNAM SITUATION .
I THINK IT WOULD TOO .
AND I DO NT THINK THE U S WILL STAND FOR IT .
I DO NT THINK HE WOULD DO THAT .
NO .
UH I THINK WE LEARNED TOO MUCH .
YEAH I AGREE WITH THAT .
OF THE EFFECTS .
UH YOU KNOW WHETHER IT WAS JUSTIFIED OR NOT I KNOW THAT THEY PROBABLY FELT LIKE WE WERE GOING IN FOR A GOOD CAUSE .
I I FEEL LIKE MAYBE THEY FELT LIKE WE WERE DOING THE RIGHT THING TO TRY AND HELP MAINTAIN THE DEMOCRACY OVER THERE AND .
UHHUH .
AND BEAT THE COMMUNISM BUT BUT I THINK SOMEWHERE THAT GOT LOST .
YEAH YEAH .
YOU KNOW IN THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF THE OF THE WAR AND .
WE YOU HAVE TO I YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO GIVE BUSH .
A LOT OF CREDIT FOR HE HE SAID THAT S WHAT .
WE WERE GOING THERE TO DO AND HE DID WHAT WHAT .
HE SAID AND HE DID PULL OUT BEFORE IT GOT ANY FURTHER THAN THAT WHERE .
YEAH .
WHERE IT WOULD HAVE TURNED INTO MORE OF A POLICE ACTION .
UH OR MORE OF A POLITICAL ACTION .
I GUESS YOU GETTING INTO THEIR GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS .
WHICH .
YOU REALLY CA NT DO AS AS ANOTHER COUNTRY .
YEAH .
I MEAN TH MY MY BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH ALL OF THESE WARS IS WE SPEND ALL OF THAT MONEY ON ALL THESE OTHER COUNTRIES AND WE HAVE SO MANY PROBLEMS HERE AT HOME THAT WE DO NT ADDRESS .
THAT WE DO NT GET FIXED .
THAT S RIGHT .
I KNOW .
AND AND THA THAT S WHAT FRUSTRATES ME MORE THAN ANYTHING .
AND I I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE A MILITARY AND I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE A DEFENSE TO KEEP ANYBODY ELSE FROM WALKING IN AND DOING IT TO US .
RIGHT .
BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO TURN SO MUCH OF THAT INWARD .
I THINK THERE S A LOT OF WASTE AND AND THEY DO NT I IF THEY COULD JUST CUT OUT ALL THE FAT AND AND GET IT LEAN AND START ADDRESSING SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES I THINK WE COULD TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING .
AND QUIT TAKING CARE OF ALL THESE OTHER COUNTRIES ALL ACROSS THE WORLD .
YE .
YOU KNOW WHO JUST END UP USING THINGS AGAINST US LATER ON ANYWAY .
I KNOW I DO THINK THAT IN THE MIDDLE EAST WAR UM I THINK THAT MAYBE A LOT OF THE ARAB COUNTRIES .
THAT WERE SO HATEFUL TOWARDS THE UNITED STATES HAVE COME AWAY WITH UH KIND OF A DIFFERENT ATTITUDE .
UHHUH .
UH I THINK THAT MAYBE WE RE NOT THEIR BIG BAD ENEMY ANY MORE .
RIGHT .
AN UH AND I THINK THAT S GOOD YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
I THINK THAT S A GOOD .
YEAH A LOT OF GOOD HAS COME FROM THIS ONE .
I THINK SO TOO .
AND I THINK I GUESS IN IN UH IRONIC WAY .
A LOT OF GOOD CAME FROM THE VIETNAM WAR TOWARD THIS WAR BECAUSE LIKE WE WE SAID EARLIER THAT YOU KNOW THE .
A LOT OF EYES WERE OPENED AFTER YEARS AND YEARS OF OF THAT WAR AND AND .
AND PERHAPS THE REASON .
THAT GOOD CAME OUT OF THE MID EAST WAR IS BECAUSE WE HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF VIETNAM .
RIGHT EXACTLY .
SO I I I DO THINK THAT WE VE LEARNED FROM IT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW I I I WISH THERE WERE NT WAR .
YEAH NO KIDDING .
BUT UH I DO THINK WE LEARNED .
AND I JUST I JUST HATE THE EMOTIONAL PRICE .
A LOT OF THE VIETNAM PEOPLE PAID .
YES .
FOR YOU KNOW ER NOTHING .
I MEAN IT WAS THEY RE THEY STILL DO NT KNOW WHAT .
THEY WERE THERE FOR .
NO THERE WAS NO FEELING OF ACCOMPLISHMENT NO GOAL NO .
NO .
WE WENT IN BUT WHAT DID WE DO .
WE LOST LIVES AND AND WHAT WERE WE TRYING TO DO .
WHO KNOWS .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
AND I I THINK YOU RE RIGHT UH I THINK YOU RE RIGHT THERE .
UM I DO REMEMBER WHEN IT WAS OVER .
I REMEMBER WHEN THEY WERE COMING HOME .
UH BUT I REMEMBER THE FEELING BACK THEN YOU KNOW LIKE I FEEL LIKE RIGHT NOW I FEEL LIKE THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN BEHIND THIS WAR .
UHHUH .
UH YEAH THERE S A LOT OF PEOPLE .
THAT ARE NT FOR WAR .
I M NOT FOR WAR .
RIGHT .
BUT I BELIEVE THAT THE WAY THAT IT WAS DONE AND THE WAY .
THAT WAS HANDLED WERE RIGHT .
I DO NT REMEMBER THAT FEELING BACK IN VIETNAM .
RIGHT .
I JUST REMEMBER OH YEAH OUR GUYS ARE OVER THERE AND IT S SAD AND WE SHOULD NT BE FIGHTING A WAR BUT THERE WAS NO LET S SUPPORT THEM YOU KNOW .
RIGHT WE THE WHEN THIS WAR BROKE OUT IT FRUSTRATED ME .
ALL THI THE ANTIWAR PEOPLE AND YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
THEIR ALL THE DEMONSTRATIONS .
THAT WERE GOING ON .
I FELT LIKE THEY GOT WAY TOO MUCH MEDIA COVERAGE AND PUBLICITY BECAUSE THOSE KIND OF PEOPLE I MEAN YOU KNOW THEY RE THE KIND OF PEOPLE .

USUALLY I CAN TALK ALL DAY BUT THIS IS SOMETHING TO ME .
THAT S SAD .
YEAH IT IS .
SO WELL HAVE A GOOD DAY AND I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION .
THANKS SAME HERE .
BYEBYE .
BYEBYE .
HAVE YOU EVER GOTTEN ONE OF THOSE CALLS .
THAT IS EITHER GENERATED BY A COMPUTER OR SOMEBODY GOING DOWN A LIST AND THEIR EITHER OFFERING A SERVICE OR THEY RE INTRODUCING SOME NEW PRODUCT IN THE AREA AND NORMALLY WHEN THEY CALL YOU RE EITHER IN THE SHOWER OR YOU RE IN THE MIDDLE OF COOKING SOMETHING AND YOU HAVE TO STOP EVERYTHING TO RUN TO THE PHONE .
YES YES .
IS IS THAT .
ONE THAT YOU RE TALKING ABOUT .
THAT WAS THE BIG ONE .
I M TALKING ABOUT .
I WORK WEIRD HOURS AND INVARIABLY JUST ABOUT THE TIME I M GOING TO SLEEP THE PHONE TEARS OFF THE WALL .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND YOU ARE TRYING TO CRAWL OUT OF A HALF UNCONSCIOUS SLEEP AND ANSWER THE PHONE YOU EITHER HEAR THE CLI AS SOON AS YOU SAY HELLO YOU HEAR THE CLICK OF THE RECORDING COMING ON .
UHHUH .
OR YOU HEAR SOMEBODY .
ALL READY STARTING READING OFF A LIST OF STUFF THAT THEY VE READ PROBABLY A THOUSAND TIMES .
THAT DAY ALREADY .
THAT S TRUE OR THE ONES .
THAT ARE ARE GENERATED BY A COMPUTER .
IT S JUST A COMPUTER VOICE .
THAT COMES ON THE LINE .
THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT I REALLY REALLY HATE TOO .
I VE EVEN HAD SOME OF THEM THE THEY RE VOICE ACTIVATED AND YOU VE GOT TO SAY HELLO TWICE BEFORE THEY LL DO ANYTHING .
UHHUH UHHUH .
YEAH SOMETIMES I I GET THEM ON MY UH ANSWERING MACHINE AT HOME SO AND I HATE THAT WHEN I VE GOT A WHOLE BUNCH OF MESSAGES AND I GO THROUGH THEM AND MOST OF THEM ARE NT FROM ANYBODY AT ALL .
WHAT .
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE DONE TO STOP ALL OF THIS .
UHHUH .
WE VE GOT A THING IN THIS COUNTRY YOU CAN HAVE YOUR PHONE NUMBER UNLISTED .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK A LAW SHOULD BE PASSED TO WHERE ANY OF THESE PEOPLE I THINK IT S GREAT THAT YOU KNOW FREEDOM OF SPEECH IN THIS COUNTRY AND EVERYTHING BUT IF THEY RE GOING TO OFFER THESE SERVICES OR THESE RECORDED MESSAGE EVERYTHING THEY OUGHT TO BE STUCK WORKING WITH THE PHONE BOOK LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE INSTEAD OF USING A COMPUTER TO GO THROUGH AND JUST GO DOWN EVERY SEQUENCE OF NUMBERS FOR THIS CERTAIN AREA CODE AND CALL THEM .
UHHUH YES SEE I HAVE AN UNLISTED TELEPHONE NUMBER BUT I STILL GET ALL OF THOSE CALLS AND THEN SOME OF THEM ARE SPEAKING IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE THAT I DO NT EVEN UNDERSTAND .
SO YEAH I DO I REALLY FEEL THAT S UH AN INVASION OF MY PRIVACY .
I AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT PARTICULAR SUBJECT THERE .
LET ME SEE .
THAT S ABOUT THAT AS FAR AS ANY OTHER EVERYDAY OCCURRENCES I PUT A STOP TO SOME OF THEM AS FAR AS THE DOOR TO DOOR EITHER RELIGIOUS GROUPS OR PEOPLE PEDDLING PRODUCTS .
IF I WANTED THEIR PRODUCTS I WOULD HAVE EITHER GONE TO THE STORE TO BOUGHT IT OR I WOULD HAVE CALLED FOR THEIR SALESMAN TO COME OUT .
UHHUH UHHUH .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
LIVING IN AN APARTMENT COMPLEX THOUGH YOU KNOW YOU CA NT UM YOU CA NT REALLY STOP THOSE PEOPLE FROM COMING AROUND EVEN THOUGH THEY PUT UP SIGNS OUT FRONT .
THAT SAYS NO SOLICITATIONS UH BUT THEY STILL COME UP TO THE FRONT DOOR AND UH YOU KNOW WALK AROUND .
SO USUALLY WHAT .
I DO IS I LL CALL THE APARTMENT MANAGER AND TELL THEM HEY THERE .
S PEOPLE COMING AROUND YOU KNOW AND THEY RE TRYING TO SELL SOMETHING OR OR THEY RE FROM A RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATION AND I REALLY HATE THAT .
I REALLY REALLY DO .
I HAD SOMEBODY COME TO THE DOOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO AND UH GOSH IT WAS ABOUT NINE OCLOCK AT NIGHT TOO .
IT WAS NT EVEN WHAT .
I WOULD CONSIDER YOU KNOW FAMILY HOURS TIME TO YOU KNOW START GOING TO BED AND UH AND IT WAS SOMEBODY FROM UM OH WHAT WAS IT THE UH JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER DAY SAINTS AND UH I VE READ A LOT ABOUT UH THAT PARTICULAR SECT AND I DO NT PARTICULARLY CARE FOR IT SO I ESPECIALLY DO NT LIKE FOR THEM TO COME UP TO MY DOOR AND AND TRY AND TALK TO ME .
NOW I AGREE WITH THEIR RIGHT TO UH PURSUE THEIR RELIGION OF CHOICE IN THAT WHATEVER MANNER .
THEY WANT TO BUT I THINK THEY SHOULD ALSO RESPECT THE SANCTITY OF THE AMERICAN HOME WHETHER IT BE IN A HOUSE OR IN AN APARTMENT .
I M ON MY TURF IF I WANT THEM THERE I LL CALL FOR THEM OTHERWISE I DO NT WANT TO KNOW THEY EXIST .
YEAH YEAH NO I I AGREE WITH YOU THERE .
IF THEY WANT TO CHOOSE THAT PARTICULAR RELIGION .
THAT S FINE WITH ME TOO YOU KNOW AS LONG AS THEY DO NT TRY AND PULL ME IN AND DRAG ME IN .
AND AND I DO NT LIKE THE WAY THAT THEY DO IT EITHER AND AND IT S THEIR MISSION THAT THEY DO IT .
THEY GO DOOR TO DOOR AND THEY GO OUT INTO THE PUBLIC AND THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THE UH TEENAGERS SERVING TWO YEARS LIKE YOU WOULD SAY LIKE IN AN ARMY AND TWO YEARS IN GOING AROUND AND DOING MISSIONARY TYPE WORK AND UH I DO NT KNOW I JUST UM DO NT PARTICULARLY CARE FOR THAT AT ALL .
AND THAT THAT S ONE THING THAT I FEEL REALLY STRONGLY ABOUT THOUGH IS UH YOU KNOW PEOPLE COMING UP TO MY DOOR AND ESPECIALLY RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS AND WANTING TO UH YOU KNOW TO TRY AND GET ME TO JOIN OR YOU KNOW BECOME INTERESTED IN THEIR RELIGION BECAUSE I HAVE MY OWN .
NOW THE PART ABOUT WHERE YOU SAID THE APARTMENT COMPLEX PUTS UP SIGNS .
THAT SAYS NO SOLICITING I VE EVEN GONE SO FAR AS TO PUT THAT I VE GOT A STORM DOOR ON THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE AND I VE PUT IN I DO NT KNOW HOW MUCH CLEARER IT CAN BE IT S A RED SIGN WITH SILVER LETTERS SAYING NO SOLICITING .
I SHOULD HAVE I GUESS I SHOULD MAKE ANOTHER .
ONE .
THAT SAYS RELIGIOUS OR OTHERWISE CAUSE I STILL GET .
YEAH YEAH THAT S TRUE YEAH .
NO I DO NT UH I DO NT HAVE I DID NT GO THAT FAR BUT UH YEAH I PROBABLY COULD DO THE SAME THING UH YOU KNOW I DO NT HAVE A STORM DOOR BUT I M SURE I COULD RIG UP SOMETHING .
BUT YOU KNOW I DO NT THINK THAT THAT WOULD STOP PEOPLE .
I IT S LIKE THEY SEE THAT WORD AND IT SAYS GO INSTEAD OF STOP .
OH GOODNESS .
I WONDER IF THERE WOULD BE SOME WAY .
WE COULD GET THESE PEOPLE TO DO THIS GET THEIR NAMES THEIR ADDRESSES AND THEIR PHONE NUMBERS AND THEN REVERSE IT AND DO WELL THAT WOULD BE TECHNICALLY ILLEGAL IT WOULD BE HARASSMENT .
OH GOSH .
BUT I CONSIDER AN INVASION OF MY PRIVACY .
YEAH YEAH .
A HARASSMENT IN ITSELF .
YEAH YEAH YEAH THAT S TRUE THAT S TRUE UM .
WELL WHAT ELSE .
I BELIEVE WE VE PRETTY MUCH SUMMED EVERYTHING UP .
I KNOW BUT I REMEMBER YOU YOU TALKED ABOUT SOMETHING YOU STARTED OFF AND SAID WELL LET ME THINK YOU TALKED ABOUT THE TELEPHONE CALLS AND PEOPLE COMING AND SOLICITING AND SELLING THINGS AT THE DOOR .

OF THE HORSES .

NOT THIS PAST FALL BUT I MEAN FALL .
OH TWELVE TIMES OF THE YEAR .
A FEW YEARS I MEAN IT .
W IT WAS IN THE YEAH IT WAS ALMOST LIKE OCTOBER OF EIGHTYFIVE .
UHHUH .
I THINK WAS THE LAST TIME .
I WAS UP UP THERE AND AT CENTER PARK .
YEAH .

WHO WENT TO COLOMBIA AND I USED TO GO UP AND VISIT HER .

UHHUH .
ONE OF THEM IS A LOT BIGGER THAN THE OTHER ONE AND SHE PUSHES THE OTHER ONE AWAY FROM THE FOOD .
APPARENTLY W I DO NT KNOW ALL THE DETAILS BUT THEY WERE BORN AROUND CHRISTMAS BECAUSE ONE OF THEM IS NAMED TINSEL AND THE OTHER ONE IS NAMED HOLLY .

THEY RE BOTH SPAYED .
UHHUH .
UM OR WHATEVER .
IT IS NEUTERED YOU KNOW UM AND THEY RE THEY RE BOTH DECLAWED AT LEAST ON THE THE FRONT CLAWS .
UHHUH .
OKAY .
ALL RIGHT UH FEELINGS ON WHAT CAUSED THE S AND L CRISIS I GUESS I DO NT HAVE A REAL TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE FOR WHAT HAPPENED I GATHER THAT THERE WHERE LARGE NUMBERS OF SITUATIONS WHERE LOANS WERE MADE THAT APPEARED TO BE A GOOD LOAN BUT IN A SPECULATIVE SINCE AND WITH HAVE LITTLE REGULATION GOING ON BECAUSE OF DEREGULATION DURING THE REAGAN EIGHT YEARS UH MORE AND MORE S AND L SIMPLY BEGAN TO TAKE RISKIER AND RISKIER LOANS AND THEN WHEN THEY BEGAN TO COLLAPSE ONE AFTER THE OTHER I THINK ALMOST LIKE AN AVALANCHE OF OF PROPERTY VALUES DEVALUED .
UHHUH KIND OF LIKE A DOMINO S EFFECT .
RIGHT I DO NT HAVE A A FIELD FOR WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS THE EQUIVALENT OF WHAT WAS CALLED THE TEAPOT DOME .
OH MUMBLEX .
UH SCANDAL ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THAT .
NO .
FROM YOUR HISTORIES LESSONS OR WHATEVER .
NO .
UH I VAGUELY RECALL BUT I VE NEVER GONE AND DONE ANY STUDY ON IT SINCE THE S AND L THING THAT TEAPOT DOME SCANDAL IS WHEN I THINK DURING THE HOOVER YEARS WHERE GOBS OF LAND WAS WAS SOLD AT REALLY INFLATED PRICES ON THE THEORY THAT THERE WERE NATURAL GAS BENEATH IT AND THAT THAT APPEARED TO BE CORRUPTION WITHIN THE HOOVER ADMINISTRATION I DO NT HAVE A REAL SINCE OF OF LIKE CORRUPTION THAT CAUSED S AND L ALL THOUGH I HAVE A FEELING THAT PEOPLE LOOK THE OTHER WAY WHEN THINGS BEGAN TO GO SOURER MAYBE .
UHHUH NO I DO NT THINK IT WAS REALLY CORRUPTION THAT CAUSED IT OR WITHIN I THINK PEOPLE JUST STARTED YOU KNOW NO NOT BEING AS CAREFUL WITH THE LOANS THAT THEY WERE MAKING WHENEVER YOU KNOW WHENEVER THEY GAVE THEM OUT .
UHHUH .
I THINK MAYBE THEY DID NT CHECK INTO THEM ENOUGH OR MAYBE BECAUSE EVERYONE ELSE WAS DOING THEY FIGURED THEY WOULD JUST GO AHEAD AND APPROVE IT ALSO SO .
YEAH .
YEAH .
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE WERE ON AWFUL A LOT OF PEOPLE MAKING LOANS AND BUSINESS DECISIONS ON A GET RICH QUICK IS THE WRONG PHRASE BUT IF IT CAPTURES SOME OF THE THE FEELING I HAVE FROM THE PEOPLE MAKING BUSINESS DECISIONS THAT IF THEY FAILED IT S SORT OF WELL NO SKIN OF MY BACK I LL MOVE ON TO THIS OTHER COMPANY .
UHHUH .
OR .
UHHUH .
I I JUST SINCE THAT THEY DID NT HAVE A COMMITMENT TO THE STABILITY OF THE ORGANIZATIONS THEY WERE WERE MAKING THE DECISIONS FOR .
UHHUH .
AND I DO NT KNOW WHETHER THAT S BECAUSE THEY HAD OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO WHICH THEY COULD MOVE YOU KNOW THAT IT WAS THAT EASY FOR THEM TO FIND NEW WORK THAT THEY DID NT WERE NT STUCK TO WHERE THEY WERE AND THINGS BEGIN TO COLLAPSE THEY JUST MOVED ON .
I M NOT SURE .
OR WHETHER THEY HAD EXTRACTED ENOUGH MONEY IN A PERCENTAGE BASE THAT THEY THAT THEY DID NT CARE ANY MORE I JUST I M RATHER PUZZLED ABOUT THE .
UHHUH .
WHOLE THING .
I KNOW WELL I M UH I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT BUT I DO NT AS MUCH AS I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT IT I M A FINANCE MAJOR HERE AT CLARION .
OKAY .
AND UM I DO KNOW THAT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT CAUSED IT IS THE FACT THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVED BACKED ANY LOAN THAT THE SAVINGS AND L MADE WITH A A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS SO THEY WERE KIND OF INSURED WITH THAT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND I THINK THAT S KIND OF WHY THEY THEY WERE MAKING THE RISKIER LOANS BECAUSE THEY WERE LIKE OH WELL WE HAVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS INSURANCE ON IT .
WELL THEY DID NT THEY DID NT HAVE A SINCE OF RISK .
NO I DO NT THINK SO .
OH OKAY .
AND UH PLUS WHERE THE FACT WHERE THEY WERE ALLOWED TO MAKE LOANS IN ANY ALMOST ANY TYPE OF LOAN AND LIKE SOME BANKS YOU KNOW THEY RE LIMITED TO THE TYPES OF LOANS THAT THEY RE ALLOWED TO MAKE .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK THE S AND L S WERE MORE OPEN WITH THE TYPES OF LOANS THAT THEY WERE ALLOWED TO MAKE .
OKAY .
AND I THINK IF THEY WOULD BE MORE BOUND TO CERTAIN LOANS AND NOT AS HIGH OF INSURANCE BY THE RESERVE THEN I DO NT THINK THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED .
OKAY WELL DO YOU THINK WE THERE S A FINAL ACCOUNTING YET NOT IN THE SINCE OF PENNIES AN NICKELS BUT DO YOU THINK THERE S ACCOUNTING ON AN ORDERED OF MAGNITUDE OR OR THAT THAT THEY REALLY DO UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH MONEY IT IS FOR AWHILE IT SEEMED LIKE EVERY TIME I OPENED THE PAPER UP IT WAS ESCALATING IN TERMS OF DAMAGE UH .
UHHUH .
DID IS YOUR SINCE THAT WE NOW UNDERSTAND HOW BAD IT IS .
OR IS THERE MORE TO BE HEARD YET .
UM I THINK THAT PEOPLE JUST BASICALLY GOT TIRED OF HEARING IT AND IT WAS NT MAKING IT WAS WAS NT AS GOOD NEWS AS IT WAS I THINK IT S STILL YOU KNOW I ADDING UP AND I THINK IT WILL BE FOR AWHILE .
SO YOU DO NT THINK NECESSARILY THEY DO NT HAVE A COMPLETE GRASP YET .
NO .
OR WHETHER MUMBLEX .
I I DO NT THINK THEY DO I DO NT THINK HOW I DO NT THINK HOW THEY COULD FIND THAT BIG HOW MUCH WAS REALLY LOST OR HOW MUCH THEY WERE GOING TO LOSE BECAUSE THERE STILL ARE SOME S AND LS STILL OPEN .
UHHUH .
AND IT S IT S VERY POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO GO DOWN IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE OF THIS .
TO BE CAUGHT IN THE MUMBLEX .
UHHUH UHHUH .
DO YOU THINK TO POSSIBLY IS THAT IT WILL HELP WITH THE REGULAR BANKS .
I I DO NT KNOW I THIN I THINK IT WOULD BE HARDER BUT I THINK THERE ARE SOME REGULAR BANKS THAT WILL GO DOWN WITH IT .
IT SEEMS THAT I RECALL READING FOR THE LAST OH LET S SAY STARTING THREE YEARS A GO BUT NOT SO MUCH IN THE LAST YEAR OF BANK RISKS OF RELATIVE TO THE LOANING FUNDS TO THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES LIKE MEXICO VENEZUELA .
UHHUH .
UH AND ARGENTINA BASED ON OIL LOANS AND THEN THE PRICE OF OIL HAD HAD GONE SOUTH RESULTING IN THOSE LOANS BEING VERY RISKY AND I GUESS I READ ARTICLES OF VARIOUS BANKS THAT HAVE DONE THE RIGHT THING TO CONTAIN THEIR RISKS GIVEN THAT THEY HAD MADE MULTIPLE BILLION DOLLAR LOANS I HAVE THIS VAGUE SINCE THAT THAT COULD HAPPEN THAT THAT THERE ARE STILL MONIES LOANED OUT TO THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES THAT COULD END UP BEING TOTALLY LOST .
OH YEAH UM IN SOME OF MY CLASSES NOW I WAS JUST READING I THINK IT WAS IN VENEZUELA I CA NT REMEMBER WHAT COMPANY IT WAS BUT THEY JUST WROTE OFF LIKE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY WILL NEVER GET IT BACK .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND THEY JUST THEY JUST WROTE IT RIGHT OFF I THINK I THINK WE VE LOST A LOT OF MONEY AND YOU KNOW LIKE WE EVERY NEVER GOING TO GET IT BACK IT S IMPOSSIBLE TO GET IT BACK .
AND SO YOU THINK THAT IT S JUST GONE .
UHHUH UHHUH YEAH CAUSE WE WE RE YOU KNOW WE RE TALKING ABOUT SOME PEENS THAT HAVE JUST LIKE EVEN GAVE UP ON LIKE GETTING IT BACK AND TRYING ANY MORE .
OKAY .
THEY JUST TOTALLY WROTE IT OFF THEIR BOOK .
DO YOU THINK IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE THE FEDERAL GUARANTY PROGRAM LIKE MY SINCE IS IT WAS THERE TO TRY TO PROTECT SMALL INVESTORS BUT IT ENDED UP PROTECTING BIG INVESTORS .
OH .
WHICH I DO NT THINK WHAT IT WAS MEANT TO DO SO I GUESS I I FEEL LIKE AS LONG AS WE HAVE THE POSSIBILITY FOR THIS LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE TO BE PROTECTED THE POSSIBILITY EXIST FOR THESE SORTS OF PROBLEMS .
UHHUH UM YEAH I THINK IS IT NECESSARY TO HAVE UM THE BACKING UM IT IT S IT S JUST FOR YOU KNOW SAFE PURPOSES YOU KNOW IN CASE SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN UM YEAH I DO NT I NE YEAH AS LONG AS THERE S ENOUGH LITTLE COMPANIES WE RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING .
UM SO YOUR SINCE IS THAT THE THAT UH THE LOAN GUARANTIES WHICH REALLY WERE ACCOUNTS GUARANTIES .
UHHUH .
SO THE SO THAT THE ACCOUNT HOLDERS THAT IF SOMETHING WENT WRONG THEY WOULD HAVE THEIR MONEY .
RIGHT .
AND GIVEN THAT THE S AND LS HAVE HAD DISASTERS THEN THOSE ACCOUNT HOLDERS ARE ARE THEIR MONEY IS STILL BEING PROTECTED .
UHHUH .
AND THAT IS IT S MILLION OF PEOPLE WITH ANYWHERE FROM THOUSANDS TO TENS OF THOUSANDS I GUESS OF .
UHHUH .
OF DOLLARS BEING PROTECTED IT IT SEEMS LIKE UM THERE WAS A LOT OF MONEY BEING PROTECTED IN MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS UH IT S IF IF YOU TAKE TEN MILLION PEOPLE AND PROTECT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IT STILL ONLY A HUNDRED BI BILLION DOLLARS AND WE RE TAKING ABOUT MONIES WAY IN ACCESS OF THAT NOW SO IT S OBVIOUS THAT WE VE PROTECTED LARGE ACCOUNTS .
UHHUH .
AND PERHAPS MULTIPLE PEOPLE IN MULTIPLE S AND LS AND AND IT SEEMS LIKE MAYBE THAT NEEDS TO BE THOUGHT ABOUT RETHOUGHT .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW THAT THE FOR I GUESS I M CONTENT WITH THE NEED TO HAVE PROTECTION ON ON ACCOUNTS BUT I FEEL LIKES IT S ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS SOMEONE WHOSE GOT ACCOUNTS IN THIRTYFIVE DIFFERENT S AND LS OR THIRTY OR FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THEY RE ALL PROTECTED BY THE GOVERNMENT SEEMS TO ME LIKE THEY VE GOTTEN AROUND WHAT WAS .
INTENDED TO BE THE ISSUE THERE .
UHHUH I GUESS I DO NT HAVE A PERSONAL SINCE OF V ON IT SINCE I .
UHHUH .
WAS NOT A HEAVY USER OF ANY S AND LS AND AND LET ALONE ANY OF THEM THAT WENT BANKRUPT .
AND I GUESS THAT MEANS THAT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN .
I THINK IT COULD HAPPEN .
BECAUSE THAT MEANS .
YEAH .
I M NOT WORRIED ENOUGH UH IT S KIND OF THING WHERE MAYBE WE LL SURVIVE AND THEN I THEN IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN BECAUSE WE DO NT PAY ATTENTION TO THOSE KINDS OF THINGS .
I THINK IT LL HAPPEN AGAIN BUT I THINK IT WILL BE A LONG TIME IN THE FUTURE BEFORE IT DOES HAPPEN AGAIN BECAUSE I THINK LIKE THE BANK PEOPLE IN ANY KIND OF PEOPLE LIKE THAT ARE GOING TO BE WORRY ENOUGH NOT TO LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN IN THE NEAR FUTURE BUT I THINK LATER ON THEY RE GOING TO START AND FORGET ABOUT AND START MAKING THE RISKIER LOANS BECAUSE I MEAN YOU RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE SOME RISK AND AS LONG AS THEIR BACKED I THINK THEY RE STILL GOING YOU KNOW START TAKING ON RISKIER LOANS AND I THINK THERE IS A CHANCE OF IT POSSIBLY HAPPEN AGAIN BUT NOT UNTIL YOU KNOW LATE YOU KNOW IN THE FUTURE .
UHHUH WELL PERHAPS IF THERE ARE REGULATORY UH CONSTRAINTS PUT BACK IN PLACE .
UHHUH .
IT WILL PROTECT THAT MAYBE WE HAVE LEARNED A LITTLE BIT OF A LESSON HERE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU REMOVE A LITTLE OF THE REGULATION UH .
SO WELL THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE TOPIC .
THE DAY AFTER EARTH DAY SO .
RIGHT .
UM WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK IS UH THE POLLUTANTS THE MAIN POLLUTANTS IN THE AIR .
I HAVE TROUBLE WITH THE CHEMICAL PLANTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT I JUST UH I THINK THEY PUT OFF SO MUCH AND THEY RE NOT REGULATED ENOUGH .
YEAH WELL THAT S ME TOO .
AFTER UM ON CHANNEL THIRTEEN UH THEY HAD SOME SOME PROGRAMS .
THE DAY BEFORE AND I M NOT SURE THAT ABOUT YESTERDAY WE DID NT REALLY WATCH IT .
TOO MUCH YESTERDAY BUT THE DAY BEFORE THEY HAD A LOT OF PROGRAMS ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT AND YOU KNOW HOW WE RE AFFECTING THE EARTH AND THINGS BY WHAT .
WE DO .
UHHUH .
AS THE PEOPLE AND AND THEY MENTIONED SULFUR AND CARBON DIOXIDE .
A LOT .
YEAH .
AND THAT ACTUALLY UM AS OUR POPULATION INCREASES AND YOU KNOW OUR OF COURSE OUR OUR CARS YOU KNOW OUR NUMBER OF CARS INCREASE PER THE POPULATION THAT S THE PROBLEM .
BUT ALSO LIKE YOU SAID THE INDUSTRY POLLUTION AND YOU KNOW THEY RE REG THEY RE REGULATION .
THAT S PLACED ON THEM IS I MEAN IT S BETTER THAN IT USED TO BE BUT IT S INCREDIBLE THAT THEY STILL DO NT HAVE YOU KNOW THEY DO NT THEY RE NOT MADE TO REGULATE THE AMOUNT OF POLLUTANTS THAT THEY PUT INTO THE AIR .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW I I JUST I CA NT STAND THAT AND I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THEY GET AWAY WITH A LOT THAT YOU KNOW THEY RE SUPPOSED TO BE REGULATED BECAUSE WE HAVE A WE HAVE A PLANT I DO NT KNOW ABOUT T I BUT WE HAVE A PLANT UH A PILLSBURY PLANT .
UHHUH .
IN IN A TOWN ADJACENT TO OURS AND I KNOW PEOPLE .
THAT WORK THERE THAT OF COURSE YOU WOULD NT THINK PILLSBURY WOULD PUT OUT CERTAIN CHEMICALS .
NO .
BUT THEY PUT OUT TOXIC CHEMICALS .
THERE JUST IN SOME OF THE UM WHAT .
THEY DO UH TO UH MAKE THEIR DOUGH AND ST TO .
REALLY .
CLEAN OUT THE FLOUR AND STUFF LIKE THAT YEAH .
HUH .
I MEAN IT S INCREDIBLE .
AND UM THEY SAID THAT THEY RE YOU KNOW THEY HAVE A LITTLE CREEK .
THAT RUNS BY THEM AND SOME OF THE PEOPLE .
THAT WORK THERE HAVE TOLD ME THAT WHEN THEY HAVE INSPECTORS COMING THEY YOU KNOW SHUT DOWN EVERYTHING AND THEY CLEAN UP THEIR ACT BUT ON A NORMAL BASIS THAT THEY RE THAT THEY RE DUMPING THINGS .
OH .
THAT THEY RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE DUMPING AND I M LIKE IF THEY RE GETTING AWAY WITH IT .
RIGHT .
CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT S A THAT S A PILLSBURY PLANT .
I CA NT IMAGINE PLANTS .
I WOULD NT HAVE THOUGHT THAT PILLSBURY COULD WOULD THE I MEAN OR EVEN HAD CHEM YOU KNOW WELL THOSE CHEMICALS WOULD NOT .
YEAH THEY HAVE CHEMICALS THAT THEY USE TO REFINE THEIR FLOURS WITH AND STUFF .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW TO TO BREAK THE FLOURS DOWN AND THEN THEY THEY ALSO DO TESTING THERE AND I DO NT YOU KNOW WH WHEN YOU CONSIDER YOU KNOW IT S PROBABLY NOT RADIOACTIVE BUT TOXIC CAN BE CAN BE ANYTHING .
THAT S CR UH CLASSIFIED THAT CAN DAMAGE THE EARTH .
RIGHT YEAH .
SO THERE COULD BE A LOT OF THINGS THAT THEY COULD PUT YOU KNOW THAT CHEMICAL WISE THAT THEY USE TO UH THAT THEY ARE TESTING WITH .
RIGHT YOU KNOW LIKE IN .
THAT THEY RE DUMPING .
YEAH .
IN PACKAGING AND UH YOU KNOW JUST GOODNESS .
YEAH I DO NT THINK THEY DO THE PACKAGING AT THIS PLANT .
YEAH .
BUT THEY DO THEY DO A LOT OF RESEARCH AND THEY DO UM THEY DO DO A LOT OF THE REFINING UP THERE OR .
YEAH .
I M NOT REALLY WHAT S IT CALLED WHEN YOU DO FLOUR I M NOT .
UH ONLY THING .
I CAN THINK IS BLEACHING BUT I MEAN I .
YEAH .
I DO NT KNOW WHAT S HOW THEY DO THE FLOUR .
YEAH .
BUT UM WE WE RE ON THE SOUTHWEST SIDE OF HOUSTON WE DO NT HAVE THAT MUCH AS FAR AS UH AIMING IN THE PLANTS OVER ON THIS UH THE WE EAST SIDE DOES .
UHHUH .
WE VE GOT IMPERIAL SUGAR BUT UH AND THEY RE YOU KNOW THEY RE RIGHT THERE ON THE CREEK ALSO AND UH THEY VE BEEN THERE FOR YEARS .
YEAH .
AND UH .
BUT I MEAN YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT YOU KNOW IT S PROBABLY A LOT EASIER TO DETECT THINGS .
THAT GO INTO THE GROUND THAN IT IS MAYBE TO JUST I M NOT REALLY SURE BUT I WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE EASIER TO DETECT THOSE THINGS BECAUSE YOU COULD DETECT THEM DOWN STREAN OR STREAM OR SUCH .
YEAH .
OR YOU CAN YOU CAN YOU KNOW DO UH TESTING ON THE GROUND .
ITSELF AT THAT POINT .
UHHUH .
BUT WHEN THEY POLLUTE INTO THE AIR AND YOU VE GOT YOU KNOW AND YOU VE GOT MOVEMENT THROUGH THE AIR IT S GOING TO MOVE A LOT OF THAT OFF .
SO I DO NT SEE YOU KNOW HOW THEY CAN DO SOME OF THE TE UNLESS IT JUST HANGS THERE LIKE IN PLACES WHERE IT S A LOT OF POLLUTION YOU KNOW LIKE IN LOS ANGELES OR OR THE BIGGER CITIES WHERE IT IT TENDS TO GET STUCK THERE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A LOT MORE PARTICLES IN THE AIR .
RIGHT YEAH .
YOU KNOW PER PER UH PER PARTICLES IN THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY BECAUSE IT S NOT MOVED AWAY .
UHHUH .
BUT UM .
I KNOW THAT I WORRY EVERY NOW AND THEN WE RE STILL ON A WELL WATER WE RE NOT ON CITY WATER .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK WELL WHAT IF SOMEBODY .
S DUMPED SOMETHING BACK THERE IN THE AND NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT IT AND YOU KNOW IT SINKED IN THROUGH THE GROUND AND ALL THAT .
YEAH WELL I KNOW OUT IN SOME I M NOT SURE I CA NT REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE COUNTY .
IT S IT S WHERE STILLWATER IS OR .

UHHUH .
BREAKS IT DOWN AND AND THIS AND THIS ARTICLE SAID THAT THEY VE GOT A REAL PROBLEM THAT UM YOU VE GOT TOXINS AND AND UH BACTERIA IN THE MANURE .
THAT IS WHAT .
IT S DOING IS IT S GOING THROUGH UH THEY DO NT HAVE A VERY DEEP UM O YOU KNOW THEY RE WATER .
UHHUH .
THEY RE NATURAL WATER UH I FORGET WHAT .
THAT S CALLED WITH YOU KNOW IT S LIKE A SPRING SPRING WATER .
YEAH .
BUT IT S BELOW THE SURFACE .
IT S NOT VERY FAR DOWN .
UHHUH .
AND ALL THIS STUFF IS SEEPING THROUGH TO THE WATER .
OH .
AND THEY RE LIKE THEY RE AFRAID THAT YOU KNOW WITHIN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF YEARS THAT IT S THEY RE WA THEY RE WATER IN THAT TOWN WILL BE TOTALLY POLLUTED .
IT WILL .
AND THEY WO NT BE ABLE TO HAVE ANY .
DRINKING WATER BECAUSE THEY WILL HAVE UM POLLUTED COMPLETELY POLLUTED SO THAT THEY RE YOU KNOW THERE S TOO MANY TOXINS AND BACTERIAL GROWTH .
UHHUH YEAH AND THE GR .
AND I M LIKE MY GOD YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
JUST FROM THAT ONE YOU KNOW JUST FROM THEM .
INTRODUCING DAIRY FARMS .
RIGHT .
IN THAT ONE COUNTY .
YEAH AND THE THE GROUND WILL FILTER SOME OF IT BUT NOT ALL OF IT .
NO NOT WHEN YOU FIGURE I DID NT REALIZE A COW ONE COW PRODUCES THAT MUCH MANURE AND THEY WERE TALKING LIKE .
THESE ARE WELL FED .
THOUSANDS OF COWS YOU KNOW .
THESE ARE .
THEY WERE TALKING THOUSANDS COWS IN ONE LITTLE TINY AREA .

GOOD GRIEF THESE ARE WELL FED COWS UH .
WELL THEY ARE EVIDENTLY .
BUT UM I MEAN EV EVIDENTLY A NORMAL COW PRODUCES THAT MUCH TOO .
UHHUH .
BUT THEY RE JUST SO SPREAD OUT ON RANCHES AND STUFF THAT IT S NOT YOU KNOW A PROBLEM .
RIGHT .
BUT WHEN THEY GET THEM IN THESE TINY LITTLE AREAS YOU KNOW AND THEY VE GOT A REAL BIG PROBLEM AND THEY THEY SAID THAT THAT WHAT .
THEY WERE DOING WAS SCRAPING IT WITH BULLDOZERS AND STUFF AND TAKING IT TO .
UHHUH .
UH THESE LIKE PONDS THAT THEY HAD TO FILTER IT WITH BUT THE PONDS BECAUSE THEY VE HAD SO MUCH RAIN IN THE PAST FEW YEARS THEY JUST .
YEAH .
OVERFLOW AND THEY OVERFLOW INTO THE THE CREEKS AND STUFF IN THE AREA .
SO THAT JUST CREATES YOU KNOW THERE THERE S AND OH IT WAS JUST DISGUSTING IT SAID THE CREEKS WILL FOAM .
OH .
PEOPLE PEOPLE STAND OUTSIDE THEIR HOUSES AND THEIR WATCH THE CREEKS FOAM BROWN AND ALL .
OH NOW THAT S BAD .
AND I M JUST LIKE OH MY GOSH AND THE SMELL IS REALLY BAD THEY .
SA .
OH I WAS GOING TO SAY THE AIR POLLUTION ALONE THERE JUST FROM A HUNDRED POUNDS OF COW MANURE WAS GOING TO BE BAD .
YEAH BUT I I DO NT KNOW IT REALLY FRIGHTENS ME THOUGH AS FAR AS THE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE YOU KNOW THINKING OF JUST AIR POLLUTION .
ITSELF AND THEN AND CHANNEL THIRTEEN .
THEY RE REALLY UM EMPHASIZING THE PROBLEM WITH ACID RAIN YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
IF WE IF WE KEEP PUTTING THAT STUFF INTO THE AIR AND AND YOU KNOW IF WE KEEP CREATING THE PROBLEM AND NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT THAT IT S REALLY GOING TO BE A PROBLEM FOR UM JUST THE THE EARTH YOU KNOW WHAT .
THE EARTH IS RECEIVING BACK YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
BECAUSE HOW CAN YOU TELL WHERE IT S GOING TO COME DOWN AT .
RIGHT RIGHT .
AND THEN CUTTING THE TREES YOU KNOW THAT BOTHERS ME .
YEAH .
AS FAR AS YOU KNOW THE .
THE RAIN FOREST AND ALL .
YES UH WE VE BEEN WANTING TO WELL NOT ME BUT UH IT S BEEN RECOMMEND OR SUGGESTED THAT WE CUT A FEW OF THE TREES DOWN HERE I M LIKE NO YOU KNOW MUMBLEX FOR WHAT S CUT DOWN HERE YOU KNOW MORE WILL BE CUT DOWN SOMEPLACE ELSE AND IT WILL JUST TAKE THAT LONGER TO GROW BACK .
YEAH .
AND TREES HELP SO THAT UH I DO NT .
WELL THEY DO BECAUSE WHAT IS IT CARBON DIOXIDE .
UHHUH .
THEY USE THAT WHERE WE CA NT SYNTHESIZE IT AND THEY RE SYNTHESIZING IT FOR US .
RIGHT RIGHT BELIEVE ME .
IT S JUST SO MUCH BETTER .
YEAH .
SO UH YEAH I KNEW I THINK THERE .
S LOTS THAT BE THAT COULD BE DONE TO TO IMPROVE HOW THINGS ARE DONE NOW .
YEAH I THINK WE JUST HAVE TO I DO NT KNOW PERSONALLY YOU KNOW I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW IF YOU JUST MAKE SURE YOUR CAR IS .
UHHUH .
IS WORKING PROPERLY AND YO YOU KNOW THEY RE SUPPOS NOWADAYS THEY HAVE THE EMISSION CONTROLS ON THEM BUT UH I THINK THE ONLY THE MAIN THING IS JUST KEEP ON THE LEGIS YOUR LEGISLATORS BACK YOU KNOW AS FAR AS SEEMS LIKE THEY VE ONLY JUST REALLY STARTED AS FAR AS THE ENVIRONMENT SAYING .
UHHUH .
OKAY WE RE REALLY GOING TO GET INVOLVED IT IT S REALLY BECOMING A PROBLEM .
BY THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND THERE WILL WHAT WHAT ARE WE GOING TO HAVE WHAT KIND OF RESULTS ARE WE GOING TO HAVE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT .
RIGHT .
AND AND WHAT WILL WE .
OKAY .
HI .
HI .
OKAY YOU WANT TO START .
UM YEAH SURE UM I THINK I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A BALANCED BUDGET EVEN IF IT MEANS THAT SERVICES ARE DRAMATICALLY CUT BACK IF YOU CA NT PAY FOR IT YOU SHOULD NT HAVE IT PERIOD AND .
THAT IS VERY TRUE .
THAT S JUST .
HOWEVER OUR WHOLE ECONOMY IS BASED ON LOANS .
UHHUH .
UH UH BUT BET RIGHT THIS MOMENT YOU PROBABLY HAVE SEVERAL LOANS OUT OR YOU HAVE BORROWED MONEY AGAINST YOUR CREDIT CARD OR SOMETHING .
WELL .
MASTER CHARGE .
I DO NT HAVE A MASTER CHARGE THANK YOU .
BUT SEE OUR WHOLE SYSTEM IS BUILT ON OWING .
RIGHT .
NOT BORROWING .
BUT THAT S THE PROBLEM SEE OUR SYSTEM SHOULD NT BE BASED ON OWING AND BORROWING AND ALL THAT .
UH TRUE BUT UH UH WITHOUT IT PEOPLE WOULD NT BE ABLE TO OWN AUTOMOBILES OR THEY WOULD NT BE ABLE TO OWN A HOUSE .
YES THEY WOULD THEY JUST WOULD NT BE ABLE TO OWN THE KIND OF AUTOMOBILES THAT THEY THINK THEY DESERVE TO OWN OR THE KIND OF HOMES THAT WE THINK WE DESERVE TO OWN WE MIGHT HAVE TO YOU KNOW JUST BE ABLE TO I THINK IF WE A GENERATION WENT WITHOUT DEBT THEN THE NEXT GENERATION LIKE IF IF OUR OUR GENERATION MY HUSBAND AND I WE RE TWENTYEIGHT IF WE LIVED OUR LIVES AND DID NT BECOME YOU KNOW INDEBTED LIKE YOU KNOW OUR GENERATION BEFORE US THAT UM THE BUDGET WOULD BALANCE AND THAT WE BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO LIVING WITH WHAT WE COULD AFFORD WHICH WE WOULD NT BE DESTITUTE I MEAN WE WOULD NT BE LIVING ON THE STREET BY ANY MEANS BUT JUST COMPARED TO HOW SPOILED WE ARE WE WOULD BE IN OUR OWN MINDS BUT I FEEL LIKE THE GENERATION AFTER US WOULD OH MAN IT WOULD BE SO GOOD IT WOULD BE SO MUCH BETTER IT WOULD NT BE PERFECT BUT THEN THEY COULD LEARN TO LIVE WITH WHAT THEY COULD AFFORD TO SAVE TO BUY AND IF YOU WANT A NICER CAR THAN THAT WELL YOU SAVE A LITTLE LONGER .
WELL NOW I AGREE UH .
UHHUH .
I AGREE WITH YOU ONE HUNDRED PERCENT I M JUST TAKING THE OTHER SIDE SO WE LL HAVE A DISCUSSION HERE .
UH BUT I STILL GO TO RIGHT BACK TO WHAT I SAID WHEN IS THE TIME YOU HAD FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ALL AT ONE TIME TO GO OUT AND BUY AN AUTOMOBILE .
BUT SEE WE MADE POOR CHOICES IN COLLEGE WE TOOK OUT TWO BOTH OF US HAD TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN LOANS FOR STUDENT LOANS .
UHHUH .
AND I LOOK BACK ON THAT AND I BOUGHT SHOES I WENT SHOPPING I DID NOT NEED THAT MONEY I DID NOT NEED IT I DID NT NEED IT I SHOULD NT HAVE EVEN QUALIFIED TO GET IT I DID NT NEED IT AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE ROUGH I MIGHT HAVE EATEN SOME BOLOGNA INSTEAD OF ROAST BEEF OUT OF THE DELI BUT I DID NOT NEED IT AND AS I LOOK BACK NOW NOW WE RE PAYING THAT BACK I TOLD MY SON IF YOU HAVE TO LIVE IN THE GHETTO TO GO TO COLLEGE DO IT BUT DO NT TAKE OUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN LOANS DO NT DO IT AND I DO NT I HOPE DO NT THINK HE LL HAVE TO DO THAT BUT I JUST FEEL LIKE IF WE DID NT HAVE THOSE LOANS WE COULD HAVE SAVED IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS THE MONEY FOR THAT AND I BELIEVE WE WOULD HAVE BECAUSE GOD S REALLY PUT IT IN OUR HEART NOT TO GET IN DEBT YOU KNOW BUT WE HAVE FRIENDS IN CHURCH THAT DO THIS ON A CONSTANT BASIS THAT ARE TOTALLY DEBT FREE AND THEY PAY CASH FOR EVERYTHING THEY BUY .
UHHUH .
INCLUDING NEW VANS AND SO SO I GUESS I VE SEEN IT DONE AND I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT YOU KNOW BUT YOU HAVE TO DRIVE THAT OLD CAR UNTIL YOU GET THAT MONEY SAVED UP FOR THAT NEW VAN AND THAT S WHERE AMERICANS DO NT LIKE TO DO IT AND SO AND WE DO NT WANT TO CUT BACK OUR SERVICES FROM THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE WE RE SPOILED .
WELL I HAVE ONE WAY TO SUGGEST REDUCING THE BUDGET .
WHAT .
VERY SIMPLE JUST TAKE ALL THESE CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES .
AND UH UH TAKE SOME OF THOSE HOLIDAYS AWAY FROM THEM LIKE COLUMBUS DAY PRESIDENT S DAY .
I KNOW .
I MEAN THEY THEY GET ALL THESE DAYS OFF .
YEAH .
NOW GIVE THEM .
I KNOW .
WHAT A A WEEK I THINK WE HERE AT T I GET A TOTAL OF ELEVEN A YEAR .
UHHUH .
AND THAT S ABOUT UH THREE OR FOUR LESS THAN CIVIL SERVANTS GET .
UHHUH .
NOW JUST LOOK AT THAT MONEY THE GOVERNMENT COULD SAVE IF THEY DID NT HAVE ALL OF THOSE DAYS OFF ALL THOSE HOLIDAYS .
YEAH THAT IS TRUE BECAUSE I ALWAYS THINK THE MAIL NEVER COMES ON THESE DAYS AND YOU RE LIKE WELL WHAT IS IT YOU DO NT EVEN KNOW IT S A HOLIDAY .
WELL NOW DO NT FORGET THE MAIL IS SOMETHING ELSE AGAIN THAT HAS NOTHING THEY RE NOT CIVIL SERVANT PEOPLE .
BUT IS NT IT FEDERAL IN THE FEDERAL BUDGET .
NO NO THEY HAVE THEIR OWN BUDGET THEY GO BY .
BUT IS NT IT PART OF OUR INCOME IT S NOT PART OF OUR TAXES .
NO .
IT S NOT .
THAT S WHY THE PRICE OF MAILING A LETTER KEEPS GOING UP .
THAT S WHY IT KEEPS GOING UP UH .
YOU KNOW I COULD .
THAT S ANOTHER TOPIC .
I CAN REMEMBER THE DAYS WHEN IT COST ONLY THREE CENTS TO MAIL UH UH UH A LETTER .
THOSE STAMPS ARE VALUABLE NOW .
YEAH .
THEY PROBABLY HEY I OUGHT TO GO LOOKING THROUGH SOME OF MY OLD MAIL .
THAT S FUNNY YEAH AND THAT IS A GOOD SHORT TERM THING THOUGH THAT LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT THAT OVERALL THOUGH I JUST THINK WE RE JUST GOING TO I DO NT KNOW SEE I KNOW I GUESS I M KIND OF LEERY OF THIS TOPIC BECAUSE I KNOW THAT BUSH IS REAL FOR THE NEW WORLD ORDER THE ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT AND ALLEVIATING ALL YOU KNOW NATIONAL DEBT BETWEEN ALL OF THE NATIONS BUT I SEE THAT TO BE A POTENTIAL POWER PROBLEM LATER WITH UM WHO S GOING TO BE IN CHARGE WITH THIS NEW WORLD ORDER AND I YOU KNOW I M UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THAT MUCH POWER BEING IN ONE PLACE BUT I KNOW WE ALREADY HAVE A NEW MONEY SYSTEM WE ALREADY HAVE NEW BILLS PRINTED FOR THE U S TREASURY ALREADY HAS OUR NEW BILLS PRINTED FOR NEW CURRENCY AND I VE SEEN THEM AND SO I KNOW THAT THE LONGTERM VISION FOR THE U S GOVERNMENT IS TO ALLEVIATE ALL NATIONAL DEBTS AND TO START OVER AFRESH BUT I M CONCERNED WITH WHOSE GOING TO HAVE THE POWER OVER THIS NEW WORLD ORDER THAT THEY KEEP TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW THAT S A LOT OF POWER FOR ONE OR TWO PEOPLE TO HAVE AND SO UM I GUESS BECAUSE I I GUESS IN FACT I KNOW WHAT THEIR LONGTERM VISION IS I M KIND OF LIKE YOU KNOW YEAH THE ONLY ANSWER IS TO START OVER OR TO TOTALLY CHANGE OUR LIFESTYLES AND I DO NT THINK AMERICANS ARE WILLING TO DO IT .
WELL WHAT ABOUT UH UH SENDING ALL THIS MONEY OVERSEAS SUPPORTING OTHER GOVERNMENTS THIRD WORLD GOVERNMENTS HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT .
I DO NT I DO NT FEEL WE SHOULD LOAN THEM MONEY IF I I WISH OUR LEADERS WERE REALLY SEEKING THE LORD ON THESE THINGS AND IF WE FEEL LED TO GIVE A COUNTRY MONEY TO HELP THEM FINE BUT I DO NT FEEL WE SHOULD BE LOANING MONEY LIKE THAT I MEAN IT DOES NT WORK I MEAN .
WELL IN SO MANY CASES IT S NOT A LOAN IT S JUST A GIVE AWAY .

WELL WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE AT A DINNER PARTY .
WELL UH LATELY SINCE I HAVE CHILDREN I VE CUT DOWN ON HAVING DINNER PARTIES .
UHHUH .
BUT WHEN I DO I TRY TO KEEP IT PRETTY SIMPLE ON THINGS THAT I CAN PREPARE AHEAD OF TIME UH I HAVE ONE RECIPE FOR UH A REALLY GOOD UM TYPE OF A MEATBALL .
IT S CALLED BURGUNDY MEATBALL AND IT S MADE WITH RED WINE AND .
OH GOSH .
UM .
THAT SOUNDS GREAT .
IT S IT S REALLY GOOD AND YOU CAN MAKE IT AHEAD OF TIME AND THEN UM MAKE THE SAUCE WHEN YOU RE READY TO UM TO SERVE IT .
UHHUH .
THAT S ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS TO TO SERVE .
WELL UM I THINK IT WOULD PROBABLY DEPEND ON WHETHER THIS WAS A FORMAL OR A INFORMAL DINNER PARTY .
SURE .
BUT IF IT WAS INFORMAL MY FIRST CHOICE WOULD BE CRAWFISH .
OH REALLY .
WELL I GUESS BEING FROM THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY .
BECAUSE I MEAN CRAWFISH EVERYBODY OVER HERE LIKES CRAWFISH BUT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW I I WOULD NT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT SATISFYING MY GUEST .
BUT IF IT WAS A FORMAL DINNER PARTY .
I WOULD PROBABLY THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE LIKE UH SHRIMP SHRIMP FETTUCINI IS REAL EASY .
YEAH .
TO UM MAKE AND EVERYTHING AND IT S USUALLY WELL LIKED BY PEOPLE I GUESS I M JUST A SEAFOOD FAN SO .
WELL HOW DO .
I THINK ON THE LINES OF .
MAKE HOW DO YOU YOU COOK CRAWFISH .
I IN FACT I JUST CAME BACK FROM THE GROCERY STORE AND BEING IN TEXAS WE DO NT HAVE TOO MANY YOU KNOW PEOPLE .
THAT THAT EAT CRAWFISH BUT THEY HAD LIVE CRAWFISH .
OH YEAH .
ON SALE .
UM YOU RE NOT SUPPOSED TO I MEAN YOU RE NOT SUPPOSED TO EAT THEM DEAD .
I MEAN .
UHHUH .
WELL YOU EAT THEM DEAD BUT .
DO NT BUY THEM .
THAT WAY .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE IF IF THEY ARE DEAD FOR TOO LONG YOU CAN ALWAYS TELL WHENEVER THEY RE COOKED IF THEY VE BEEN DEAD FOR A LONG TIME BECAUSE THEIR TAIL STRAIGHTENS OUT .
UHHUH .
AND YOU RE NOT SUPPOSED TO EAT THOSE BECAUSE THEY RE BAD FOR YOU .
OKAY .
WELL I LL REMEMBER THAT .
YEAH SO IF YOU EVER GO IN A RESTAURANT ORDER CRAWFISH I MEAN EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE .
YOU LL SEE ON I MEAN IT DOES NT HAPPEN VERY OFTEN BECAUSE IT S JUST AN ACCIDENT BUT IF THE TAIL IS STRAIGHT ON IT THEN YEAH .
UHHUH .
DO NT EAT IT .
BUT UM YOU JUST PUT SOME CAJUN WELL LOTS OF PEPPER .
UHHUH .
AND YOU JUST BOIL THEM AND THEY RE ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL BUT THERE S UH THEY RE A PAIN TO PEEL FOR SOME PEOPLE .
ONCE YOU GET USED TO IT .
THEY RE REAL EASY BUT UM YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE NAILS OR ANYTHING .
YOU CAN PLAN ON THOSE .
BEING SHOT .
HUH .
WHEN YOU WERE UM WHE WHEN YOU SERVE IT DO YOU SHELL THEM AND THEN SERVE EM TOO .
I THINK FOR A DINNER PARTY .
I I DO NT KNOW IT DEPENDS .
UMHUM .
LIKE IF LIKE MY AGE IF THERE WAS A BUNCH OF COLLEGE KIDS COMING OVER FOR A DINNER PARTY NO I THEY WOULD SHELL THEIR OWN .
SURE .
YOU KNOW WE D JUST HAVE CRAWFISH AND BEER OR SOMETHING BUT UM IF IT WAS MORE FORMAL LIKE IF I WAS YOU KNOW WORKING ENVIRONMENT THEN I WOULD PROBABLY UM SH SHELL EM OR AT LEAST DISCONNECT THEM FROM THE HEAD .
BUT THERE S A .
STILL HAVE SEE THAT .
THERE S A BIG THING OVER HERE THAT EVERYBODY SUCKS THE HEAD .
SO UM .
OOH .
IT IT WOULD JUST .
DEPEND .
THAT S THE BEST PART OF THE CRAWFISH .
SUCKING THE HEAD BUT UM I DO NT KNOW IT .
JUS I .
IT JUST DEPENDS ON WHAT TYPE .
IT WAS I GUESS BUT YOU CAN BUY UH THE CRAWFISH SHELLS ALREADY PEELED N EVERYTHING AND USUALLY YOU USE THOSE LIKE FOR FRYING .
UMHUM .
OR TO PUT IN SALADS OR TO UM .
YOU KNOW MAKE A SAUCE WITH OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND BUY EM COOKED AND SHELLED AND THEY RE MORE EXPENSIVE OF COURSE BUT .
DOES IT TASTE A LOT LIKE SHRIMP .
UM YEAH .
IT REALLY DOES .
UHHUH .
I LIKE SHRIMP BETTER .
YEAH .
JUST UM THE CRAWFISH .
I MEAN IT JUST HAS A TASTE OF ITS OWN .
IT ALSO DEPENDS ON WHO S COOKING IT AND HOW MUCH SEASONING .
THEY USE .

MY GRANDMA SPEAKING .

OF THOSE MEATBALLS AGAIN SHE OWNED EVERY CHRISTMAS AND AND EASTER WHENEVER WE HAVE AT THE BIG GETTOGETHER OVER AT HER HOUSE .
SHE MAKES THIS MEAT BALL SAUCE AND IT HAS I DO NT KNOW THEY ARE JUST KIND OF LIKE QUARTER SIZE MEATBALLS AND .
UHHUH .

UMHUM .
WATER BURGUNDY WINE AND UM CORNSTARCH INSTEAD OF FLOUR .
OH .
SO IT S NOT A .
IT S NOT A THICK RICH TYPE OF A SAUCE .
IT S MORE OF A WHEN YOU USE CORN STARCH IN IN GRAVY LIKE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE UM CHINESE FOOD .
UMHUM .
THAT KIND OF A GRAVY OR A SAUCE .
THAT COMES WITH A LOT OF THAT THEY USE CORN STARCH INSTEAD OF FLOUR IN ALL OF THEIR SAUCES AND GRAVIES AND IT GIVES IT .
A BIT OF A DIFFERENT CONSISTENCY .
WELL UM HOW LONG DO YOU COOK THE MEATBALLS .
THE MEATBALLS YOU JUST UM AFTER YOU FORM THEM FRY THEM IN A PAN UNTIL .
UH HUH .
THEY RE UH BROWNED ON ALL .
ALL SIDES AND THEN DRAIN OFF ALL THE GREASE UH THEN WHAT .
I USUALLY DO IS I FREEZE THEM AND THEN WHEN .
YOU RE READY .

TO SERVE .

THEM THEN YOU COOK THE SAUCE AND THEN PUT THE MEATBALLS INTO THE SAUCE AND HEAT IT PROBABLY YOU HAVE TO HEAT IT UP FOR A GOOD OH IF THEY RE FROZEN YOU KNOW IT MAY TAKE A HALF FOR THEM TO THAW OUT BUT THEN HEAT THEM THOROUGHLY IN THE SAUCE .
ITSELF LET THEM SIMMER IN THE SAUCE .
ITSELF .
HUM .
AND IT S REAL GOOD .
THAT SOUNDS GREAT ESPECIALLY I MEAN THE FACT THAT YOU CAN PREPARE THE MEATBALLS SO SO FAR IN ADVANCE .
RIGHT .
I MEAN LIKE IF IF .
AND THEN FREEZE THEM .

SHE WAS USED TO RUNNING YOU KNOW FLAT TRACKS AND WHATNOT AND UH EVER SINCE THAT IT S JUST BEEN REAL DIFFICULT .

EVEN IF SHE DOES GET ON FLAT GROUND SO SHE S KIND OF IN THE SAME MODE .
SHE WAS ALL READY TO GET BACK INTO IT AND START RUNNING UH FIVE K S AND TEN K S AND STUFF THIS SPRING AND SHE JUST HAS NT BEEN ABLE TO STICK WITH THE TRAINING SCHEDULE LONG ENOUGH TO REALLY GET BACK IN SHAPE .
AND WHEN YOU WANT TO DO IT IT S REALLY REALLY AGGRAVATING .
YOU KNOW IT IT S ONE THING TO GET MOTIVATED TO START DOING THE EXERCISE AND IT S ANOTHER THING TO TO ALREADY BE PAST THAT AND THEN NOT BE ABLE TO BECAUSE OF YOUR HEALTH .
I CAN YOU UNDERSTAND THAT .
YEAH .
UH I DO NT REALLY WANT TO I JUST KNOW I NEED TO .

RIGHT .
YEAH .

THAT S FOR SURE .
LET ME ASK YOU .
A QUESTION OFF THE SUBJECT THOUGH .
OKAY .
YOU RE IN YOU RE LIVING IN THE CASTLE PARK AREA .
THAT S RIGHT .
I GREW UP IN OAK CLIFF .
DID YOU REALLY .
YES I DID .
UH JUST CLOSE TO METHODIST HOSPITAL .
OKAY YEAH .
ON CANDY C .
A N D Y .
RIGHT .
OH IN FACT I LIVED THERE OH UNTIL NINETEEN LATE NINETEEN FIFTIES .
OKAY OKAY .
AND THAT AREA IS IT CHANGING BACK AGAIN .
SO MANY PEOPLE ARE MOVING BACK INTO THOSE OLD HOUSES AND ARE RESTORING THEM .
YEAH IT IS .
UH WE RE ON WE RE ON A LITTLE STREET CALLED BISON TRAIL .
IT S ONLY ABOUT A BLOCK AND A HALF LONG BUT IT S IT S OVER ON THE OTHER END .
IT IT S OVER BY THE FAR EDGE OF UH STEPHEN S PARK GOLF COURSE .
OH I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THAT IS .
YEAH IT S IT S UH YOU KNOW WHERE THE LITTLE BRIDGE IS ON NORTH OAK CLIFF BOULEVARD .
YEAH SURE .
YEAH WE ARE JUST SOUTH OF THAT LITTLE BRIDGE BACKUP ON THE HILL IN THE TREES THERE AND YEAH UH OUR STREET IS UH AN AWFUL LOT OF RETIRED PEOPLE BUT THE OTHER HALF IN FACT OUR ONE LITTLE BLOCK AND A HALF THERE FOUR HOUSES SOLD LAST SUMMER AND THREE SOLD THE SUMMER BEFORE AND EVERYBODY IN THEIR LATE TWENTIES TO MIDTHIRTIES ARE BUYING AND AND STARTING TO REBUILD AND FIX THINGS UP AGAIN AND EVERYBODY IS REAL EXCITED .
OH THAT S THAT S WONDERFUL .
YEAH .
THAT IS A GORGEOUS GORGEOUS PLACE .
OH IT S IT S A LOT OF FUN THE PEOPLE ARE GREAT .
THERE TOO WE VE GOT A REAL ACTIVE NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION .
AND UH WE HAVE WELL WE VE GOT FOUR REGULAR PARTIES .
EVERY YEAR AND WE DO A NEIGHBORHOOD RECYCLING PROGRAM AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF .
SO IT S A LOT OF FUN AND IT IS IT S A REALLY BEAUTIFUL AREA .
AND SOME SOME OF THE PEOPLE UH SOME OF THE HIGHER DOLLARS LAWYERS AND STUFF DOWNTOWN TOO ARE PICKING UP SOME OF THOSE GREAT BIG HOUSES AND THEY RE THEY RE GETTING THEM AT A REAL BARGAIN .
WELL SURE THEY ARE .
YOU KNOW .
THEY RE THEY RE GETTING FOUR THOUSAND SQUARE FEET FOR A HUNDRED FIFTY A HUNDRED AND SEVENTYFIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS .
HM .
AND UH AND THEY RE JUST GOING TO TOWN WITH THEM .
THEY RE PEOPLE ARE PUTTING IN POOLS AND AND COMPLETELY REDOING THE OUTSIDE RESTORING TO THE ORIGINAL YOU KNOW NINETEEN THIRTY NINETEEN FORTIES LOOK .
OH WOW .
AND IT IT S IT S REALLY COMING AROUND .
I GUESS .
I NEED TO GO OVER THERE AND JUST DRIVE AROUND AND LOOK .
IT S IT S WORTH THE TRIP .
OH I M SURE IT MUST BE .
I M JUST WE HAD A LOVELY LITTLE HOUSE OVER THERE IT WAS LIKE A TWO STORY .
UHHUH .
WELL STORY AND A HALF REALLY BECAUSE WE HAD A BASEMENT .
OKAY .
AND THE GUY .
THAT BUILT IT WAS WEIRD I MEAN WEIRD .
YEAH .
IT .
S .
ONE OF THESE REALLY CREATIVE HOUSES .
OKAY .
THAT I GREW UP IN THAT .
NOTHING WAS ON THE SAME LEVEL WITH ANYTHING ELSE .
OH WOW .
AND I JUST LOVED THE NEIGHBORHOOD .
YEAH .
AND I MEAN EVERYONE EVERYONE HAD HOUSES LIKE THAT .
THEY WERE ALL COMPLETELY DIFFERENT .
UHHUH THAT S RIGHT .
AND SO NEAT .
YEAH OURS IS KIND OF A LITTLE RANCH STYLE WITH A GREAT BIG OH I GUESS IT S TWENTYEIGHT BY FIFTEEN FRONT PORCH .
OH .
NEXT DOOR WE VE GOT AN AUSTIN STONE .
ACROSS THE STREET THE GUY IT WAS BURNT OUT ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO AND AND THE GUY MOVED IN AND COMPLETELY REDID .
IT .
S GOT OH IT S GOT A ROUNDED FRONT ON IT .
IT .
S ALL BRICK AND HE S HE S LANDSCAPED HIS YARD AND HE S ABOUT READY TO PUT IN A POOL AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
SO YEAH THERE S A VARIETY YOU JUST DO NT SEE IT ANYWHERE ELSE AS FAR AS THE DIFFERENT STYLES IN THE HOUSES AND WHATNOT .
NOW WHY COULD NT YOUR WIFE RUN AROUND THE GOLF COURSE .
IS THAT NOT GOOD .
OH SHE COULD A LITTLE BIT .
WE I TELL YOU .
WHAT WE GOT INTO THE FITNESS CENTER AT METHODIST AND THEY HAVE A QUARTER MILE TRACK THERE .
SO SHE HAS STARTED DOING THAT RATHER THAN UH RATHER THAN TAKE OFF .
THE PROBLEM IS SHE S A SCHOOL TEACHER AND FOR HER SHE CA NT RUN IN THE MORNING .
FOR HER TO GET HOME AND TRY TO RUN AT SIX OCLOCK IN THE NIGHT IN THE WINTER TIME IT S STARTING TO GET DARK AND YOU KNOW YOU DO NT WANT TO SHE DOES NT WANT TO BE OUT BY HERSELF ANYWHERE IN DALLAS .
REGARDLESS WHETHER IT S NORTH DALLAS OR WHATNOT WHEN SHE GOES OVER TO THIS FITNESS CENTER IT S FENCED IN AND THERE S SOMEBODY IN THE BUILDING WATCHING HER AND ALL THAT SO THERE S A LOT OF CONSIDERATION .
YES I I REALLY HEAR THAT YOU KNOW I THINK YOU KNOW YOU RE IN OAK CLIFF .
UHHUH .
BUT I M IN PLANO .
IN WEST PLANO .
YEAH .
AND WE LIVE ON ONE OF THOSE BLOCKS THAT IT S A NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH BLOCK .
UHHUH .
WE .
ALL KNOW EACH OTHER AND THE STREET DOES NT GO ANYWHERE .
RIGHT .
IF YOU ARE ON THE STREET YOU BETTER BELONG THERE .
THAT S RIGHT .
BECAUSE IT S NOT A THROUGH STREET .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND STILL I WANT TO GET UP EARLY IN THE MORNING AND WALK .
UHHUH .
BEFORE THIS KNEE BUSINESS .

WHEN I WAS OUT WALKING IT WAS MORE OF A PREDAWN TYPE PRETTY BUT HUHHUH HE DID NT THINK IT LOOKED PREDAWN TO HIM .
YEAH .
IT LOOKED DARK .
YEAH .
AND EVEN HE WAS REAL CONCERNED ABOUT THAT .
SO IT S NOT JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE IN OAK CLIFF IT S JUST BECAUSE YOU RE SMART .
THAT S TRUE .
THAT YOU DO NT DO THINGS LIKE THAT .
IT ONLY TAKES ONE TIME .
THAT S RIGHT .
IT S A HARD LESSON TO LEARN .
THERE S ONLY ONE CRAZY OUT THERE YOU KNOW TO MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE .

ALL RIGHT .
UH .
THE SAVINGS AND LOAN SCANDAL .
IT I GOT TO UH THIS IS GOING TO BE FUN ARE YOU REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT .
UH KIND OF NEITHER .
OKAY WELL I M A I M A DEMOCRAT SO I WAS GOING TO SAY IF YOU RE A REPUBLICAN BOY WE WOULD REALLY HAVE A GOOD TIME .
I DO HAVE SOME REPUBLICAN LEANINGS BECAUSE .
I AM DIVISION ONE YOU KNOW .
WELL I UH TO ANSWER THAT ONE BEFORE WE GET TO OUR SUBJECT YOU KNOW I ALWAYS GET A KICK OUT OF REPUBLICANS WHO TAKE CREDIT FOR ALL THE MILITARY HARDWARE THAT WAS BOUGHT FOR THE WAR AND HOW SUCCESSFUL IT WAS THOUGH WHEN IT COMES TO THE BUDGET THEY SAY WELL THE DEMOCRATS CONTROL ALL THE MONEY AND THEY RE THE ONES WASTING ALL THE MONEY .
AND I ALWAYS WONDERED HOW THEY CAN PLAY THE MONEY EITHER WAY THEY WANT YOU KNOW I GET A KICK OUT OF THAT BUT ANYWAY THE SUBJECT GO AHEAD YOU FIRST .
UH I THINK IT S A STINKING SHAME THAT THERE IS NT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT FOR THOSE ASSHOLES THAT STOLD OUR MONEY .
YEAH I UH I DO NT THINK IT S OVER I THINK THAT UH SO MANY OTHER THINGS HAVE TAKEN OVER UH IN THE MEDIA BUT I THINK IT WAS JUST PLAIN GREED AND I THINK IT WAS DEREGULATION REALLY WHEN THEY SAID DO ANYTHING YOU WANT BANKS GO AHEAD LOAN YOUR MONEY OUT YOU KNOW .
I AGREE WITH YOU I THINK IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH DEREGULATION BUT I BELIEVE UH MORE OF IT WAS JUST GREED .
YEAH I WAS TALKING TO SOMEONE I CA NT REMEMBER WHO IT WAS BUT HE WAS A SMALL BUSINESSMAN AND HE SAID THAT THE BANKS WERE CALLING HE BORROWED SOME MONEY AND THE BANKS WERE CALLING AND JUST LOOKING FOR PEOPLE TO GIVE THEIR MONEY AWAY THEY JUST GOT TOTALLY CARRIED AWAY WITH BUYING PROPERTY AND RESELLING THE SAME PROPERTY AND UH YEAH THERE THERE SHOULD BE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN JAIL AS FAR AS I M CONCERNED .
WELL .
NOT JUST A COUPLE .
YOU KNOW WE VE WATCHED AND WATCHED T V AND SEEN THAT A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE WERE DOING THINGS NOT JUST PLAYING IN THE GRAY AND NOT JUST RESELLING PROPERTY AT A PROFIT BUT FINANCING THE SAME PROPERTY THREE AND FOUR TIMES .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW AND THE LIST GOES ON AND ON .
WELL I I AGREE A HUNDRED PERCENT .
YOU KNOW OF OF JUST THE CRIMES COMMITTED .
OH YEAH .
MUCH LESS FOR CRIMINALS THAT SHOULD BE INDICTED .
IT MAY HAVE STARTED WITH HUD TOO I NOTICED THAT HUD WAS IN TERRIBLE SHAPE AND THAT WAS PROPERTY AND UH THEY LOST A LOT OF MONEY THERE AND THEN SOME OF THESE BIG THESE RICH PEOPLE STARTED TO EVEN MURCHISON HERE WHO OWNED THE COWBOYS HAD A LOT OF PROPERTY DOWN IN FLORIDA THIS WAS SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND HE LOST YOU KNOW ALL ALL OF HIS MONEY BEFORE HE DIED .
YEAH .
NOT ALL OF IT I DO NT KNOW HOW MUCH HE LOST BUT UH THEY WERE JUST BUYING PROPERTY AND BUYING ALL KINDS OF REAL ESTATE AND THINKING THAT THERE WAS A BOTTOMLESS PIT AND IT ALWAYS WOULD IT ALWAYS WOULD INCREASE YOU KNOW IT ALWAYS WOULD UH UH BE MORE THAN WHAT YOU PAID FOR IT AND THEY JUST NEVER EVEN GOT CONSERVATIVE WITH OUR MONEY AT ALL .
YEAH IT EVERYONE FORGETS WHOSE MONEY IT WAS .
RIGHT .
AND EVERYONE FORGETS THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL OF THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE WANTED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CURRENTLY AND ARE OVERSEAS WHERE EXTRADITION IS MERELY A FUNNY AMERICAN WORD .
YEAH .
I AS FAR AS BEING A REPUBLICAN OR A DEMOCRAT I THINK NO AMERICAN COULD STAND FOR CRIMINAL ACTION .
WELL NOW THE REASON THAT I SAID THAT IS BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO BLAME ALL UH REAGANOMICS FOR YOU KNOW YOU SPEND YOUR WAY TO PROSPERITY AND WHEN YOU OPENED UP THE BANK DEREGULATION WITHOUT ANY CONTROLS I THOUGHT WELL THAT WAS THE PHILOSOPHY YOU KNOW JUST KEEP SPENDING UNTIL TAXES ARE LOWER AND I THOUGHT THAT S NOT GOING TO WORK YOU KNOW AND I KNEW THAT IT WAS NT GOING TO WORK ORIGINALLY .
WELL .
AND IT HAS NT WORKED NOW .
IN THEORY IN THEORY A HEALTHY ECONOMY HAS A LOT OF SPENDING GOING ON .
RIGHT NO DOUBT NO DOUBT .
AND IF PEOPLE ARE MAKING MONEY PEOPLE CAN SPEND MONEY .
AND IT LL GENERATE TAXES .
OH YEAH I I I AGREE WITH THAT BUT THERE S GOT TO BE SOME CONTROL AND APPARENTLY THERE WAS YOU KNOW .
WELL THE PROBLEM IS AND THE PROBLEM WITH REAGANOMICS IS THAT THE PEOPLE AT THE TOP ARE THE ONES GETTING RICH .
YEAH .
AND FOR WHAT THEY WOULD COST AND WE WERE NT PRODUCING ANYTHING .
YEAH .
WE AS AMERICANS WERE NT PRODUCING ANYTHING IT WAS ALL INFLATION .
YEAH .
AND I M SORRY WE DO NT GET INTO A REAL ARGUMENT OVER IT WE AGREE TOO CLOSELY BUT .
YEAH I KNOW UH .
BUT YOU YOU CA NT SAY THAT THAT WAS RIGHT .
OH NO I .
NO INTELLIGENT PERSON CAN SAY THAT WE COULD SPEND OUR WAY RICH .
RIGHT .
REMEMBER ALL WE RE DOING IS DELIVERING PIZZAS TO EACH OTHER .
AND AND NOT HIGH QUALITY ONES AT THAT YOU KNOW .
YEAH WELL .
WELL I DO HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IN THE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE ECONOMY AND EVERYTHING ELSE I I FEEL BAD WHEN I SEE THE INEFFICIENCY EVEN HERE AT T I YOU KNOW AND I THINK THAT THE IT IT STILL A LOT OF THE WORKERS DO NT UNDERSTAND THAT UH THEY NEED TO PUT OUT THE BEST THAT THEY CAN BECAUSE IT COMES RIGHT BACK TO THEM YOU KNOW .
IT IS A LIFE AND DEATH STRUGGLE .
RIGHT .
WITH JAP WITH THE JAPANESE .
I KNOW AND I WHEN I OF COURSE I M IN FACILITIES AND I WORK WITH A LOT OF MECHANICS AND I JUST CAN NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THEY RE JUST HAPPY TO SPEND THEIR TIME HERE RATHER THAN PRODUCE YOU KNOW AND THEY THINK THAT WELL I M PAID ANYWAY SO IT DOES NT MATTER YOU KNOW .
I I M VERY TIRED OF IT ALL PAYS BY THE HOUR .
RIGHT RIGHT .
UH AND I M NONEXEMPT .
YEAH OH REALLY YOU DO NT SOUND LIKE A NONEXEMPT JIM .

WELL I NOW MAYBE I M NOT THE UH TYPICAL NONEXEMPT THAT YOU DEAL WITH THE BADGE IS SILVER .
YEAH .
AND UH I AM DEGREED THOUGH NONEXEMPT .
UH WELL THAT S GOOD .
NO THAT S NOT GOOD BUT .
NO RIGHT I MEAN THAT S GOOD THAT YOU RE DEGREED .
UH UH YOUR TIME WILL COME WE UH I KNOW A FEW PEOPLE .
NO I I DO NOT WISH MY TIME TO COME .
OH REALLY WHAT ARE YOU IN A TECH LIKE DO YOU DO TECHNICIAN WORK OR SOMETHING .
OH NO NO NO I GOVERNMENT TOOL CONTROL IS MY SPECIALTY NOW I DID P C PROTECTION CONTROL WORK FOR UH .
OH QUALITY OKAY .
ABOUT TEN OR TWELVE YEARS UH RIGHT NOW I M JUST TRYING TO TOOL CRIB AND MUMBLEX CHIPS .

UH BEING BASICALLY AN ENGINEER AND LIKING UH DOING INSTALLATION WORK WELL THERE S NOT ANY I MEAN THERE IS LITERALLY IS NO INSTALLATION WORK GOING ON .
THEY TURNED ALL INSTALLATION UP HERE OFF .
YEAH .
THEY TOLD FACILITIES THEY COULD NOT WORK .
YEAH .
I DO NT CARE WHAT THE JOBS ARE YOU WILL NOT WORK .
YEAH IT IT .
AND AND AS FAR AS OUR YOU KNOW OUR CONVERSATION GOES I WOULD REALLY BE INTERESTED TO KNOW HOW MUCH OF T I S PROBLEMS NOW ARE RELATED TO .
BANKING .
THE BANKING STRUCTURE .
I THINK THAT NOT NOT ONLY T I BUT A LOT OF IT WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT UH THERE WAS ONE POINT I WAS GOING TO MAKE I THINK THE LAST I HEARD AND I I HAVE TO ADMIT I M NOT AS INFORMED AS THEM BUT THERE S SOMETHING LIKE ABOUT EIGHTY SIX BILLION THAT THEY ADMIT WELL I ALWAYS DOUBLE THAT I FIGURE WELL IF THEY CLAIM THAT IT S GOING TO COST US EIGHTYSIX BILLION IT S GOT TO BE TWICE AS MUCH BECAUSE NO ONE ADMITS THEIR MISTAKES AND SO IF THAT S TRUE IT MAY MEAN THAT TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR CATEGORY THAT WAS THAT WENT DOWN THE TUBE SOMEWHERE .
UH IT REALLY HURTS ME .
YEAH IT S AMAZING REALLY IT S AMAZING THAT .
TO REALIZE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE ARE TRYING TO RETIRE ON THEIR HOME VALUES .
OH YEAH I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN .
UH ONE OF OUR SENIOR .
COURSE YOUR VALUE OF HOMES UP THERE ARE PRETTY GOOD I MEAN HERE THEY RE NOT REALLY THAT HIGH BUT ARE THEY PRETTY GOOD UP THERE .
NO .
OH REALLY .
OUR ECONOMY IN COLORADO SPRINGS FELL COMPLETELY APART .
WELL WE RE IN THE METROPLEX HERE YOU KNOW AND UH .
RIGHT .
IT IT I DIE EVERY TIME COMPANIES LIKE GENERAL DYNAMICS THEY THEY LOST SEVERAL CONTRACTS AND AND I DO NT KNOW IF YOU NOTICED YESTERDAY YOU PROBABLY DO NT PAY ATTENTION TO THE BELL HELICOPTER YOU KNOW THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE BIG UH AWARD AND SECORSKI GOT IT WHICH WAS BOEING SECORSKI THIS WHICH IS UP IN THE NORTH SOMEWHERE YOU KNOW .
YEAH IT S NORTHWEST .
AND I DO NT KNOW HOW .
SEATTLE .
BELL DID NT GET IT .
SEATTLE AND ALSO UH THEY DO SOME OF THAT IN WICHITA KANSAS .
WELL I I DO NT THEY WERE ADVERTISING HERE THAT IT WAS BELL T I T I WAS GETTING THE UH ELECTRONICS WITH BELL AND SO IT WAS A DOUBLE ONE THAT BELL IS IN THE METROPLEX AND TWO THAT T I WAS DOING THE ELECTRONICS FOR THEM .
HUH .
AND THEY THEY ADVERTISED THAT THAT IT WAS T I BELL T I BELL AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN SECORSKI GOT IT YEAH .
SECORSKI BOEING .
SECORSKI BOEING BOEING DOES NT NEED THE MONEY SOMETHING I ALMOST THINK THERE S SOME POLITICS AROUND HERE BECAUSE THE METROPLEX HERE IN THE DALLAS FORT WORTH AREA THE UH WITH T I I DO NT KNOW IF T I HAS LOST AS MUCH AS EVERYBODY ELSE BUT GENERAL DYNAMICS AND L T V AND BELL HAVE LOST PROJECT AFTER PROJECT YOU KNOW .
WELL YOU REALIZE .
OKAY UH I REALLY HAVE NT THOUGHT ABOUT THE TOPIC OF DRUG TESTING BUT UH JUST OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I I DO NT THINK I SEE MUCH WRONG WITH IT UM IF I OWNED A COMPANY AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS RUN SMOOTHLY AND THAT THE PEOPLE THAT I HAD UH COMING IN UH WERE TRUST WORTHY ET CETERA AND SO ON I THINK I WOULD I WOULD UH PROBABLY DO THE RANDOM TESTING JUST TO INSURE THAT MY COMPANY UH RUNS SAFELY AND SMOOTHLY .
YEAH UM I I ALSO HAVE NT THOUGHT TOO MUCH ABOUT IT UH BUT I SUSPECT IT IT VERY MUCH DEPENDS UPON THE JOB .
HUHUH .
MAYBE THERE ARE SOME JOBS WHERE I GUESS IT DOES NT REALLY .
YEAH .
AND IT S IT S IT S IF IT S NOT AFFECTING SOMEONE S PERFORMANCE THEN I M NOT SURE IF IT S A PROBLEM .
YEAH .
IF IF IT S A POSITION WHERE IT COULD POTENTIALLY AFFECT .
THAT S TRUE I DID NT THINK ABOUT THAT LIKE FOR INSTANCE .
MUMBLEX IF IF IF .
UH IF SOMEONE S WORKING ON HEAVY MACHINERY .
RIGHT .
OR SAY DRIVING TRUCKS OR BUSES CITY BUSES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THEN THAT IS SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS THE THAT AFFECTS THE COMMUNITY YOU KNOW IF YOU RE YOU RE DRINKING OR ON DRUGS OR WHATEVER YOU RE DRIVING A CITY BUS YOU TAKING SEVERAL LIVES IN YOUR HANDS .
RIGHT AND THEN IF YOU RE A COMPUTER OPERATOR AND UH THERE S REALLY NO BIG DEAL I THINK YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
THAT MAYBE IT S NOT NECESSARY .
AND FOR ME I THINK THAT DRUG TESTING IT FOLLOWS THE PATH THAT SOCIETY IS GOING IN IF MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE USING DRUGS THEN I THINK THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE TO GUARD AGAINST PEOPLE THAT ARE USING DRUGS .
HUHUH .
I MEAN IT S JUST IT S JUST WHERE SOCIETY IS RIGHT NOW AND YOU KNOW SOMETHING WE HAVE TO COPE WITH AND I THINK THE DRUG TESTING IS SOMETHING THAT THE DRUG USERS HAVE TO COPE WITH .
YEAH WELL I THINK IT MAY IT MAY THAT S IN IN THAT RESPECT I THINK IT MAY HELP A LOT I THINK IT MAY BE PUSHING PEOPLE HOPEFULLY PUSH PEOPLE AWAY FROM DRUG USE .
YEAH .
IF THEY NO THAT YOU KNOW .
YEAH I THINK THAT MAY BE .
IF YOU USE DRUGS YOU WO NT GET THE JOB I MEAN .
THAT MEANS ONE OF THE POINTS OF IT OF COURSE I THINK UM I M NOT SURE YOU KNOW WHAT THE TIME SPAN IS BUT I MEAN IF I USED DRUGS LAST WEEK AND I HAD A YOU KNOW JOB INTERVIEW THAT I WOULD NT USE DRUGS THE DAY BEFORE OR SOMETHING AND THEY WOULD NT EVEN SEE IT YOU KNOW WHAT I M SAYING .

YEAH YEAH .
MY WIFE PROBABLY DOES .
I M NOT SURE WHAT THEY ARE EITHER .

BUT IT S AN INTERESTING TOPIC THAT I NEVER ACTUALLY THOUGHT ABOUT MUMBLEX .
YEAH THE OTHER DAY WE HAD TALKED ABOUT UH CAPITAL PUNISHMENT .
OH I MUMBLEX .
AND I REALLY REALLY HAD NT THOUGHT ABOUT IT I MEAN I THINK ABOUT IT BECAUSE I HEAR ABOUT IT BUT I HAD NT HAD TO SIT DOWN AND AND WELL WHAT DO I THINK ABOUT IT YOU KNOW AND THAT S KIND OF LIKE TODAY I M NOT REAL SURE WHAT I THINK ABOUT IT I M KIND OF YOU KNOW IN THE MIDDLE ON THAT ONE .
YEAH WELL THESE ARE TOUGH I SORT OF LIKE THAT STUFF IT MAKES YOU THINK .
HUHUH REALLY REALLY .
SO I THINK THAT S REAL GOOD .
OKAY IT WAS VERY NICE TALKING TO YOU .
NICE TALKING TO YOU TO .
OKAY TAKE CARE .
BYEBYE .
BYEBYE .
I PAY A GOOD DEAL OF TAXES I GUESS BECAUSE I I MAKE A FAIR AMOUNT OF MONEY AND UH THE TAXES THAT I PAY UM I GUESS AS A AS A GENERAL STATEMENT I FEEL I I GUESS I GET MY MONEY S WORTH FOR .
OKAY .
I M NOT SURE THOUGH WHETHER I FEEL I GUESS I AM SURE THAT I FEEL THAT IN GENERAL THOUGH UH THE ALLOCATION UH OF THE TAXES IN CERTAIN AREAS I IS NT CORRECT .
WELL I M SURE THAT UH PROBABLY EVERY PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY WOULD AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT .
BECAUSE EVERYBODY HAS A DIFFERENT IDEA OF WHERE THE MONEY SHOULD GO .
WELL I I LATELY I GUESS UM UH OR AT LEAST FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS OR SO I VE FELT THAT THE EXPENDITURES OF OUR TAXES INTO HIGH COST UH DEFENSE ITEMS AT LEAST IN THE LAST TEN YEARS HAVE BEEN UH THERE S BEEN AND EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF MONEY SPENT THERE AND I M NOT REALLY SURE THAT THAT WE VE GOTTEN OUR MONEY S WORTH THERE UH REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME OF THE DESERT STORM UH .
UHHUH .
DESERT SHIELD UH SITUATIONS .
YEAH .
UH I GUESS MY PARTICULAR BEEF IS THAT HAVING PARTICIPATED IN THE MI MILITARY OFF AND ON OVER THE OVER THE YEARS OF BEING CALLED BACK AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE IS UH I VE FOUND THAT YOU KNOW THERE S AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF WASTE .
I TAKE THAT AS A AS A GIVEN IN ANY MILITARY OPERATION AND .
OH YEAH NO ARGUMENT HERE .
YEAH AND I GUE I I SHOULD IMAGINE THAT THAT THAT WHAT .
THE WHAT .
THE PROBLEM WHY I I M I M A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT TODAY IS THAT THIS UH RATHER UH QUICK AND AND EASY I DO NT KNOW I SHOULD NT SAY EASY RATHER QUICK VICTORY IN THE IN IN THE UH MIDEAST UH UH OVER THE UH IRAQIS UH MIGHT LEAD US INTO UH A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY THAT WE CAN DO THAT AGAINST ANY OTHER FOE .
I M I I DO NT KNOW WHAT .
OTHER FOE .
THAT WOULD BE BUT UH I I M JUST GETTING NERVOUS AGAIN NOW HEARING THE VOICES COME UP THAT THERE HAS TO BE INCREASED EXPENDITURES IN THAT AREA .
YEAH WELL OF COURSE UH A LOT OF UH A LOT OF W MISSILES AND THINGS WERE EXPENDED IN THE COURSE OF FIGHTING THE WAR AND THE AND THE INVENTORY S GOING TO HAVE TO BE RESTOCKED UH ON NOW I WORK FOR T I AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE WERE TOLD IS LIKE THEY HAD ELEVEN THOUSAND HARM MISSILES .
WHICH .
T I IS THE SOLE SUPPLIER FOR AND THEY USED UP TWO THOUSAND OF THEM IN IN THE WAR SO THEY RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO ANOTHER CONTRACT TO RESTOCK THAT TO GET READY IN CASE .
SOMETHING ELSE IS NEEDED .
YEAH BUT IT IT IT WOULD THAT BE UH WELL LET S SEE TWO THOUSAND OUT OF ELEVEN THOUSAND THAT S ABOUT A LITTLE OVER TWENTY PER CENT .
UH I I SHOULD IMAGINE THAT THAT WOULD BE TO KEEP IT AT A LEVEL THOSE LEVELS I GUESS THAT THAT WERE ORIGINALLY APPROPRIATED W WAS WHEN THE SOVIET THREAT I GUESS WAS PERCEIVED AS BEING A GREATER ONE .
I DO NT THINK THERE S VERY MUCH OF A THREAT THERE TODAY .
I DO WORRY ABOUT WHAT .
NUCLEAR WEAPONS ARE LEFT IN THE TERRITORIES UH IN THEIR TERRITORY OVER THERE AND WHO S CONTROLLING THEM BUT .
THA THAT S TRUE THAT S TRUE .
I I DO NT KNOW WHAT AMOUNT OF WHAT AMOUNT OF OUR HARDWARE WOULD STOP SOME FANATIC I GUESS FROM DOING ANYTHING UH THAT WOULD BE IRRATIONAL .
WELL OF COURSE NOW WE USED UP TWENTY PER CENTS PER CENT OF THAT INVENTORY .
RIGHT .
IN A MATTER OF JUST A FEW WEEKS .
YEAH .
AND UH UH UH T I ALSO MAKES THE MISSILE WHICH WAS THE THE T V LASER GUIDED BOMBS .
YEAH .
AND AND A BIG PERCENTAGE OF THAT WAS EXPENDED AS WELL THAT N THAT W THAT WAS JUST A MATTER OF .
OH WHAT IS THE NAME OF THAT .
UH IT S CALLED PAVEWAY .
YES YES .
AND UH A BIG PERCENTAGE OF THAT WAS USED UP DURING THAT CONFLICT ALSO .
SO THO THOSE ARE TWO AREAS IN WHICH .
T I STANDS TO TO GAIN SOME SOME SHORT TERM BUSINESS TO RESTOCK THAT .
YEAH WELL UH I M WHAT .
I M UH I GUESS UH IT CONCERNED ABOUT TALKING ABOUT THE TAXES IN GENERAL AND THAT THAT WAS AN AREA THAT I I PERCEIVE AS NOT BEING THE BEST EXPENDITURE FOR THE AMOUNT OF DOLLAR THAT WE RE TAXED FOR UH IN THE AREA OF DEFENSE OR PERHAPS WE HAVE PAID TOO MUCH THERE I DO NT KNOW IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT OVER THE YEARS NOW THE AND AND IT S IT S A CLICHE I I BUT I SEE IT .
MYSELF I SEE WHERE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS SORT OF BREAKING DOWN THE ROADS THE HIGHWAYS .
OH NO DOUBT .
I I I DO NT KNOW UH I KN I M FAMILIAR WITH SOME SOME UPBEAT SCHOOL AREAS SO I DO NT TOTALLY AGREE WITH THE THE GREAT UH UH WITH THE WITH THE GREAT EX EXPENDITURE OF EFFORT AND TIME THERE BUT I GUESS OVERALL BECAUSE I GUESS I M NOT ASSOCIATED WITH WHAT GHETTO SCHOOLS AND AND UH AND UH RURAL SCHOOL SYSTEMS ARE LIKE I I SHOULD IMAGINE THAT WOULD TAKE AN ENORMOUS EXPENDITURE .
YEAH AS A MATTER OF FACT IN TEXAS UM WE VE HAD OUR SCHOOL FUNDING SYSTEM DECLARED UNCONSTITUTIONAL BY THE A STATE JUDGE AND THEY AND UH THE LEGISLATURE JUST PASSED WHAT .
THEY CALLED A ROBIN HOOD BILL WHICH BASICALLY WHAT .
IT DOES IS IT TAKES EXTRA MONEY FROM THE MORE AFFLUENT SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE THAT ARE YOU KNOW COME FROM LOCAL TAXES .
UHHUH .
AND SEND THEM TO OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE THAT ARE NOT SO AFFLUENT .
THEY THEY DO NT HAVE A BROAD BASED INCOME TAX .
THAT FUNDS THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM .
UH WELL .
OR IS IT .
ALL FUNDED OUT OF LOCAL TAXES .
OKAY TO G TO GIVE YOU .
SOME PERSPECTIVE THIS THIS TOWN THAT I HAD LIVED IN FOR SOMETIME IN NINETEEN EIGHTYTHREE WAS FUNDED SIXTYFIVE PER CENT BY STATE FUNDS .
YEAH .
THEN WE HAD A NUMBER OF EDUCATION REFORMS THAT THE LEGISLATURE SAID HEY WE GOT TO DO THIS WE GOT TO DO THIS WE GOT TO DO THIS BUT THEY FORGOT TO PUT IN THE STATE BUDGET .
THE MONEY TO PAY FOR IT AND THEY DUMPED IT .
ALL ON THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS .
SO .
SOUNDS LIKE THE WAY .
THE FEDERAL AND STATE SYSTEM WORKS NOW .
REALLY .
YEAH .
SO SO WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING WAS WAS A WAS A SHIFT .
WE WENT TO SIXTYFIVE PER CENT STATE FUNDING TO SIXTYFIVE PER CENT LOCAL FUNDING IN A MATTER OF FOUR YEARS .
AND UH I MEAN .
UH DO YOU MEAN A A COMPLETE REVERSAL .
OH COMPLETE COMPLETE .
IT .
S ALL SHIFTED TO LOCAL DISTRICTS AND NOW EVEN THE MONEY .
THAT S BEEN RAISED FOR THE LOCAL DISTRICTS IS BEING IS GOING TO BE SIPHONED OFF AND SENT TO OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE .
BECAUSE I GUESS THEY CA NT RAISE THAT MONEY IN THOSE THOSE POORER DISTRICTS HUH .
THAT S RIGHT AND AND I HAVE I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH UH A CERTAIN UH FLOOR LEVEL MINIMUM LEVEL THAT S A STANDARD .
YEAH .
UH THAT EVERYBODY UH OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE UH BUT I AM OPPOSED TO W ANY ATTEMPTS TO RESTRICT UM LOCAL COMMUNITIES FROM TAXING THEMSELVES ABOVE THAT TO PROVIDE ABOVE THE MINIMUM .
YES I SEE WHAT .
YOU RE SAYING .
UH I UH I I DO I I GUESS I AM A S UH A STRONG AND STAUNCH SUPPORTER OF SOME SUBSIDY FOR ANY FORMS OF EDUCATION .
I MEAN BY THAT I MEAN I M A PRODUCT .
MYSELF I HAVE UH A A A A BACKGROUND OF UH BEING UH GETTING MY COLLEGE EDUCATION THROUGH THE G I BILL .
SO DID I .
MY MASTERS ANYWAY .
WHAT BUT UH WHEN I LOOK AT IT TO ME UH IT DOES NT REALLY MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE .
IT WAS A MARVELOUS OPPORTUNITY THAT I COULD NT HAVE DONE I DO NT THINK I WOULD HAVE GONE ON UNLESS I HAD THAT FINANCIAL .
YEAH .
UH EASEMENT MADE POSSIBLE .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND I I DO NT REALLY CARE WHAT .
IT TAKES TO QUALIFY WHETHER YOU RE UH AN AN EX WHETHER YOU RE A VETERAN OR WHETHER YOU I DO NT EVEN KNOW IF YOU HAVE TO PERFORM COMMUNITY SERVICE OR UNLESS UH OR OR YOU PROMISE TO EVEN DO SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE I THINK THAT UH THE THAT THAT THE SUBSIDY .
ITSELF OR I GUESS THE ENACTMENT OF THAT FORM OF LEGISLATION .
UHHUH .
WOULD GIVE MANY PEOPLE .
WHO I I THINK I THINK I PERCEIVE THE FACT AT LEAST .
WHAT .
I READ IS THAT SOME YOUNGER PEOPLE FEEL THAT EDUCATION IS PRICED OUT OF THEIR UH OUT OF THEIR UH BUDGET .
I KNOW IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA JUST TODAY UH THE THE LEGISLATURE UH ADJOURNED AND UH THEY HAD COMPLETED A FIFTEEN PER CENT INCREASE IN THE IN THE UH STATE LAND GRANT COLLEGES WHICH WHICH IS NT I MEAN TO ME .
IT DOES NT SOUND LIKE A MO LOT OF MONEY BUT I GUESS IT WOULD BE FOR FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS .
A YEAR .
UHHUH .
THEY WENT FROM ELEVEN TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED .
YEAH .
AND UH FOR AN OUT OF STATE STUDENT .
THE TUITION WENT UP TWENTYFIVE PER CENT .
I DO NT KNOW WHAT .
THAT WOULD BE .
YEAH THEY HAD TO THEY HAD TO RAISE UH COMMUNITY COLLEGE TAXES HERE A FEW YEARS AGO .
BUT THAT UH I GUESS THAT GOES ALONG WITH THE GENERAL IDEA THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAD TO UH WAS EXPENDING SO MUCH MONEY ON DEFENSE UH THAT THAT THE PROGRAM NOW IS A UH PROGRAM NOW IS UH FEES THAT THAT FUND THESE THINGS I GUESS THAT S TRICKLED DOWN TO THE STATES AND .
UHHUH .
THE STATES NOW ESTABLISH UH DO NT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY SO THEY THEY MUST CHARGE FEES .
UH I I M NOT TOO SURE OF THAT REASONING .
YEAH .
BUT I GUESS TO GET BACK TO THE MAIN TOPIC I DO NT KNOW WHETHER I PAY TOO MUCH TAXES .
I I I TRAVEL EXTENSIVELY IN EUROPE AND SEE ENORMOUS UH PEOPLE P PAY UH A GREAT DEAL IN TAXES THEY TELL ME WHEN I SIT AND TALK TO PEOPLE THERE THEY TELL ME .
THEY THEY SOME STATES THEY PAY UH IN GERMANY OR IN IN ENGLAND IN SOME CASES PEOPLE IN MY INCOME LEVEL AT LEAST ALLEGE THAT THEY PAY UP TO SIX FIFTYFIVE PERCENT OF THEIR GROSS INCOME IN TAXES .
OH OH I CAN BELIEVE THAT .
BUT BUT I M NOT TOO SURE WHEN I PUT MY PROPERTY TAX IN MY CAR TAX MY INCOME TAX AND THESE MYRIAD OF UH NOW IT COSTS ME .
MONEY TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY SOME SORT OF A TAX TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY .
YEAH YEAH .
SOME SORT OF AN AIRPORT DEPARTURE TAX UH UH A TAX A SALES TAX .
WHICH IS GETTING TO UH QUITE HIGH LEVELS I M NOT SURE THAT I M NOT UP FAIRLY CLOSE TO THAT .
WELL I GUARANTEE YOU YOU D BE PAYING A LOT MORE IN TAXES I IF UH THE DEMOCRATS HAD MORE SAY .
YOU REALLY THINK SO .
YEAH I REALLY DO .
BUT I MEAN W WHAT S WHAT S HAPPENED HERE IS IS IS I FEEL THAT THAT IN THE LAST TEN YEARS UH MY TAXES HAVE GONE UP THEY HAVE NT GONE DOWN .
I PAY EX UH .
YEAH .
QUITE A BIT MORE TAXES AND AND AND .
EVERYBODY EVERYBODY IS .

I VE MAYBE BEEN INTO THE OFFICE ONCE IN THE PAST THREE YEARS YOU KNOW .
OH MY .
THEY JUST UM THEY JUST SEND ME .
EVERYTHING AND PICK IT UP COURIER OR WHATEVER SO YOU KNOW .
MAN .

YEAH .
IT IS REAL NICE YOU KNOW I JUST DEAL WITH THEM ON THE TELEPHONE HALF THE PEOPLE DO NT EVEN KNOW WHO .

UHHUH .
BUT I YOU KNOW WORKED I KNOW MOST OF THEM WELL I CA NT SAY THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE CHANGED AROUND THERE BUT MOST PEOPLE KNOW WHO .
I AM BUT I DO NT KNOW WHO .
THEY ARE YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
A LOT OF THEM JUST KNOW ME BY NAME AND PHONE VOICE .
RIGHT .
YEAH I VE GOT A LOT OF FOLKS THAT I VE WORKED WITH LIKE THAT AS WELL .
YEAH YOU JUST KNOW THEM BY THE TELEPHONE SO .
BUT WELL IT S BEEN GOOD TALKING TO YOU I THINK WE VE MUMBLEX GOT THE SUBJECT .
YEAH WE SORT OF STAYED TO THE TOPIC ANYWAY .
YEAH WE TRIED .
IT S HARD TO SOMETIMES .
OKAY WELL WE LL TALK TO YOU LATER .
OKAY WELL THANKS BYE BYE .
BYE .
WELL UH WHAT .
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE METRIC SYSTEM .
UH DO YOU UH FIND IT USEABLE .
HAVE YOU TRIED MUCH WITH IT .
WELL WI WITH AN ENGINEERING .
YEAH .
DEGREE IT S OF COURSE IT S A WHOLE LOT EASIER .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE UH .
TO USE YOU MEAN UHHUH .
YEAH IF IF SOMEBODY HA IS TOTALLY UNFAMILIAR WITH IT UH HUMAN NATURE BEING WHAT .
IT IS WE DO NT LIKE TO CHANGE .
YES .
UH IT JUST ABSOLUTELY MAKES PERFECTLY GOOD SENSE TO ME BECAUSE IT S ALL DECIMAL .
YES .
AND IT S SO EASY TO CONVERT FROM ONE SET OF UNITS TO ANOTHER .
UHHUH UHHUH .
WE WELL I VE LIVED BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND AND IN A COUNTRY WHERE THEY DO USE THE METRIC SYSTEM AND UH SO I VE I VE LIVED WITH MUMBLEX POUNDS AND INCHES AND FOUND IT REALLY QUITE EASY TO CONVERT OVER .
UM THE SECRET SEEMING TO ME TO BE TO NOT BOTHER EVER CONVERTING INCHES TO CENTIMETERS AND .
RIGHT .
POUNDS TO KILOM UH UH KILOGRAMS .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND I THINK THAT S .
WHAT HUNG PEOPLE UP THE MOST IS THEY WENT NOW WAIT A MINUTE AN INCH IS TWO POINT FIFTYFOUR CENTIMETERS .
RIGHT .
HOW ON EARTH .
AM .
I .
EVERY GOING TO DO THE MATH .
RIGHT .
AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE TRIED TO CONVERT EVERYTHING FROM INCHES TO CENTIMETERS PRESERVING BASICALLY THE INCHES BUT EXPRESSING THEM AS CENTIMETERS RATHER THAN SAYING NO A CENTIMETER IS ABOUT THE WIDTH OF YOUR THUMBNAIL OR WHATEVER AND YOU KNOW AND LEAVING IT AT THAT AND UH YOU KNOW A KILOGRAM WEIGHS ABOUT THIS MUCH AND GET USED TO IT FROM SCRATCH CAUSE I STILL CA NT CONVERT BACK AND FORTH FROM INCHES TO CENTIMETERS BUT I M PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE USING EITHER .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK THE REAL PROBLEM WITH THIS THIS WEIRD CONVERSION YO YOU SEE SIGNS .
THAT SAY FIFTYFIVE MILES PER HOUR AND YOU KNOW WHATEVER .
IT WOULD BE ONE HUNDRED SIX KILOMETERS PER HOUR YOU KNOW PEOPLE YOU KNOW IT S HARD TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY .
OH YEAH .
AND AS LONG AS BOTH WERE GIVEN YOU BASICALLY JUST DO NT READ THE KILOMETERS PER HOUR YOU JUST SAY WELL LOOK READ THE MILES PER HOUR ONE THE OTHER ONE MUST BE FOR SOMEONE ELSE .
THAT S RIGHT .
UH I DO NT KNOW I MEAN EVEN BRITAIN HAS CONVERTED OVER AND WE INHERITED THIS MESS FROM THEM AND UH .
THAT S RIGHT IT S ALL THEIR FAULT .
WELL I MEAN IT S MORE OUR FAULT THAN THEIRS AT THIS POINT BECAUSE THEY THEY SAW THE LIGHT UM I DO NT KNOW WHY THEY WE UM WERE MORE ABLE THAN WE WERE EXCEPT I THINK THAT THEY PROBABLY JUST SAID WELL WE RE JUST GOING TO START USING THE THINGS NOW AND YOU SORT OF HAVE TO FORCE PEOPLE TO CHANGE SINCE THEY DO NT WANT TO .
OF COURSE BEING PART OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY IF EVERYBODY ELSE DID IT .
THEY THEY WERE PROBABLY MUCH MORE IS MUCH MORE NECESSARY FOR THEM THAN FOR US .
THAT S TRUE THAT S THAT S PROBABLY TRUE AND AMERICA DOES HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF SORT OF DOING THINGS OUR OWN WAY RATHER THAN ADOPTING YOU KNOW SOME OTHER MODEL .
THERE S AN EXPRESSION FOR THAT WITH EYES ON THE PAST BACKING CONFIDENTLY INTO THE FUTURE .
I VE NEVER HEARD THAT ONE THAT S VERY NICE .
OH SO I M ALL FOR THE METRIC SYSTEM AND CONVERTING OVER AND I THINK I GUESS MY FEELING IS THE WAY TO DO IT IS IS TO JUST START GIVING WEIGHTS YOU KNOW HAVE A VERY BRIEF TRANSITION PERIOD AND THEN JUST START GIVING WEIGHTS AND KILOMETERS ER JUST AS IN KILOMETERS AND WEIGHTS AND KILOGRAMS AND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT AND UH JUST HAVE PEOPLE START USING IT RATHER THAN HAVING PEOPLE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO CONVERT .
REMEMBER ME GETTING A PACKAGE OF SOMETHING .
THAT SAID ONE POUND THIS IS A PACKAGE OF DATES MIND YOU IT S WAS PRESUMABLY SOMETHING .
YOU WEIGH FAIRLY PRECISELY IT SAID ONE POUND AND THEN IN PARENTHESIS .
IT SAID FOUR HUNDRED FIFTYFOUR POINT SIX GRAMS .
RIGHT RIGHT .
AND AS NEAR AS I COULD TELL SEEING THAT WAS BASICALLY ANTIMETRIC PROPAGANDA CAUSE ANYONE .
WHO WOULD SAY WELL LOOK I CAN EITHER BUY A POUND OF SOMETHING AT FOUR HUNDRED SIXTYFOUR POINT SIX GRAMS .
WHICH OF COURSE THEY COULD NT WEIGH IT OUT ACCURATELY ANYWAY UM EVERY TIME .
I SEE SOMETHING LIKE THAT I THINK WELL THAT S THAT S AN ANTIMETRIC ARGUMENT .
YEAH .
WELL UH I I DO NT THINK IT LL IT COULD EVER HAPPEN WITH WITH A QUICK TRANSITION .
YOU DO NT .
NO .
I I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE EASIEST WAY BUT HUMAN NATURE BEING SUCH AS IT IS .
UHHUH UHHUH .
I WOULD THINK IT WOULD TAKE PROBABLY TWO OR THREE YEARS BEFORE PEOPLE CO COULD COMPLETELY CUT THE CORD .
YEAH OH OH THAT S WHAT .
I WAS THINKING BY QUICK TRANSITION I DID NT MEAN YOU KNOW I DID NT MEAN LIKE SWEDEN GOING OVER TO RIGHT HAND DRIVE OR ANYTHING YOU KNOW AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT WE .
ALL SWITCH OVER OR ANYTHING .
DID THEY SWITCH .
UH I BELIEVE SO YEAH AND I THINK THEY DID IT OVERNIGHT CAUSE YOU KNOW YOU CA NT DO IT GRADUALLY .
THAT S AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING .
YOU CA NT DO GRADUALLY .
WELL THAT S TRUE .
IT IT HAS TO BE KIND OF A DISCREET TRANSACTION .
YES IT DOES .
A QUANTUM LEAP FROM LEFT TO RIGHT HAND DRIVE .
INTERESTING .
AND THEY BUT YOU KNOW THAT MUST HAVE TAKEN UH THAT WAS SOMETHING .
THAT HAD TO BE DONE QUICKLY .
OH YES .
YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THEY DECIDED TO DO IT TO MAKE THEMSELVES IN SYNC WITH THE REST OF EUROPE .
YEAH .
OR THE REST OF CONTINENTAL EUROPE AND YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
BUT THAT MUST HAVE BEEN TREMENDOUSLY DIFFICULT TO ORCHESTRATE .
I M SURE .
UM SO I I I I I THINK IT S ESSENTIAL THAT IT S DONE AND I THINK THE REAL TRICK IS TO AVOID THE .
YOU KNOW A LITTLE MORE ATTENTION TO HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY AND WHEREAS PEOPLE WANT ROUND NUMBERS AND AFTER ALL THE WHOLE REASON TO GO OVER TO METRIC IS TO HAVE ROUND NUMBERS .
EXACTLY EXACTLY .
SO THEY DO NT DEAL WITH THIRTY SECONDS OF AN INCH AND SO WHAT .
THE EXACT THE THING .
THAT WAS BEST ABOUT METRIC WAS THE THING .
THAT WAS MOST POORLY REPRESENTED .
REALLY I THINK .
WELL WE DO HAVE THE TWO LITER SODA POP BOTTLES .
UHHUH I SAW THAT I SAW THAT THE OTHER DAY .
I DON DO NT DRINK SODA POP .
YEAH .
BUT I SAW A TWO LITER SODA POP BOTTLE SO YEAH THINGS LIKE THAT ARE A GOOD START AND IF YOU START EXPRESSING ONE LITERS AND ONE KILOGRAMS AND THEN THE POUNDS COME IN THE THE YOU KNOW THE ODD NUMBERS .
RIGHT .
YES .
YOU KNOW TWO POINT TWO POUNDS OR SOMETHING .
I THINK PEOPLE WILL START GETTING A SENSE OF GEE THE METRIC IS THE SENSIBLE ONE .
THAT S TRUE .
WELL SURE HAVE ENJOYED OUR TALK .
YES WELL GET BACK TO WHAT .

UHHUH .
BUT THEY SEEM TO FALL SHORT OF OF BEING REALLY CREATIVE WITH A LOT OF THINGS I MEAN .
YEAH UHHUH .
HERE S THE SITUATION OF THIS KID AT HOME YOU KNOW IT S A CLASSIC SLAPSTICK SITUATION WITH THESE BUNGLING BURGLARS TRYING TO GET IN .
RIGHT .
AND YOU KNOW HE DID SOME CLEVER THINGS BUT GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE HOUSE AND HOW CLEVER THE KID WAS IT SEEMS TO ME THEY COULD HAVE DONE A LOT MORE I MEAN YOU KNOW BASICALLY STEPPING ON THINGS AND YELLING IN PAIN .
YEAH .
AND IT SEEMS TO ME THEY COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT MORE CREATIVE STUFF USED .
YEAH I WAS VERY SURPRISED THAT DID DO A SLAPSTICK MOVIE BECAUSE THAT S UH NOT REALLY THE WAY COMEDIES ARE RIGHT NOW .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW ALL THE COMEDIES ARE MORE LIKE JOKES AND YOU KNOW GAGS AND STUFF LIKE THAT .

BUT THEY HAVE THIS ONE GUY MUMBLEX WHO DOES SLAPSTICK COMEDY AND THERE S SOMETHING ABOUT IT THAT S SO INNOVATIVE YOU KNOW HE LL HAVE TROUBLE PICKING UP HIS HAT OR CATCHING HIS UMBRELLA BLOWING IN THE WIND OR SOMETHING BUT THERE S SOMETHING ABOUT IT THAT JUST IT IS NT JUST SLAPSTICK THERE S SOMETHING ABOUT THE HUMAN CHARACTER IN IT .
OH UHHUH .
AND THAT S WHAT I FIND LACKING IN A LOT OF YOU KNOW LIKE HOME ALONE THERE WAS A LOT OF THE HUMAN CHARACTER WHEN HE WAS HOME ALONE AND HE WAS TRYING .
RIGHT .
MUMBLEX AND THERE WAS A LOT OF HUMAN CHARACTER THERE BUT WHEN IT WAS THE REAL SLAPSTICK MOMENTS HIM VERSUS THE CRIMINALS KIND OF THING IT JUST SORT OF LOST THE HUMAN ELEMENT .
UHHUH .
AND BECAME PURELY A CARICATURE .
RIGHT .
DOES THAT MAKE SINCE TO YOU .
YEAH UHHUH YEAH I SEE WHAT YOU RE SAYING THERE S LESS CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT RATHER JUST THE THE THE FUNNINESS OF THE GAG .
YEAH YEAH .
RATHER THAN .
DID YOU GO WITH KIDS THOUGH .
AND HOW IT FITS WITH THE CHARACTER RIGHT .
DID YOU GO WITH KIDS .
EXCUSE ME .
DID YOU TAKE KIDS ALONG .
NO WE WENT UH WITHOUT THE KIDS IT S WAS A NIGHT OUT AWAY FROM THE CHILDREN .
OH I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE A KID WITH ME I THINK PREFERABLY SOMEONE SEVEN OR EIGHT .
OH .
JUST JUST TO GET A SENSE FOR YOU KNOW HOW HOW IT AFFECTED THEM .
ESPECIALLY TO COME HOME AND YOU KNOW MUMBLEX I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN IN TROUBLE THE NEXT DAY I M SURE .
UHHUH YEAH THAT THAT S TRUE I I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT TOO I SAW THAT UM THAT S WHY I WATCHED ANOTHER SILLY MOVIE UM UM WITH MY COUSIN WAS UH UH THE ONE ABOUT THE UM THE TURTLES .

AND THEY HAVE TO SHAKE IT OFF .
YEAH .
THEY DO NT THEY DO NT YOU KNOW GET UH EPILEPTICS THAT SORT OF THING FROM GETTING HIT ON THEIR HEAD .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW IT S A LITTLE DISTURBING THE VIOLENCE IN THESE FILMS PARTLY MUMBLEX IT S SUPPOSED TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE OKAY BECAUSE IT S COMIC BOOK .
UHHUH .
ON THE OTHER HAND IT MAKES IT SEEM LIKE I READ AN ARTICLE ONE TIME TALKING ABOUT EVEN THE QUOTE UNQUOTE REALISTIC MOVIES DO NT HAVE VERY REALISTIC UPSETS OF THE VIOLENCE THE VIOLENCE CAN SEEM VERY REALISTIC BUT THE AFTERMATH IS USUALLY NOT THERE .
RIGHT .
SO YOU SEE PEOPLE WHO ARE SEVERELY INJURED VERY VERY BADLY LOSE CONTROL OF BODY FUNCTIONS .
UHHUH .
THEY THRASH AROUND THEY SCREAM YOU KNOW UH IT S JUST A VERY VERY BAD THING AND THEY NEVER PRESENT THAT EVEN THE MOVIES THAT WANT TO SHOW VIOLENCE AS REAL THEY DO NT REALLY SHOW YOU WHAT HAPPENS WITH THAT REAL VIOLENCE .
UHHUH .
AND I M NOT REALLY SURE HOW I FEEL ABOUT THAT .
UHHUH .
UH ON THE ONE HAND I D LIKE IT TO BE A WARNING ON THE OTHER HAND I WOULD NT WANT PEOPLE WHO CURRENTLY GET SORT OF ENJOY THEIR VIOLENCE FIXES FROM THESE MOVIES TO START THINKING GEE NOW WE WANT TO SEE THE AFTERMATH ALL THE TIME EITHER .
YOU RE RIGHT UHHUH YEAH IT S TRUE .
BUT YEAH TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES WAS SORT OF THE SAME WAY THEY I GUESS THEY FIGURED I MEAN THEY KNOW WHAT THEY RE DOING AND THEY MAKE THE MOVIES GOOD ENOUGH I GUESS I M A BIT OF A SNOB THEY MAKE THE MOVIES GOOD ENOUGH TO BE SUCCESSFUL .
UHHUH .
AND THEN THEY DO NT AND THEY BUT THEY COULD MAKE THEM BETTER YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
THEY COULD TRY TO MAKE I MEAN AS FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES COULD HAVE BEEN A CLASSIC OF WORLD THEATER .
REALLY .
MUMBLEX IT COULD HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW IT WAS IT WAS INNOVATIVE UH A COMPLETELY NEW APPROACH TO MAKING A MOVIE IN A LOT OF WAYS AND YET IT ENDED UP NOT BEING ANYTHING PARTICULARLY MEMORABLE BECAUSE THE THE STORY WAS STUPID AND AND THEN THINGS LIKE THAT AND THEY BUILT UP I REMEMBER FEELING ANNOYED AGAIN I DID NT HAVE A KID WITH ME AND I REMEMBER FEELING ANNOYED THAT THEY HAD THIS WHOLE THING ABOUT THE MASTER AND THE PASSING OF WISDOM THE FROM OLDER TO YOUNGER GENERATION IT WAS IT WAS A CLASSIC GREEK YOU KNOW YOU KNOW A SORT OF EUROPEAN MESS GOING BACK THREE THOUSAND YEARS THAT THEY RE PLAYING WITH .
UHHUH .
UM AND HE HAD TO MUMBLEX AND HE TOLD THEM REMEMBER MUMBLEX REMEMBER YOU WERE UNITED YOU CAN SUCCEED INDIVIDUALLY YOU WILL FAIL .
YEAH RIGHT RIGHT .
AND THEN THERE WAS A BIG CLIMACTIC FIGHT SCENE AND THEY DID NT REMEMBER THAT .
THEY DID NT FIGHT TOGETHER THEY FOUGHT INDIVIDUALLY AND THEY FAILED INDIVIDUALLY AND THEN THAT WAS IT THEN THEY HAD TO HAVE THE MASTER BEAT HIM .
RIGHT .
AND THE MASTER SHOULD ACCORDING TO THE CLASSIC MYTH THE SORT OF JOSEPH CAMPBELL TYPE MYTH HE THE MASTER SHOULD HAVE DIED AT THE END .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE THE THE LESSON WAS PASSED TO THE YOUNG GENERATION AND THE OLDER GENERATION IS NOT NEEDED AND IS REBORN TO THE YOUNGER GENERATION AND ON AND ON AND ON AND ALL THIS WONDERFUL MESS .
UHHUH .
AND IT STILL WOULD HAVE BEEN EVERY BIT AS ACCESSIBLE A MOVIE FOR THE KIDS IF THEY HAD INCLUDED ALL THIS STUFF THAT I ANYWAY AS AN INTELLECTUAL ADULT WOULD APPRECIATE IT WOULD NT HAVE HURT THE MOVIE TO DO THAT AND IT WOULD HAVE MAKE IT UH BROADENED THE AUDIENCE THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN TARGETED FOR I THOUGHT .
UHHUH .
BUT I UH I M TRULY ENOUGH YOU KNOW I M TRULY AN INTELLECTUAL SNOB .
TO BE GOING TO THESE KINDS OF MOVIES I REALIZE THAT I MEAN TO GO TO THESE MOVIES AND EXPECT THEM TO BE YOU KNOW OTHER THAN JUST JUST GOOD ENTERTAINMENT .
RIGHT .
KIND OF THING .
THAT S TRUE YEAH THERE S NOT TOO MANY THAT ARE UH THAT ARE GOOD JUST ON THEIR YOU KNOW THAT THAT YOU WOULD NT WANT TO CHANGE SOMETHING AND THERE S ALWAYS SOMETHING THAT UH .
YEAH YEAH .
UHHUH .

AND MY FATHER WORKS IN FILMS AND SUCH AND I TEND TO TEND TO BE HYPERCRITICAL .
UHHUH .
OF THESE THINGS AND THEN PERHAPS PERHAPS IT S UNFAIR BECAUSE I I I MUST ADMIT I ENJOY THESE MOVIES .
YEAH RIGHT .
AND THAT S WHAT THEY RE FOR BUT I DO NT DO NT REMEMBER THEM AND I THINK IT S I THINK I CAN THINK OF MOVIES I HAVE LESS FUN DURING AND THEN AFTER THE MOVIE S OVER I REMEMBER IT SO TERRIBLY WELL .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE IT IT HAD SOME SOME MEANING TO ME OR SOMETHING .
RIGHT EXACTLY YEAH THERE THERE THERE ARE SEVERAL MOVIES THAT HIT HOME LIKE THAT OF COURSE THE ONES I ALWAYS REMEMBER ARE THE THE OLDER ONES .
UHHUH .

BYE BYE .
GREAT BYE .
OKAY HAVE YOU PARTICIPATED IN ANYTHING LIKE THAT .
WELL A LITTLE BIT WE MOSTLY DO OUR NEWSPAPERS WE KEEP OUR NEWSPAPERS AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND WE KEEP OUR NEWSPAPERS AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND WE TAKE THEM TO BE RECYCLED .
UHHUH UH WE WE HAVE A PRETTY NICE RECYCLING CENTER UH IN OUR CITY NOW AND WE TAKE THE NEWSPAPERS AND PLASTIC AND GLASS UP THERE THEY RE OPEN LIKE TWO DAYS A WEEK AND YOU CAN JUST TAKE IT UP THERE AND DROP IT OFF .
UHHUH .
IT S KIND OF FUN AND EVERYBODY UP THERE LOOKS PLEASED WITH THEMSELVES WHEN THEY RE TAKING THEIR STUFF IN LIKE THEY RE DOING SOMETHING GOOD TO .
YEAH .
HELP THE EARTH I GUESS .
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE COMPLAIN BECAUSE IT S REALLY NOT CONVENIENT FOR THEM .
YEAH YEAH MY HUSBAND WAS COMPLAINING THE OTHER DAY BECAUSE HE SAID EVERY TIME I TURN AROUND YOU RE TELLING ME SOME NEW RULE ABOUT RECYCLING LIKE YESTERDAY I WAS TELL HIM YOU HAVE TO YOU RE SUPPOSED TO SQUEEZE THE PLASTIC JUGS BEFORE YOU TAKE THEM UP THERE .
YOU RE SUPPOSED TO WHAT .
EVERY TIME HE TURNS AROUND I M GIVING HIM SOME NEW RULE .
BUT WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THEM .
WHERE YOU RE SUPPOSED TO SQUISH UP THE YOU KNOW LIKE COLLAPSE THE PLASTIC JUGS .
OH OKAY .
INSTEAD OF TAKING THEM UP THERE SOLID AND I WISH THAT OUR RECYCLING CENTER TOOK PAPER BAGS THEY WO NT TAKE THOSE WE LIKE TO PUT OUR JUST PUT OUR NEWSPAPERS IN A PAPER BAG YOU KNOW AND THEN CARRY THEM UP THERE THAT WAY .
UHHUH .
AND WE HAVE TO BRING THE PAPER BAGS BACK EVERY TIME .
YEAH .
BECAUSE THEY WO NT TAKE THEM DO YOU UH TAKE YOUR PAPERS SOMEWHERE OR DOES SOMEONE PICK THEM UP .
WE WE USUALLY COLLECT A YOU KNOW COLLECT A QUITE A BIT AND THEN WE TAKE THEM TAKE THEM IN .
UHHUH WE UM WE DO NT TAKE OUR CANS UP TO THAT CENTER THOUGH OUR ALUMINUM CANS WE LIKE TO TAKE THEM TO ONE OF THE PLACES WHERE THEY PAY YOU FOR THEM .
YEAH WE DO NT WE DO NT UM USE ALUMINUM CANS .
UHHUH .
SO WE GENERALLY DO NT HAVE THOSE TO DO .
YEAH IT TAKES US ABOUT A YEAR TO SAVE UP ENOUGH TO BE WORTH YOU KNOW WORTH BOTHERING TO GO IN AND DO BUT DO YOU UM HAVE ANY IDEAS ON ANYTHING THAT WOULD MAKE .
YOU KNOW THEY THEY CHARGE YOU YOU KNOW IT S LIKE A FLAT RATE I THINK FOR PICKING UP YOUR GARBAGE .
UHHUH .
AND I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE IT WOULD WOULD SOLVE THE CONVENIENCE PROBLEM IF THEY HAD CURBSIDE PICKUP AND SOME COMMUNITIES ARE TRYING TO DO THAT NOW AND I THINK THAT MAYBE IF THEY ONLY CHARGED FOR THE GARBAGE THAT YOU DID NOT SORT AND HAVE SET UP FOR RECYCLING .
RIGHT .
THEY THEY CHARGED YOU BY BY WEIGHT OF HOW MUCH TRASH YOU WERE ACTUALLY SENDING TO A LAND FILL .
YEAH THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA .
THAT THAT MIGHT BE A BETTER WAY TO DO IT .
YEAH .
AND THEN PEOPLE WOULD WOULD KNOW THAT IT WAS GOING TO COST THEM MONEY TO NOT SORT THEIR TRASH .
RIGHT YEAH THAT WOULD BE A REAL GOOD MOTIVATION FOR PEOPLE .
YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEN IT WOULD THEN IT WOULD MAKE MONETARY SENSE TO THEM YOU KNOW TO SAY HEY YOU KNOW IF I JUST SPEND THE TIME TO TO SORT THIS OUT WHERE THIS STUFF CAN BE RECYCLED THEN I DO NT HAVE TO PAY FOR THEM HAULING IT OFF .
RIGHT YEAH MY FATHER WAS TELLING ME ABOUT SOME PROGRAM HE READ ABOUT WHERE YOU BUY YOUR BAGS LIKE YOU BUY YOUR GARBAGE BAG FROM THE CITY .
UHHUH .
AND YOU PAY MORE THAN JUST WHAT YOU WOULD PAY FOR AN EMPTY GARBAGE BAG BUT THEN YOU DO NT PAY ANY MONTHLY FEE OR ANYTHING SO HOW EVER MANY BAGS OF GARBAGE YOU THROW AWAY THAT S HOW MANY YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR .
OH YEAH THAT S ABOUT THE SAME KIND OF THING .
YEAH YEAH THAT WOULD BE A REAL GOOD IDEA I M TRYING TO THINK IF THERE S ANYTHING ELSE I COULD THINK OF THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT GOING TO CURBSIDE PICKUP IN OUR IN OUR CITY MUMBLEX .
WHERE DO YOU LIVE .
ROWLETT TEXAS .
OH OKAY .
DO YOU KNOW WHERE THAT IS .
YES .
AND I DO NT KNOW IF THEY DECIDED TO DO OR NOT BUT I THINK THEY SAID IT WAS GOING TO ADD LIKE EITHER A DOLLAR OR THREE DOLLARS A MONTH TO YOUR BILL TO HAVE THEM DO THAT ALTHOUGH I THINK A LOT OF THOSE PROGRAMS CAN OPERATE AT ABOUT A BREAK EVEN BREAK EVEN POINT .
IT SEEMS LIKE THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO .
WITHOUT CHARGING PEOPLE YEAH I DO NT KNOW UH I GUESS IT JUST DEPENDS ON HOW THEY MANAGE IT .
UHHUH .
I DO NT KNOW HOW MUCH THEY GET WHEN THEY SELL ALL THAT STUFF .
THE CENTER THAT THEY VE GOT NOW WHERE YOU TAKE YOUR STUFF IN I I THINK THAT SHOULD BE MAKING SOME MONEY .
YEAH .
SINCE THEY JUST HAVE TO HIRE SOMEONE TO MAN IT A FEW HOURS A WEEK AND THEY SELL I GUESS THEY SELL EVERYTHING TO SOME WASTE COMPANY THAT COMES AND GETS IT .
YEAH .
BUT I WISH THAT UH MORE OF THE CANS YOU KNOW LIKE THE CANS YOU BUY VEGETABLES AND FRUIT AND STUFF LIKE THAT IN WERE RECYCLABLE I DO NT A LOT OF THAT S THAT RECYCLABLE STEEL AND I DO NT KNOW ANYBODY THAT TAKES THAT .
YEAH THAT S TRUE MUMBLEX .
TH MY HUSBAND LIKES PEPSI AND THOSE CANS ARE STEEL INSTEAD OF ALUMINUM SO WE CA NT CA NT EVER RECYCLE THEM I THINK IT S A GOOD REASON TO QUIT BUYING IT .
UM NOW I DID NT KNOW THAT CAUSE WE JUST USUALLY IF WE RE GOING TO UH BUY SODAS THEY RE IN THE THE TWO LITER BOTTLES .
YEAH THAT S WHAT WE BUY THE MOST OF UNLESS WE RE GOING ON A TRIP OR SOMETHING WHERE WE WANT TO .
YEAH .
PUT THE CANS IN A COOLER BUT WELL THAT S ALL I CAN REALLY THINK ABOUT FOR RECYCLING .
OKAY .
IT WAS GOOD TALKING TO YOU .

YEAH .
ALMOST NOBODY THERE HAS HAS LAWNS .
YEAH WELL THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO WATER SO WHAT DO YOU DO .
YEAH .

UH IT IS VERY IT IS VERY ROUGH ON THEM SO .
UHHUH .
ACTUALLY I THINK I THINK IT IS PRETTY MODERATE HERE IN DALLAS BECAUSE THE THE SUMMERS ARE EXTREMELY HOT .
UHHUH BUT YOUR HUMIDITY IS DIFFERENT THOUGH THAN OURS I THINK AND IT MAKES A A BIT OF A DIFFERENCE TOO .
UM WHAT IS YOUR HUMIDITY LIKE .
OH I DO NT KNOW I THINK OUR HUMIDITY IS HIGHER NORMALLY THAN WHAT IT IS IN TEXAS I COULD BE WRONG .
UH I DO NOT KNOW WHAT WHAT IT IS PERCENTAGE WISE BUT I .
I DO NOT KNOW FOR SURE EITHER BUT IT ALWAYS SEEMS WELL IT JUST FELT DIFFERENT LIKE WHEN WE WERE IN TEXAS IT HAD A DIFFERENT FEEL TO IT .
YEAH IT IS IT IS DRIER IN DALLAS THAN IT IS IN HOUSTON OR SAN ANTONIO .
UH .
OR EVEN AUSTIN .
UHHUH .
WHICH IS FURTHER SOUTH .
UHHUH .
BUT IT IS NOT DRY AND AND I HAVE LIVED HERE FOR MANY YEARS AND I THINK IT HAS GOTTEN MORE HUMID OVER THE YEARS WHERE THE WATER IS COMING FROM I DO NT KNOW .
UHHUH WELL IT COULD BE I KNOW MY BROTHER S HOME HAS BEEN FLOODED A COUPLE OF TIMES UH .
OH DOES HE LIVE NEAR THE LAKE .
WELL THERE IS A LAKE NOT FAR BUT IT IS MORE RUN OFF .
UHHUH .
FROM SURROUNDING YOU KNOW AREAS AND THAT .
UH .
AND UH HE IS JUST IN AN AREA WHERE IT IS JUST LOW ENOUGH THAT IT S YOU KNOW IT IT COLLECTS THERE .
UHHUH .
AND UH HE HAS HAD A COUPLE OF INCHES IN HIS HOUSE SEVERAL TIMES .
THAT IS THAT IS A PROBLEM UH THEY TELL YOU WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A HOUSE OR OR OR BUYING LAND TO BUILD ON .
UHHUH .
TO BE VERY CAREFUL AND CHECK THE DRAINAGE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
BECAUSE UH .
BECAUSE OF THAT .
IT IS IT IS DECEPTIVE .
UHHUH .
AND UH I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU MEAN .
WE ARE FORTUNATE OR UH WE ARE ON A WHERE WE ARE WE GET FLOODED IT FLOODS BELOW US .
UHHUH .
BEHIND US BUT WE ARE UH WE ARE HIGH ENOUGH THAT OUR HOUSE ITSELF WE NEVER YOU KNOW HAVE HAD ANY PROBLEM LIKE THAT .
OH WELL THAT IS FORTUNATE .
YEAH IT IS AN OLD FARM HOUSE AND UH WE REALLY LIKE IT HERE .
UHHUH WELL I I LIKE IT I LIKE IT HERE UH I I GREW UP HERE I HAVE LIVED OTHER PLACES AND AND .
UHHUH .
BUT I I DID GROW UP HERE AND THIS IS VERY MUCH HOME FOR ME .
UHHUH .
AND .
IT IS NICE DOWN THERE I I I LIKED IT WHEN WE VISITED THERE .
I HOPE YOU VISITED DURING THE WINTER .
UHHUH .
ONE OF MY ONE OF MY THEORIES IS THAT YOU ALWAYS GO TO WARM PLACES DURING THE WINTER AND .
RIGHT .
YOU GO TO COLD COOL PLACES THAT WELL I GO TO COOL PLACES DURING THE SUMMER IF I CAN ANYWAY .
RIGHT THAT IS THE BEST TIME TO GO YEAH AN AND USUALLY IT HAS BEEN WHEN WE HAVE GONE IT HAS BEEN NICE IT HAS BEEN HOT BUT IT IS IT IS HOT TO ME IN THE WINTERTIME DOWN THERE .
OH SURE I MEAN .
YOU KNOW BUT IT IS NICE IT IS A IT IS REALLY A NICE AREA .
I I HAD A FRIEND FROM ENGLAND VISIT ONCE AT CHRISTMAS AND WE COULD NOT GET HER OUT OF THE WHAT SHE CALLED THE BACK GARDEN .
OH REALLY .
BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO GO BACK WITH A SUNBURN .
OH .
AND SHE WENT BACK TO THE NORTH OF ENGLAND WITH A SUNBURN .
OH GOOD HEAVENS NOT ME I AVOID THE SUN .

IS THAT RIGHT .
YEAH .
IT .
AND I THINK THAT IS WHY .
IT JUST MAKES YOUR SKIN MORE LEATHERY IT UH .
EXACTLY .
IT YEAH SO .
I THINK IT BURNS OFF THE I DO NT KNOW THE THE THE THEORY THE SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLE BUT IT BURNS SOMETHING OFF THE NATURAL OILS .
UHHUH .
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
WELL THE ELASTICITY OF YOUR SKIN THE COLLAGEN OR WHATEVER THEY CALL IT THEY SAY IT DESTROYS A LOT OF THAT .
YES .
AND YOU LOSE A LOT OF THAT SO UH .

OKAY .
OKAY .
WELL THANKS JEAN .
UH BYEBYE .
BYEBYE .
ALL RIGHT DO YOU WANT TO START OUT .
WELL IT LL BE REAL EASY FOR US .
BECAUSE WE RE BOTH MY HUSBAND AND I ARE VEGETARIANS .
OH ARE YOU REALLY .
SO YEAH SO THAT S THE FIRST THING WE LOOK FOR .
OH .
IS IF WE CAN EAT THERE OR NOT .
ARE YOU STRICT VEGETARIANS .
WE RE NOT VEGAN VEGETARIANS WE DO WE RE OVOLACTO WE DO EAT UH EGGS AND AND MILK PRODUCTS .
UHHUH .
I USED TO BE A COMPLETE VEGAN VEGETARIAN .
UHHUH .
WHERE I DID NT EAT ANY ANIMAL PRODUCTS AT ALL .
UHHUH .
BUT UM IT WAS IT S REALLY DIFFICULT IN THE AREA IF YOU DO NT HAVE YOU KNOW THE PRODUCTS THAT YOU CAN GET AND IF YOU GO OUT TO DINNER THERE S VIRTUALLY YOU KNOW THERE S NOT A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS YOU CAN GET .
THERE S VERY FEW PLACES THAT YOU I LL BET THAT YOU COULD UH .
YEAH I THINK MAYBE IF YOU WERE SOMEWHERE LIKE CALIFORNIA WHERE THEY HAVE A LOT MORE VEGETARIAN RESTAURANTS .
UHHUH .
AND STUFF BUT HERE BASICALLY YOU GO TO AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT OR YOU GO TO A MEXICAN RESTAURANT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW WHERE YOU CAN GET FOODS THAT YOU KNOW WHERE YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE VARIETY AS FAR AS THE PASTAS OR THE .
UHHUH .
THE CORN MEAL YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
OR SOMETHING .
AND YOU .
BUT .
WOULD NT HAVE THE MEAT PRODUCTS IN THAT AND SOME .
YEAH .
YEAH .
YEAH YOU HAVE TO WATCH THAT TOO ALL YOU KNOW SOME OF THE RESTAURANTS HERE THEY WILL YOU KNOW L YOU CAN ASK THEM AND THEY LL TELL YOU WHETHER OR NOT THEY USE LIKE LARD OR .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW ANIMAL FAT TO COOK WITH .
UHHUH .
SO BUT SO THAT S THAT WE DO NT REALLY EAT OUT TOO MUCH .
YEAH .
WE WE TEND TO EAT AT HOME AND ACTUALLY YOU KNOW I THINK WE WE WE GET A HA WE HAVE A HEALTHIER DIET THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON .
UHHUH HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN DOING THIS .
UM I VE BEEN A VEGETARIAN FOR UH TWO YEARS NOW MY HUSBAND HAS BEEN ONE FOR OH JUST OVER A YEAR NOW .
UHHUH .
AND UH SO .
DO YOU FEEL THAT IT HAS IMPROVED THE WAY YOU FEEL .
DEFINITELY .
DO YOU THINK .
AND IT IT MAKES YOU MORE AWARE OF WHAT YOU RE EATING .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE YOU YOU HAVE TO BE .
UHHUH .
I MEAN YOU YOU K I THINK YOU YOU YOU BALANCE THE FOODS UH YOU KNOW YOU RE MORE AWARE OF WHAT NUTRIENT YOU KNOW VALUE EACH THING HAS .
UHHUH .
AND MINERALS AND YOU RE JUST MORE AWARE OF FOOD FOR ENERGY .
UHHUH .
FOR ENERGY SAKE .
I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HARD TO FIGURE WHAT TO EAT IF YOU WERE A VEGETARIAN HOW HOW .
WELL THAT S JUST IT YOU YOU DO HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT .
YEAH .
AND AND YOU KNOW TO GET PROTEINS AND THINGS AND WHEN I WAS A VEGAN IT S YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER CALCIUM AND IRON AND .
UHHUH .
THINGS LIKE THAT YOU YOU RE NOT EVEN GETTING THROUGH YOUR MILK PRODUCTS .
UHHUH .
YOUR EGG PRODUCTS .
BECAUSE YOU DO NT EAT ANY OF THOSE THINGS .
IF YOU DO NT EAT ANY OF THOSE BUT ACTUALLY YOU CAN GET EVERYTHING YOU NEED THROUGH VEGETABLES I MEAN THERE ARE TRA THERE ARE THERE ARE YOU ACTUALLY YOU CAN GET MORE CALCIUM THROUGH LEAFY GREEN VEGETABLES THAN YOU CAN GET THROUGH MILK PRODUCTS .
IS THAT RIGHT .
A LOT OF PEOPLE DO NT KNOW THAT .
UHHUH .
WELL THE THING IS THAT MILK PRODUCTS OUR BODIES DO NT UH DO NT UH THE LACTOSE THAT KIND OF MILK IT DOES NT .
UHHUH .
OUR WE WE TEND TO UH WHAT S IT CALLED WE DO NT SYNTHESIZE THE THE CALCIUM THE .
WE WE THROW MORE OF IT OFF .
SAME WAY .
OUR BOD OUT IN OTHER WORDS .
YEAH WE WE SLOUGH SOME OF IT WE WE SEND WE SEND SOME OF IT OUT BECAUSE IT OUR BODY DOES NT ACCEPT SOME OF IT .
UHHUH .
SO WE RE NOT UTILIZING WE RE WHEN IT WHEN IT GETS RID OF SOME OF THAT UM THAT WE CA NT USE IT GET RIDS IT GETS RID OF SOME OF THE CALCIUM .
UHHUH .
WHEREAS WHEN WE EAT SAY BROCCOLI YOU UTILIZE ALL OF IT .
UHHUH .
YOU UTILI YOUR YOUR BODY ACCEPTS .
ALL THAT S IN IT .
ALL OF THE BROCCOLI .
UHHUH .
SO IT S LIKE .
WHY .
IT S LIKE SAY A PERSON USING VITAMINS AS OPPOSED TO UH VITAMIN SUPPLEMENTS AS OPPOSED TO EATING REGULAR FOOD .
UHHUH .
YOUR BODY JUST DOES NT ACCEPT VITAMINS .
UHHUH .
AND THE MINERALS IN THE THE VITAMINS IN UH SUPPLEMENTS THAT IT DOES IN REGULAR FOOD .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW SO .
THAT S INTERESTING .
BUT WE BOTH WE BOTH FEEL MUCH HEALTHIER .
UHHUH .
MUCH HEALTHIER AND I COULD NT CONSIDER GOING BACK TO EATING .
AFTER YOU HAVE BEEN ON THIS .
YEAH WELL NOW I CHANGED FOR ETHICAL REASONS .
UHHUH .
AND MY HUSBAND HAS CHANGED HE FEELS MORE ETHICALLY ABOUT IT BUT HE HE IN THE BEGINNING BEGAN FOR HEALTH REASONS .
UHHUH .
BUT UM NOW HE HE FEELS LIKE I DO THAT HE LOOKS AT THE THINGS THAT HE EATS AND HE REALIZES WHAT THEY ARE .
UHHUH .
BEFORE HE EATS THEM AND HE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW .
HE THINKS MORE ABOUT THEM THEN .
YEAH PLUS HE EATS WE BOTH THINK MORE ABOUT I THOUGHT MORE OF ABOUT IT AS FAR AS WHAT IT WAS I WAS EATING YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
AS A LIVING CREATURE .
UHHUH .
AND NOW WE BOTH THINK A LOT OF WELL WHAT IS IT WE RE EATING IN RELATION TO WHAT IT S GOING TO GIVE TO OUR BODIES .
UHHUH SO YOU KIND OF HAVE A COMBINATION .
UHHUH .
UHHUH WELL SEE WE I LIVE IN A FARMING COMMUNITY .
UHHUH .
SO OF COURSE WE HAVE A LOT OF ANIMALS AND THAT TYPE OF THING RAISED IN OUR AREA .
WELL WE DO TOO I MEAN I WAS RAISED IN UM WE RE IN CATTLE COUNTRY .
UHHUH .
AND PEOPLE HERE BUY A HALF A COW .
UHHUH .
AND PUT IT IN THEIR FREEZER .
OH YEAH YEAH .
YOU KNOW AND THAT S THAT S THE WAY I AND I BELIEVE YOU ME IT WAS NT EASY TO GIVE UP .
TO GIVE UP A HAMBURGER .
THAT THAT WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE FOODS WAS WAS A A WAS A GOOD STEAK OR A HAMBURGER .
UHHUH .
BUT YOU KNOW I SUPPOSE IF YOU REALLY BELIEVE IN SOMETHING IT S .
YOU GET ADJUSTED TO THE TASTE .
YOU YOU ADJUST YOUR LIFE .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE YOUR MIND .
UHHUH .
YOU YOUR YOU INSIDE YOURSELF YOU JUST IT S NOT RIGHT .
UHHUH .
SO BUT UM .
SO YOU WOULD HAVE A LITTLE MORE TROUBLE WHEN YOU WERE LOOKING FOR A DINING AREA THAN WHAT MOST .
OH YES .
MOST PEOPLE WOULD .
YEAH .
NOW WE WOULD NT HAVE THAT PROBLEM BECAUSE WE RE NOT VEGETARIANS .
SO WHAT DO YOU LOOK FOR WHEN YOU .
UH I THINK THE MAIN THING THAT I LOOK FOR IS UH CLEANLINESS UH YOU KNOW THE IN THE APPEARANCE OF THE PEOPLE THAT WORK THERE .
UHHUH .
AND THE UH QUALITY OF THE FOOD THAT THEY SERVE .
DO YOU NORMALLY WHEN YOU RE TRAVELING DO YOU LOOK FOR PLACES THAT S ESTABLISHED THAT THAT YOU VE BEEN TO BEFORE OR .
YES .
ARE YOU WILLING TO TRY NEW PLACES .
OH WE TRY NEW PLACES BUT WHEN WE A LOT OF TIMES WE DO EAT WHERE WE KNOW .
YEAH LIKE .
WHAT .
A CHAIN RESTAURANT .
UHHUH .
OR SOMETHING .
WHAT THE QUALITY BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM ARE THE SAME NO MATTER WHERE YOU STOP .
UHHUH .
AND UH WE DO DO THAT A LOT AND I GUESS I M GETTING OLD OLDER ALSO I LIKE TO BE SERVED I LIKE TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE MY UH ORDER TAKEN .
AS OPPOSED TO LIKE A CAFETERIA .
RIGHT YEAH .
KIND OF SITUATION YEAH .
SO I SUPPOSE YOU D SAY I WELL I I DO NT KNOW WHETHER IT S AGE OR WHAT IT IS BUT I HAVE .
WELL NO I DO NT THINK SO I THINK IT S JUST YOUR BECAUSE I I PREFER TO BE WAITED ON TOO I JUST IF YOU RE GOING TO GO OUT TO EAT WHY NOT HAVE THE WHOLE SERVICE .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
WHY NOT GET THE WHOLE I GUESS BECAUSE WE DO NT GO OUT THAT MUCH .
UHHUH .
I FEEL LIKE IT S A TREAT .
YOU SHOULD FEE HAVE A TREAT .
YEAH .
AND I LIKE THE LIGHT MEALS NOT ALL RESTAURANTS HAVE LIGHT MEALS ON THEIR MENU .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND I .
OH LIGHT MENU YOU MEAN LIKE COOKED LIGHT OR .
UH L I T E LIKE UH UH THINGS THAT ARE NT AS HEAVY A MEAL .
OH I SEE .
IT .
UHHUH .
THAT YOU GET MORE UH FRUIT AND MAYBE COTTAGE CHEESE OR A CHICKEN BREAST OR THINGS THAT ARE NT AS UH THEY RE NOT BREADED AND THEY RE NOT FRIED AND THEY RE NOT .
NOT A LOT OF GRAVY .
YEAH .
AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
UH BUT IT S NOT .
YOU KNOW I .
ALL REST .
I LIKE THOSE TOO .
UHHUH .
I LIKE THOSE TOO BECAUSE UH SOME SEEMS LIKE SOMETIMES IT S YOU ORDER A MEAL YOU ORDER THEIR DINNER MEAL AND IT S LIKE THEY RE TRYING TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH YOU CAN EAT OR .
I KNOW .
OR .
IT S TOO MUCH YES .
OR OR LIKE EVIDENTLY PEOPLE GO IN THERE AND THEY RE NOT SATISFIED THAT THEY D BEEN GIVEN ENOUGH AND THEY COMPLAIN AND .
UHHUH .
MAYBE THEY RE AFRAID THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO .
COMPLAIN OR SOMETHING .
I DO NT KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT NOW FOR INSTANCE WE WE HAD A SCOUT DINNER LAST NIGHT WE WENT TO AND IT S IT S THEY UH WELL THEY LL SERVE YOU AT YOUR SEAT AND U USUALLY THE SALAD BAR IS INCLUDED SO YOU HAVE TO GET UP FOR THAT BUT THEY HAVE SO MUCH FOOD THAT YOU NOT MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY TO RESTRAIN YOURSELF YOU END UP EATING MUCH MORE THAN YOU NEED .
UHHUH AND I THINK THAT S A SHAME .
UHHUH .
I MEAN I MUST ADMIT SOMETIMES I DO LIKE A BUFFET BUT UH BUT I THINK THAT THEY JUST TEND TO MAKE YOU YOU SAY OH WELL I VE HAVE GOT ALL I CAN EAT .
UHHUH .
OR OR YOU KNOW IT S ONE OF THESE SITUATIONS WHERE NOBODY S GOING TO RESTRAIN WHAT YOU EAT .
UHHUH .
THE AMOUNT THAT YOU EAT .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK THAT PEO THAT WE JUST TEND TO EAT OVEREAT .
YEAH YOU CAN EAT .
YEAH .
AS MUCH AS YOU WANT AND YOU LIKE THE FOOD YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
UH A LOT OF TIMES THE FOODS LIKE UH HAAS S CARRY A BREAD BAR THAT IS JUST OUT OF THIS WORLD AND YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
YOU AND SOUP AND UH THEY JUST AND FRUIT AND VEGETABLES AND THEY THEY JUST I DO NT KNOW TH Y I KNOW I ALWAYS OVEREAT NO MATTER I GO WITH GOOD INTENTIONS .
BUT I SOMEHOW ALONG THE WAY WHEN I COME BACK TO MY SEAT I HAVE TOO MUCH AND I EAT IT BECAUSE IT S SO GOOD .
YEAH WELL AT LEAST IT S FRUIT AND STUFF THERE .
YEAH .
MAYBE IT S NOT TOO BAD .
AND I LIKE REASONABLE PRICES OF COURSE TOO I DO NT LIKE TO YOU KNOW GO TO ANYTHING THAT S REAL EXPENSIVE .
YEAH .
I THINK THAT S A WASTE OF MY MONEY .
JUST FOR FOOD .
UHHUH .
IT DOES SEEM LIKE IT .
UHHUH .
YEAH BUT UH .
SO .
WE LIKE UH WE DO LIKE INTERNATIONAL FOOD SO WE TAKE .
DO YOU .
I LIKE CU WE LIKE INDIAN FOOD .
UHHUH .

I I REALLY LIKE EATING THERE AND AND YOU DO NT GET STUFFED ON THEIR FOOD IT SEEMS .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW YOU CAN EAT A WHOLE BIG PLATE OF THEIR FOOD AND YOU REALLY DO NT FEEL LIKE YOU VE EATEN TOO MUCH .
YOU RE FULL YOU KNOW YOU RE SATISFIED .
YEAH .
BUT YOU DO NT FEEL STUFFED AND MISERABLE .
YEAH YEAH THAT S ONE THING THAT I WISH WE HAD MORE OF UH BECAUSE WHERE WE RE FROM IT S IT S PRETTY LIMITED AND IT S MOST OF THE RESTAURANTS ARE OH THEY TEND TO BE YOU KNOW AMERICAN STYLE FOOD .
UHHUH .
AND WE DO NT HAVE TOO MANY W YOU HAVE TO GO ALL THE WAY TO DALLAS .
UM .
AND SO IT REALLY IS A TREAT .
UH YEAH .
BECAUSE UH .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW WE DO NT MAKE A TRIP SIXTYFIVE EIGHTY YOU KNOW SIXTYFIVE TO EIGHTY MILES DEPENDING HOW FAR IN DALLAS IT IS .
YEAH .
WHAT KIND OF A CAR DO YOU DRIVE NOW .
I DRIVE A HONDA PRELUDE .
DO YOU .
I DRIVE A HONDA ACCORD .
OH YEAH .
YEAH .
I BOUGHT MINE A YEAR AGO SO I M NOT BUYING A CAR .
ANY TIME SOON .
YEAH ME EITHER .
I JUST BOUGHT MINE UH IT WILL BE A YEAR IN AUGUST .
YEAH .
I LOVE IT THOUGH .
I LOVE HONDAS .
YEAH .
IT .
I THINK I FOUND MY CAR .
WELL I I LIKE WHERE ALL THE CONTROLS ARE .
RIGHT .
THEY RE THEY RE IN GOOD SPOTS AND I I HAVE AN AUTOMATIC I CA NT DRIVE A STANDARD .
OH REALLY .
YEAH .
I HAVE A STANDARD .
BUT UM I IT S AN .
IT S SUPPOSEDLY REAL RELIABLE THE ONLY THING .
I VE EVER HEARD ABOUT HONDAS IS THAT THE BREAKS GO OUT FIRST .
OH REALLY .
YEAH .
I HAD NT HEARD THAT .
YEAH .
WHAT DID YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU BOUGHT THAT .
I HAD A BUICK REGAL .
DID YOU .
YEAH .
I HAD UH A MAZDA R X SEVEN BEFORE THAT AND THAT WAS THE WORSE CAR .
I VE EVER DRIVEN IN MY LIFE .
THE BUICK WAS WAS GREAT .
IT WAS NINE YEARS OLD AND IT .
REALLY .
WAS STILL GOING STRONG .
THE ONLY PROBLEMS I HAD WITH IT IN THE NINE YEARS THAT I OWNED IT I HAD TO REPLACE THE COMPRESSOR WHEN IT WAS ABOUT SEVEN YEARS OLD .
REALLY .
AND THAT WAS THE ONLY MAJOR PROBLEM THAT I HAD I MEAN I HAD LIKE LITTLE PIDDLY THINGS LIKE .
YEAH .
I HAD TO REPLACE THE MUFFLER AND I HAD REPLACED THE TIRES AND UH SEEMS LIKE IT HAD A RADIATOR LEAK ONCE .
BUT I NEVER HAD ANY MAJOR .
ANYTHING .
RIGHT .
OTHER THAN THE COMPRESSOR .
I REALLY NEVER HAD ANYTHING MAJOR WITH MY MAZDA BUT IT WAS A STANDARD ALSO AND THE CLUTCH WENT OUT ON IT TOWARD THE END I HAD IT .
FIVE YEARS AND THE LAST YEAR LAST TWO YEARS .
IT SEEMED TO GO OUT REALLY EASILY .
I THINK IT WENT OUT TWICE IN TWO YEARS AND THAT S THAT S A LOT .
IT SHOULD NT GO OUT THAT MUCH .
HUHUH .
AND SO I WENT AHEAD AND BOUGHT ANOTHER STANDARD WHEN I BOUGHT THE HONDA BUT I DO NT THINK I M GOING TO DO THAT AGAIN .
I THINK I M GOING BACK TO AUTOMATIC NOW .
WELL I NEVER WELL I .
KIND OF KNOW HOW TO DRIVE STANDARD BUT I VE NEVER OWNED ONE SO I HAD NT I DO NT DRIVE ONE A LOT .
RIGHT .
SO I DO NT FEEL COMFORTABLE IN TRAFFIC WITH IT .
RIGHT .
AND FOR EVERYTHING .
I VE HEARD IT S A LOT EASIER TO SELL AN AUTOMATIC .
YEAH IT IS .
AND .
THAT S TRUE .
AND RESALE VALUE IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME .
YEAH IT IS ME TOO THAT S WHY I GOT THE HONDA .
YEAH .
HONDAS HAVE GREAT RESALE VALUE .
YEAH .
THE MAZDA DEFINITELY DID NOT .
NOT AT ALL .
THEY RE WORSE THAN AMERICAN CARS I THINK OR JUST AS BAD AS FAR AS RESALE GOES .
I DID PRETTY WELL WITH MY UH REGAL BECAUSE IT WAS IN REALLY GOOD SHAPE BUT .
YEAH .
IT STILL LOOKED REAL NICE THE THE INTERIOR WAS STILL REALLY NICE THERE WAS NT CRACKS ALL OVER THE DASH BOARD AND STUFF .
RIGHT .
AND IT HAD SOME SOME NICE FEATURES .
SO I ENDED UP OKAY WITH THE BUICK .
GOOD .
AND I ANTICIPATE THE SAME THING WITH THE HONDA WHENEVER I DECIDE TO SELL IT OF COURSE I MAY NEVER SELL IT .
RIGHT .
I MAY DRIVE IT UNTIL IT S DEAD BUT .
YEAH .
THAT S WHAT .
I DID WITH THE MAZDA DRIVE IT UNTIL THE UNTIL THE CLUTCH WENT OUT AND THE WHEELS FELL OFF .
YEAH .
SO PROBABLY WHAT .
I LL DO AGAIN .
YEAH .
BUT I REALLY LIKE THE HONDAS .
I LIKE FOREIGN CARS .
UHHUH .
A LOT .
WELL .
I LOOKED AT THE MITSUBISHI GALANT .
I WAS LOOKING FOR A FOUR DOOR CAR HAVING DRIVEN THE R X SEVEN SO LONG .
UHHUH .
AND IT WAS SO SMALL AND IT S REALLY IMPRACTICAL .
SO I WANTED SOMETHING WITH A REAL TRUNK AND FOUR DOORS .
SOMETHING EASY TO GET IN AND OUT OF AND I LOOKED AT THE GALANT AND THOSE WERE REALLY NICE AND I CAN GET THEM FOR A GREAT PRICE .
YEAH .
BUT I FOUND IT HARD TO DEAL WITH THE THE DEALERSHIP .
I WAS GOING THROUGH .
OH .
SO THAT S HOW I ENDED UP WITH A HONDA .
I WAS NT EVEN LOOKING FOR A CAR WHEN I BOUGHT THIS CAR .
I UH I WAS THINKING ABOUT BUYING A PRELUDE FROM A FRIEND .
WHO WAS MOVING TO NEW YORK OR SOMETHING SO AND SHE WAS GOING TO SELL HER CAR BECAUSE SHE DID NT NEED IT ANYMORE AND IT WAS ONLY LIKE A YEAR OLD AND I HAD NEVER DRIVEN UH A PRELUDE .
SO I WENT TO A DEALERSHIP BECAUSE THEY HAD LIKE UH THE SAME YEAR AND SAME MODEL .
RIGHT .
OF PRELUDE ON THEIR USED CAR LOT AND I WENT AND I TEST DROVE IT AND YOU KNOW I JUST FELL IN LOVE .
OH YEAH .
WITH THIS BRAND NEW WHITE PRELUDE UH YOU KNOW .
THEY RE NICE I THINK .
TWO LITER S I WITH THE SUN ROOF AND THE MOON ROOF AND I .
OH YEAH .
BOUGHT IT LOADED .
OH YEAH .
I HAVE TO HAVE THEM LOADED .
OH .
UM I LOVE ALL THOSE LITTLE THINGS THAT YOU DO NT NEED BUT THEY RE SO WONDERFUL .
YEAH .
I WENT THERE LOOKING AT A USED CAR AND TWO DAYS LATER I BOUGHT THIS CAR .
I FELT LIKE I FELT LIKE THAT WAS THE WORST IMPULSE THAT WAS THAT WAS LARGEST IMPULSE THAT I .
THAT I HAD EVER MADE .
THE OTH THE TWO .
I UNDERSTAND .
OTHER THINGS THAT I BOUGHT ON IMPULSE ARE A V C R AND A WASHER .
AND DRYER .
I GO FOR THE BIG STUFF .
YEAH .
I NOTICED .
MINE WAS DEFINITELY NOT IMPULSE I REALLY NEEDED A NEW CAR .
MINE WAS JUST IT WAS GETTING WORN OUT I GUESS FROM BEING A SPORTS CAR .
I DROVE IT .
KIND OF HARD .
OH .
AND I GOT IT RIGHT AFTER HIGH SCHOOL .
SO BY THE TIME .
I TRADED IT IN IT WAS READY .
YEAH .
I GOT .
READY TO GO .
I GOT MY BUICK AS A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION GIFT .
DID YOU .
YEAH .
BUT I I GUESS THIS WAS NT REALLY AN IMPULSE I MEAN BUYING IT RIGHT THEN AND YOU KNOW RIGHT QUICKLY WAS KIND OF IMPULSIVE BUT I D BEEN THINKING ABOUT BUYING A NEW CAR FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS AND I WAS JUST SCARED TO .
RIGHT .
I WAS SCARED TO START TAKING ON PAYMENTS BECAUSE THE BUICK WAS LONG SINCE PAID FOR .
RIGHT .
THAT S THE SAME WITH ME .
WOULD YOU EVER BUY A USED CAR FOR A NEW CAR FOR YOURSELF .
BUY A WHA AR YOU .
LIKE .
BUY A USED CAR .
RIGHT .
SURE .
I I WAS GOING TO BUY ONE ONCE BUT I JUST I WORRY ABOUT WHO S DRIVEN THEM AND WHAT .
THEY VE BEEN THROUGH AND THE WARRANTIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
YEAH .
JUST I CA NT SEEM TO GET OVER THAT .
THAT JUST BOTHERS ME .
I DO NT KNOW WHY .
WELL UM LIKE ON HONDAS THEY SUPPOSEDLY THE MAINTENANCE RECORDS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE REGISTERED WITH HONDA OR WHATEVER AND YOU CAN REQUEST WHATEVER MAINTENANCE RECORDS EXIST ON CARS AND YOU CAN HAVE THEM CHECKED OUT BY MECHANICS AND STUFF .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
I MEAN THEY CA NT STOP YOU FROM DOING IT .
HOPING THAT THEY DO GO TO A HONDA DEALERSHIP TO GET THEM SERVICED .
YEAH .
YEAH .
WELL AND EVEN IF THEY DID NT YOU CAN STILL GET A GOOD IDEA FROM A IF YOU CAN GET A GOOD MECHANIC TO .
YEAH .
CHECK IT OVER REAL CAREFULLY AND CHECK THE BLOCK AND EVERYTHING .
THAT S TRUE .
SO .
WELL I GUESS THAT S ALL .
OKAY .
WELL I ENJOYED TALKING TO YOU .
I ENJOYED TALKING TO YOU .
BYEBYE .
BYEBYE .
OKAY .
WHERE TO START .
WELL I THINK UH I HAVE NT HAD THAT MUCH OF COURSE .
I JUST HEARD BUT I HAVE NT HAD THAT MUCH TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT EITHER .
I GUESS THE UH BIGGEST THING .
I F FIND IS THE FINANCIAL .
UHHUH .
ASPECTS UH PARTICULARLY THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO ACCESS YOU KNOW YOUR FINANCIAL RECORDS OR FOR EXAMPLE YOUR CREDIT UH RATING .
UHHUH .
ALMOST AT WILL .
THAT S TRUE .
I DID NT THINK ABOUT THAT .
AND UH OF COURSE FLYING UH USING YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER OF COURSE PERMITS PEOPLE TO DO THAT .
UHHUH .
AND ALMOST ANYTHING .
YOU DO NOW A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER IS REQUIRED .
UHHUH .
AND UH OF COURSE .
THERE S ANOTHER ASPECT OF THIS TOO UH IN TERMS OF INVASION OF PRIVACY .
I JUST THOUGHT ABOUT IT BEING A PROFESSIONAL AND OF COURSE YOU PROBABLY BELONG TO ONE OR MORE PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND THAT IS THAT SOME OF THE ORGANIZATIONS SELL THEIR MAILING LISTS .
UHHUH .
WHICH .
I THINK IS A IS AN INVASION OF PRIVACY .
I AGREE .
YES I GET SOME OF THESE THINGS IN THE MAIL THAT I WONDER WHERE IN THE WORLD DID THEY GET MY ADDRESS OR WHERE DID THEY GET MY NAME .
UHHUH .
AND IN FACT SOME OF THESE THINGS I GET SOME OF THESE QUESTIONNAIRES IT S FUNNY BECAUSE I M I WAS IN THE PROCESS OF FILLING ONE OUT WHEN I DECIDED I WOULD MAKE THIS PHONE CALL BUT UH I HAVE NT GOT TO THE END OF IT YET WHERE IT ASKS ALL THAT SALARY INFORMATION AND EVERYTHING BUT WHEN YOU HAVE TO SEND THAT BACK IN THE MAIL WITH YOUR NAME ON IT YOUR SALARY INFORMATION I I JUST HAVE A REAL HARD TIME DOING THAT UH AND THEY ASK YOU .
WHAT TYPE OF HOUSEHOLD ITEMS DO YOU OWN LIKE STEREOS AND T V S AND V C R S AND AND YOU HATE TO SEND SOMETHING OFF WITH YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS AND WHAT TYPES OF THINGS DO YOU OWN AND WHAT KIND OF MONEY DO YOU MAKE AND YOU WONDER WELL WHO S GOING TO GET AHOLD OF THIS AND THINK UM THAT S A NICE PLACE TO GO ROB .
AND NOT ONLY THAT IT IT OPENS YOU TO PHONE SOLICITATIONS .
RIGHT .
AND I I VE NOTICED MORE AND MORE I WOULD SAY OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS .
UHHUH .
I AM GETTING MORE AT HOME PHONE SOLICITATIONS .
UHHUH .
FOR A VARIETY OF THINGS FROM .
I GOT ONE TONIGHT ABOUT SIX THIRTY WHEN I SAT DOWN TO EAT DINNER CARPET CLEANING .
I VE HAD THEM FOR CARPET CLEANING I VE HAD THEM FOR OF COURSE FOR YOU KNOW REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW YOU GET UH PLEASE SEND IN YOUR UH YOU KNOW THIS PARTICULAR CARD AND YOU GET UH A FREE TRIP OR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES .
RIGHT .
AND SO THAT UH THAT BOTHERS ME BECAUSE I OF COURSE I ENJOY BEING AT HOME AND I DO NOT ENJOY GETTING CALLED BY STRANGERS .
UHHUH .
UH PARTICULARLY SOLICIT YOU KNOW SOLICITING .
SO G HAVING YOUR AND I KNOW THAT A LOT OF THESE OF COURSE ARE RANDOM PHONE CALLS .
UHHUH .
THEY JUST YOU KNOW START GOING THROUGH THE PHONE BOOK OR GOING THROUGH A SERIES OF NUMBERS BUT SOME OF THEM ARE SOLD AND I KNOW YOU TALKING ABOUT MAILING LISTS THE I THERE IS ONE .
PARTICULAR GROUP TO WHICH .
I BELONG AND FOR SOME THE REASON .
THEY HAVE THREE DIFFERENT NAMES .
UM .
FOR ME .
NOW THE ADDRESS IS THE SAME .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW MY MY OFFICE ADDRESS .
BUT THEY HAVE ONE UNDER YOU KNOW MY FIRST NAME JAMES .
THEY HAVE ONE UNDER MY FIRST NAME AND INITIAL .
UHHUH .
MIDDLE INITIAL THEN THEY HAVE A A THIRD ONE UNDER MY JUST MY TWO INITIALS .
UHHUH .
AND AND I GET MAIL .
UHHUH .
HERE AT HOME UNDER EACH OF THOSE NAMES .
OH NO .
SO I KNOW THAT THEY HAVE SOLD THEIR MAILING LIST .
RIGHT .
AND UH I THINK THOSE TWO THINGS BOTHER ME MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE .
YEAH .
AS FAR AS AN INVASION OF PRIVACY .
AND UH I CA NT REALLY THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE OFFHAND THAT UH .
I THINK I DISLIKE THE PHONE NUMBER PART .
THE WORST .
I MEAN IT S IT S ONE THING TO GET JUNK MAIL BECAUSE YOU CAN YOU CAN JUST PUT IT RIGHT IN THE TRASH BUT IT S THE PHONE CALLS AND YOU KNOW USUALLY WHEN THEY CALL YOU IT S GOING TO BE WHEN YOU .
S RIGHT WHEN YOU SIT DOWN TO DINNER BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY PRETTY MUCH KNOW THAT YOU RE AT WORK .
ALL DAY AND THEY CALL YOU RIGHT WHEN WHEN YOU VE JUST GOTTEN HOME FROM WORK .
THE LAST THING .
YOU WANT IS A PHONE CALL UNLESS IT S YOU KNOW SOMETHING HALFWAY ENJOYABLE BUT IF IT S A SALESPERSON IT S JUST SOMETHING .
YOU DO NT WANT TO HAVE TO MESS WITH .
AND AND I VE GOTTEN A LOT OF THEM LATELY OR I LL SOMETIMES I COME HOME FROM WORK AND THERE S A LOT OF HANG UPS ON MY ANSWERING MACHINE AND I M JUST ASSUMING IT S PROBABLY A SALESMAN .
THAT CALLED DURING THE DAY AND I WAS NT HOME AND THEY LL PROBABLY CALL ME UP AND YOU KNOW CALL ME BACK AND BOTHER ME WHEN I SIT DOWN TO DINNER LATER ON BUT .
UHHUH .
I FIND THAT VERY ANNOYING .
THE UH MAIL STUFF YEAH YOU KNOW IT S KIND OF IRRITATING BUT IT S NOT NEARLY AS OBNOXIOUS AS THE PHONE CALLS .
I THINK I THINK YOU MENTIONING THE PHONE CALLS DURING DINNER .
I KNOW WHEN I SIT DOWN WITH THE FAMILY AND WANT TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY YOU KNOW TO TALK .
UHHUH .
AND SEE WHAT S GOING ON AND ALL THOSE THINGS EVEN IF FRIENDS CALL .
UHHUH .
IT IRRITATES ME .
YEAH .
SO I TRY TO I ACTUALLY DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME FROM YOU KNOW USUALLY FROM SIX OCLOCK OR SIX THIRTY WHENEVER I GET HOME UNTIL EIGHT OR SO I WILL SHUT OFF THE PHONE .
UHHUH .
AND UH MY DAUGHTER GETS IRATE .
UHHUH .
WHEN I WHEN I DO THAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW SHE S A TEENAGER .
UH OH .
SO SHE LL YOU KNOW WHY ARE YOU CUTTING OFF THE PHONE .
I MIGHT GET AN IMPORTANT PHONE CALL BUT .
RIGHT .
SO THO I GUESS THOSE THREE THINGS ARE THE UH UH MOST IRRITATING TO ME .
UHHUH .
I AGREE WITH THE PHONE TOO IN THAT I M SINGLE BUT WHEN I COME HOME FROM WORK THERE .
S TIMES I NEED TO PAY BILLS I NEED TO BALANCE MY CHECKING ACCOUNT I NEED TO DO ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT AND EVEN THOUGH IT S FRIENDS CALLING SOMETIMES YOU JUST FEEL LIKE THIS IS MY QUIET TIME I NEED TO GET THINGS DONE AND THE PHONE RINGING BOTHERS ME BUT THAT S THAT S WHERE ANSWERING MACHINES ARE NICE BECAUSE IF IT S REALLY IMPORTANT THEY LL LEAVE A MESSAGE AND I CAN CALL THEM BACK .
THAT S RIGHT .
BUT UH AT WORK .
I HAVE SO MANY PHONE CALLS FROM CUSTOMERS CALLING IN SOMETIMES IT IS JUST I JUST WANT TO GET AWAY FROM THE PHONE RINGING BECAUSE IT IT REALLY DOES ANNOY ME .
AND UH IF I VE HAD A LOT OF PHONE CALLS DURING THE DAY WHEN OCCASIONALLY WHEN WE HAVE UH LIKE THIS PAST WEEK WE HAVE TO DO A LOT OF TROUBLESHOOTING WHEN THE PROGRAMMERS HAVE INSTALLED A NEW SYSTEM AND UH PHONE RINGS LIKE CRAZY AND YOU COME HOME AND THE LAST THING .
YOU WANT TO DO IS HAVE TO ANSWER THE PHONE .
AND IF IT S SOME SALESMAN THAT JUST MAKES IT EVEN THAT MUCH WORSE .
AND UH IT JUST I GET TO WHERE I I TURN THE ANSWERING MACHINE ON AND JUST LET IT PICK UP THE PHONE BUT NOW WITH THIS THING .
I M PARTICIPATING IN I .
KIND OF HAVE TO ANSWER IT BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW IF IT S THE SWITCHBOARD OR IF IT S UH YOU KNOW SOMEBODY CALLING THAT YOU REALLY DO NT WANT TO TALK ON THE PHONE .
WELL I HAVE NOW WE HAVE A YOU KNOW VOICE MAIL SYSTEM AT UH AT THE OFFICE .
UHHUH .
NOW WHAT .
I HAVE DONE IS I HAVE FORWARDED MY HOME PHONE .
UHHUH .
TO THE ANSWERING SERVICE AT THE OFFICE .
UHHUH .
SO THAT I DO NOT HAVE TO HAVE A UH .
A RING AT ALL .
A RING AT ALL .
OH HUH .
THAT S AN IDEA .
IF I IF I WANT TO DO THAT .
RIGHT .
AND UH OR I WILL JUST LET THE PHONE RING THREE OR FOUR TIMES AND KNOW THAT IT WILL FORWARD TO UH TO THE OFFICE .
UHHUH .
AND SO IT S YOU KNOW IT MAKES IT CONVENIENT .
BUT AT THE OFFICE WHEN I YOU KNOW WE CAN UH ON OUR SYSTEM AND I IMAGINE ON MOST SYSTEMS YOU CAN JUST ROUTE IT DIRECTLY TO THE ANSWERING SERVICE .
YEAH .
OURS IS THAT WAY TOO .
AND WHEN I WHEN I WANT TO BE YOU KNOW NOT BOTHERED DURING THE DAY THAT S EXACTLY WHAT .
I DO .
UHHUH .
AND SO UH .
WELL YOURS IS PROBABLY THE SAME AS OURS .
IT .
S UH TIGON IS NT TIGON UH PART OF G T E OR VICE VERSA OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
UH .
SEEMS I READ .
YEAH WELL TIGON IS PART OF G T E .

THEY WERE BOTH INTERESTED IN THINGS LIKE MODEL ROCKETS SO WE WOULD GO TO THE FOOTBALL FIELD AND SET OFF MODEL ROCKETS .
I HAVE TWO BOYS ALSO .
UH MY CHILDREN ARE UM ARE SWIMMERS AND SO AS THEY WERE GROWING UP MUCH OF UH OUR UM NORMAL LIFE OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL AND EVERYTHING .
AROU UH REVOLVED AROUND THEIR SWIMMING .
UHHUH .
SO IN ORDER TO HAVE A REASON FOR BEING THERE ESPECIALLY AS THEY GOT OLDER I BECAME INVOLVED IN IT TOO SO WE WERE ALWAYS TOGETHER AT THEIR MEETS .
OH WELL THAT S GOOD .
UM MINE WERE NOT TERRIBLY SPORTING .
UHHUH .
UH THEY .
BOTH DID TBALL AND SOCCER IN GRADE SCHOOL .

ONE OF THEM CARRIED ON UH THE SPORTS AFTER THAT .
YEAH THE THE BOYS TRIED THOSE BUT THEY .
W THEY DID GO IN THEY STARTED SWIMMING WHEN THEY WERE OH SEVEN AND EIGHT AND THEY REALLY LOVED IT AND THEY RE SWIMMING BOTH C THEY LL BE ONE IS IN COLLEGE ALSO SWIMS IN COLLEGE AND THE OTHER WILL CONTINUE TO SWIM IN COLLEGE AND THEY RE FORTUNATE THEY MA EVEN MADE NATIONALS .
OH WONDERFUL .
OH THAT S GREAT .
AND SO WE WOULD DRIVE UP TO SEE THAT WHEN W WHENEVER IT WAS REASONABLY CLOSE BUT WE DID A LOT OF THINGS UM AND WE TRIED TO DO THINGS .
BOTH TOGETHER AND INDIVIDUALLY WITH THE CHILDREN UM .
YEAH I .
WE LIVE NEAR WASHINGTON SO WE WE WOULD ALWAYS GO IN FOR THE MUSEUMS .
SURE .
THAT S ALWAYS A BIG UH THING .
AND ONE OF MY CHILDREN IS UH ALSO A MUSICIAN SO UM ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID WITH HIM .
A LOT WAS TO GO EITHER MY HUSBAND OR I OR BOTH OF US WOULD T CONCERTS WITH HIM .
UHHUH .
AND MY OTHER CHILD UM UH IS IN BIG INTO TROPICAL FISH .
UH .
SO OUR WHOLE FAMILY WE TAKE FAMILY TRIPS TO DIFFERENT PLACES TO VISIT FISH STORES OR GO TO FISH SHOWS SO .
MY GOODNESS UH .
WELL WE DID NT HAVE ANY UH AVID UH ACTIVITIES LIKE THAT .
THEY THEY WERE INTERESTED IN A LOT OF THINGS BUT NOTHING TO QUITE THAT DEPTH I GUESS .
BUT WE WOULD .
MUMBLEX I DO NT THINK WE VE WE VE MISSED A FISH STORE ON THE ENTIRE EAST NORTHEAST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES .
OH MY GOODNESS .
WELL WE DID GO TO THINGS LIKE AQUARIUMS AND UH .
UHHUH .
UH NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUMS AND ZOOS AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT ONE DOES WITH KIDS UH .
YES .
IN FACT IT S FUNNY OUR VACATIONS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN UM UH UH AS AS THEY VE GOTTEN OLDER .
WHEN THEY WERE YOUNGER WE WOULD GO TO THE BEACH BUT AS THEY GOT OLDER WE TRIED TO PATTERN OUR VACATIONS WHERE WE WOULD TRAVEL AND DO THINGS .
UHHUH .
AND THAT THERE WOULD BE A A FEATURE .
EACH DAY .
UH YES .
WHETHER IT WOULD BE GOING TO ONE SUMMER .
WE UH WE WENT UP TO NEW ENGLAND AND WE WENT TO THE MARBLE QUARRIES UP THERE AND UH .
OH REALLY .
TO SEE THAT AND ANOTHER DAY FISH HATCHERY AND .
YEAH .
SO WE DID YOU KNOW WE DID TRY AND OF COURSE .
WE LEARNED TOO .
YEAH .
BUT UH AND UH I DO NT KNOW I UH WHEN THEY WERE VERY YOUNG I DID NOT WORK .
YEAH WELL I STARTED WORKING HALFTIME WHEN UH THEY WERE AT THE NURSERY SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
BUT I MUMBLEX YET .
AND I I STARTED WORKING PARTTIME WHEN THEY WERE IN UM JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL AND NOW AND I WORKED IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM AND NOW I WORK A FULL SCHOOL DAY BUT THAT LEAVES ME OFF ON HOLIDAYS AND SUMMERS .
UHHUH .
SO IT WAS A IT WAS A YOU KNOW I THINK THEY NEED ME MORE .
YEAH .
WHEN THEY WERE OLDER THAN THEY DID WHEN THEY WERE .
WELL UH I THINK IT UH THEY NEED YOU IN DIFFERENT WAYS .
THAT S TRUE YEAH .
YOU WANT TO BE AROUND FOR THE CRISIS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND .
THAT S RIGHT .
BUT IT S NOT QUITE SO MUCH THE HANDHOLDING AND PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY MAKING .
UM YEAH THAT S THAT S FOR SURE .
THAT S FOR SURE WHAT DO YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY FEELINGS AS TO THE TRENDS THAT YOU SEE .
WELL IT .
LO O THE ONE TREND .
I WOULD SAY IS THAT WITH SO MANY MORE WOMEN CHOOSING PROFESSIONAL CAREERS .
UHHUH .
THERE ARE FEWER OF THEM .
HOME IN THE AFTERNOONS AND I DO NT THINK IT NEEDS TO BE THE MOTHERS BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE NICE IF SOME OF THE PARENTS WOULD BE AROUND FOR A FEW MORE HOURS .
YEAH WHEN THEY MUMBLEX YOU KNOW IT WAS FUNNY I CAN REMEMBER AND MY MOTHER AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT TO HOW IMPORTANT .
IT WAS WHEN I CAME HOME FROM SCHOOL .
UM .
IT .
WAS NT REALLY CONVERSATION BUT THERE WERE ALWAYS THINGS .
THAT JUST TUMBLED OUT .
YES .
AND UH UH GRANTED THE CHILD DOES NT ALWAYS THINK THAT THEY RE SHARING IT BUT IT WHEN THEY WHEN IT S NOT THERE THEY MISS IT .
I THINK THAT S TRUE BUT I D I ALSO THINK THAT S AT LEAST IN MY EXPERIENCE TRUER OF GIRLS THAN BOYS .
UHHUH .
EVEN WHEN I WAS THERE MY BOYS DID NT SHARE ALL THAT MUCH WITH ME AND CERTAINLY NOT TO THE EXTENT .
I DID WITH MY MOTHER .
YEAH YEAH .
NO I I I REALIZE THAT BUT IT S FUNNY THEY DO NT ALWAYS DO IT BUT OCCASIONALLY THEY DO AND YOU WANT .
YEAH .
UHHUH .
AND WHEN THEY DO THERE S A REASON FOR IT THAT THEY RE SHARING IT .
UHHUH .
AND YOU WANT TO BE AVAIL AT LEAST I VE WANTED TO BE AVAILABLE WHEN THEY FOR SOME REASON THEY HAD THEY WERE BOUNCING SOMETHING OFF OF ME .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE IT WAS SOMETHING .
THAT WAS BOTHERING THEM OR THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT AND IT WAS UH YOU JUST FELT GEE IF I WERE NT HERE .
UHHUH .
HOW OR OR IF MY HUSBAND .
WHO WOULD THEY ASK .
THAT S RIGHT .
OR WHAT WOULD THEY DO .
YES THAT S EXACTLY RIGHT .
UH BUT IT HAS BEEN UM IT S BEEN INTERESTING AND PARTICULARLY I I THINK BECAUSE THE SOCIETY IN WHICH .
WE LIVE FAMILIES ARE SEPARATED .
YOU DO NT HAVE GRANDPARENTS NEAR BY OR AUNTS AND UNCLES .
UHHUH .
UM I MEAN I GREW UP IN A SITUATION WHERE ON WEEKENDS WE WERE ALWAYS VISITING RELATIVES .
YEAH WELL I DID TOO .
WE WERE CLOSE TO MY UH MATERNAL GRANDPARENTS I MEAN JUST A FEW MILES .
UHHUH .
AND UH CLOSE ENOUGH TO VISIT MY PATERNAL GRANDPARENTS YOU KNOW QUITE OFTEN .
YEAH YEAH .
THEY WERE FIFTY MILES AWAY BUT .
SEE AND WE RE UH THAT WE I I GREW UP WITH YOU KNOW EVERY WEEKEND .
THERE WAS SOME VISITING SOMEWHERE .
UHHUH .
UM AND IT WAS SORT OF AN ITALIAN FAMILY .
UM .
UM BUT MY CHILDREN WE ALTHOUGH WE HAVE SOME RELATIVES IN THE AREA THAT WE WE SEE WE THEY DO NT HA IT S NOT THAT CONSTANT .
RIGHT .
THING WHERE YOU ARE ON INTIMATE TERMS WITH COUSINS .
WELL WHEN MY KIDS WERE QUITE SMALL .
UHHUH .
UH WE LIVED CLOSE TO BOTH .
SETS OF GRANDPARENTS AND THEY SAW THEM .
A LOT BUT THEY DO NT HAVE ANY COUSINS UH OR THEY DID NT .
YEAH .
THEIR UH THEIR COUSINS ARE ABOUT TEN YEARS YOUNGER .
UHHUH .
SO UH THEY NEVER PLAYED TOGETHER OR ANYTHING .
YEAH .
AND I I JUST SORT OF THINK .
AND THERE ARE ONLY TWO OF THEM AND THEY DID NT LIVE IN THE SAME TOWN .
YEAH THAT THE TREND OF OF FAMILIES AND TIME WHERE WHERE PARENTS ARE SPENDING LESS TIME YOU DO NT HAVE THE FAMILIES TOO TO TAKE UP THE GAP .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND SO THE KIDS IN SOME WAYS ARE ARE ARE SUFFERING A LITTLE BIT IN THAT UH THE MODEL THE ROLE MODELS .
THAT GET THE THE THE FAMILY ISSUES .
THAT GET DISCUSSED .
YEAH .
AND ALL THESE I THINK ARE VERY IMPORTANT PARTS OF THEM GROWING UP .
UHHUH .
SO WE WE TRY TO TO DO IT AS WELL AS WE CAN .
WE KEEP IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH GRANDPARENTS AND TALK OVER THE PHONE .
UHHUH .
AND COUSINS AND AUNTS AND UNCLES AND WE DO BUT IT S ALTHOUGH IT S NOT THE SAME WE ARE AND THAT S PART OF I THINK TEACHING TOO IS WHAT .
A FAMILY IS LIKE BECAUSE THEN H HOW DO THEY PATTERN THEIR OWN .
WELL EVERYONE MAKES IT .
S OWN MODEL BUT UH I IT SEEMS THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOME CONTINUITY .
YEAH UM .
AND IT S HELPFUL TO HAVE UH THINGS .
THAT BECOME FAMILY TRADITIONS AND THAT SORT OF THING .
THAT S YEAH .
WELL WE VE ALWAYS WE HAVE HAD THIS TRADITION UM THAT WE ALWAYS GO OUT BEFORE CHRISTMAS AND CUT OUR OWN TREE .
UHHUH .
AND THAT S ALWAYS BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF A TRADITION THAT WE VE HAD .
NOW THIS YEAR IT S WAS HARD WITH OUR SON NOW BEING IN COLLEGE .
YEAH .
SO THIS WAS ONE THING THAT WE UM WERE NT ABLE TO DO THIS YEAR BUT WE DID THAT FOR E FROM THE TIME .
THE CHILDREN WERE YOUNG ENOUGH TO REALIZE WHAT .
IT WAS UNTIL UH OUR OLDER SON WENT AWAY TO COLLEGE .
OH WELL THAT S THE KIND OF THING THAT THEY WILL REMEMBER THOUGH .
AND WE HAVE ADVENT CALENDARS STILL .
UHHUH .
FROM THE TIME THAT THEY CAME YOU KNOW TO .
OURS FINALLY DISINTEGRATED .
OH .
WE HAD A FELT .
ONE .
THAT WAS LI IT WAS A CHRISTMAS TREE .
THAT HAD UH A LITTLE TRINKET FOR EACH DAY .
OH YES .
THAT WAS PINNED ON THE DATE .
THAT S UHHUH .
AND THEN YOU TOOK IT OFF AND PUT IT ON THE TREE SO AT THE END .
YOU HAD A DECORATED TREE .
WELL O OURS IS UH A FRIEND .
AND IT FINALLY GOT MOTHEATEN WE THREW IT .
WAY LAST YEAR .
UH A FRIEND OF MINE FROM DENMARK HAND APPLIQU3ED ONE FOR EACH CHILD .
HOW NICE .
AND I MEAN THEY LOOK TODAY AS NEW AS THEY DID WHEN THEY GAVE THEM TO SHE GAVE THEM TO US AND THERE S A RING AND YOU BUY A PRESENT .
OH I SEE .
AND YOU WRAP THE PRESENT UP AND I MEAN THE PRESENTS HAVE GONE FROM THE DAYS WHEN THEY WERE VERY YOUNG TO A LITTLE BOX OF BANDAIDS AND AN ERASER AND THINGS .
HOW CUTE .
TO TODAY WHERE UM SOMETIMES I PUT A LITTLE GIFT IF I SEE SOMETHING .
THAT .
S UH OCCASIONALLY A CHRISTMAS TREE DECORATION .
WHICH .
THEY WILL SAVE FOR THEIR THEIR FUTURE .
UHHUH .
TO SOMETIMES JUST MONEY .
YEAH .
UH PIECES OF CANDY .
SO I THINK AS THEY RE GETTING IN COLLEGE I JUST FOR MY OLDER BOY .
THAT WAS IN COLLEGE .
I PUT A DOLLAR BILL FOR EACH DAY .
WHICH WAS THE EQUIVALENT .
OH I M SURE HE APPRECIATED THAT .
WELL IT WAS THE EQUIVALENT OF A CHRISTMAS PRESENT .
UHHUH .
BUT IT WAS UH AND IT WAS AND YOU KNOW IT WAS FUN BUT THAT S A TRADITION AND THEY WILL THOSE WILL BE PASSED ON TO THEM WHEN THEY .
YEAH .
WHEN THEY GET MARRIED AND LEAVE .
WELL YOU WERE SAYING WHAT .
OTHER TRENDS ARE THERE AND ONE JUST OCCURRED TO ME BECAUSE I WAS EDITING A BOOK ABOUT IT RECENTLY .
UHHUH .
AND THAT IS THE TREND IN A LOT OF UH LOWER CLASS AREAS FOR THE GRANDMOTHERS TO BE RAISING THE CHILDREN .
YES YES .
AND THAT S A LOT OF IT IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE MOTHERS ARE ON DRUGS .
THE B YES AND THE BROKEN FAMILIES .
WE UM AS I SAID LIVING IN AN AREA OF WASHINGTON D C .
UHHUH .
WE DEFINITELY SEE THIS UH AND UH IT S THAT GRANDMOTHER FIGURE NOT ONLY RAISING HER OWN CHILDREN BUT RAISING UM CHILDREN FROM THE STREETS TOO FREQUENTLY .
RIGHT .
WELL WE HAD A SOCIOLOGIST AT THE CENTER WHERE I WORK WHO WAS WRITING A BOOK ON UH MULTIGENERATION .
UHHUH .
UM MATRIARCHIES IN A WAY .
UHHUH .
UH WHERE THE TRADITION IN THE FAMILY HAS BEEN FOR A TEENAGED DAUGHTER TO HAVE A BABY WHILE SHE S STILL LIVING AT HOME WITH THE MOTHER AND .
YES WELL THIS IS A THIS IS A SI UH THIS IS IN FACT UH WE VE BEEN STUDYING THIS IN OUR SCHOOL THAT UM THIS IS ONE OF THE SYMPTOMS OR NOT THE SYMPTOMS IT S ONE OF THE WAYS THAT YOUNG GIRLS FEEL THAT THEY ARE MATURING IT S A RITE OF PASSAGE .
YEAH .
DO YOU HAVE ANY PARTICULAR THOUGHTS ABOUT THE SCHOOL SYSTEM .
WELL UM I I THINK THAT IN IN UH RECENTLY WITH THE I M NOT SURE IF IT S MORE A PROBLEM WITH AMERICAN FAMILIES OR A PROBLEM WITH THE SCHOOL SYSTEM .
THEY SEEM TO BE BURDENING THE SCHOOL SYSTEM MORE AND MORE WITH PROBLEMS ANY PROBLEMS THAT A CHILD MIGHT HAVE WHETHER IT S ACTUALLY A SCHOOL RELATED THING OR NOT AND .
I .
I SAY AGREE WITH YOU .
A HUNDRED PERCENT THERE .
YEAH AND AND WELL IT S GOTTEN TO A POINT WHERE THE SCHOOLS ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING .
YEAH .
IF UH YOU VE SOME KID .
WHO DOES NT HAVE UH WHO S FROM A BROKEN FAMILY THE SCHOOLS ARE SUPPOSED TO FILL THAT VOID .
IT .
S GOTTEN WAY BEYOND TEACHING .
UH YOU KNOW TEACHING CLASSES .
YEAH .
AND MAYBE PROVIDING EXTRACURRICULAR SPORTS ACTIVITIES OR SOMETHING LIKE OH WERE KIND OF TRADITIONALLY THE SCHOOL S ROLES .
YEAH IT S INTERESTING BECAUSE UH WE RE JUST HAVING CONVERSATION ON THIS UH WITH A COUPLE OF PEOPLE YESTERDAY .
AND I WAS EXPRESSING MY FRUSTRATIONS .
THAT UH SOME OF THE SO MANY PROBLEMS I WORK IN A HIGH SCHOOL ARE THAT KIDS DO NT HAVE A A DEGREE OF SELFDISCIPLINE .
WHICH MAY BE REFLECTED IN SOCIETY AT LARGE .
UH AND YOU CA NT EXPECT IN A CLASSROOM FOR A PARTICULAR COURSE .
AN HOUR .
A DAY TO COUNTERACT UH SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN YEARS OF INFLUENCE AT HOME .
RIGHT .
UM AND IT S SEEN MORE SO BECAUSE WHEN YOU CALL PARENTS UP MANY PARENTS WO NT EVEN RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM AND I LL SAY THEY LL SAY OH WELL OUR KIDS MY KID I VE NEVER HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT THIS BEFORE .
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME .
THERE HAVE BEEN PROBLEMS .
AND AND YOU WONDER DO NT THESE PARENTS KNOW THAT TEACHERS TALK AND YOU KNOW WE DO CHECK WITH OTHER TEACHERS AND OTHER TEACHERS FIND THE SAME THINGS IN .
RIGHT .
THIS CHILD .
AND YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU TELL YOUR PARENT S THE PARENT HEY WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE .
RIGHT .
BUT UM IT IT IS A PROBLEM AND I M NOT SURE JUST UH HOW HOW THE SCHOOL SYSTEM COULD OPERATE IN A VACUUM ON IT .
YEAH .
WHETHER MAYBE THROUGH A COMMITMENT OF THE P T .
A UH AND THE PARENTS BEING INFORMED BETTER THAT IN FACT THAT THE PROBLEMS .
THAT ARE NATIONWIDE .
YEAH .
ARE PROBLEMS UM OF SOCIETY AND THAT THAT THE SCHOOL CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH ON IT .
WELL THEN THEN AGAIN WHEN YOU HAVE UH A SOCIETY WHERE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE PARENTS ARE UH DOING DRUGS IN THE HOME .
UHHUH .
UH EITHER UNEMPLOYED AND DO NT CARE ABOUT A UH JUST A HAVE THEIR OWN PROBLEMS .
YEAH YEAH .
HOW HOW DO YOU EXPECT THE SCHOOL TO UM OR HOW DO YOU EXPECT THE YOU CA NT REALLY EXPECT THAT PARENT .
WHO S QUITE FRANKLY .
THAT S RIGHT .
A LOSER IN LIFE AS IT IS .
UHHUH .
TO TO CARE ABOUT THE THE SITUATION WITH THEIR CHILD AND .
YOU KNOW WHAT SCARES ME TOO IS THAT WE HAVE YET TO SEE OTHER THE BIGGEST EFFECT OF THE CRACK CHILDREN .
RIGHT .
UH IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM .
THESE ARE CHILDREN .
THAT ARE BORN WITH LOW DEFICIT ATTENTION DEFICIT .
RIGHT .
AND GOSH WHAT S GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN THESE KIDS START COMING INTO THE SCHOOL SYSTEM .
THAT S REALLY SCARY .
YEAH .
BUT THERE ARE I THINK THERE ARE A COUPLE OF AREAS WHERE THE SCHOOL SYSTEM CAN IMPROVE AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I SEE .
TOO MANY TIMES STUDENTS GET DIAGNOSED AS MO SLOW LEARNERS AND IN FACT .
THEY RE NOT .
THEY RE BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS .
RIGHT .
AND SO THEY GET PUT IN IN IN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM IN A CLASS .
THAT S LIMITED FOR SKILLS CHILDREN .
UHHUH .
THAT HAVE REALLY HAVE TO MASTER SKILLS .
AND THAT S NOT THEIR PROBLEM .
UM AT THE SAME TIME I VE SEEN WE WE HAVE A AN INTERNATIONAL POPULATION .
THERE S NO BRIDGE AREA FOR STUDENTS COMING OUT OF THE E S O L WHICH IS ENGLISH FOR SPEAKERS OF OTHER LANGUAGES .
UHHUH .
PROGRAM .
THE ONCE THEY RE PAST E S O L THEY GET OUT THEY GOT THROWN RIGHT INTO THE TOTAL MAINSTREAM .
RIGHT .
AND UH THERE REALLY NEEDS TO BE A BRIDGE SOME SORT OF TRANSITION .
RIGHT .
FOR THAT .
SO THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS CAN IMPROVE BOTH IN STANDING UP FOR SPLITTING CLASSES YOU KNOW HAVING LEARNING DIS LEARNING SLOW SLOW CHILDREN IN SLOW CLASSES BUT NOT MIXING THEM WITH BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS .
RIGHT .
AND THEN YOU KNOW THE CASE WHERE THEY PUT THE BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS IN THE AVERAGE CLASSES YOU GET THESE KIDS .
THAT ARE AVERAGE STUDENTS BUT HIGHLY MOTIVATED .
RIGHT .
AND THEN YOU THROW IN KIDS .
THAT ARE NOT MOTIVATED MAYBE BRIGHT BUT THEY RE DISCIPLINE PROBLEMS .
AND YOU SOMETIMES THE AVERAGE CLASSES REALLY ARE PROBLEMS .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE YOU VE GOT SUCH A MIXED BAG THERE .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW THE GIFTED AND TALENTED ARE FAST CLASSES .
THERE S REALLY NOT THAT MUCH OF A PROBLEM WITH .
BUT IT S .
WELL I I VE SEEN MORE UH INCREDIBLY INTELLIGENT UNDERACHIEVERS THAN .
UHHUH .
THAN UH I PERSONALLY I WILL I WOULD TAKE A PERSON .
WHO S MOTIVATED AND A LITTLE UH LESS INTELLIGENT .
THAT S YEAH .
THAN THE PERSON .
WHO UH IS ONE OF THESE .
VERY INTELLIGENT PEOPLE .
WHO JUST KIND OF IS NT MOTIVATED TO DO ANYTHING .
I REMEMBER I HAD A COLLEGE PROFESSOR .
WHO ONCE SAID THAT GENIUS IS ONE PERCENT INSPIRATION AND NINETYNINE PERCENT PERSPIRATION .
YEAH .
WELL I NOT TO TOOT MY OWN HORN HERE OR ANYTHING BUT I I WAS GRADUATED FROM MY HIGH SCHOOL I WAS THE VALEDICTORIAN AND I KNOW .
UHHUH .
THAT THERE WERE A LOT OF KIDS .
THAT WERE AN AWFUL LOT SMARTER THAN ME AND THEY PROVED OUT LATE WHEN IT CAME TIME TO TAKE THE S .
A T S .
MINE WERE .
UHHUH .
GOOD BUT THEY WERE NT GREAT .
UHHUH .
AND UH WHEN I GOT INTO COLLEGE .
I STRUGGLED I STRUGGLED JUST TO UH GET MY DEGREE IN THE IN THE FIELD THAT I WAS IN .
YEAH .
WHEREAS I KNEW PEOPLE THAT IN HIGH SCHOOL WERE KIND OF LAZY AND ALL BUT THEY GOT MOTIVATED IN COLLEGE AND THEY DID A LOT BETTER THAN I DID .
AND WHEN IT .
YEAH .
I GUESS KIDS DO MATURE AT DIFFERENT AGES .
RIGHT .
TOO .
THAT S AND YOU KNOW AS A TEACHER .
YOU YOU TRY TO MAKE BE UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE DIFFERENT AGES KIDS ARE IS THIS A GOT A KID THAT JUST A QUESTION OF MATURITY OR IS HE .
A .
UHHUH .
PROBLEM CHILD .
BUT TEACHERS ARE ASKED TO DIAGNOSE SO MUCH .
UM THERE I MEAN I MEAN WE RE HAVE TO BE WE RE ALERTED .
RIGHT .
THERE .
S ALL SORTS OF SYSTEMS WHERE SUICIDE UH PREDISPOSITION .
I MEAN WE RE ALERTED TO WHAT .
THE MOMENT .
WE SEE SOMETHING .
IF WE SEE A CHILD THAT WE HAVE ANY REASON THAT S ON DRUGS SUCH AS IF HE S GOT A BEEPER OR IF THEY RE IF THEY RE FLASHING LOTS OF MONEY AROUND .
WE VE THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS TO DO .
I MEAN SO TEA THE SCHOOL SYSTEM S ASKED TO DO SO MUCH BUT YOU CA NT OPERATE IN A VACUUM .
YOU ACTUALLY HAVE STUDENTS WITH WITH BEEPERS .
THIS IS A WE RE IN A RATHER WEALTHY SUBURB OF WASHINGTON .
UHHUH .
AND A STUDENT WITH A BEEPER IMMEDIATELY GETS SENT DOWN TO THE UH PRINCIPAL .
I MEAN WHERE WHAT ARE THE WHAT COULD THEY POSSIBLY BE THINKING .
I MEAN HOW .
IT S FOR DRUG USE .
THEY CA NT IMAGINE FOR ANYTHING ELSE .
YEAH .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW IT S IT S AMAZING BUT UH YOU GET ALL SORTS YOU GET ALL ALL SORTS OF THINGS UH IN THE SCHOOLS UH UH AND IT S AND YOU KNOW AS A TEACHER .
YOU RE ALERT YOU RE ALERT FOR THE KID .
WHO S VERY DROWSY .
YOU RE ALERT TO THE KID .
WHO SUDDENLY HAS A UM BEHAVIORAL CHANGE AND YOU REFER THEM TO THE NURSE .
RIGHT .
AND SO I MEAN YOU HAVE TO FIND OUT WHETHER THERE S A LEGITIMATE REASON OR WHETHER THIS IS A WARNING SIGNAL .
YEAH CAN YOU HOW CAN YOU HOW CAN YOU EXPECT TO .
AND PARENTS FREQUENTLY RESENT WHEN YOU ASK THEM .
IS THERE A PROBLEM THAT WE SHOULD BE AWARE OF .
OH YEAH I I I WAS UH SITTING IN THE BARBER SHOP .
I M AN OFFICER IN THE AIR FORCE AND I WAS HAVING MY HAIR CUT .
UHHUH .
AND THE BARBER GOT A CALL WHILE I WAS THERE UH FROM HIS SON S SCHOOL .
HIS SON S IN HIGH SCHOOL .
AND HIS SON WAS FAILING GYM AND UH AND HAVING TROUBLE .
WITH A FEW OTHER THINGS .
BUT YOU KNOW IT S LIKE UH THIS GUY WAS LIKE WHY NOW THERE S NO PROBLEM WITH MY KID .
MY KID S A GREAT KID AND ALL THIS .
THE KID HAD MISSED ALL THESE CLASSES AND BASICALLY .
UHHUH .
HE HIS ANSWER WAS OH I GAVE HIM .
PERMISSION TO TO MISS .
YEAH THE DENIAL MECHANISM IS REALLY STRONG AND SO MANY PARENTS ARE FACILITATORS .
YEAH .
I MEAN THEY RE MANIPULATED BY THEIR CHILDREN .
RIGHT .
I VE BEEN FORTUNATE .
I HAVE UH A SON .
WHO S A SOPHOMORE IN COLLEGE UP IN MASSACHUSETTS .
UHHUH .
AT UH AMHERST AND MY OTHER SON IS A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL AND HE S GOING ON TO WILLIAMS .
AND I MEAN THEY RE REALLY SUPER .
THEY RE BOTH NATIONAL LEVEL .
SURE .
SWIMMERS AND WHERE WE VE BEEN VERY FORTUNATE BUT YOU KNOW THEY HAD TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE .
RIGHT .
TOO .
I MEAN YOU KNOW AT SOME POINT .
A PARENT DOES HELP THEIR KID BUT IN IN SOME WAYS BUT BUT YOU HAVE TO SAY AT WHAT POINT IS NT THE HELP BECOMING NEGATIVE .
SURE .
AND I THINK THIS IS WHERE THE SCHOOL SYSTEM AT IS SUFFERING AND NOT THROUGH ANY FAULT OF THE EFFORT .
RIGHT .
OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM .
BUT GEE .
IT WAS GOOD TALKING WITH YOU .
IT WAS GOOD TALKING TO YOU TOO .
YEAH SO THERE ARE PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY .
THAT FEEL .
YEAH .
THE SAME WAYS THAT YOU DO AND AND ARE CONNECTED WITH THE SCHOOLS .
YEAH I VE HAD INTERESTING CONVERSATIONS ON SEVERAL SUBJECTS NOT UH NOT JUST THIS BUT DIFFERENT THE DIFFERENT .
UHHUH .
THINGS .
IT S AMAZING HOW THE YOU KNOW PEOPLE YOU TALK TO HAVE SOME INTERESTING CONVERSATIONS AND UH IT S TOO BAD THAT ALL THIS STUFF IS JUST BEING THROWN INTO A DATA BASE AND THAT NONE OF THE IDEAS OR THOUGHTS ARE BEING USED AT ALL .
WELL WE ARE THOUGH .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
LISTEN GOOD LUCK .
TAKE CARE .
YEP .
BYEBYE .
BYEBYE .
WELL WE HAVE NT REALLY HEARD THAT MUCH IN THE NEWS LATELY ABOUT UH U S INVOLVEMENT IN LATIN AMERICA SINCE UH ALL THIS MIDDLE EAST CRISIS BEGAN SO I HAVE NT REALLY PAID THAT MUCH ATTENTION LIKE SINCE BACK IN AUGUST WHEN ALL OF THE NEWS AND ALL OF THE MEDIA BEGAN TO FOCUS IN ON UH IRAQ AND THE SO THE LAST THING THAT I REMEMBER HEARING THAT MUCH ABOUT IS THE IRAN CONTRA SCANDAL THAT HAPPENED IN THE REAGAN PRESIDENCY CAN YOU THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE THAT S HAPPENED RECENTLY .
NO I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU WE HAVE NT HAD TOO MUCH BUT UH HISTORICALLY WE VE ALWAYS UH ALMOST BEEN LIKE A BIG BROTHER TO IN AND TO THE LATIN AMERICAN AREA AND UH ALMOST USED THEM .
I I I FEEL .
UHHUH .
UH I THINK SOMETHING WILL HAVE TO BE DONE DOWN THERE VERY SOON ABOUT UH ABOUT MEXICO AND AND UH SOME OF THE OTHER AREAS BUT BUT WITH THE PERSIAN GULF AS YOU SAID IT S JUST UH BEEN VERY QUIET I I KEEP PRETTY CLOSE TABS ON THE PAPER AND YOU DO NT HARDLY SEE A UNLESS IT S THERE AND WE RE JUST NOT SEEING IT .
WELL THE ONLY UH REFERENCES THAT I HAVE SEEN LATELY HAS BEEN UH IN PART OF THE OVERMILITARIZATION OF IRAQ WAS DUE TO COMPANIES SELLING THEM ARMS AND THINGS AND .
UHHUH .
AND THEY MADE REFERENCES TO IN THE PAST HOW WE HAVE GIVEN ARMS TO UH NICARAGUA AND TO OTHER PLACES IN LATIN AMERICA AND THAT THOSE MIGHT TURN AROUND AND HAUNT US SOMEDAY .
WELL THAT S .
I MEAN NOT NOT TO THIS LARGE SCALE AS IRAQ BUT THAT .
UHHUH .
WHENEVER WE GIVE ARMS TO PEOPLE A AS WE DID AND AS WE SOLD ARMS TO PARDON ME TO IRAQ WHEN WE WANTED THEM TO FIGHT IRAN .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND THEN UH AND THEN IT TURN AROUND AND .
I I AGREE WE RE THE LARGEST MUNITIONS PRODUCER IN THE WORLD AND SO UH THERE S A LOT OF MONEY TO BE MADE THERE AND IT S UH BE VERY DIFFICULT TO TO CUT IT BACK TO A .
UHHUH .
A LEVEL WHERE IT SHOULD BE AND AND UH IT WILL COME BACK TO HAUNT US IT SEEMS TO COME IN CYCLES .
UHHUH AND I KNOW WHEN I SPENT THE TIME THAT I VE STUDIED IN MEXICO UH SE SPANISH WAS ONE OF MY MAJORS IN COLLEGE THAT UH THERE WAS A KIND OF A LOT OF RESENTMENT THERE TOWARDS AMERICA .
UHHUH .
ABOUT UH LIKE YOU SAY USING THEM YO OUR INTEREST THERE IS YOU KNOW WHAT PROFIT WE COULD MAKE OFF OF ANY KIND OF RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM .
RIGHT .
AND THAT WE WERE NT NORMALLY VERY INTERESTED IN THEM AND THEY HAVE IN OTHER IN MOST LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES THEY THERE ARE A LOT OF THE KIND OF PROBLEMS THAT WE VE FOUGHT FOR IN OTHER COUNTRIES YOU KNOW THAT THEY HAVE CORRUPTION AND AND THEY DO NT HAVE UH I MEAN THERE S JUST VERY FEW REALLY MODERN CITIES .
RIGHT AND THE PROBABLY THE BIGGE BIGGEST PROBLEM DOWN THERE IS THAT S WHERE THE THAT S THE DRUG ENTRY POINTS .
UHHUH .
AND THEIR ECONOMY IS OF S SEVERAL OF THE COUNTRIES ESPECIALLY COLUMBIA IS SO BUILT ON THE ON T ON THE DRUGS THAT UH OUR OUR LITTLE WAR ON DRUGS HAS REALLY BEEN LAUGHABLE IT S JUST A YOU KNOW SUCH A SMALL AMOUNT AND IT DOE IT JUST IT UH CUTS OFF JUST A TRICKLE AND UH IF IF WE CA NT GET A HANDLE ON THAT THROUGH SOME THROUGH SOME UH METHOD I DO NT KNOW WHERE WHE THAT WILL BE ANOTHER BIG PROBLEM .
WELL THAT S RIGHT BECAUSE THAT S JUST SO MUCH OF THE WAY THAT THEY MAKE THEIR MONEY AND SO MANY COMMUNITIES HAVE UH HAVE TO HAVE THAT FOR FARMING .
RIGHT RIGHT .
AND THEY DO NT LOOK AT IT SO MUCH AS YOU KNOW .
AND AS LONG AS WE RE THE LARGEST UH CONSUMER THEN UH .
UHHUH .
THIS IS THE MARKET .
THAT S RIGHT .
IF WE CAN CUT BACK THE USAGE THEN UH MAYBE IT WILL HAVE TO GO SOMEPLACE ELSE .
AND I THINK IT S REALLY VERY SAD THAT NORTH OF THE BORDER YOU KNOW THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA IS SO DIFFERENT .
UHHUH .
FROM THE S FROM SOUTH AMERICA .
UHHUH YEAH .
AND CENTRAL AMERICA THERE S REALLY A DISPARITY BETWEEN THE UH WHAT A E I WOULD CALL CIVILIZATION OF THE COUNTRIES YOU KNOW .
RIGHT YEAH WE RE JUST SO MUCH WEALTHIER AND UH .
UHHUH .
AND UH THERE HAS TO BE RESENTMENT BUILT UP AND THAT S WHERE UH LEADERS CAN USE UH USE THAT WHENEVER THE OPPORTUNE MOMENT ARISES .
YES IT S REALLY KIND OF SAD AND .
YEAH .
THAT WE WOULD GO ALL THE WAY TO IRAQ AND THAT WE WOULD BE VERY CONCERNED WITH THE SITUATION BETWEEN JERUSALEM AND UH ISRAEL AND THE MIDDLE EAST ARAB COUNTRIES AND AND WHEN WE HAVE WHEN WE HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS R R RIGHT IN OUR OWN BACK DOOR .
THAT S RIGHT OUR OWN HEMISPHERE BUT WE VE THAT S BEEN UH THAT S BEEN THE WAY IT S ALWAYS BEEN .
UM .
SO UH .
SO I GUESS WE VE KIND OF NEGLECTED LATIN AMERICA .
VERY MUCH SO EXCEPT WHEN WE NEED THEM YOU KNOW WHEN THEY FOUND OIL IN MEXICO THEN WE GOT VERY FRIENDLY WITH THEM AGAIN .
RI RECENTLY .
YEAH .
YEAH FAIRLY RECENTLY WELL THAT S REALLY SAD I HAD NT THOUGHT ABOUT THAT IN A LONG TIME .
UM .
WELL I GUESS THEN I WILL GO BUT I .
OKAY .
MADE ME STOP AND THINK A MINUTE ABOUT .
SURE DID .
NOT WORRYING SO MUCH ABOUT THE MIDDLE EAST CRISIS I KNOW THAT IT S NOT SETTLED BUT THERE ARE OTHER AREAS THAT WE COULD FOCUS OUR ATTENTION ON .
ALWAYS YES MAAM .
WELL THANK YOU YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY .
YOU TOO DEAR .
BYEBYE .
BYE .
WELL THIS IS KIND OF IRONIC BECAUSE I WORK IN T I S LEGAL DEPARTMENT .
DO YOU .
AND ALTHOUGH WE DO NT HAVE ANY CRIMINAL ACTIONS HERE WE DO HAVE OTHER UM LAWSUITS THAT DO GO TO TRIAL FROM TIME TO TIME .
UHHUH .
AND UH WHEN WAS IT A COUPLE WEEKS AGO I WAS ASKED TO GO TO UH JURY DUTY I I WAS NT SELECTED BUT UM FOR SOME OF OUR CASES IN PARTICULAR WE HAVE UM VERY TECHNICAL CASES FROM TIME TO TIME BECAUSE OF LIKE OUR PATENTS AND SUCH .
SURE .
AND IT S VERY DIFFICULT FOR LAY PEOPLE FOR SOMEBODY WHO MIGHT JUST YOU KNOW HAPPEN TO BE SELECTED IN OUR JURY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE RE TALKING ABOUT .
WELL I DO THINK THAT THE CASES LIKE THE UH OH SAY SOMETHING LIKE TEXACO VERSUS PENNZOIL .
UHHUH .
OR OR THE TEXACO PENNZOIL PROBLEM .
UHHUH .
UH IS RIDICULOUS FOR PEOPLE JUST TAKEN OFF THE STREET TO UNDERSTAND AND .
RIGHT .
REALLY SHOULD HAVE SOME BETTER WAY WHERE PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND BOTH THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE COMPLEX ISSUES INVOLVED SHOULD HANDLE CASES LIKE THAT .
YEAH YOU KNOW SOME MUMBLEX I DO NT YOU ALWAYS HAVE THE OPTION NOW IN CRIMINAL I GUESS YOU ALWAYS HAVE A JURY BUT IN CIVIL CASES YOU HAVE THE OPTION OF WHETHER YOU WANT A JURY OR NOT .
OH IS THAT RIGHT .
YEAH AND IN SOME INCIDENCES I THINK THEY OUGHT TO OUGHT NOT TO HAVE A JURY .
YEAH .
UM .
OKAY BOY OR UH OR THERE SHOULD BE SOME WAY WHERE IT COULD BE OPTED FOR THEM NOT TO HAVE A JURY UH I WAS ONLY ON ONE JURY EVER .
UHHUH .
SO FAR IN MY LIFE AND UH IT REALLY WAS A PRETTY TRIVIAL CASE AND IT SEEMED TO ME ALL THE TIME I WAS THINKING OF ALL THESE PEOPLE IN THE COURTROOM OVER THE CASE THAT INVOLVED OH A COUPLE THOUSAND DOLLARS I THINK .
UHHUH .
IT WAS IT WAS REALLY JUST UH UH TERRIFIC WASTE OF EVERYBODY S TIME AND MONEY .
UM .
AND IT FINALLY ENDED UP THAT UH EVEN THOUGH WE HAD REACHED A VERDICT BEFORE WE WERE ALLOWED TO GIVE IT THEY SETTLED THE CASE .
OH .
THEY WO THEY HAD SETTLED WHILE WE WERE DELIBERATING .
YEAH .
NOW THE ONE THING I DID APPROVE OF THERE WAS THAT WE DID NT HAVE TO BE UNANIMOUS BECAUSE IT WAS A CIVIL CASE .
UHHUH .
AND UH WE WERE SPLIT UH TEN TO TWO SO IT WAS UH A GOOD THING THAT IT WAS NT A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME TO HAVE A HUNG JURY ON A CASE THAT TRIVIAL .
YEAH WELL UM I VE NEVER FULLY SERVED I MEAN I VE BEEN ASKED TWICE TO GO DOWN BUT I DID NT GET ELECTED ON THE PANEL BUT I KNOW THAT UM FOR A LOT OF THE CIVIL CASES IT S RARE I MEAN IF YOUR A LAWYER UM THERE YOU COULD BE A LAWYER WHO NEVER ACTUALLY GETS INTO THE COURTROOM THERE S A LOT OF ATTORNEYS LIKE THAT THAT NEVER GET TO THE COURTROOM SOME THEIR KIND OF LAW DOES NT GET THEM TO THE COURTROOM BUT EVEN IN UM LITIGATION WHICH IS DOING LAWSUITS IS A LOT OF TIMES THAT YOU NEVER GET TO THE COURTROOM ITSELF AND .
WELL I THINK THAT THE TRIAL IN A SENSE IS KIND OF A THREAT TO HOLD OVER PEOPLE TO TRY TO GET THEM TO REACH AN AGREEMENT OUT OF COURT .
YEAH .
BECAUSE IT DOES COST SO MUCH MONEY .
BUT IT S A SHAME THAT OH IT S NOT SO BAD FOR THE COURT SYSTEM BECAUSE THE MONEY THERE IS NT BEING SPENT BUT THERE S AWFUL LOT OF MONEY IN TIME AND EFFORT SPENT IN PREPARING FOR TRIAL ONLY TO THEN FINALLY GET SCARED ENOUGH BY GOING TO THE COURT AND USUALLY IT S THE SCARE KIND OF OF THE JURY BECAUSE YOU REALLY DO NT KNOW ONE WAY OR THE OTHER HOW THAT JURY IS GOING TO FEEL .
UHHUH .
YOU COULD FEEL THAT YOU REALLY HAVE A VERY STRONG CASE AND THAT YOU RE VERY MUCH RIGHT BUT THE JURY MAY OR MAY NOT SEE IT THAT WAY .
SURE .
SO YOU GET A LITTLE ANTIC YOU KNOW ANXIOUS THERE AND GO WELL YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
I DO NT FEEL THAT SURE AND WHO KNOWS WHAT THE JURY WILL SAY BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU KNOW THE JURIES COME DOWN WITH A RESULT AND YOU GO GEE .
YEAH I WAS A WITNESS IN A CASE IN A CRIMINAL CASE .
UHHUH .
AND IT WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRIFYING TO ME HOW THAT OPERATED BECAUSE SO MUCH EVIDENCE WAS EXCLUDED .
UM .
AND THAT THE JURY WAS NEVER ALLOWED TO HEAR AND THEY CONVICTED THE DEFENDANT I ON AS FAR AS I COULD TELL VERY FLIMSY EVIDENCE AND TWO PERJURED TESTIMONIES .
OH REALLY .
AND I KNEW THE PEOPLE INVOLVED BOTH THE PEOPLE WHO D AND THE PEOPLE WHO UH WERE DEFENDANTS .
UHHUH .
AND YEAH I THINK THAT WAS JUST A A HORRIBLE MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE BECAUSE OF THE UH YOU KNOW STAYING BY THE ABSOLUTE STRICT RULES AND NOT ALLOWING THINGS TO BE PRESENTED TO THE JURY THAT UH WERE HIGHLY IRRELEVANT TO THE CASE AND COULD I THOUGHT HAVE ESTABLISHED THE DEFENDANT S INNOCENCE .
YEAH .
SO UH I DO ALTHOUGH I M A LAWYER S DAUGHTER AND I HAVE LAWYER S .
OH REALLY .
AND JUDGES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE FAMILY AND UNCLES AND COUSINS AND THINGS LIKE THAT I REALLY THINK THAT WE HAVE GOTTEN INTO MUCH TOO LEGALISTIC OF SOCIETY AND THAT WE WE SPEND FAR TOO MUCH ON THE FINE POINTS OF THE LAW AND FAR TOO LITTLE ON ACHIEVING JUSTICE .
YEAH AND IT SEEMS A LOT OF TIMES THAT UH ESPECIALLY IN CRIMINALS THAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE SO PROTECTED BUT WHAT ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF YOU KNOW THE REST OF SOCIETY I MEAN WE RE PROTECTING THIS PERSON S RIGHTS WHO HAS BROKEN THE LAW .
UHHUH .
UM AND WE PROTECT HIM SO MUCH BUT WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF THE SOCIETY YOU KNOW WHAT ARE WE DOING FOR THEM WE RE KIND OF YOU KNOW FORGETTING ABOUT THEM AND I THINK SOMETIMES THAT A CRIMINAL SHOULD KIND OF IF HE BREAKS LAW ESPECIALLY IT HE S A REPEATER THE LAW SHOULD NT JUST ALWAYS COVER FOR HIM .
WELL AND THEN IN A LOT OF .
THAT SOME OF HIS RIGHTS AS SHOULD BE TAKEN .
YEAH IN CRIMINAL CASES UH FOR INSTANCE YOU CA NT BRING UP PRIOR CONVICTIONS UNLESS THEY ARE SOMEHOW DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE CASE AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT A JURY CAN MAKE A MUCH MORE RATIONAL DECISION IF THEY KNOW SOMEBODY HAD FIFTEEN CONVICTIONS FOR A SIMILAR CRIME .
YEAH .
MUMBLEX NOW IT S POSSIBLE THAT HE DID NT COMMIT THE MUMBLEX BUT THE LIKELIHOOD CERTAINLY TILTS IT .
YEAH .
WITH A RECORD LIKE THAT AND .
YEAH .
MUMBLEX THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE RE NOT ALLOWED TO WAS NOT ALLOWED IN THE UH TRIAL I WENT TO THOUGH UH ONE OF THE TWO PEOPLE WHO GAVE THE PERJURED TESTIMONY HAD A LONG CRIMINAL RECORD AND HAD BEEN YOU KNOW A REAL SLEAZE BAG .
UM .
AND HE CAME IN AND WAS PRESENTED TO THE COURT AS A MUMBLEX STANDING YOUNG MAN WHO HAD UH BEEN IN SEMINARY TO BECOME A PRIEST AND .
YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE GUY WAS JUST PURE AS THE DRIVEN SNOW BUT I HAPPEN TO KNOW HIS BACKGROUND AND I KNOW THAT HE WOULD HAVE SOLD OUT HIS MOTHER FOR UH UH SHORTER SENTENCE .
JEEZ .
AND YOU KNOW IT S IT S REALLY ANNOYING WHEN THE I ASKED THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY LATER WHY HE DID NT BRING UP ALL THIS OTHER TROUBLE THE GUY HAD BEEN IN HE SAID THAT THAT WAS BARRED UH BY THE COURT .
UM .
SO WE DO HAVE SOME PROBLEMS AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT UH MAYBE IT S TIME TO JUST SCRAP ALL THE CASE LAW AND GO BACK TO GENERAL PRINCIPLES .
AND START OVER AND THEN MAKE A LEGAL SYSTEM THAT CAREFULLY PROTECTS PEOPLE BUT UH WHERE YOU .
YEAH I D EVEN GO FOR FOR TRYING TO GET SOME TRUTH OUT OF THE WITNESS STAND IF THEY COME UP WITH SOME PRETTY RELIABLE UH UM LIE DETECTOR TESTS THAT WE CAN SEE RIGHT THEN AND THERE WHETHER THEY RE LYING OR TELLING THE TRUTH .
YEAH .
YEAH THAT WOULD BE WRONGFUL .
YEAH YOU KNOW .
SURE WOULD .
YEAH I WITNESSED ONE TRIAL MANY YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS FIRST UM STUDYING TO BE A PARALEGAL AND UH UH THEY BARRED PRIORS ON THIS UH PERSON AND THEY NEVER THEN TOLD US I GUESS BECAUSE PRIORS HAD A REASON AS TO WHY THESE TWO PEOPLE WERE VERY MUCH IN HATRED OF EACH OTHER .
UM .
AND THEY NEVER TOLD US WHY THESE TWO PEOPLE HAD SUCH A VENDETTA AGAINST EACH OTHER AND THE CRIME WAS UH UH ATTEMPT TO COMMIT MURDER YOU KNOW .
UM .
BUT THEY NEVER TOLD US WHY THESE PEOPLE WERE MAD AT EACH OTHER AND GEE YOU KNOW THAT S .
AND YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE RELEVANT .
YEAH YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY THEY TOLD US IN SCHOOL THAT YOU KNOW CRIME HAS TO BE AN INTENT YOU KNOW HAS TO BE NOT JUST THE ACT BUT YOU HAVE TO INTEND TO DO IT BECAUSE THERE COULD BE ACCIDENTAL KIND OF THINGS YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
BUT THEY NEVER TOLD US WHY THESE TWO PEOPLE HATED THEMSELVES OR IF ONE HAD DONE SOMETHING TO YOU KNOW REALLY AGGRAVATE THE OTHER THERE WAS NEVER ANY MOTIVE .
UHHUH .
GIVEN AND AND I HAD A TOUGH TIME WITH THAT AND AND BEING A PERSON WHO SAW WHAT THE JURY DID NT PLUS WHAT THE JURY DID BECAUSE WE WERE JUST OBSERVING YOU KNOW THERE IN THE COURTROOM .
UHHUH .
AT THE END OF IT ALL I STILL DID NT KNOW .
YEAH RIGHT .
I STILL HAVE A LOT OF REASONABLE DOUBTS AND I VE SEEN EVERYTHING PRESENTED AND YOU KNOW THEY JUST HAVE NT DONE A REAL COMPLETE CASE HERE TO MY THINKING .
UHHUH .
I DO NT KNOW THAT I WANT TO .
I THINK SO AND I .
SIT ON A JURY LIKE THAT AND YOU D STILL YOU KNOW I WANT ASK SOME QUESTIONS HERE .
YEAH THAT S SOMETHING I THOUGHT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD IDEA OF WHEN JURIES COME IN THEY ARE TOLD JUST TO SHUT UP AND LISTEN .
UHHUH .
AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU D GET A LOT MORE UH INFORMATION IF YOUR QUESTIONS WERE HEARD .
UHHUH .
IF YOU WERE ALLOWED TO ASK THE WITNESSES THINGS OR IF OR THE LAWYERS THINGS OR EVEN THE JUDGE .
RIGHT .
BUT PARTICULARLY THE WITNESSES .
RIGHT YEAH ALLOW THEM TO UH GO BACK AND AND DELIBERATE AND UH YOU KNOW AFTER EACH DAYS PROCEEDINGS COME OUT WITH SOME QUESTIONS THAT THEY WANT ANSWERED LIKE THE NEXT DAY BRING THOSE PEOPLE BACK .
OR IF THEY WOULD ALLOW THEM TO UH GIVE BROADER ANSWERS THEY IT S REALLY KIND OF UH CHOREOGRAPHED IT S LIKE A SCRIPT HAS BEEN WRITTEN WHEN PEOPLE TESTIFY THEY ARE NT TESTIFYING REALLY IN THEIR OWN WORDS .
RIGHT .
YEAH I CAN REMEMBER UH FRIENDS OF DADDY .
OKAY SO WHAT KIND OF CAR ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT GETTING .
WELL NONE AT THE MOMENT .
WELL WHEN YOU DECIDE TO .
NO NO NO .
I CURRENTLY DRIVE A A FORD TAURUS .
UHHUH .
AND I WOULD IMA I WOULD IMAGINE THAT IF I CHANGE OR IF I GET ANOTHER CAR A NEW CAR I WILL GO WITH THE TAURUS OR SOMETHING SIMILAR UH IN THAT REGARD .
SO YOU LIKE THE FORD .
ABSOLUTELY .
I HAVE HAD IT FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS NOW .
UHHUH .
AND IT S UH IT S EVERYTHING .
IT S SUPPOSED TO BE .
UH I HAVE NT HAD A MINUTES TROUBLE WITH IT .
UHHUH .
AND UH THE ONLY THING .
I HAVE AGAINST IT IN THAT S .
IT S A TAURUS BUT I STILL FEEL A LITTLE EVEN AFTER TWO YEARS I STILL FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE DRIVING IT BECAUSE I HAD A HONDA BEFORE THAT .
UHHUH .
AND SO IT S A LITTLE BIT LARGER .
RIGHT .
BUT THAT S THE ONLY THE ONLY DIFFERENCE THAT I SEE REALLY .
BUT I WOULD MY MY CRITERIA WOULD BE AT THE MOMENT .
IT WOULD BE UH AMERICAN UH PERSONALLY AN .
UHHUH .
YEAH IT S THE THIS THE CAR .
I HAD BEFORE THIS ONE WAS A THUNDERBIRD .
UHHUH .
AS A MATTER OF FACT AND UH I LOVED IT I REALLY DID .
BUT UH UM I FINALLY DECIDED TO GO CHECK OUT WHAT .
THE UH WHAT .
THE UH FOREIGN CARS WERE .
SO I BOUGHT MYSELF .
A A A NISSAN .
UHHUH .
A TWO FORTY S X .
BUT EVEN THOUGH I LOVE THE CAR .
I VE GOT NOW I THINK MY NEXT CAR WILL PROBABLY BE AMERICAN AGAIN .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE IF I CAN AT ALL DO IT I D LIKE TO STAY AMERICAN I ALWAYS HAVE UP UNTIL NOW .
I JUST FOR ONE TIME DECIDED TO GO OUTSIDE .
SO .
WELL MY WIFE DRIVES A STILL HAS A A HONDA .
UHHUH .
ACCORD AND IT S A VERY IT S AN EXCELLENT AUTOMOBILE .
UHHUH .
AND UH BUT YOU KNOW PRICE AND SO FORTH I M NOT A REAL CAR FAN .
SO I I I DO NOT UH OPT FOR UH SOMETHING .
THAT WOULD BE YOU KNOW EXPENSIVE .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW I WANT I WANT SOMETHING .
THAT S SERVICEABLE SERVICEABLE SOMETHING THAT I CAN USE .
UHHUH .
AND UH AND I AND WITH THE TAURUS I HAVE A TAURUS UH L X AND IT S YOU KNOW YOU RE TALKING WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT PRICE IT S SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS LOWER THAN THE COMPARABLE HONDA OR NISSAN OR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES .
UHHUH .
AND AS I SAID AS FAR I M CONCERNED IT IT HAS BEEN EXTREMELY UH UH SERVICEABLE AND EVERYTHING .
I WANTED .
WELL FORD S DONE A REAL GOOD JOB IN THE LAST UH SAY TEN YEARS .
UHHUH .
OR AT LEAST THE LAST FIVE TO TE SIX YEARS SO OF REALLY TURNING AROUND THEIR UM QUALITY I THINK UM .
OH I THINK SO TOO .
NOW I YOU KNOW IN TRAVEL AND RENTING AUTOMOBILES .
UHHUH .
UH IN I VE DRIVEN YOU KNOW CHEVROLET AUTOMOBILES AND SO FOR AND DODGE AND I IF IT S CHEVROLET I JUST WILL NOT TOUCH IT .
UM .
UH I HAD A CHEVROLET BEFORE I BOUGHT MY TAURUS .
I PURCHASED A A CHEVY UM CITATION .
OH YEAH THOSE WERE NOT GOOD CARS .
AND UH I WAS READY TO GET RID OF IT .
TWO MONTHS AFTER I BOUGHT IT .
UHHUH .
AND UH SO I I .
SHOPPED AROUND AND I WOULD I PROBABLY IF I HAD THOUGHT I UH WANTED TO PAY THE AMOUNT OF MONEY I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE GONE WITH UH UH AN ACCORD .
UHHUH .
OR EVEN A A CIVIC OR SOMETHING COMPARABLE FROM NISSAN .
RIGHT .
OR TOYOTA AND UH BUT IT WAS JUST I HAD I HAVE A FRIEND .
WHO UH HAS A UH AN AUTO SHOP AND HE PURCHASED ONE OF THE FIRST SABLES .
THAT WAS UH MANUFACTURED FOR HIS WIFE A SABLE STATION WAGON AND HE JUST ABSOLUTELY SWORE BY IT .
UHHUH .
AND IT WAS UPON HIS RECOMMENDATION AND SO FORTH FOR YOU KNOW COMPARABLE COMPARABLY EQUIPPED YOU KNOW WITH CRUISE CONTROL AND AIR CONDITIONING AND A M F M RADIO AND ALL THESE OTHER THINGS .
UHHUH .
UH IT WAS JUST THERE WAS NO THERE WAS NO COMPARISON .
UH THE ONLY THING THAT I FIND YOU KNOW IF I WOULD HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST IT IS THAT IT STILL HAS THAT SOFT AMERICAN RIDE .
RIGHT .
UH NOT UH THAT S ABOUT THE ONLY THING .
I FIND YOU KNOW DISADVANTAGEOUS TO IT .
BUT MY CRITERIA IS SIMPLY SOMETHING .
THAT LOOKS GOOD SOMETHING .
THAT S SERVICEABLE AND I YOU KNOW I DRIVE AROUND A LOT BUT UH AND IT S YOU KNOW IT S VERY COMFORTABLE ON THE HIGHWAY .
I CAN DRIVE FOR YOU KNOW TEN HOURS OR SO AND NOT REALLY BE TIRED IN ANY WAY .
UHHUH .
BUT THOSE ARE MY CRITERIA AND I I PROBABLY IN ANOTHER SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR OR SOMETHING WILL PROBABLY START LOOKING AROUND AGAIN AND IF THERE S SOMETHING OUT THERE .
THAT UH IS COMPARABLE TO WHAT .
I HAVE NOW I LL GO AHEAD AND GET IT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THE ONLY THING .
I M LOOKING .
AT RIGHT NOW UM I JUST I JUST BOUGHT YOU KNOW THE NISSAN THAT I VE GOT ABOUT UH SAY NINE MONTHS AGO I GUESS IT WAS .
SO THE ONLY THING THAT THAT WOULD GET ME TO CHANGE CARS RIGHT NOW WOULD BE IF SEE AT THE MOMENT .
I M SINGLE AND IF I WERE TO GET MARRIED AND HAVE A FAMILY .
THAT WOULD HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT .
BUT UH I DO NT HAVE ANY PLANS FOR PROBABLY ANOTHER TWO THREE YEARS OF EVEN LOOKING YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
UH CARS ARE TOO EXPENSIVE RIGHT NOW TO UH .
I YEAH .
TO EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING NEW CARS .
EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS YOU KNOW IT S .
IN OUR PARKING LOTS UH TWO OR THREE DAYS AGO I SAW ONE OF THE NEW HONDA SPORTS CARS .
UHHUH .
UH I I CA NT REMEMBER WHAT .
THE NAME IS .
IT S THE THIRTYFIVE OR FORTY THOUSAND DOLLAR ONE WHATEVER .
IT IS AND IT LOOKED IT RESEMBLED A MAZARATTI .
UM .
VERY VERY CLOSELY .
AND IT S AN ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL AUTOMOBILE .
UHHUH .
AND WELL APPOINTED AND SO FORTH BUT TO PAY THAT MUCH MONEY FOR AN AUTOMOBILE UH IS JUST I CA NT I CA NT CONCEIVE OF DOING THAT .
YEAH THAT S UH I WENT TO A A CAR SHOW DOWN HERE ABOUT UH ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO AND UM YOU KNOW OF COURSE .

BUT THEN YOU STARTED LOOKING AT THE UH UH THEY HAD FERRARI THERE THEY HAD UH B M W AND ALL THESE OTHER KINDS OF CARS .
AND FERRARI DID NT EVEN LET YOU NEAR THE CAR I MEAN THEY WERE THAT S HOW EXPENSIVE THEY WERE .
UHHUH .
AND THEN YOU SAW UH HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR CARS YOU SAW EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLAR CARS AND EVEN EVEN THOUGH I I I DO ENJOY CARS I ENJOY UM DRIVING THEM I ENJOY UH RIDING IN THEM AND EVERYTHING BUT I CA NT SEE BUYING OR PAYING MORE FOR A CAR THAN I WOULD FOR A HOUSE YOU KNOW .
THAT S TRUE .
WELL .
THAT DOES NT SEEM LIKELY .
THE DIFFERENCE .
THERE IS TOO UH IS BETWEEN US IS THAT I AM NOT REALLY CRAZY ABOUT DRIVING .
UHHUH .

YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT S YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO CUT EACH THING OR YOU KNOW USE THE MELON BALLER AND STUFF BUT BUT I THINK THEY RE REALLY NEAT AND YOU KNOW I THINK THEY RE WORTH THE TIME YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY .
YEAH YOU PROBABLY GET THIS PROBABLY PRETTY STICKY AFTER YOU GET DONE .
OH YEAH .
THEN YOU VE GOT TO DRAIN THE WATER OUT OF THE WATERMELON BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SCRAPE IT IT MAKES THE WATER .
RIGHT YEAH .
YEAH UM SOMETHING I DO IS A FRUIT IS I LL GET UM MAKE CHOCOLATE SAUCE AND DIP STRAWBERRIES AND BANANAS IN THEM YEAH I HAVE TWO NIECES AND THEY THEY MUMBLEX THEY GO MELT SOME CHOCOLATE CHIPS GO BUY ME SOME STRAWBERRIES .
IS THAT IS THAT GOOD YOU KNOW I VE SEEN THAT SO MANY TIMES STRAWBERRIES DIPPED IN CHOCOLATE BUT I VE NEVER TRIED IT ARE THEY REALLY GOOD .
YEAH THER YOU KNOW IF YOU GET A SWEET STRAWBERRY THEY RE MUCH BETTER BUT IF YOU GET A SOUR STRAWBERRY .
OH I BET IT DOES NT MIX WELL DOES IT .
HUH YEAH NO THEY UM THE STRAWBERRIES ARE COMING IN SEASON NOW FROM THEY RE THEY RE COMING UP FROM FLORIDA OF COURSE I LIVE IN VERMONT SO BUT THEY RE REALLY REASONABLY PRICED THEY RE COMING UP FROM FLORIDA SO .
OH WELL THAT S GOOD BECAUSE I KNOW THEY VE BEEN REALLY EXPENSIVE LATELY .
YEAH .
BECAUSE THEY WERE NT IN SEASON OF COURSE THEY HAD TO BE BE UH GROWN IN GREENHOUSES AND STUFF AND IN .
YEAH I THINK THE UH ACTUALLY I THINK THEY GET UM SOME OF THEM FROM SOUTH AMERICA .
OH IS THAT RIGHT .
YEP THEY A LOT OF UM OF A UM WINTER PRODUCE COMES FROM SOUTH AMERICA .
OH I MUMBLEX .
OF COURSE THEIR SEASONS ARE SWITCHED .
UHHUH RIGHT .
SO UM DO YOU WANT TO DISCUSS THE RECIPE .
WELL .
I HAVE A RECIPE IF YOU WANT .
OKAY SURE SU .
UM IT FILLED A LOT OF PEOPLE TRY TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS BUT I MAKE MY OWN HOMEMADE PUDDING JUST BECAUSE I DO NT LIKE BOX PUDDING .
IS THAT RIGHT I VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT .
YEAH IT AND IT MUMBLEX IF YOU UM WELL FIRST OF ALL I MUMBLEX TAKE ABOUT A QUARTER AND A HALF OF MILK AND I PUT IT IN A TWO QUART SAUCEPAN AND YOU PUT IT ON A REALLY LOW HEAT .
UHHUH .
AND YOU WANT TO USE ONE OF YOUR GOOD SAUCE PANS THAT DISSIPATE THE HEAT BECAUSE IT IT ENDS UP BURNING I MEAN NO MATTER HOW CAREFUL YOU ARE YOU STILL MIGHT GET A FILM ON THE BOTTOM OF THE POT .
UHHUH .
I DO NT LET THAT WORRY ME AND I GET THE MILK LUKEWARM AND THEN I POUR ABOUT A HALF A CUP OF CORNSTARCH IN IT AND I HAVE THIS THING IT S CALLED THE SLENDER BLENDER IT IT MAKES THE UH IT MAKES UH A WHIP TOPPING OUT OF MILK IF YOU GET THE MILK COLD ENOUGH IT S UH I DO NT KNOW THEY RE CALLED MOO GOO LEAVES OR SOMETHING THEY RE SL .
I THINK I KNOW WHAT YOU RE TALK IS IT LIKE A HAND HELD .
YEAH THEY RE REAL NEAT .
THE YEAH OKAY .
I THINK THEY RE REAL REASONABLY PRICED SOME OF THEM THEY USED TO BE A HUNDRED DOLLARS AND THEY USED TO WHIP SKIM MILK INTO A DESSERT BUT I DID NT GET THAT ONE I GOT THE BLACK AND DECKER KIND BUT UH IT S REAL HANDY BECAUSE IT DOES NT HAVE A CORD AND YOU BEAT THIS CORNSTARCH RIGHT INTO THE MIL THE MILK YOU KNOW AND IT DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB OR JUST HAND BEAT IT I GUESS YOU COULD USE A HAND MIXER BUT I DO NT THINK IT PUR I DO NT THINK IT GETS IT GOOD ENOUGH .
UHHUH .
AND THEN BEFORE THE MILK GETS TOO HOT UM I ADD TWO BEATEN EGGS AND I REALLY MIX THEM IN GOOD AND THEN ABOUT A HALF A CUP OF SUGAR AND I LET IT PRETTY MUCH I BEAT IT LIKE EVERY MINUTE FOR ABOUT TEN SECONDS AND IT S IT STARTS THICKENING WHEN IT THICKENS THE CORNSTARCH MIGHT GET A LITTLE I DO NT KNOW IT GETS LIKE LITTLE GLOBS OF THIS RUBBERY CORNSTARCH .
OH HUH .
AND YOU JUST KEEP BEATING IT IN AND IT S THE THE TRICK IS IS TO HAVE THIS BLENDER SO IF YOU WERE YOU D HAVE TO PROBABLY ALMOST GO OUT AND MUMBLEX SOMEONE WHO S JUST GOING TO MAKE IT FIRST TIME IT S YOU LL HAVE MUCH BETTER LUCK IF YOU HAD ONE OF THESE LITTLE BLENDERS .
HUH .
AND THEN YOU CAN ADD COCOA POWDER TO IT TO MAKE CHOCOLATE OR AFTER IT S THICKENED I COOK IT FOR A GOOD ONCE IT STARTS BOILING I JUST I COOK IT FOR A GOOD SEVEN MINUTES .
UHHUH .
SEVEN TO TEN MINUTES AND THEN YOU CAN MAKE CHOCOLATE OR YOU CAN TAKE IT OFF AND LET IT COOL MUMBLEX YOU PUT UM REALLY GOOD VANILLA FAVORING IN IT AND SOME BUTTER AND THAT MAKES FRENCH VANILLA UM CUSTARD YEAH .
OH WOW THAT IS REALLY INTERESTING ARE YOU SAYING TO USE LIKE UM FOR CHOCOLATE LIKE UNSWEETENED .
A CHOCOLATE POWDER .
UNSWEETENED .
YEAH THAT COCOA YEAH THE UNSWEETENED IT COMES IN LIKE A REAL DARK CAN .
YEAH .
OUR MOTHERS USED TO USE IT AND THEN .
RI I HAVE SOME .
YEAH WE ALL USED TO .
I JUST WANT TO .
YEAH IT S THE UNSWEETENED KIND IT S NOT LIKE NESTLES QUIK .
RIGHT OKAY .
I SUPPOSE YOU COULD USE THAT I .
COOKING CHOCOLATE .
YEAH BUT UM .
THAT S REALLY INTERESTING I VE NEVER HEARD OF ANYBODY MAKING THEIR OWN PUDDING BEFORE THAT S REALLY NEAT .
WELL I USED TO MAKE THE REGULAR PUDDING THE CHOCOLATE AND PUT IT IN THE PIE SHELL AND IF IT WOULD SIT IN THE REFRIGERATOR FOR A DAY WHERE YOU CUT THE PIE IT WOULD SOAK INTO THE PIE SHELL AND IT WAS LIKE RED AND I M LIKE OH THIS IS KIND OF GROEDY .
WELL HOW DID YOU GET A RECIPE FOR PUDDING ON YOUR OWN .
UM ACTUALLY I FOUND IT IN ONE OF MY MOTHER S UM HOMEMADE COOKBOOKS I MEAN .
IS THAT RIGHT .
SOMETHING SHE HAD COLLECTED OUT OF WOMAN S DAY OR SOMETHING .
OH NEAT .
SO .
THAT IS JUST REALLY NEAT BECAUSE I .
I THINK YOU COULD NT MAKE IT WITH A HAND WHISK OR OR A REGULAR BEATER BUT UM .
IT WOULD PROBABLY BE A LOT MORE WORK AND PROBABLY NOT TURN OUT AS GOOD .
YEAH BUT I STILL THINK A BEATER WOULD DO IT GOOD ENOUGH UM THE TRICK IS TO GET THE CORNSTARCH .
UHHUH .
UM YEAH RIGHT IN THE IN THE LUKEWARM MILK SOMETIMES I PUT THE CORNSTARCH IN A SEPARATE BOWL AND I WOULD PUT IT IN THE SINK AND I LL TAKE MY LUKEWARM MILK AND PUT IT IN THE CORNSTARCH AND BEAT IT GOOD IT SEEMS TO BE BETTER THAN PUTTING THE THE CORNSTARCH INTO THE LIQUID IT ONCE IT HITS THE TOP OF THE LIQUID IT SEEMS TO MAKE LITTLE BALLS AND STUFF ON THE TOP .
SO YOU PUT THE MILK IN THE CORNSTARCH .
YEAH AND I LL DO THIS UH SOMETIMES MUMBLEX I LL PUT MY AFTER I POUR THAT INTO MY BACK INTO MY SAUCEPAN I LL PUT THE EGGS IN THE SAME DISH AND BEAT THEM UP AND THEN POUR THE CORNSTARCH AND THE MILK MIXTURE IN THE EGG SO .
AND THEN PUT THAT BACK IN THE SAUCEPAN .
YEP AND THEN YOU KNOW IF YOU CAN PUT YOUR COCOA IN WITH YOUR CORNSTARCH IF YOU WANTED TO THE COCOA EVEN SEEMS TO THICKEN IT EVEN MORE .
HUH THAT S .
BECAUSE BY THE VANILLA DOES NT SEEM TO THICKEN AS WELL AS THE SOMETIMES THE COCOA IS LIKE MY HUSBAND REALLY LIKES IT THICK HE SAYS I CAN STICK THE SPOON RIGHT IN THIS .
OH .
BECAUSE I M ALWAYS WORRYING IT WO NT FIRM UP BECAUSE IT WHEN YOU TAKE IT OUT OF THE SAUCEPAN IT S LIKE BOY I HOPE THIS THICKENS A LITTLE MORE BECAUSE IT S NOT LIKE REAL PACKAGE THICK YOU KNOW WHEN YOU COOK A PACKAGE .
UHHUH .
IT S IT S A LITTLE LESS BUT I PUT IT IN A NICE GLASS BOWL AND UM SOME PEOPLE DO NT LIKE THAT THAT FILM ON THE PUDDING SO YOU CAN PUT UH SARAN WRAP OVER THE TOP .
UHHUH .
AND THEN ONCE THE PUDDING STARTS COOLING IT MAKES LITTLE BALLS OF WATER ON THE SARAN WRAP SO WHEN YOU PULL THE SARAN WRAP BACK YOU SORT OF SHOULD BE A LITTLE CAREFUL PULL IT BACK AND SHAKE THE WATER OFF THE SARAN WRAP AND I MIGHT PUT IT BACK ON BUT UM .
DO YO DO YOU PUT IT IN THE REFRIGERATOR THEN OR Y .
YEAH AFTER WELL WHEN IT STARTS STEAMING A LOT UH I DEFINITELY YEAH PUT IT IN THE REFRIGERATOR .
UHHUH .
BUT UM I MY FATHER ALWAYS TOLD ME IF YOU PUT HOT FOOD IN YOUR REFRIGERATOR YOU RE GOING TO MAKE IT WORK TOO HARD .
RIGHT THAT S TRUE I KNEW THAT .
THAT S YEAH .
YEAH .
SO THAT S WHY I DO THAT .
YEAH .
SO WELL I DO NT KNOW THAT S MY MY GREAT HARD RECIPE .
SO I OWN A A P C .
A T AT MY HOME .
UHHUH I COULD NEVER JUSTIFY OWNING A PERSONAL COMPUTER AT HOME UH I MEAN THAT S QUITE AN EXPENSE TO LOOK FOR UH WELL WHO IS THIS WHAT DO YOU USE YOURS AT HOME FOR .
WELL THAT S ACTUALLY A GOOD QUESTION .
MY WIFE WORKS OUT OF THE HOME OUR HOME .
SHE HAS AN OFFICE AND IN FACT .
SHE SITS IN THE OFFICE AND SHE USES IT TO COMPOSE AND PRINT OUT LETTERS .
OKAY WELL NOW .
SO THAT S A VERY REGULAR USE OF IT THAT SHE HAS .
UHHUH .
AND IN ADDITION TO THAT I TINKER AROUND WITH IT .
I M A COMPUTER SCIENTIST .
OH .
AND SO I WRITE PROGRAMS TO DO LITTLE THINGS I M ACTUALLY WORKING ON A DATA BASE AT HOME JUST TO KEEP TRACK OF THINGS .
NOTHING SPECIAL .
AND ALSO I M INTERESTED IN WRITING SOME PROGRAMS .
THAT WILL KIND OF LIKE REMIND ME OF THINGS LIKE REMIND ME THAT WEDNESDAYS IS TRASH DAY AND THE LIKE .
UH HUH WELL EXCUSE ME I UH UH WELL I M A TECHNICIAN ELECTRONICS TECH .
YEARS AGO T I SENT ME TO THEIR UH COMPUTER SCHOOL DOWN IN AUSTIN .
UHHUH .
SO UH I LEARNED TO REPAIR ONE BUT YOU KNOW I NEVER REALLY LEARNED TO OPERATE ONE .
OH THAT S A KEY THING .
WELL ACTUALLY THAT S A THERE S REALLY TWO ISSUES TO THAT THAT THERE S SO MANY SOFTWARE PACKAGES AVAILABLE TODAY .
YES .
THAT JUST REQUIRE NO PROGRAMMING .
SO THAT YO IN OTHER WORDS WHEN SOMEONE BUILT THAT SOFTWARE PACKET .
THEY HAD TO USE THE PROGRAMMING BUT IF THEY WERE CAREFUL THEY COULD MAKE THE USE OF IT TOTALLY WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING HOW THE COMPUTER WORKS .
UHHUH .
BUT I THINK YOU .
YOU REALLY HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD .
FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON IS EXACTLY WHAT .
HE CAN USE IT FOR .
AND IF YOUR WIFE IS NT WORKING OUT OF THE HOME AND SENDING LETTERS OR IF YOU DO NT WANT TO BUILD A DATA BASE TO KEEP TRACK OF THE NUTS AND BOLTS IN YOUR GARAGE WHATEVER THERE YOUR ISSUE IS THEN THERE REALLY .
WELL UH SPACE IS A HANDICAP WITH ME I LIVE IN A MOTOR HOME .
OH I SEE WELL .
AND I M PREPARING FOR RETIREMENT .
I SEE WELL CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT .
AND I M NOT TO FAR FROM IT .
ANOTHER YEAR AND A HALF .
YEAH WELL ACTUALLY ONE OTHER THING .
I MIGHT OUGHT TO MENTION IS THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY GETTING QUITE CHEAP .
YES DEFINITELY BUT JUST LIKE THE COMPUTERS .
UHHUH .
UH REMEMBER HOW THEY STARTED OUT RUNNING THREE FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS .
RIGHT .
OH THE CALCULATORS YOU MEAN .
I MEAN CA CALCULATORS I BEG YOUR PARDON .
YEAH THEY SURE DO .
YEAH I ACTUALLY WAS THINKING ABOUT UPGRADING MINE VERY RECENTLY AND KIND OF LOOK AT THE WHOLE SPECTRUM .
YOU CAN ACTUALLY BUY A WHOLE BRAND NEW COMPUTER WITH A NOT NOT A NECESSARILY A SLOW ONE OR INADEQUATE ONE BUT A PRETTY GOOD ONE FOR SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS .
YOU RE KIDDING .
NO .
INCLUDING A PRINTER .
WELL ACTUALLY I WAS NT INCLUDING A PRINTER BUT YOU .
YOU CAN BUY A PRINTER NOW FOR A HUNDRED DOLLARS SO MAKE IT .
SEVEN HUNDRED .
A HUNDRED .
YEAH .
WHOLLY SMOKE A RESPECTABLE ONE .
YES UHHUH .
WELL SEE OF NOT BEING PARTICULARLY INTERESTED I DO NT KEEP TRACK OF PRICES ON THEM BUT I M I M THAT DOES AMAZE ME .
YEAH THE PRICES HAD PLUMMETED YOU CAN BUY THE COMPUTER .
THE GUTS JUST THE GUTS WITH THE POWER SUPPLY .
UHHUH .
THE BOX AND THE MOTHER BOARD OF A TYPE OF COMPUTER CALLED AN EIGHTY EIGHTYEIGHT FOR ABOUT TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS .
HUH .
AND THEN THE KEYBOARD IS ANOTHER FIFTY THE MONITOR WITH THE CARD .
THAT DRIVES IS ANOTHER HUNDRED AND THEN THE DISK DRIVE IS TWO FIFTY .
WELL WHAT WHAT IS A .
A GOOD BRAND .
A INEXPENSIVE .
WELL THAT S THAT S THE DEAL IS YOU RE NOT BUYING BRANDS NOW YOU RE BUYING THESE KNOCK OFFS SO THERE S PROBABLY THE WAY TO DO IT IF YOU REALLY WANTED TO BUY ONE IS THERE S A MAGAZINE CALLED COMPUTER SHOPPER .
UHHUH .
IT S A BIG MAGAZINE IT S TWELVE INCHES ACRO NARROW THE NARROW SIDE AND .
OH WOW .
SEVENTEEN INCHES .
THE TALL SIDE AND IT S PROBABLY AN INCH THICK A THOUSAND PAGES .
BUT THE BOOK IS THE MAGAZINE IS FULL OF THESE MAIL ORDER COMPUTER MAILORDER HOUSES AND THEY RE ALL COMPETING WITH EACH .
UHHUH .
SO YOU JUST FLIP THROUGH THERE UNTIL YOU FIND A EIGHTY EIGHTYEIGHT COMPUTER THAT THAT S CALLED IT S THE ORIGINAL P C .
SO IT S WE CALL THE T I I M SORRY AN .
I B M P C COMPATIBLE .
AND YOU LL FIND ALL THESE THINGS AND YOU LL FIND THE MONITORS FORTY DOLLARS AND THE CARD .
THAT DRIVES THE MONITOR .
THAT GOES IN THE BACK OF THE BOARD FOR TWENTYFIVE DOLLARS .
WHICH IS AMAZING TO ME .
UH .
AND YOU MIX AND MATCH AND THEN YOU DO IT BY MAILORDER .
BUT THERE S NO REAL BRANDS .
IT S PROBABLY A HALF A DOZEN COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD .
THAT ARE MAKING THOSE MOTHER BOARDS THE MAIN COMPUTER THE CIRCUIT BOARD .
I SEE .
HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT GETTING ONE OF THOSE .
A CATALOGS .
THEY RE AVAILABLE IN YOU KNOW THE B DALTONS THAT THAT TYPE OF THING .
UHHUH .
YOU LL NOTICE THAT IN THAT IT S IT S A IT S A ALTHOUGH IT S A MAGAZINE .
IT S LARGE .
AND LIKE I SAID IT S ABOUT AN INCH THICK .
UHHUH WELL GETTING BACK TO THE P C S I LL TELL YOU I .
YA FIRST OF ALL .
I DO NT LIKE A MACHINE .
THAT S SMARTER THAN ME .
AND SECONDLY I DID LEARN THIS MUCH ABOUT COMPUTERS THEY .
THEY ARE PRETTY STUPID BECAUSE THEY ADD ONE AND ONE UP AND COME UP WITH TEN .
IN BINARY .
THAT S RIGHT .
THERE S GREAT .
WELL ANYWAY THAT S ONE EVER MY FAVORITE JOKES .
OH YEAH .

YEAH THAT S GREAT .
COURSE .
IT S IT .
S KIND OF AN INSIDE JOKE YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
YOU CAN ONLY TELL THAT TO SOMEBODY .
WHO UNDERSTANDS BINARY .
I UNDERSTAND THAT S GREAT THAT S A GOOD JOKE .
SO WHAT DO YOU UH UH WORK WITH A COMPUTERS .
A AT T I .
I DID FOR YEARS AND THEN I WAS A SCIENTIST OVER IN CENTRAL RESEARCH LABS AND JUST RECENTLY I VE CHANGED MY JOB TO ACTUALLY DO SOME OF THE MARKETING .
UHHUH .
UH NOW I .
I TYPE THAT ONE BUT I DO NT USE IT ANYMORE .
UHHUH WELL I JUST RECENTLY STARTED USING ONE .
UHHUH .
IN CONNECTION WITH MY WORK .
YES .
UH I KEEP TRACK OF AN INVENTORY HERE .
UHHUH .
AND OF COURSE NOW THAT IS WHERE A COMPUTER IS VERY HANDY .
YES I AGREE .
AND WELL I IT S MY RESPONSIBILITY TO SEE THAT EQUIPMENT IS SENT OFF TO BE CALIBRATED .
OH YEAH .
SEE I M WITH THE Q R .
A LAB .
OH I SEE THAT S FASCINATING .
QUALIFICATION AND EVALUATION SO NATURALLY OUR EQUIPMENT HAS TO BE IN TOP CONDITION AND IS CONSTANTLY CALIBRATED .
UHHUH .
AND THEY RE DATED .
SO I HAVE TO KEEP UP WITH THEM UH AND AND IT S VERY HANDY DOING IT ON THE COMPUTER .
YEAH .
I JUST RUN A PRINTOUT .
EVERY WEEK AND AND IT PUTS ME RIGHT UPTODATE WHAT .
I M WHAT .
I HAVE TO DO WHAT .
I HAVE TO SHIP WHAT .
I SHOULD BE EXPECTING TO BE RETURNED .
UHHUH .
SO A IT .
IT IS HANDY .
RIGHT .
AND I MUST ADMIT THAT UP UNTIL I DID START USING ONE UH IT WAS I HAD VERY LITTLE INTEREST IN COMPUTERS .
YES .
BUT THEY ARE AMAZING .
YEAH THEY CERTAINLY ARE .
SO LET S SEE SEE SO I GUESS WITH RESPECT TO THE QUESTION YEAH I GUESS WE VE KIND OF COVERED IT .
I THINK WE DID .
GREAT NICE LITTLE CONVERSATION WITH YOU .
JACK .
YEAH MIKE YOU TAKE CARE NOW .
GOOD DAY .
GOOD LUCK TO YOU .
THANK YOU .
SAME TO YOU .
WHERE DO YOU LIVE .
UH IN THE HOUSTON AREA .
UHHUH .
WELL I USED TO .
I LIVED THERE FOR A LONG TIME .
BUT I M NOW IN PALO ALTO CALIFORNIA .
WHICH IS I THINK THE RECYCLING CAPITAL OF THE WORLD .
OH THAT S GREAT .
SO WE HAVE MANY RECYCLING ACTIVITIES AND I M AND IN FULL UH SUPPORT OF ALL OF THEM .
OH WE ARE TOO .
OUR COMMUNITY IS UH JUST STARTING TO GET ORGANIZED ABOUT IT .
THEY JUST OPENED UP A RECYCLING CENTER WHERE WE GO AND DONATE OUR OUR THINGS AND DUMP THEM OFF OURSELVES .
UHHUH .
AND UH IT .
WELL THAT S SOMETHING BUT IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE VE GOTTEN A WHOLE LOT BETTER UM COOPERATION OUT HERE UH BY SETTING IT UP SO THAT WE PAY JUST A LITTLE BIT EXTRA UH ACTUALLY I DO NT THINK WE PAY VERY MUCH EXTRA AT ALL TOO BUT THE UH GARBAGE MEN .
UHHUH .
COME BY UH ON YOUR REGULAR GARBAGE DAY AND PICK UP THE RECYCLING OUT AT THE CURB .
I THINK THAT S GREAT .
THERE S A FEW PLACES IN HOUSTON WHERE THEY RE TRYING THAT OUT .
I DO NT KNOW IF IT S THE IF THEY VE DONE IT CITYWIDE YET OR NOT WHERE THEY HAVE THE COLOR CODED UH BAGS AND UH BINS .
YEAH WE HAVE BURLAP SACKS .
OH .
AND THEY GIVE US .
ONE FOR ALUMINUM AND UH STEEL ONE FOR METALS .
UHHUH .
AND ONE FOR GLASS AND THEN YOU CAN EITHER BUNDLE YOUR NEWSPAPERS OR PUT THEM IN GROCERY BAGS .
SO WE HAVE WE LEAVE THREE LITTLE PILES .
THAT THEY NEED OUT ON THE CURB .
EVERY THURSDAY AND THE GARBAGE MEN COME BY AND UH COLLECT THEM AND LEAVE US NEW BAGS WHEN OURS GET OLD AND RATTY OR LEAVE THE ONES IF THEY RE STILL IN GOOD SHAPE .
OH THAT S GREAT .
AND THE IT REALLY PAYS FOR ITSELF BECAUSE OH THEN THE CITY .
UHHUH .
GETS THE MONEY FROM THE RECYCLING .
YEAH WE RE WE RE ALL FOR IT .
OUR UM WE VE GOT SEVERAL BINS IN OUR ON IN OUR GARAGE WHERE WE UH YOU KNOW SORT THINGS OUT AND AND TAKE IT TO TO THE APPROPRIATE PLACES .
YEAH THE ONE THING .
I WISH WE COULD RECYCLE IS MAGAZINES .
BUT THEY CLAIM THAT BECAUSE OF THE WAY .
THEY RE BOUND THEY UH IT S TOO EXPENSIVE TO RECYCLE THEM .
AT MY OFFICE .
YES .
WE HAVE TWO BIG CARDBOARD BOXES IN THE LIBRARY WHERE EVERYBODY GOES TO PICK UP THEIR MAIL AND THEY RE UH ONE S FOR WHITE PAPER AND ONE S FOR COLORED PAPER SO ANYTHING LIKE MANUSCRIPTS OR COMPUTER PAPER OR SO .
UHHUH .
THINGS LIKE THAT GOES IN THOSE BOXES BUT WE GET TONS OF CATALOGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND MAGAZINES AND THERE S NO WAY TO GET RID OF THEM .
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE SUCH A WASTE .
OH IT DOES .
IT DOES .
BUT I M SURE THAT THEY CAN UH FIND SOME SORT OF UH USE FOR THEM IF YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THERE I VE SEEN TALK ABOUT UH USING GARBAGE FOR UH ENERGY .
UHHUH .
AND SO YOU KNOW YOU COULD ALSO APPLY THE MAGAZINES TOWARD THAT .
WELL THAT WOULD BE A HELP .
I WISH THEY WOULD DO THAT HERE .
WE HAVE GOT SO LITTLE LANDFILL SPACE LEFT THAT WE RE GOING TO RUN OUT BEFORE THE END OF THIS DECADE .
YES .
AND IT S REALLY GOING TO BE A MESS WHEN THEY HAVE TO START HUNTING FOR PLACES TO PUT THE THINGS .
OH I KNOW IT .
WE DID HAVE UH ANOTHER NOVEL UH EXPERIMENT START THIS YEAR .
NOW WE CAN PUT ALL OUR YARD CLIPPINGS OUT .
OH .
YOU CAN YOU BUY THESE SUPER GIANT HEAVYDUTY PAPER BAGS THEY RE ABOUT FOURFEET HIGH .
UHHUH .
AND YOU GET THEM FOR I THINK IT S ABOUT FIFTY CENTS APIECE AT THE GROCERY STORE YOU UM USUALLY BUY THEM BY THE DOZEN .
UHHUH .
AND THEN YOU PUT ALL YOUR LAR YARD CLIPPINGS AND UH LEAF RAKINGS AND ANYTHING .
THAT WILL BE COMPOSTIBLE .
OH UHHUH .
AND THOSE AND THEY THE GARBAGE MEN ALSO PICK THOSE UP ON THURSDAYS .
OH THAT S GREAT .
AND THEN THE UH THEY TAKE THEM TO A SPECIAL PART OF OUR DUMP WHERE COMPOSTING IS NOW IN FULL SWING AND AT THE END OF EVERY YEAR UH THEY SELL ALL THE COMPOSTS TO NURSERYMEN AND TO LOCAL PEOPLE .
WHO WANT TO PUT IT ON THEIR FLOWER BEDS .
RIGHT WELL THAT S A GREAT IDEA .
I WISH WE WERE THAT UH INVOLVED IN UH OR THAT OUR CITY WAS SO INVOLVED IN THAT INVOLVED IN RECYCLING .
YEAH .
LIKE THAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW I VE TALKED TO MANY PEOPLE AND WE WOULD NT MIND GOING ITS EXTRA EFFORT TO DO IT .
UH .
IF THEY MAKE IT SO THAT IT S NOT A HORRENDOUS INCONVENIENCE I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD .
YEAH OH YEAH .
YOU KNOW AND I DO NT MIND YOU KNOW AT FIRST IT WAS THE THE LITTLE EXTRA MONEY THAT YOU GOT YOU KNOW RETURNING THE CANS IN AND STUFF LIKE THAT .
RIGHT .
BUT NOW YOU KNOW I DO NT MIND AS LONG AS THINGS ARE GETTING RECYCLED YOU KNOW THAT WE DO NT GET REIMBURSED .
NO I THINK IT S IT S TO ME MORE OF A CONVENIENCE TO HAVE THEM COME PICK IT UP .
UHHUH .
THEN TO GET THAT TWO CENTS WHEN YOU TAKE IT TO THE STORE .
OH I OH I KNOW IT .
WE STILL HAVE BINS AT THE GROCERY STORES WHERE YOU CAN TURN IN BOTTLES AND CANS .
UHHUH .
FOR CASH .
BUT SO FEW PEOPLE UH HAVE ENOUGH TO MAKE THAT WORTHWHILE YOU D SPEND MORE IN GAS GETTING DOWN THERE THEN YOU GET BACK .
RIGHT .
YES .
AND THEN THE PLUS THE TIME THAT YOU WASTE STANDING IN LINE IS VALUABLE ALSO .
NOW DO THE GROCERY STORES IN HOUSTON HAVE RECYCLING FOR THEIR PAPER BAGS AND PLASTIC BAGS .
WE HAVE I KNOW OF ONE THAT THE ONE THAT WE USE UH HAS UH RECYCLING FOR THE BAGS .
UHHUH .
AND UH AND THEY RE PROMOTING THE CLOTH BAGS .
YOU KNOW THE REUS REUSABLE CLOTH BAGS .
YEAH WELL WE CAN GET A NICKEL APIECE FOR ANY PAPER BAGS THAT WE BRING BACK TO BE REUSED .
OH THAT S GREAT .
THEY JUST TAKE IT OFF LIKE THEY DO A COUPON .
THEY CAN JUST SUBTRACT IT FROM YOUR BILL .
OH .
AND THEY HAVE A GIANT BIN BY THE FRONT DOOR FOR THE PLASTIC BAGS .
UHHUH .
AND THEY SAY Y AS LONG AS IT S CLEAN THEY DO NT WANT A PLASTIC BAG .
THAT S FULL OF GOOP .
YES .
HERE THEY DO NT WANT YOUR ROTTED TOMATOES .
BUT THEY WANT ANY CLEAN AND DRY PLASTIC BAG SO I KEEP AND THE THING IS I HARDLY HAVE ROOM NOW FOR ALL THE THINGS THAT WE RE SAVING IT TO RECYCLE SO RIGHT OUTSIDE THE BACK DOOR I VE GOT THE TWO BURLAP BAGS HUNG UP FOR THE CANS AND BOTTLES .
UHHUH .
AND WI THERE RIGHT OUTSIDE THE THAT PLACE WHERE THE GARBAGE CAN IS WE HAVE THE BAG FOR THE NEWSPAPERS .
AND NOW WE VE GOT THE BAG FOR THE PLASTIC BAGS .
I UNDERSTAND UH MY HUSBAND ABOUT ONCE A WEEKEND .
HE LL GO UH TO A COUPLE OF AREAS WHERE HE KNOWS THAT THE PEOPLE JUST THROW CANS OUT .
OH YEAH .
AND HE LL GO PICK THEM UP BECAUSE HE JUST CA NT STAND THAT .
HE HE .
WELL HOW NICE THAT S GREAT .
AND UH IT S SO YOU KNOW HE WE HAVE ALL OUR PILES OF OF RECYCLABLES ALSO .
UHHUH .
I REMEMBER AT CHRISTMAS .
THE THE ONLY THING THAT I M WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE COMPOSTING THE ONLY THING THAT OUR CITY DID THAT WAS THEY .
DI UH PROVIDED A PLACE FOR US TO TAKE OUR CHRISTMAS TREES .
UHHUH .
UH TO FOR THEM TO MULCH .
YEAH .
FOR FOR CITY USE .
WELL THAT S THEY JUST PUT ALL OUR CHRISTMAS TREES IN THE REGULAR UH COMPOST .
UHHUH .
PICKUP SO THEY DID SAY THAT YOU HAD TO PUT IT OUT WITHIN I THINK IT WAS UH THREE WEEKS AFTER .
UHHUH .
CHRISTMAS .
RIGHT .
AND UH OTHERWISE YOU WOULD HAVE TO TREAT IT LIKE YOU WOULD ANY OTHER LAWN REFUSE .
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE CUT INTO FOURFOOT LENGTHS .
SO YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE BRANCHES OR SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
THEY HAVE TO BE CUT IN FOURFOOT LENGTHS BUT OTHERWISE UH THEY HAVE TO BE IN ONE OF THEIR PAPER BAGS .
WELL THAT SOUNDS LIKE YOU .
ALL REALLY HAVE A A GREAT SYSTEM WORKED OUT THERE .
AND THEY EVEN PICKED UP OUR UH STYROFOAM PL PACKING MATERIALS .
THEY BROUGHT UH THE WEEK AFTER CHRISTMAS THEY LEFT A PLASTIC BAG ON EVERYBODY .
S FRONT DOORKNOB WITH A LITTLE NOTE ON IT SAYING WE RE TRYING SOMETHING .
NEW NEXT WEEK ONLY .
UHHUH .
IF YOU HAVE ANY UH OF THOSE LITTLE UH STYROFOAM PEANUTS .
THAT .
UHHUH .
ANY OF YOUR CHRISTMAS PRESENTS WERE PACKED IN PUT THEM IN THIS BAG AND LEAVE IT OUT WITH YOUR RECYCLING AND WE LL UH TAKE ALL OF THOSE BACK AND TRY TO RECYCLE THEM .
RIGHT .
WELL SEE THAT S ONE .
BUT I THAT S NOT GOING TO BE A REGULAR FEATURE .
THAT WAS JUST A ONE TIME THING RIGHT AFTER CHRISTMAS .
WELL THE BUT UH SOMETHING .
NEE DOES NEED TO BE DONE ABOUT THE STYROFOAM THAT UH .
WELL THOSE THINGS MUST TAKE UP A HUGE AMOUNT OF SPACE IN LANDFILLS .
OH YEAH I MEAN THEY DO NT UH UH .
THEY DO NT MASH .
NO .
THEY DO NT COMPRESS AT ALL .
AND THEY STAY FOREVER .
RIGHT .
AND I VE SEEN WHERE SOME PLACES HAVE TAKEN A PLASTIC AND UH THEY RE RECYCLING THEM INTO OTHER PLASTICS .
UHHUH .
AND THE STYROFOAM ALSO INTO INSULATION AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE GREAT IF THEY COULD GET SOMETHING ORGANIZED ALONG THOSE LINES .
YEAH I DO TOO .
THE DIFFICULTY WITH THAT IS THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE HAVE ENOUGH TO MAKE IT WORTHWHILE .
IT THEY REALLY HAVE TO RELY ON BUSINESSES .
THAT GENERATE A LOT OF THAT STUFF .
RIGHT .
UH BECAUSE OTHERWISE UH YOU KNOW THEY RE NOT GOING TO GO HOUSETOHOUSE COLLECTING IT AND YOU RE NOT GOING TO BOTHER IF YOU HAVE ONE BAG FULL .
UHHUH .
TO DRIVE ALL THE WAY TO SOME .
RECYCLING CENTER TO TURN IN JUST YOUR LITTLE PLASTIC PEANUTS .
RIGHT .
OH I WAS THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW LIKE THE UH THE STYROFOAM USED AT UH THE FASTFOOD RESTAURANTS .
YEAH .
THAT IF EVERYBODY UH AND SO YEAH I KNOW LIKE OUR CAFETERIA HERE USES A LOT OF STYROFOAM BUT UH .
NOW WE QUIT THAT ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO NO THREE YEARS AGO WHEN WE GOT CHINA MUGS FOR EVERYBODY .
HUH .
SO AND THE ONLY DIFFICULTY WITH THAT IS THAT WE RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIVEYEAR DROUGHT AND SO I IT S A REAL DIFFICULT CHOICE WHETHER WE WANT STYROFOAM CUPS TO FILL UP OUR LANDFILLS OR UH CHINA CUPS TO USE UP OUR WATER .
BUT AT THE MOMENT .
WE RE USING THE CHINA CUPS .
AND EVERYBODY GETS ONE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR AND THEN UH YOUR SUPPOSED TO KEEP IT RECYCLED EVERY DAY .
WELL THAT S GOOD .
THAT S A .
YEAH .
THEY SHOULD LAST AWHILE .
WELL LET US HOPE THAT EVERYBODY S GOING TO BE PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO THIS AND THAT WE WILL GET UH BETTER REUSE OF THINGS BECAUSE .
I BELIEVE WE ARE .
I H I HAVE TO BELIEVE EVERYBODY IS STARTING TO PAY ATTENTION AND TAKE HEED OF WHAT IS HAPPENING .
YEP .
AND SO IT WILL IT WILL BE GOOD .
IT SURE WILL .
IN THE LONG RUN .
WELL I ENJOYED IT .
WELL GOOD TO TALK .
HELLO .
HELLO I WAS I WAS THINKING ABOUT OUR TOPIC FOR THE NIGHT UM IMMIGRATION PROBLEMS WE HAVE IMMIGRATION PROBLEMS AND WHAT DO DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT .
WELL I THINK IT S A VERY VERY COMPLICATED .
HUH .
AND I SORT OF I SEE PERSPECTIVES ON ALL SIDES UM AND I VE RE HAVE NO HOPE FOR SOLUTIONS BUT UH I DO KEEP MYSELF SOMEWHAT ABREAST OF THE ISSUE I HAVE WORKED WITH UH UH A LITTLE BIT WITH REFUGEES FROM .
SOUTHEAST ASIA UH WHO VE COME OVER UH YOU KNOW TO ESCAPE THE GENOCIDE PROGRAMS THAT ARE OVER THERE AND SEEN YOU KNOW HEARD ABOUT SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT THEY VE HAD AND I M ALSO FAIRLY SENSITIVE TO THE ISSUES ABOUT HOW OPEN SHOULD THE BORDERS BE BECAUSE I IN GENERAL LIKE A SMALLER RATHER THAN A LARGER POPULATION .
UHHUH .
TO THE LAND AREA .
UHHUH .
AND UH .
WHERE ARE YOU .
I M IN CALIFORNIA .
SEE .
WHICH HAS A LOT OF IMMIGRATION PROBABLY MORE THAN ANY WHERE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY THOUGH I M NOT SURE IF THAT S THE CASE .
WELL WE VE GOT A LOT TOO I M IN TEXAS .
UHHUH YEAH .
IN GARLAND RIGHT OUTSIDE OF DALLAS .
UHHUH UHHUH .
SO WE RE GETTING A LARGE OH GOSH I DO NT KNOW I THINK THERE S LIKE TWENTYSIX DIFFERENT LANGUAGES NOW THAT ARE SPOKEN IN I THE I S D DALLAS INNERCITY SCHOOL DISTRICT .
UHHUH UHHUH .
CAMBODIANS UH ASIANS VIETNAMESE WE WE RE GETTING A LOT OF UH MEXICAN AMERICANS YOU KNOW WE VE HAD .
YEAH .
THOSE FOR A LONG TIME .
SURE WELL TEXAS .
USED TO BE PART OF MEXICO OR MOST OF IT .
YES OH YES NO I M BUSY RIGHT NOW STEVEN STEVEN WANTS ME TO DO POPCORN RIGHT NOW .
HUH .
OKAY AND I DO NT KNOW WHAT THE SOLUTION IS .
I I DO NT EITHER IT S A REALLY DELICATE UH MORAL ISSUE BECAUSE I IF YOU HAVE WELL I GUESS THE ONE THING I DO SEE THAT IS IS THAT NEEDS TO BE A SOLUTION IS THAT IF YOU DO LET PEOPLE INTO THE COUNTRY I DO FEEL YOU HAVE A CERTAIN OBLIGATION TO .
TO GET THEM ON THEIR .
TO GET THEM ON THEIR FEET .
YEAH .
BECAUSE OTHERWISE WHAT YOU RE DOING IS YOU RE LETTING PEOPLE IN AND YOU RE YOU RE DOOMING THEM TO BEING UNDERCLASS PEOPLE .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW YOU RE DOOMING THEM TO GHETTO LIFE OR WHATEVER AND I KNOW THAT THAT THE SOUTHEAST ASIANS THE HMONG PEOPLE THAT I VE DONE SOME WORK WITH UH FEEL VERY QUITE HURT AND AND UNSURE OF THEMSELVES WHEN HERE BECAUSE THEY RE COMING FROM YOU KNOW FROM THE SLASH AND BURN INTERCULTURAL SOCIETY YOU KNOW THEY RE COMING FROM THE MIDDLE AGES BASICALLY AND THEY RE BEING PLUNKED DOWN PLUNKED DOWN INTO AMERICA MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN PROMISED BY THE C I A DURING THE WAR OVER THERE THAT BECAUSE THEY COOPERATED WITH THE C I A AND THEY HELPED THE C I A OUT THAT WHEN THEY CAME HERE THE C I A WOULD HELP ESTABLISH THEM IN AMERICA AND THE C I A OF COURSE IS NT DOING THAT .
UM .
AND UH SO THEY COME HERE AND THEY DO NT KNOW WH WHAT THE HECK THEY RE DOING AND THEY RE FINDING THEMSELVES ADRIFT IN THE BIG CITIES AND OF COURSE THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE BIG CITIES WHO WOULD DO LIKE NOTHING BETTER THAN TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM .
UHHUH .
AND THEY RE THEY RE INCREDIBLE VICTIMS OF CRIME AND PART OF IT IS THIS LACK OF .
LACK OF BASIC INFORMATION BEING DISSIMILATED AND I M NOT SAYING IT S EASY TO DO AND I KNOW THERE ARE A FEW PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING BUT BUT THE FUNDING IS NT THERE FOR VERY MUCH WORK TO BE GOING ON .
AND THERE S A LOT OF GRAFT LIKE PEOPLE TRYING TO TELL THEM OH GIVING THEM INFORMATION THAT WAS FREE TO THEM ANYWAY IF THEY JUST KNEW HOW TO GET IT .
UH YEAH EXACTLY Y HA .
YEAH .
I MEAN THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO DO NT HAVE THE FOGGIEST IDEA ABOUT WHAT AMERICA S LIKE .
RIGHT .
UM AND IT S VER IT S I I COULD NT REALLY CONCEPTUALIZE HOW HARD IT WAS TO UNDERSTAND THAT UNTIL I UNTIL I MET WITH THEM AND I REALIZED THAT THEY SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT I JUST YOU KNOW DO NT EVEN REALIZE AND KNOW IS INFORMATION THEY DO NT HAVE AND I NEVER THOUGHT WELL I GUESS THAT IS SOMETHING YOU NEED TO KNOW YOU KNOW PEOPLE GETTING INTO TROUBLE BECAUSE THEY COME HERE AND SO THEY START FARMING ON UH AVAILABLE LAND YOU KNOW LIKE THE MEDIAN STRIPS ON FREEWAYS BECAUSE NO ONE S USING IT BUT THEN SOMEONE COMES ALONG AND SAYS YOU CA NT DO THAT YOU KNOW WHY CA NT THEY THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHY NOT SOME SOME OF THEM YOU KNOW THE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN HERE LONGER AND HAVE BEEN IN YOU KNOW UNDERSTAND NOW BUT WHEN THEY INITIALLY COME OVER .
YOU MEAN REALLY TRYING TO PLANT SOMETHING THAT S WHAT YOU RE SAYING .
YEAH .
FARMING .
CAUSE THEY RE FARMERS THESE .
OH .
ARE ALL FARMERS COMING OVER AND THEY RE BEING PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CITY .
OH THAT S TERRIBLE .
I MEAN THEY RE NOMADIC FARMERS YOU KNOW THEY RE PEOPLE WHO FARM ON THE HILLSIDE AND THEN LEAVE THE HILLSIDE TO ANOTHER HILLSIDE AND FARM ON THAT HILLSIDE .
UHHUH .
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO VE NEVER SEEN FLAT GROUND BEFORE AND PEOPLE WHO VE NEVER SEEN PROPERTY RIGHTS BEFORE YOU KNOW THESE PEOPLE WHO VE NEVER SEEN ANY MACHINES OTHER THAN THOSE USED IN WAR AND UH THEY HAVE YOU KNOW SO I I I DO HAVE A LOT OF SYMPATHY FOR THEM AND I FEEL THAT AMERICA COULD TRY A LITTLE BIT HARDER TO TO HELP PEOPLE ADJUSTING TO THE AMERICAN WAY BECAUSE IF THEY DO NT YOU RE JUST GOING TO PRODUCE YOU KNOW YOU RE GOING TO PRODUCE AN UNDERCLASS YOU KNOW YOU RE GOING TO GET A SITUATION THAT I THINK A LOT LIKE WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BLACKS BEING SORT OF LED OUT OF SLAVERY AND THEN THEN MANY OF THEM ENDED UP JUST WORKING THE SAME JOBS THEY WERE AS SLAVES THEN AND THERE WAS NO .
AND NOT BEING CARED FOR .
REAL UP UPWARD MOVEMENT AND NOT BEING YOU KNOW .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
UM .
WELL WHAT DID YOU DO WHEN YOU HELPED THESE PEOPLE .
WELL .
HOW DID YOU WHAT DID YOU DO TRU .
I I WAS NT HELPING THEM I WORKED WITH THEM NOT TO HELP THEM BUT FOR MY OWN PURPOSES I M I M A LINGUIST AND I WAS UH DOING A LANGUAGE TRYING TO LEARN THEIR LANGUAGE A LITTLE BIT AND I ACTUALLY UM I MEAN HELPED THEM THEM IN THE SENSE THAT THEY RECEIVED MONEY FOR WORKING WITH ME BUT I DID NT I DID NT I WAS NT A SOCIAL WORKER OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT .
ALL RIGHT .
I DO HAVE FRIENDS WHO HAVE TRIED TO DO MORE .
UHHUH .
SOCIAL WORK .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW BY EXPLAINING TO PEOPLE HOW THE LANGUAGE .
AND WHAT THE PROBLEMS LEARNING ENGLISH MIGHT BE AND SUCH .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE ALL THE MODELS OF TEACHING ENGLISH ARE BASED ON TEACHING ENGLISH TO SPANISH SPEAKERS OR TO OTHER EUROPEAN LANGUAGE SPEAKERS AND PEOPLE DO NT REALIZE HOW DIFFERENT SOME OF THE LANGUAGES THEY SPEAK ARE .
WELL I M AN E S L TEACHER .
OH YOU ARE .
YES .
UHHUH WELL YOU .
I GOT MY CERTIFICATION BUT ACTUALLY THEY DID NOT TEACH US VERY MANY THINGS ABOUT HOW REALLY TO GO ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE TO LEARN ANOTHER LANGUAGE .
THAT S THAT S BEEN MY IMPRESSION .
I MEAN IT S LIKE PEOPLE DO NT KNOW WHAT THEY SAY .
YEAH IT S IT S NOT THEY RE NOT WITHHOLDING INFORMATION .
IT S NOT STEP FOR STEP .
THEY JUST DO NT HAVE THAT INFORMATION .
YEAH .
THEY THEY HAVE NT THE FOGGIEST IDEA .
BUT ANYWAY I ENJOY IT THEY THEY THE KIDS I VE WORKED WITH SO FAR HAVE BEEN SPANISH SPEAKING .
YES .
AND .
AND SPANISH IS .
BUT I M APPLYING FOR .
PRETTY CLOSE TO ENGLISH REALLY .
WHAT YEAH IT IS .
AND SPANISH IS A LOT LIKE ENGLISH .
A LOT OF OUR WORDS ARE THE SAME .
YEAH .
LIKE YOU KNOW .
YEAH YEAH .
THEY JUST CHANGE THE PRONUNCIATION A LITTLE BIT .
YEAH .
BUT I LOVE IT I LOVE THE CULTURE UH THE WAY THAT THEY UH THEY RESPECT EDUCATION AND THEIR TEACHERS .
UHHUH UHHUH .
THEIR PARENTS SO MUCH MORE THAN THAN MY CHILDREN DO .
UHHUH UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND I LIKE IT AND WHAT I VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT DOING IS VOLUNTEERING FOR THIS UH ASIAN CENTER THAT A DOCTOR FALK HAS STARTED THAT WORKS WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT .
UHHUH .
AND DOING WHAT TRYING TO GET THEM SET UP IN INCULTURATED .
UHHUH .
INTO THE SYSTEM .
UHHUH .
I THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE GOOD EXPERIENCE FOR ME .
OH I M SURE IT WOULD .
AND I VE APPLIED AT ANOTHER DISTRICT WHERE MANY OF THE CHILDREN ARE ASIAN .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL TOO .
YEAH IT WOULD BE A GOOD EXPERIENCE AND YOU D BE HELPING PEOPLE I M SURE VERY MUCH AND N AND I MEAN NOT TO PUT NOT TO TRIVIALIZE THE PROBLEMS OF ANY IMMIGRANT GROUP BUT I DO KNOW THE ASIAN GROUPS ARE HAVING A LOT OF TROUBLE I MEAN AND PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT A LOT OF CHINESE AND JAPANESE IMMIGRATION FROM YOU KNOW DECADES AGO HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE THEY VALUED EDUCATION AND SO FORTH .
RIGHT .
THEY BECAME A VERY SUCCESSFUL IMMIGRANT GROUP BUT AND BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE COMING OVER FROM VIETNAM RIGHT NOW COMING FROM WORN TORN COUNTRIES ARE ARE NA NOT HAVING THE SAME SUCCESS I THINK SOME PEOPLE HAVE JUST ASSUMED WELL WHY WHY CA NT YOU BE SUCCESSFUL THE JAPANESE WERE OR THE CHINESE WERE OR SOMETHING AND IT S REALLY MUCH MORE COMPLICATED .
WELL THE TIMES WERE DIFFERENT TOO .
YEAH THE TIMES ARE DIFFERENT YEAH .
MY NEIGHBOR LET S SEE IS JEWISH AND HE S GOING THROUGH THE I DO NT KNOW THE JEWISH LEAGUE OR SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
AND HELPING A FAMILY THAT S COME OVER FROM RUSSIA .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND HE SPENDS WELL RIGHT NOW HE S DOWN TO LIKE ONCE A WEEK BUT HE WAS GOING OVER THERE SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK TO BE WITH THE FAMILY .
UHHUH .
AND HELP THEM WITH THE LANGUAGE AND HE THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IT .
OH YEAH I I THINK IT S A WONDERFUL THING TO DO AND THERE S A LOT THERE S A LOT MORE I GUESS ANOTHER POSSIBLE SOLUTION IS SINCE TAXPAYERS ARE NT GOING TO START PAYING MORE MONEY FOR THIS AND AND OTHER BUDGETS ARE NT GOING TO BE CUT TO PAY FOR IT UH .
NO .
MORE OF THE VOLUNTEER NETWORK SERVICE BECAUSE EVERYONE GAINS FROM IT .
UHHUH .
WOULD BE WOULD MIGHT BE REALLY USEFUL UH AND IF IT S YOU KNOW UH JUST PEOPLE HELPING PEOPLE I THINK MAKES MAKES THE COMMUNITY SO MUCH HAPPIER .
UHHUH WHAT S SO SAD ABOUT THIS IS BOTH OF THE THE MAN AND THE WOMAN HAD A DEGREE HAVING TO DO WITH COMPUTERS BUT .
UHHUH .
THEIR TRAINING IS NT WHAT WE NEED IN THIS COUNTRY .
YES .
AND BECAUSE THEY RE SO DEFICIENT IN ENGLISH THEY HAVE NT BEEN ABLE TO GET JOBS .
UHHUH UHHUH .
SO THEY LL HAVE TO GO BACK AND GET A DEGREE HERE YOU KNOW ALMOST START ALL OVER .
YES YES I VE KNOWN PEOPLE WITH EFFECTIVELY WORTHLESS DEGREES IN THIS COUNTRY I MEAN AND THEY RE HIGHLY EDUCATED PEOPLE BUT OF COURSE IF YOU RE EDUCATED AND YOU DO NT SPEAK ENGLISH NO ONE THINKS ANYTHING OF YOU .
NO NO AND THIS WOMAN WAS UH STOCKING THE SHELVES IN A DRUGSTORE .

UM THEN YOUR KIND FAMILY IS PROBABLY PRETTY RARE NOW A DAYS I DO NT SEE A LOT OF FAMILIES FISHING AND DOING THINGS LIKE THAT THAT S GREAT .
WELL I M DIVORCED BUT THAT S WHAT WHEN SHE S WITH ME THAT S WHAT WE DO .
YEAH .
AND WE COLOR A LOT AND I READ HER STORIES .
UHHUH THAT S GREAT .
YEAH .
I THINK A LOT OF FAMILIES NOW THEY PROBABLY DO NT SPEND ENOUGH TIME TOGETHER .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW WHETHER THEIR PARENTS ARE TOGETHER OR DIVORCED THEY DO NT SPEND ENOUGH TIME TOGETHER AND AND I THINK THAT CONTRIBUTES TO A LOT OF WHY SOCIETY IS GOING DOWNHILL RIGHT NOW IS BECAUSE THE BASIC FAMILY UNIT IS BEING DESTROYED JUST SIMPLY BECAUSE THAT TIME IS NT SPENT JUST DOING THINGS LIKE FISHING AND UH BECAUSE THAT I THINK THAT WHEN YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH EACH OTHER YOU COMMUNICATE A LOT AND THE COMMUNICATION HELPS YOU BUILD ON YOUR UH HELPS JUST JUST BUILD YOUR FAMILY .
UHHUH AND EVEN EVEN WHEN I WAS WHEN I WAS UH LIVING WITH HER WITH DID STUFF THEN TOO .
UHHUH .
SO .
YEAH THAT S PRETTY TO ME THAT S PRETTY RARE .
YEAH I KNOW .
I LIKE THAT WHENEVER I DO HAVE CHILDREN I I M GOING TO TRY AS HARD AS I CAN TO S SEE THAT WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER YOU KNOW MAYBE JUST EVEN IF WE JUST RENT A MOVIE AND WATCH IT TOGETHER JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY S NOT GOING OUT AND DOING AND THEIR HER OWN THING ALL THE TIME .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THAT S GOOD SOMETIMES BECAUSE YOU NEED TO YOU KNOW GET AWAY BUT UM I DO NT THINK YOU YOU SHOULD SPEND TOO MUCH TIME OUTSIDE AT THE DETRIMENT OF OF LOSING YOUR FAM THE FAMILY UNIT .
YEAH THAT S RIGHT BECAUSE THEN YOU NEVER GET TO KNOW THEM EITHER .
UHHUH .
THEY RE ALL GROWN UP AND THEIR .
YEAH YEAH AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT I DO NT KNOW I HAVE NT EXPERIENCED IT BUT .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW KIDS THESE DAYS ARE GROWING UP SO MUCH FASTER .
UHHUH .
AND ONCE THEY HIT LIKE TEN OR ELEVEN OR TWELVE YOU KNOW YOU VE PRETTY MUCH LOST THEM .
YEAH THEY RE OUT DOING STUFF BY THAT TIME .
YEAH SO UM DO YOU THINK THAT YOU DO YOU THINK THAT YOUR FAMILY IS PRETTY RARE IN THAT YOU DO A LOT OF THINGS OR JUST THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR DAUGHTER .
YEAH I REALLY DO BECAUSE BECAUSE I DO NT SEE MANY OTHERS MUMBLEX AND WHEN WHENEVER WE GO TO THE PARK OR SOMETHING SOMETIMES ON THE WEEKDAYS WE LL SEE OTHER FAMILIES .

WELL I THINK THEY CAN TURN OFF THE T V FOR ONE THING .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
AND AND GO OUT AND DO STUFF YOU KNOW .

BECAUSE SHE ALWAYS LIKES TO DO THINGS WHENEVER THE T V S OFF YOU KNOW SHE LL FORGET ABOUT THE T V COMPLETELY .

UHHUH .
BECAUSE I TAPED THE STORIES FROM EARLIER TODAY .
RIGHT .
AND I LIKE TO WATCH EM BUT I THINK THAT S THAT IS A BIG PROBLEM THE TELEVISION AND IT S IT S TOO STATIC YOU KNOW IT S SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN DO BUT THERE S NO THINKING INVOLVED NO MOTION YOU KNOW AND I THINK THINK THAT S ANOTHER REASON WHY PEOPLE ARE UH SO HEALTH CONSCIOUS NOW IS BECAUSE AMERICA S BECOMING REALLY A COUCH POTATO SOCIETY .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE NT DOING ANYTHING JUST SITTING AROUND YOU KNOW NO THINKING INVOLVED AND NOW I THINK I THINK PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GET OUT OF THAT AT LEAST AND THAT UM THERE S A LOT OF UM IT S BECOMING REALLY HEALTH CONSCIOUS AND THAT PEOPLE ARE YOU KNOW STARTING TO LOOK OUT FOR CHOLESTEROL AND THINGS LIKE THAT TRYING TO GET OUT AND WORKOUT MORE OFTEN AND JOG AND WALK AND DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT AND THAT S PROBABLY GOOD YOU KNOW IF YOU GET YOUR FAMILY INVOLVED IN EXERCISING AND MAYBE PLAYING TENNIS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT ALSO HELPS THAT S ALSO SOMETHING YOU KNOW FAMILY ORIENTED THAT EVERYONE CAN DO .

RIGHT .
IT OUGHT TO GO IT IT S JUST IT S RIDICULOUS WHAT KILLS ME IS WHEN THEY HAD A CHANCE TO TO UH PUT INTO AC ACTION THE THE G THE GLEN RUB WHAT IS IT UH THE ACT WHERE THEY HAD TO CUT EVERYTHING ACROSS THE BOARD .

YEAH NO I THINK UH IT IS THE CONGRESS AND THEM JUST DO NT HAVE ANY INTEREST IN SAVING US MONEY UH .
THEY SURE DO NT SEEM TO .
THE NATIONAL DEBT IS TERRIBLE UH .
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS I THINK WE NEED TO REALLY WORK FOR AND I DO NT KNOW QUITE HOW TO DO IT BUT I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE THE ONE LINE UH UH VETO SO THAT THEY DO NT HAVE TO SPEND SO MUCH TIME DOING EVERYTHING IF IT S A GOOD IDEA .
RIGHT .
IT CAN BE DONE AGAIN .
OH YEAH .
YOU KNOW AND IF IT S NOT SO WHAT AT LEAST YOU HAVE NT THROWN OUT ALL THE WORK THEY VE DONE FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS .
I SAW ONE ON TWENTY TWENTY ABOUT A MONTH AGO I GUESS WHEREAS ONE I THINK THAT HE WAS A SENATOR FROM PENNSYLVANIA OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT MAYBE IT WAS UH CONNECTICUT I M NOT SURE ONE OF THE SMALL STATES UP THERE WHERE HE HAD A BILL THROUGH FOR ANOTHER UH A DRUG AGENCY THAT WOULD BE LOCATED THERE AND HE WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT WANTED IT WAS GOING TO COST MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THE DRUG AGENCY DID NT WANT IT AND HE WAS GOING TO BUILD IT IN HIS HOME TOWN AND THEY WERE GOING TO HIRE A LOT OF PEOPLE .
AND IT WAS RIDICULOUS YOU KNOW THE WHOLE THING .
YEAH THIS IS THAT S RIGHT .
AND AND YOU KNOW THEY ASKED HIM ABOUT IT DO YOU REALLY NEED THIS THIS IS GOING TO COST A LOT OF MONEY OH YES WE NEED IT BUT DO YOU KNOW THAT THE DRUG AGENCY DOES NT WANT THIS .
YEAH .
AND THEY DO THINGS THAT ARE YOU KNOW JUST LIKE THE UH .
YEAH THAT S JUST AN AWFUL LOT OF THAT KIND OF THING GOING ON .
YEAH THAT .
AND THE TROUBLE IS YOU DO NT YOU HAVE SO LITTLE INPUT ABOUT IT YOU DO NT KNOW .
RIGHT .
ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT WHAT TO DO ABOUT SOME OF THIS STUFF .
RIGHT .
I .
THEY RE SUPPOSED TO DO WHAT WE SAY BUT THEY DO WHAT THEY THEY WANT TO DO WITH IT .
YEAH THAT S RIGHT THE OTHER THING ABOUT IS I THINK UH LIMITING THEIR TIME IN OFFICE WOULD BE GOOD I I JUST .
ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY .
CA NT BELIEVE THERE ARE NT OTHER PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT COULD DO JUST AS WELL AS WHAT WE VE GOT .
WE NEED TO GET THAT THROUGH WE WE HAVE SAID THAT I VE SAID IT SEVERAL TIMES ON DIFFERENT SUBJECTS ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT THAT TWO YEA TWO TERMS IS ENOUGH FOR ALL OF THEM .
YEAH .
UH WHETHER YOU RE MAYOR ALL THE WAY UP CITY COUNCIL THE WORKS I THINK CERTAINLY PRESIDENT THAT UH TWO TERMS IS PLENTY .
YEAH I THINK THAT S RIGHT .
AND THEN WE GET THESE PROFESSIONALS OUT OF THERE AND THEY HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO EARN A LIVING AGAIN THEMSELVES YOU KNOW RATHER THAN .
YEAH WOULD NT THAT BE TOO BAD .
LIVING OFF OF US .
WELL THAT S RIGHT I THINK I DO NT KNOW I THINK UH PEOPLE IN GENERAL THE THE THE IDEA OF WHAT YOU NEED TO TO EXIST IS SO OUTRAGEOUS THAT IT S NOT .
UHHUH .
HARDLY YOU KNOW IT STARTS AT THE COURTS IT STARTS EVERYWHERE .
RIGHT .
UNTIL WE CA NT WE VE JUST LOST CONTROL OF OF ANY KIND OF PERSPECTIVE ABOUT WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE AND WHAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE YOU KNOW .
WELL IT S SO MUCH MONEY AND YOU CA NT EVEN ADD IT UP YOU KNOW .
NO YOU CA NT EVEN .
THAT S WHY THEY THINK .
CA NT EVEN CONCEIVE OF WHAT THEY RE TALKING ABOUT .
YEAH WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS .

ON THIS AND THAT OUR NATIONAL .
YEAH .
DEBT IN THE TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS YOU KNOW .
I MEAN IT JUS AND AND YOU JUST THE OTHER THING IS IT S IT S ALL VERY WELL TO GIVE MONEY TO HELP PEOPLE OTHER PEOPLE AND I THINK WE NEED TO DO THAT BUT THERE ARE THEY NEED TO PUT MORE LIMITS ON THEM THEY NEED TO RESTRAIN .
FOREIGN AID YEAH .
ABOUT WHAT THEY DO .
FOREIGN AID MEANS TO GO DOWN TO ALMOST ZERO UNLESS IT S ABSOLUTELY .
YEAH .
NECESSARY THEY THEY VE GIVEN THAT AWAY FOR FIFTY YEARS .
I I YOU KNOW I THINK THAT S PROBABLY UN UNLESS WE CAN AFFORD IT IF WE PAY OFF THE DEBTS THEN WE CAN GIVE IT TO PEOPLE AGAIN .
I AGREE I AGREE .
YOU KNOW I DO NT REALLY MIND HELPING PEOPLE BUT YOU YOU NEED TO GET RID OF THIS THING THAT S THAT S JUST UH EATING US UP .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND GET THINGS ON A ON AN EVEN IF IT WERE IF IT WERE A FAMILY WE D BE UP BEFORE THE THE MAGISTRATE .
RIGHT .
FOR FOR DOING ALL THESE WICKED THINGS YOU KNOW BUT THE GOVERNMENT DOES IT AND IT S ALL RIGHT .
YEAH I I KNOW WE RE TAXED TO DEATH ON EVERY EVERY THING I DO NT KNOW WHAT S THE BEST WAY TO DO IT BUT UH THEY DO NT EVEN TALK ABOUT THAT THEY JUST RAISE IT THEY DO NT EVEN CONSIDER IT LIKE YOU SAYING .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
TO CUT SOMETHING BACK YOU KNOW .
WELL SOUNDS LIKE .
THEY ARE AT LEAST DOING SOMETHING NOW WITH THE THE MILITARY YOU KNOW THEY RE CUTTING SOME OF THAT BUT OF COURSE NOW YOU KNOW T I YOU KNOW THAT S HURTING US BUT ALTHOUGH .
YEAH IT S GOOD TO SEE THEM DOING SOME THINGS THERE ANYWAY .
BUT T I HAS GOTTEN A LOT OF GOOD CONTRACTS FROM THE WAR AND EVERYTHING ELSE AND IF THEY LL GET A LOT OF PROGRAMS IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE OF THEIR EXOTIC UH .
YEAH .
WEAPON SYSTEMS BUT UH THAT S THE ONLY GOOD THAT I VE SEEN CONGRESS DO YOU KNOW AND EVERYBODY .
WELL .
AND ALL THE CONGRESSMEN AND THE PRESIDENT AND EVERYBODY UH .
I THINK WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT WHATEVER HAPPENS WE RE GOING TO HAVE TO BITE THE BULLET AND WE RE ALL GOING TO HAVE TO DO IT I IT JUST IS NT FAIR THOUGH THAT WHEN THIS HAPPENS IN SOME PLACES IT NEEDS TO ALL COME OFF EVERYWHERE .
YEAH YEAH .
THAT S WHY I THOUGHT WELL YOU KNOW THIS IS THE TIME THEY NEED TO PUT THAT INTO ACT INTO ACTION AND SHOW THEY MEAN BUSINESS THAT THEY VE GOT TO CUT THEY VE GOT TO CUT COSTS .
YEAH THE ONLY TAXES I THINK THAT ARE WELL SPENT WELL NOT THE ONLY BUT UH I THINK THE NOW I I DO NT UNDERSTAND THE PRESENT SCHOOL THING BUT UH I HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS ONE S IN COLLEGE ALREADY AND ONE S ABOUT TO BE IN HIGH SCHOOL BUT UH I THINK THAT PAYING FOR SCHOOL SCHOOLS IS THE SCHOOLS IS THE ONLY ANSWER REALLY TO GET RID OF CRIME AND SO I DO NT MIND PAYING FOR SCHOOL .
YEAH I THINK THAT S RIGHT .
TAXES EVEN THOUGH MY KIDS WILL BE OUT OF IT YOU KNOW .
WELL I DO NT I DO NT REALLY MIND PAYING TAXES FOR FOR POSITIVE THINGS THAT ARE HELPS LIKE ROADS AND .
YEAH .
MAKING SURE THAT UH THAT WATER IS SAFE AND SOME OF THESE THINGS BUT UM YOU KNOW IT YOU JUST FEEL LIKE IT S OUT OF CONTROL YOU FEEL LIKE .
YEAH .
THEY DO NOT HAVE CONTROL OF IT .
THE SPENDING IS OUT OF CONTROL .
AND THAT AND SO THEN IT JUST AGGRAVATES YOU YOU KNOW YOU THINK I COULD SPEND MY MONEY I COULD HELP THE POOR PEOPLE BETTER BY MYSELF THAN THEY RE DOING .
YEAH OH I AGREE WITH YOU .
SO IT S .
I I THINK THAT S A WIDE OPEN SUBJECT .
YEAH .
WHAT YOU SAID PEOPLE NEED TO TAKE A STAND I THINK THE PEOPLE WILL HERE SHORTLY UH .
WELL I THINK THAT S RIGHT IF THEY DO NT DO IF THEY DO NT IF THEY DO NT PULL IT IN AND START DOING SOMETHING I THINK THEY RE REALLY GOING TO HAVE TO I THINK .
I THINK THE NEXT TIME WE HAVE AN ELECTION WE NEED TO TRY TO GET SOME OF THE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN THERE FOREVER OUT TOO THAT WHAT THEY DID LAST ELECTION AND UH NINETY SOME ODD PERCENT OF THE SAME OLD BOYS GOT BACK IN YOU KNOW SO WE NEED TO TRY TO GET PEOPLE TO TWO TERMS SO THEY RESPECT OUR WISHES YOU KNOW THEY RE SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT US THAT S WHAT THEY RE CALLED .

THANKS FOR CALLING .
UHHUH BYE NOW .
BYEBYE .
OKAY .
ALL RIGHT .
UM I I UNDERSTAND THAT IT S BEING PROPOSED AS A REQUIREMENT .
UHHUH .
FOR UH YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE TO GO INTO PUBLIC SERVICE .
I THINK .
YES ALL ALL YOUNG AMERICANS THEY DID NOT SPECIFY YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT .
YOUNG MEANS .
YEAH YEAH .
I THINK THAT IT PROBABLY WOULD BE A A GOOD PROGRAM .
I THINK PROBABLY TWO YEARS IS TOO LONG .
YEAH .
I THINK MAYBE A YEAR WOULD BE .
YEAH .
THE LONGEST .
YEAH YOU RE PROB PROBABLY RIGHT TWO YEARS MIGHT BE A LITTLE TOO LONG .
YEAH AND THERE WILL BE A LOT OF REBELLION IN THAT AND WHEN YOU GET PEOPLE .
WHO HAVE NO DESIRE TO BE THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE .
THAT S RIGHT .
THAT .
I DO NT THINK THAT THEY RE GOING TO BE SERVING ANYBODY .
THAT WOULD BE THE PROBLEM .
SURE WOULD .
YEAH .
SO I THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING THOUGH .
UHHUH .
TO ENCOURAGE OTHER PEOPLE .
WHO ARE NT EVEN AWARE THAT THEY CAN DO SUCH A THING .
UHHUH .
TO GET OUT THERE AND DO SO .
YEAH OR MAYBE OFFER THEM YOU KNOW SOME SORT OF AN INCENTIVE TO DO IT .
YEAH .
UH YOU KNOW COLLEGE CREDIT YOU KNOW SOMETHING YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
I M NOT SURE WHAT BUT .
RIGHT .
COLLEGE CREDIT IS A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE .
I M NOT SURE THEY NEED TO BE YOU KNOW PAID YOU KNOW A SUPER DO SALARY OF ANY KIND .
RIGHT .
BUT THAT THAT KIND OF TAKES AWAY FROM PUBLIC SERVICE .
THAT S RIGHT .
YEAH THEY PROBABLY COULD NT DO ANYTHING MONETARY BUT I THINK GIVING .
BUT JUST YOU KNOW TO RECEIVE A LETTER IN THE MAIL .
GIVING SOME KIND OF COLLEGE CREDIT .
THAT SAYS YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO REPORT SOMEWHERE BY NEXT MONDAY YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO REPORT SOMEWHERE BY NEXT MONDAY YOU KNOW .
I M NOT SURE THAT WOULD BE A TERRIFICALLY GOOD IDEA .
NO I DO NT THINK SO EITHER BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE UM DEPENDING ON HOW THE PUBLIC SERVICE PROGRAMS ARE SET UP AND I M NOT THAT FAMILIAR WITH THEM TO KNOW .
I M NOT EITHER REALLY .
BUT YOU KNOW IF A A LOT OF PEOPLE FLAT CA NT AFFORD TO .
THAT S RIGHT .
YOU KNOW .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND MOST KIDS THESE DAYS HAVE GOTTEN THEMSELVES INTO UH FINANCIAL SITUATIONS .
UHHUH .
WHERE THEY HAVE TO BE WORKING ALL THE TIME .
THAT S RIGHT .
ABSOLUTELY .
THEY NEED YOU .
SO IT S IT S A REALLY TOUGH QUESTION .
YOUNG FAMILIES WHATEVER .
THAT S RIGHT .
THEY JUST COULD NT YOU KNOW TAKE OFF TO DO THAT .
YEAH .
OH .
AND IF YOU PUT THEM IN PUBLIC SERVICE RIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL THEN THAT THAT POSTPONES THEIR COLLEGE .
THAT S RIGHT UHHUH .
FOR A YEAR AND THAT WOULD UPSET A LOT OF PEOPLE TOO .
UHHUH IT SURE WOULD .
BECAUSE THEY JUST WANT TO GET ON .
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A LOT OF YOU KNOW THOUGHT GIVEN TO SOMETHING LIKE THAT I WOULD THINK .
YEAH .
I YOU KNOW I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE TO GET INVOLVED IN THAT KIND OF PROGRAM .
UHHUH .
BUT I I THINK IT CA NT BE SOMETHING .
THAT S MANDATORY .
YEAH .
YEAH .
IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING .
THAT S VOLUNTARY .
YOU KNOW WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH THE WAY .
IT IS NOW .
THEY MIGHT .
THAT S RIGHT .
I M NOT EVEN REALLY SURE AT THIS POINT IN TIME YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT PROGRAMS ARE OUT THERE .
YEAH AND THAT S THE OTHER THING IS THAT YOU KNOW INSTEAD OF MAKING IT MANDATORY THEY MAYBE NEED TO PUBLICIZE IT .
A LITTLE BIT BETTER .
UHHUH .
AND UH YOU KNOW GO TO THE SCHOOLS AND DO PROGRAMS .
UHHUH .
AND TELL THEM THAT WE NEED YOUR HELP AND .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW UH VOLUNTEER FOR SUCH AND SUCH A TIME .
UHHUH .
AND YOU VE A CHOICE OF WHERE YOU WANT TO GO .
YEAH .
AND AND THAT WAY HANDLING IT .
THAT WAY .
THEY COULD PROBABLY GET SOME RESULTS OUT OF IT .
YEAH LIKE MAYBE IF IF THERE WAS SOMETHING .
THEY COULD DO IN THEIR OWN OWN IN THEIR OWN TOWN OR CITY .
YEAH IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITY RIGHT .
YEAH AND NOT HAVE TO PULL UP ROOTS AND YOU KNOW GO SOMEWHERE HALF WAY AROUND THE WORLD OR SOMETHING .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
MOST OF THEM PROBABLY WOULD NT DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
THAT S RIGHT .
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE A LOT OF KIDS .
WHO WOULD DO IT JUST TO GET AWAY FROM THEIR PARENTS .
YEAH THAT S THAT S TRUE TOO .
THAT S TRUE TOO .
BUT THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE SUPPORTED IN SOME WAY AND I M NOT SURE THAT THO THOSE PROGRAMS ARE AVAILABLE TO DO THAT .
YEAH YEAH .
ME NEITHER .
AND YOU WONDER YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF QUALITY JOB WOULD THEY DO YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
JUST SIT AROUND FOR THEIR YEAR OR WOULD THEY REALLY YOU KNOW MAKE A CONTRIBUTION OF SOME KIND .
RIGHT EXACTLY .
YEAH IT S TOUGH .
IT S TOUGH .
YEAH IT IS TOUGH .
IT S AND I DO NT KNOW WHO S EVEN PROPOSING IT .
YEAH .
OR OR HOW THEY PLAN ON IMPLEMENTING IT .
YEAH .
IF THEY DO .
I I M NOT SURE EITHER .
BUT I THINK THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE A LOT MORE YOU KNOW INFORMATION YOU KNOW DISSEMINATED BEFORE YOU SAY .
YEAH .
LET S DO THIS YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
I THINK GOING TO THE SCHOOLS WOULD BE THE EASIEST FOR THEM .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW IT BE IT WOULD NT TAKE UP MUCH MUCH IT WOULD TAKE UP MORE TIME THAN ANYTHING BUT IT WOULD NT TAKE UP A LOT OF MONEY .
YEAH .
THEY WOULD NT HAVE TO SPEND MONEY ADVERTISING AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
YEAH .
THAT S RIGHT .
YOU GO TO SCHOOL AND YOU HAVE A KIND OF A CAPTIVE AUDIENCE GET THEM .
ALL IN THE AUDITORIUM .
YEAH .
AND YOU YOU GIVE THEM YOUR SPEECH AND MAYBE A LITTLE SLIDE SHOW OR SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK THAT THEY COULD GET SOME RESULTS FROM THAT .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE .
WHO ARE VOLUNTEER AND COMMUNITY MINDED BUT THEY DO NT KNOW WHERE TO GO TO TO .
THAT S RIGHT .
TO DO ANYTHING .
YEAH .
THAT S A REAL WASTE TOO .
IT REALLY IS .
YEAH IT IS .
IT REALLY IS .
I DO NT REALLY SEE THE EMPHASIS ON THINGS LIKE PEACE CORPS LIKE WE YOU KNOW WE SAW BACK I GUESS IN THE CARTER ADMINISTRATION .
RIGHT .
THAT WAS THAT WAS A BIG THING WITH HIM .
YEAH YEAH .
AND I GUESS EVEN BACK TO KENNEDY AS A MATTER OF FACT I GUESS KENNEDY MAY BE THE ONE .
THAT ACTUALLY STARTED THE THING OR WAS YOU KNOW REALLY INTERESTED IN THINGS LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
I JUST DO NT HEAR MUCH ABOUT IT ANYMORE .
LIKE I SAY I DO NT EVEN KNOW WHAT PROGRAMS ARE ARE EVEN ONGOING NOW YOU KNOW .
I DO NT EITHER .
THAT S ONE .
ANYWAY IT S A TOUGH QUESTION .
YEAH IT IS A TOUGH QUESTION .
OKAY WELL THANKS FOR YOUR TIME .

OKAY TAKE CARE .
TA YOU TOO .
BYEBYE .
BYE .
OKAY UM YEAH ONE YEAR PUBLIC SERVICE FOR EVERYBODY .

RIGHT .
UH WHO WANTS TO START THIS ONE .
EM I DO NT KNOW I VE BEEN I VE BEEN SITTING HERE THINKING YEAH BECAUSE IT WAS YOU KNOW TOOK A COUPLE TRIES BEFORE I FOUND SOMEBODY .
WELL YOU KNOW I M LIKE I M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT .
I THINK ABOUT THIS .
UM UH I MEAN THE FIRST THING IS THE UH IF IT S GOING TO BE MANDATORY IT S GOT TO BE MANDATORY I MEAN EVERYBODY NOT JUST LIKE YOU KNOW POOR PEOPLE AND ALL THAT YOU KNOW .
BUT .
RIGHT RIGHT .
YOU KNOW SENATORS SONS AND ALL THAT STUFF TOO .
I MEAN EVERYBODY .
S GOT TO DO IT .
UM I DO NT KNOW IT D PROBABLY BE IT D PROBABLY BE GOOD I JUST DO NT KNOW IF YOU KNOW I WAS EIGHTEEN OR WHATEVER I D WANT TO BE STUCK DOING IT FOR A YEAR OR WHATEVER .
I M NOT SURE I WANT AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD TO MAKE THAT KIND OF DECISION .
UH I MEAN THAT THAT DOES NT SOUND RIGHT .
UM I GUESS I SEE OVERALL BENEFICIAL IF IF WE RE GOING FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW .
UHHUH .
UM .
I YOU KNOW IN THE PAST I DO NT KNOW I DO NT KNOW HOW OLD YOU ARE BUT WHEN I WAS UH IN HIGH SCHOOL IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF VIETNAM AND SO FORTH .
AND MANY OF MY PEERS WERE BEING DRAFTED .
UHHUH .
AND I COULD SEE THAT MANY OF THEM HAD CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTIONS TO WAR OR WHATEVER .
BUT I I FELT STRONGLY THEN THAT EVEN IF THEY DID NT FEEL LIKE THEY COULD KILL SOMEONE OR GO INTO A MILITARY SITUATION THAT THEY COULD HELP THE COUNTRY IN OTHER WAYS .
BE IT CLEANING OUT UH LOTS IN IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD OR .
UHHUH .
WHATEVER KIND OF COMMUNITY OR PUBLIC SERVICE MIGHT BE AVAILABLE .
AND I GUESS I SEE THAT AS AS NOT SO MUCH A DEMAND BUT BUT A PRIVILEGE .
IT S IT S KIND OF UH UH .
IT IS UH .
IT .
S .
SOMETHING IT S IT S SINCE WE LIVE HERE AND WE .
ALL BENEFIT RICH POOR OR IN BETWEEN UH THERE ARE BENEFITS EVEN FOR THOSE .
WHO HAVE IT .
THE HARDEST .
I JUST SEE THAT AS MAYBE A GOOD IDEA .
I WOULD NT MIND DOING IT AT FORTYFOUR .
UHHUH .
UH AND I FIND WAYS TO TO TURN SOME OF THAT BACK TO TO OTHERS .
UH AND I I GUESS I I CA NT SEE THAT AS BEING SOMETHING TO REALLY OBJECT TO .
WELL I GUESS IT WOULD STILL DEPEND ON HOW I MEAN IF IF YOU RE TALKING ABOUT ANY IF YOU RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING .
THAT S LIKE A FULL TIME YOU KNOW ONE YEAR FULL TIME YOU KNOW THIS IS WHAT .
YOU DO YOU KNOW .
YOU RE GOING TO GO AND AND FILL POT HOLES AND YOU KNOW AND YOU KNOW ALL THAT STUFF .
I MEAN I YOU KNOW I DO NT KNOW .
I COULD SEE A A FULL A RUN A GAMUT OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF OPPORTUNITIES .
THINGS .
THAT NEED TO BE DONE .
UHHUH .
THAT WOU THAT COULD BE DONE IN AN HOUR OR TWO .
UHHUH .
UH A DAY OR SEVERAL HOURS OF THE WEEK .
LIKE A HALF OF A DAY ON SATURDAY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
IN ADDITION TO WHAT .
ONE DOES .
UHHUH .
UH BESIDES THAT .
I I CA NT IMAGINE WHAT KIND OF UH UH BUREAUCRACIES WE D GET INTO AND EXPENSE HAVING IT BE FULL TIME OH YOU RE GOING TO GO TO THIS CAMP AND YOU RE GOING TO YOU KNOW LIKE UM BACK IN THE DEPRESSION THE C C C .
YEAH .
THE CONSTRUCTION CORPS .
THAT WENT OUT AND DID THINGS .
THAT WAS GREAT IT WAS NEEDED IT GAVE SOME FOLKS .
SOME JOBS AND WE GOT SOME GREAT PUBLIC WORKS OUT OF IT .
BUT UM I DO NT SEE THAT AS BEING NECESSARY NOW .
I CAN SEE IT BEING DONE UH ON A REGULAR SCHEDULE .
UHHUH .
UH EVERYBODY HAS TO PUT IN SO MANY HOURS OF UH PUBLIC SERVICE IN A GIVEN TIME PERHAPS .
UHHUH .
UH I I GUESS I SEE ALL OF US BENEFITING AND I I DO NT SEE IT JUST RELEGATED TO THE YOUNG .
BUT I SEE I I SEE SO MUCH GOING ON THAT THAT S BAD .
AND THIS WOULD GIVE THEM .
A CHANCE TO HAVE SOME POSITIVE SELFESTEEM .
UHHUH .
SOMETHING THAT THEY TURN .
WELL .
BACK .
AND ALSO YOU KNOW YOU YOU FEEL MORE LIKE YOU KNOW YOU RE ACTUALLY PART OF THE COMMUNITY IF YOU VE DONE SOMETHING .
THAT S RIGHT .
IN IT .
YOU TAKE PRIDE IN THAT AND AND GET SOME SOME POSITIVE FEEDBACK FROM THOSE .
WHO BENEFIT .
UHHUH .
BESIDES YOURSELF .
AND I I SEE IT BEING MOST BENEFICIAL IF IT S IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE OR OR AT LEAST THE AREA WHERE THE PERSON LIVES .
UH DEFINITELY .
IT MIGHT NOT BE THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD BUT THE SAME CITY OR COUNTY BECAUSE THEN YOU RE YOU RE COMING IN CONTACT WITH IT .
IT S NOT AS MEANINGFUL FOR ME TO GO TO MINNESOTA AND DO SOMETHING UP THERE THAT I LL NEVER BE ABLE TO SEE AGAIN UNLESS I HAPPEN TO GO ON VACATION .
RIGHT .
UP THERE .
YEAH .
IT S IT ALMOST NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING .
THAT HAS MORE IMPACT FOR THE INDIVIDUAL ON GOING .
YEAH .
BUT AS FAR AS PUTTING THAT INTO WORK I DO NT WANT TO I DO NT WANT TO DEAL WITH THE WITH THE HEARTACHE OF FIRST OF ALL GETTING IT STARTED AND FIGURING OUT HOW TO DO THE LOGISTICS .
OH THAT WOULD .
OF IT .
BE A NIGHTMARE .
AND JUST I MEAN JUST GETTING GETTING IT GOING .
YEAH .
YEAH .
I I SEE A LOT OF THINGS LIKE UH SCOUTING UH .
UHHUH .
BOYS CLUBS GIRLS CLUBS THINGS LIKE THAT THAT KIND OF GET INTO THAT CITIZENSHIP UH THE UH LOOKING AFTER THE ENVIRONMENT SORT OF THING .
UHHUH .
AND I GUESS I DO NT SEE UH THIS BEING THAT DIFFERENT .
BUT EVEN MORE BENEFICIAL BECAUSE IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY PARTICIPATED IN .
UHHUH .
AND WOULD TAKE A TURN IN .
UHHUH .
YEAH .
DO YOU HAVE KIDS .
N NO NOT YET .
IN ABOUT SIX MONTHS WE WILL .
OH WELL GOOD .
TH YOU LL HAVE A LITTLE TIME THINK ABOUT THAT .
I GUESS I I HAVE UH WHEN I WAS TEACHING SCHOOL .
I SAW MANY SO MANY KIDS .
THAT WERE AT LOOSE ENDS AND THAT DID NT REALLY HAVE A PURPOSE .
AND I CAN SEE YOU KNOW SOME SOME REALLY SIGNIFICANT THINGS COMING OUT OF IT .
UHHUH .
I KNOW YOU VE GOT TO GET PAST THAT THAT GRUDGE ATTITUDE THAT MANY HAVE BUT THAT S UH THA THAT WOULD BE A PART OF SELLING IT TO THE COMMUNITY .
UHHUH .
THE ADULTS UH AHEAD OF IT WOULD PROBABLY NEVER SERVE AND AND TO EACH SUCCEEDING GENERATION .
THERE DEFINITELY WOULD HAVE TO BE A MAJOR P R CAMPAIGN IN EACH COMMUNITY EACH COUNTY .
UHHUH .
UH PARISH OR HOWEVER THE STATE WAS DIVIDED UP .
UM I MAY WELL I DO NT KNOW AROUND HERE WE HAVE A NUMBER OF COMMUNITY PROJECTS THAT FOLKS JUST VOLUNTEER FOR .
BOY SCOUT TROOPS OR CHURCH GROUPS OR CIVIC CLUBS WILL UH POLICE .
A UH A COUPLE OF MILES OF THE HIGHWAY AND KEE AND I I VE SEEN IT IN OTHER STATES TOO .
YEAH .
THEY HAVE .
I DO NT KNOW .
THAT HERE .
UM .
UM .
THEY VE GOT UM IN MOST OF THE STATES AROUND HERE I THINK UH .
YOU KNOW DOWN IN NORTH CAROLINA THERE WAS A BIG CONTROVERSY FOR A WHILE BECAUSE THEY UH THE LOCAL CHAPTER OF THE K K K WANTED TO UH .
UH TO PARTICIPATE IN IT AND UH .
THERE WAS A .
AND THERE WERE THOSE .
THAT SAID NO YOU CA NT DO THAT I M SURE .
YEAH .
WELL UH IT WAS IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE THAT S AN INTERESTING QUESTION YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
SHOULD THESE PEOPLE BE ALLOWED TO OR NOT .
I THINK THEY FINALLY DECIDED NOT TO BECAUSE THEY FIGURED THAT STRETCH OF HIGHWAY WAS GOING TO GET TRASHED .
OH .
AND I HAD NT EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT THAT UH THE THE OTHER END OF THAT .
THAT THAT S AN INTERESTING UH SITUATION .
I HAD NT THOUGHT OF THAT .
WE HAD VISITED RELATIVES IN VIRGINIA NOT TOO LONG AGO AND I THOUGHT I HAD SEEN WHEN WE WERE TRAVELING AROUND THE STATE SOME SIMILAR SIGNS UP THAT INDICATED THAT CERTAIN SECTIONS WERE BEING POLICED AND CLEANED UP AND .
YEAH .
I THINK VIRGINIA S GOT IT AND I KNOW MARYLAND DOES AND WE JUST WE WENT TO INDIANAPOLIS LAST WEEKEND AND BACK .
AND UM I M PRETTY SURE I SAW YEAH STUFF IN OHIO AND INDI INDIANA ABOUT IT AND PENNSYLVANIA MAYBE PENNSYLVANIA I DO NT REMEMBER FOR SURE NOW .
AND I DO NT KNOW ABOUT YOUR PART OF THE COUNTRY BUT UH DOWN HERE IN THE LAST OH YEAR PLUS I IT WAS LAS BEGINNING WITH LAST YEAR S EARTH DAY .
UHHUH .
THERE S JUST BEEN MORE OF A TURN TOWARD UH ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS AND E I WORK FOR TEXAS INSTRUMENTS .
UHHUH .
AND THEY THEY VE STARTED SOME .
RECYCLING CAMPAIGNS THAT A YEAR BEFORE THAT HAD BEEN TURNED DOWN BECAUSE THEY SAID WELL IT S NOT FEASIBLE .
UHHUH .
IT S NOT A GOOD IDEA .
AND .
YEAH .
AND BUT THEN THEY LOST .
I SEE THAT AS BEING .
TOO MUCH BUSINESS .
I I SEE THAT AS BEING A A A CHANGE UH FOR THE POSITIVE .
KIND OF ALONG THE SAME LINE AS AS AS THE MANDATORY THING .
IT S JUST THING A PART OF EVERYONE .
S CONSCIOUSNESS .
UHHUH .
WELL THE THING ABOUT THAT IS THOUGH IT S GOT A I MEAN BECAUSE IT WAS I MEAN IT WAS BIG YOU REMEMBER LIKE IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES AND ALL THAT .
AND YOU KNOW AND THEN IT .
KIND OF JUST WENT OUT OF VOGUE .
AND I I M WORRIED THAT IT IT MIGHT YOU KNOW IT LL IT THE SAME THING WILL HAPPEN .
IT .
S LIKE YOU KNOW ENVIRONMENTALISM WAS REALLY BIG FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS AND THEN PEOPLE LIKE WELL YOU KNOW I D RUTHER RATHER SPEND YOU KNOW FIFTY CENTS LESS ON UH ON ON SUCH AND SUCH YOU KNOW AND EVEN IF IT S NOT ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE WHO CARES YOU KNOW .
I M SURE THE PENDULUM WILL SWING THE OTHER WAY .
UH THERE HAVE BEEN TOO MANY OTHER THINGS THAT IT S DONE THAT FOR JUST IN MY LIFE .
AND IF YOU LOOK AT HISTORY AT ALL YOU SEE THAT YOU KNOW UH WE GO FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER ON JUST ABOUT ANY SUBJECT .
YEAH .
THAT YOU ONE MIGHT CARE TO BRING UP .
BUT IT IS COMFORTING TO ME TO SEE UH MORE CONCERN ABOUT SOME OF THESE THINGS .
THAT THAT COST US .
MONEY .
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE DWINDLING UH RESOURCES SUCH AS OIL .
THAT S BURNING OUT OF CONTROL IN THE PERSIAN GULF AND AND SO FORTH .
JUST JUST EVERY LITTLE BIT DOES IT MAKES ME FEEL BETTER .
IT IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE WELL THERE MAY BE SOMETHING LEFT FOR MY CHILDREN MY NIECES AND NEPHEWS AND SO FORTH .
WELL YEAH UH .
WELL UH WOULD NT IT S JUST PROBABLY A GOOD THING THAT THE OIL S BURNING AND MAY MAY MAKE SOME PEOPLE REALIZE THAT HEY YOU KNOW THIS STUFF RUNS OUT .
THAT S THAT S RIGHT BECAUSE .
OF COURSE THAT S PROBABLY BLASPHEMY FOR YOU TO SAY UH COMING FROM WHERE YOU ARE IN TEXAS .
UH NO NO BECAUSE IF WE WHAT WAS IT SEVENTYFOUR WHEN WE HAD THE THE LAST LAST OIL CRISIS .
AND UH WE STARTED GETTING SMART AND AND WE WERE LOOKING ALL THESE ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF THE ENERGY AND SO FORTH .
UHHUH .
AND AS SOON AS THE OIL PRICES CAME BACK DOWN WE THE PENDULUM SWANG .
THE OTHER WAY .
RIGHT .
AND WE NEED THOSE REMINDERS .
YEAH .
UH OR WE LL SUDDENLY BE IN THE DARK AND SAY OH MY GOODNESS NOW WE DO NT HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO ON TO SOME NEW TECHNOLOGY .
RIGHT .
WELL MY DAD S IN THE IN THE SOLAR ENERGY BUSINESS SO UH .
AH .
YOU KNOW WE RE ACUTELY AWARE OF A LOT OF THIS .
BUT YOU KNOW ON THE OTHER HAND HE VOTED FOR GEORGE BUSH SO UM YOU KNOW I I WONDER SOMETIMES IF HE KNOWS WHAT .
HE S DOING .
WELL I THI YOU KNOW JUST ABOUT ANYBODY .
YOU COULD NAME WHETHER I VOTED FOR THEM OR NOT .
UHHUH .
UH MAKES UM UH DECISIONS THAT I JUST CA NT GO ALONG WITH .
BUT THAT S WHY THEY RE THERE AND NOT ME .
I DO NT WANT THE .
YEAH .
I DO NT WANT THE STRESS .
WELL THE THE THING WITH BUSH .
OKAY .
IF YOU WANT TO GO FIRST GO AHEAD .
OH I THINK I THINK THAT A WOMAN S ROLE HAS COME A LONG WAY WE HAVE GONE MORE INTO THE BUSINESS ASPECT OF LIKE I SAY OF I DO NT KNOW WORKING MORE AND WE I THINK WE VE EVEN GONE INTO MORE THE LABOR ASPECT OF IT ALSO .
YEAH DEFINITELY .
WITH THE PAY AND EVERYTHING YOU KNOW .
I FEEL THAT UH WE VE MISSED AS FAR AS THE TOP JOBS GO .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW THE HIGHER ECHELON .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT MOST CORPORATIONS THERE IS NT A WOMAN YOU KNOW THAT S ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OR THAT TYPE OF THING THEY ARE MOSTLY ALL MEN .
UHHUH .
THERE MAY BE A FEW BUT VERY INCIDENTAL .
YEAH .
AND I REALLY THINK THAT IT WILL BE A LONG TIME PROBABLY BEFORE WE SEE THAT IN ONE SENSE I M AN OLDER PERSON IN MY FIFTIES SO I FEEL THAT WE VE LOST SOME THINGS IN THE SENSE THAT WOMEN HAVE TO WORK TODAY .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT IN THE HOME BY CHOICE ANYMORE .
UHHUH .
IT S MOSTLY YOU KNOW EVEN IF YOU WANT TO SAY HOME YOU REALLY CA NT .
AND A LOT OF TIMES YOU CA NT YEAH .
YOU KNOW IT S GOTTEN TO BE A TWO INCOME FAMILY TO JUST SURVIVE TODAY BETWEEN TAXES AND THE COST OF LIVING AND I DO NT THINK RAISES HAVE KEPT UP WITH YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE STUFF YOU KNOW AS FAR AS YOUR MEDICAL INSURANCE AND JUST GROCERIES AND GASOLINE AND ALL YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
SO I THINK THAT WE DID COME A LONG WAY IN THE SENSE THAT WE ARE ALLOWED TO VOTE IN YOU KNOW LIKE YOU SAY WE RE OUT IN THE LABOR FORCE BUT I THINK WE VE LOST SOMETHING TOO .
YEAH MY MOM SHE S A HOUSEWIFE AND WELL THERE IS TWELVE KIDS IN MY FAMILY SO MY MOM NEVER COULD REALLY WORK YOU KNOW BECAUSE SHE WAS KIND OF PREGNANT FROM DAY ONE SHE NEVER REALLY HAD A CHANCE TO WORK .
YEAH .
SHE WORKED BEFORE SHE GOT MARRIED BUT UH SHE UH SHE DOES NT BELIEVE IN SHE S VERY OLD FASHIONED SHE DOES NT BELIEVE IN THE WOMAN WORKING UNLESS SHE HAS TO .
THAT S WHAT I MEAN AND .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW THERE S A LOT OF TRUTH TO THAT IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE A FAMILY THEN THAT S FINE THEN YOU KNOW A CAREER IS A SMART CHOICE .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK IT S GREAT BUT IF YOU YOU HAVE A FAMILY I THINK YOU OWE THE FAMILY A RESPONSIBILITY .
UHHUH .
AND TO HAVE CHILDREN AND JUST GET A DAY CARE OR SOMEONE TO TAKE CARE OF IT AND NOT REALLY HAVE THE BONDING PROCESS THAT TAKES PLACE WITH BABIES AND STUFF YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
I I THINK THAT THE MOTHER AND THE CHILD LOSE AND I THINK THAT S WHY THERE IS SO MANY PROBLEMS .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW WITH KIDS TODAY BECAUSE THEY DO NT HAVE THE FAMILY ROOTS ANYMORE YOU KNOW I M NOT SAYING THAT THAT IT S TOTALLY GONE BUT IT S NOTHING LIKE WHAT IT USED TO BE .
YEAH UHHUH .
YOU KNOW IN THAT SENSE .
YEAH AND ALSO LIKE MY MOM MY MOM THINKS I MEAN SHE S KIND OF RIGHT WITH IT WHEN BOTH PARTNERS OF THE MARRIAGE WORK SHE FEELS THAT THAT S TAKING MORE AWAY THAT S INCREASING MORE UNEMPLOYMENT FOR PEOPLE THAT NEED TO WORK .
OH DEFINITELY .
YOU KNOW LIKE FOR FOR THE MEN THAT DO NT HAVE JOBS IF YOU KNOW SHE FEELS IF THERE IS WOMEN OUT THERE JUST BECAUSE THEY WANT TO DO IT SHE SAID YOU KNOW THEY COULD STAY AT HOME .
THAT S RIGHT THEY DO NT WANT TO TAKE CARE OF THE KIDS .
YEAH .
AND THE HOUSE AND THAT KIND OF THING THAT S VERY TRUE BUT THEN THEY SHOULD NT HAVE A FAMILY .
YEAH .
THAT S WHAT I M SAYING YOU KNOW I THINK IT S GREAT THAT WOMEN HAVE A CHOICE TODAY .
UHHUH .
THAT THERE ARE WAYS TO PREVENT FAMILIES YOU KNOW LIKE BASICALLY THERE S CONTRACEPTIVES AND .
YEAH .
ALL KINDS OF WAYS TO PREVENT PREGNANCIES THERE IS NO NEED TO HAVE CHILDREN IF YOU DO NT WANT THEM .
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT DO YOU THINK THAT UH WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE WOMEN THAT ARE NOT HAVING FAMILIES BECAUSE THEY WANT TO CONTINUE THEIR BUSINESS .
THAT S FINE THAT S THAT S THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE .
UHHUH .
AND I AGREE WITH THAT BECAUSE ANYONE WHO HAS CHILDREN THAT DOES NT REALLY WANT THEM IS NT GOING TO BE A GOOD PARENT .
UHHUH .
WELL I SHOULD NT SAY THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE A GOOD PARENT THEY WO NT BE A CARING PARENT .
UHHUH .
LIKE THEY WO NT HAVE THAT .
OR THEY WO NT BE AS GOOD AS THEY COULD BE .
RIGHT THAT S WHAT I MEAN THEY LL FEEL LIKE IT S A JOB .
UHHUH .
IT S NOT LIKE SOMETHING THAT THEY REALLY WANTED LIKE I HAD THREE CHILDREN AND I MEAN I I WANTED EVERY ONE OF THEM .
UHHUH .
I M NOT SORRY I HAD ANY OF THEM AND I WORKED THIRD SHIFT FOR A GOOD PART OF MY LIFE JUST SO I WOULD BE HOME WITH THEM .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW I HAD TO WORK BUT I TRIED TO MAKE IT AS PAINLESS AS POSSIBLE .
UHHUH .
IN FACT AT ONE TIME I WORKED AS A SECOND SHIFT AND ONE SATURDAY MORNING WE WERE ALL SITTING AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE AND THE KIDS WERE TALKING DADDY THIS DADDY THAT DADDY THIS DADDY THAT AND I WAS SITTING THERE IT WAS LIKE I DID NT BELONG ANYMORE .
AND IT WAS BECAUSE I HAD WORKED FOR ABOUT NINE MONTHS AND WHEN THEY WERE COMING HOME I WAS GOING TO WORK .
UHHUH .
AND I WAS NT THERE AT SUPPER TIME OR BED TIME OR THEY COULD NT TELL ME WHAT WENT ON AT SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE COMING IN THE DOOR I WOULD BE GOING OUT .
EXACTLY .
SO WE WERE I FELT I WAS LOSING MY FAMILY .
UHHUH .
AND THAT S WHY I SAID THAT S IT I EITHER HAVE TO QUIT OR YOU KNOW TRY SOMETHING ELSE SO I WENT ON THIRD SHIFT .
UHHUH .
AND I WORKED THAT SHIFT FOR ELEVEN YEARS .
OH MY .
YEAH .
BLESS YOU .
JUST SO THAT MY KIDS WOULD HAVE ME AT HOME .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND I FEEL THAT S VERY IMPORTANT IT REALLY IS AND IT S TOO BAD BECAUSE MOTHERS MISS OUT ON SO MUCH TOO .
UHHUH .
SO I MEAN IN THE SENSE THAT WE VE COME A LONG WAY YES BUT WE VE SACRIFICED A LOT TO GET THERE .
YEAH I I AGREE .
AND UH I REALLY THINK THAT IF UH LIKE AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR WHEN WOMEN WENT TO WORK IN FACTORIES AND ALL THAT THAT WAS LIKE OUT OF NECESSITY BECAUSE THE MEN WERE NT HERE ANYMORE .
UHHUH .
BUT THEN IT GOT TO BE A POINT WHERE THEY GOT SOME INDEPENDENCE .
AND THEY JUST ENJOYED THE INCOME THE EXTRA .
EXACTLY A MAN CAN AFFORD THE NECESSITIES A WOMAN AFFORDS THE LUXURIES .
UHHUH .
AND I NOTICE TODAY KIDS YOU KNOW LIKE WE HAD APARTMENTS BEFORE WE HAD HOMES .
UHHUH .
AND WE HAD TO WALK BEFORE WE HAD A CAR .
EXACTLY .
AND NOW KIDS AT SIXTEEN YEARS OLD THEY HAVE THEIR BIRTHDAY WHAT DO THEY GET THEY GET A CAR .
OH I KNOW .
AND TO ME IT S LIKE WE VE LOST OUR VALUES IN THIS COUNTRY .
UHHUH .
WE REALLY HAVE AND I I M NOT TRYING TO BE UH YOU KNOW A PRUDE OR OLD FASHIONED OR ANYTHING BUT I I DO NT THINK IF YOU UNLESS YOU EARN SOMETHING AND YOU VE WORKED FOR IT AND YOU HAVE A SENSE OF PRIDE ABOUT IT BECAUSE WHILE I DID THIS IN YOU KNOW NO ONE GAVE IT TO ME .
UHHUH .
YOU WILL TAKE BETTER CARE OF THAT AND YOU WILL PRIZE THAT POSSESSION .
EXACTLY .
MORE THAN SOMEONE HANDING SOMETHING TO YOU .
UHHUH .
AND IT S JUST LIKE COLLEGE TOO I THINK THAT IF A KID GOES TO COLLEGE AND YOU CAN HELP THEM FINE BUT I DO NT THINK YOU SHOULD PAY THE WHOLE WAY .
SEE YEAH SEE NOW MY PARENTS THERE IS NO WAY THEY COULD AFFORD TO SEND TWELVE KIDS TO COLLEGE .
OF COURSE .
AND SO FAR THERE IS ONLY TWO OF US THAT HAVE GONE AND MY OLDER BROTHER HAS PAID HIS ENTIRE WAY AND I M ON MY I HAVE SIX WEEKS LEFT AND I LL YOU KNOW I LL GRADUATE AND I PAID MY ENTIRE WAY AND THAT S THE WAY IT LL GO DOWN THE LINE AND LIKE I DO NT HAVE A CAR BECAUSE I M PAYING FOR COLLEGE AND IF I WANT A CAR MY PARENTS ALWAYS SAID IF WE WANTED A CAR WE PAID FOR THE CAR AND WE PAID FOR OUR OWN INSURANCE AND I THINK THAT S RIGHT BECAUSE .
SURE BUT I LL BET YOUR VALUES ARE A LOT HIGHER YOU KNOW AND YOUR SELF ESTEEM AND THE THE WAY YOU UH YOU KNOW THINK ABOUT THINGS IS PROBABLY .
UHHUH .
A LOT MORE COMMON SENSE .
YEAH .
THAN THESE KIDS THAT DO NT HAVE THAT RESPONSIBILITY .
UHHUH LIKE I VE HAD MY YOU KNOW LIKE I KNOW KIDS UP HERE THAT HAVE THEIR OWN CARS AND MONEY IS JUST GIVEN TO THEM LIKE THEY STILL GET THEIR ALLOWANCE THEY ARE TWENTY YEARS OLD AND THEY STILL GET AN ALLOWANCE WELL I HAVE HELD A SUMMER JOB YOU KNOW SINCE I YOU KNOW I WAS IN THE ELEVENTH GRADE AND I HAVE HAD TO TAKE CARE OF MY OWN MONEY I HAVE MY OWN CHECKING ACCOUNT I PAY FOR MY OWN LIFE INSURANCE AND I KNOW A LOT OF KIDS THAT DO NT EVEN KNOW I MEAN I TELL THEM I PAY FOR MY OWN LIFE INSURANCE AND THEIR MOUTHS JUST DROP TO THE FLOOR YOU KNOW .
SURE THEY PROBABLY DO NT EVEN HAVE ANY .
WELL IF THEY DO THEY DO NT KNOW IT YOU KNOW .
YEAH EXACTLY AND THAT S WHAT I SAY YOU LL YOU LL BE SO MUCH BETTER OFF FOR IT AS YOU GET OLDER BECAUSE YOU KNOW A LOT OF KIDS RESENT THINGS THAT PARENTS TELL THEM AND STUFF BUT IT S BECAUSE YOU VE BEEN THERE .
UHHUH .
AND NO ONE CAN TELL ANYONE ANYTHING .
OH I KNOW .
YOU KNOW YOU ARE GOING TO FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF BUT I MEAN I DO NT THINK YOU SHOULD JUST NOT LISTEN TO ADVICE EVEN IF YOU DO NT TAKE IT JUST LISTEN .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THERE IS NO HARM IN THAT WHEREAS SOMETIMES YOU CA NT EVEN GET THAT FROM A KID YOU KNOW .
JUST ATTENTION YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
BUT REALLY UH WHAT DO YOU FEEL THE CHANGES IN THE FUTURE LIKE WITH THE ABORTIONS AND THAT TYPE OF THING WOMEN IN POLITICS AND .
UH .
PRESIDENT SOMEDAY MAYBE .
ACTUALLY I THINK ABORTION IS GOING TO TAKE A TURN WHERE THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE AS MANY BECAUSE I THINK CONTRACEPTIVES ARE GOING TO BE MORE POPULAR I MEAN I REALIZE THAT THEY ARE POPULAR NOW BUT I THINK I REALLY THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING TO START USING MORE CONTRACEPTIVES AND WITH THE ABORTION I DO NT THINK THERE IS GOING TO BE AS MANY ABORTIONS BUT I DO NT KNOW WHAT WOMEN WILL DO WHEN THEY GET INTO POLITICS YOU KNOW ABOUT ABORTION .
YEAH YEAH .
I THINK IT WILL BE FREEDOM OF CHOICE .
WELL I STILL THINK PEOPLE HAVE A CHOICE YOU KNOW IF YOU CAN LIVE WITH IT AND IT S YOU KNOW YOUR CONSCIENCE IS CLEAR .
UHHUH .
THEN I MEAN ALL OF US ARE GOING TO ANSWER TO IT ONE DAY MAYBE .
EXACTLY YEAH .
OR MAYBE NOT I DO NT KNOW .
UHHUH .
I MEAN NO ONE HAS SAID FOR SURE YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
BUT .
I THINK IF A WOMAN WOULD GET INTO POLITICS OR ENOUGH WOMEN GET INTO POLITICS I THINK IT WILL DEFINITELY BE FREEDOM OF CHOICE .
YES YES .
UHHUH .
WHICH I MEAN I THINK IT SHOULD BE ANYWAY .
I I DO I M CATHOLIC AND WE WE ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO YOU KNOW SAY THAT THAT S OKAY BUT I REALLY FEEL THAT IT S FREEDOM OF CHOICE .
YEAH .
I DO .
BECAUSE I MEAN YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL WHAT YOU DO THAT TO ME IS YOUR BUSINESS .
UHHUH .
AND UH .
AND DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES CALL FOR DIFFERENT THINGS .
EXACTLY EXACTLY THAT S .
UHHUH .

NICE TALKING TO YOU TOO BETH .
ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT BYEBYE .
BYE .
ALL RIGHT .
OKAY ARE YOU ON AN EXERCISE PROGRAM NOW OR .
YEAH I EXERCISE PRETTY REGULARLY .
UHHUH .
I LIFT WEIGHTS QUITE A BIT .
UHHUH .
UM I RUN OCCASIONALLY .
LET S SEE WHAT ELSE DO I DO .
PLAY GOLF SOME AND I WORK OUT ON A ON A HANGING BAG .
I M BROWN BELT IN KARATE SO I .
UHHUH .
KEEP UP WITH THAT A LITTLE BIT .
OH YEAH .
HOW ABOUT YOU .
UM THE ONLY EXERCISE PROGRAM .
I M DOING RIGHT NOW IS WALKING .
UHHUH .
I VE GOT A NINE MONTH OLD AND I M FOUR MONTHS PREGNANT WITH MY SECOND AND SO AT THE TIME WALKING SEEMS TO BE THE BEST .
IT S SOMETHING .
I CAN DO WITH HER PLUS UM DOES NT TAX ME TOO PHYSICALLY .
UHHUH .
I HAVE ENJOYED AEROBICS IN THE PAST AND I ENJOY THAT BECAUSE I LIKE THE GROUP ASSOCIATION YOU KNOW LIKE EXERCISING WITH OTHER PEOPLE .
YEAH .
AND UM AND THAT S MY FAVORITE WAY TO EXERCISE .
WELL THAT S NEAT .
YEAH I DO WALK SOME TOO .
MY WIFE S ABOUT FIVE MONTHS ALONG .
OH .
SO SHE S BEEN WALKING QUITE A BIT SO THAT IS A GOOD EXERCISE FOR THAT .
YEAH IT S NICE TO DO IT TOGETHER TOO I GUESS .
UHHUH .
MY HUSBAND AND I USE TO WALK TOGETHER BUT OUR SCHEDULES DO NT COINCIDE AS WELL AS THEY USED TO AND SO WE VERY SELDOM GET TOGETHER TO WALK BUT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU WORK OUT DO YOU PRETTY MUCH DO IT ON YOUR OWN SCHEDULE OR DO YOU GO TO GROUPS OR .
I I DO IT ON MY OWN SCHEDULE .
UHHUH .
WE USED TO TRY AND BELONG TO CLUBS OR THE Y STUFF LIKE THAT BUT IT WAS SO DIFFICULT TO GO ON A REGULAR BASIS TO DRIVE THE DISTANCE .
YOU HAVE TO GO .
UHHUH .
SAVE THE FEES WE VE UH JUST SAVE THE FEES AND BUY SOME OF OUR OWN EQUIPMENT .
SO .
AND THEN YOU CAN DO IT WHENEVER YOU WANT I GUESS .
YEAH I VE GOT A WEIGHT BENCH AND WE GOT MY WIFE .
AN EXERCISE BIKE AND I USE THAT SOMETIMES TOO .
UHHUH .
IT S A LITTLE .
MORE CONVENIENT BUT YOU RE I GUESS YOU RE NOT AS DEDICATED IF YOU DO NT DRIVE OVER TO DO IT .
I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON THE PERSON DEPENDS ON HOW MOTIVATED YOU ARE .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE MY HUSBAND USED TO WORK OUT THREE DAYS .
A WEEK WITH UH AT THE TEXAS INSTRUMENTS GYM .
UHHUH .
AND THEN I WOULD JUST GO ON SATURDAYS .
BUT SINCE THE FIRST OF THE YEAR NEITHER ONE OF US HAVE BEEN GOING .
YEAH .
SO I GUESS LIKE I SAY WE VE BEEN PAYING THESE FEES AND NOT GOING SO IT S KIND OF A WASTE OF MONEY IF YOU DO NT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT .
YEAH I THINK YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE DISCIPLINED .
YEAH .
I UH I TRY TO WORK OUT AT LEAST A COUPLE OF TIMES .
A WEEK AND I THINK YOU REALLY HAVE TO AT LEAST TWICE A WEEK JUST TO MAINTAIN THE SHAPE THAT YOU RE IN .
YEAH .
WITH THE WALKING I THINK THEY SAID YOU NEED TO WALK AT LEAST TWELVE MILES .
A WEEK FOR IT TO BE AEROBICALLY BENEFICIAL .
UHHUH .
AND WE I HAVE TWO FRIENDS THAT WE WALK .
THEY HAVE BABIES .
THAT ARE ABOUT THE SAME AGES AS AS MINE AND WE VE BEEN WALKING EVERY MORNING AT GOING WHEN IT WAS COLD WE WOULD GO TO THE MALL BECAUSE YOU CA NT TAKE THE BABIES OUT .
YEAH .
VERY EASILY .
SO WE WHEN WE GO WE HAVE ABOUT DO ABOUT FIFTEEN MILES .
A WEEK BUT THE LAST LITTLE WHILE FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER WE HAVE NT BEEN REAL CONSISTENT .
SO IT S A LITTLE HARDER WHEN YOU RE DEPENDING ON OTHER PEOPLE TO DO IT WITH YOU .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO MEET THEIR SCHEDULES AS WELL BUT .
SURE .
BUT I ENJOY DOING IT MORE WHEN I VE GOT OTHER PEOPLE WITH ME .
YOU KNOW I USUALLY DO IT BECAUSE I WANT TO BECAUSE I KNOW IT S GOOD FOR ME NOT BECAUSE I DO NT FEEL OBLIGATED TO DO IT .
I ENJOY IT .
IF I FEEL TOO OBLIGATED TO DO IT I START TO REBEL AND I WO NT BE AS CONSISTENT WITH IT .
YEAH I UNDERSTAND .
DID YOU EXERCISE BETWEEN YOUR FIRST CHILD AND YOUR SECOND .
I EXERCISED PRETTY WELL UP UNTIL I FOUND UH UNTIL I WAS PREGNANT AND I STARTED HAVING PAINS .
SO I VE CALMED DOWN EVERYTHING EXCEPT I WAS WORKING OUT DOING AEROBIC EXERCISES AS WELL AS THE UM WALKING .
YEAH .
AND I HAD TO STOP THE AEROBICS BECAUSE IT WAS JUST KIND OF PAINFUL .
BUT THE T I .
REC CENTER HAS AN AEROBICS PROGRAM FOR FOR UM PRENATAL AND POSTNATAL AEROBIC TYPE THING .
UM .
AND I WAS GOING TO WAIT UNTIL UM ABOUT MY SIXTH MONTH AND THEN START THAT .
I DID THAT WITH THE SECOND BABY AND UM I WENT TO MY EXERCISE CLASS ONE DAY AND THEN SHE WAS DELIVERED THE NEXT DAY .
GOSH .
SO IT WOULD SEEM TO BE REAL BENEFICIAL .
UHHUH YEAH .
MAYBE IT MAYBE IT SPEEDED UP THE PROCESS AND ALL THAT .
WELL I THINK IT MADE PARTS OF IT .
A LOT EASIER .
AND AND IS THIS YOUR FIRST THAT YOU RE HAVING .
UHHUH .
OH OKAY WELL THEN I DO NT KNOW HOW MUCH YOU VE BEEN THROUGH IT BUT I THINK PARTS OF IT MADE A LOT EASIER .
AND I VE TALKED TO A LOT OF LADIES .
THAT EXERCISE WITH ONE PREGNANCY AND DID NT WITH THE OTHER AND THEY SAID THAT THEY HAD EX THAT THE ONE .
THEY HAD EXERCISED WITH WAS THREE OR FOUR TIMES EASIER .
REALLY .
AND WE VE I HAD HAVING BOTH OF THEM .
NATURAL THE FIRST ONE WAS NATURAL AND GOING NATURAL .
THE SECOND AND AND IT S IT S ROUGH BUT IT S NOT AS BAD AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AND I THINK THE EXERCISE HELPED .
WELL THAT S GOOD .
SO DO YOU WORK WITH T I .
NO I DO NT .
MY MY WIFE HAS BEEN WORKING WITH THEM .
OH OKAY WELL THEN SHE COULD GO IF SHE WERE INTERESTED .
UHHUH .
I THINK THAT S WHAT .
THE CLASS .
THAT MEETS ON SATURDAY MORNINGS .
SO SHE COULD FIND OUT IF SHE WANTED TO GO .
IT .
S KIND OF FUN BECAUSE WITH THE FIRST PREGNANCY .
ALL THE OTHER LADIES EXCEPT ONE WERE ON THEIR FIRST PREGNANCY AND THEY WOULD TALK ABOUT EXERCISE AND JUST GENERAL THINGS RELATING TO THE BIRTHING PROCESS .
AND SO FOR US .
IT WAS EDUCATIONAL AS WELL AS EXERCISE BENEFICIAL .
SO .
AT LEAST ITS .
SOMETHING .
YOU ENJOY .
I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE .
THAT TALK ABOUT EXERCISE AND SAY WELL I DO NT WANT TO EXERCISE IT S TOO MUCH WORK .
BUT THERE S A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN DO THAT ARE ENJOYABLE THAT YOU DO NT HAVE TO STRAIN YOURSELF OR SWEAT .
THAT S RIGHT .
OR BE REAL SORE AFTERWARDS .
YEAH .
AND SOMETIMES IF YOU GET A LITTLE SORENESS .
YOU FEEL LIKE WELL I VE DONE A GOOD JOB BECAUSE I GOT WORKED MYSELF TO THAT POINT .

I COULD JUST WALK IN THE DOOR AND SHE KNEW WHETHER TO TO TO QUIETLY COME UP TO ME OR TO JUST RUN AND KNOCK ME OVER .
I MEAN SHE REALLY COULD PICK UP ON MY MOOD .
YEAH YEAH .
UH THE WAY I WALKED IN THE DOOR IT WAS UH UNCANNY .
HUH I I THINK UH IN A WAY WE RE ABLE TO READ EACH OTHER PRETTY WELL BECAUSE UH SHE KNOWS WHEN I M UPSET AND I KNOW WHEN SHE S NOT FEELING GOOD TOO SO .
YEAH .
I KNOW LIKE WHEN SHE HAS AN ACCIDENT I KNOW SHE S NOT DOING IT ON PURPOSE WHEN .
YEAH .
WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER SHE USED TO DO THAT TO GET EVEN WITH ME .
UH AND AND YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE MIGHT NOT BELIEVE THAT BUT BUT BUT UH I DO .
SURE OH ABSOLUTELY .
LIKE IF I IF I PUT HER IN A ROOM ALL BY HERSELF AND CLOSE THE DOOR AND LEAVE HER THERE FOR A FEW HOURS UH BECAUSE I WAS GOING OUT SHE WOULD UH BREAK SOMETHING OR RIP UP THE CARPET OR DO SOMETHING JUST TO UH TO TO LET ME KNOW THAT SHE WAS UNHAPPY WITH WHAT I DID .
REALLY .
YEAH .
THAT S THE WAY WELL I HAD THAT CAT THAT I MENTIONED ALFIE ONE MORNING YOU KNOW THE FIRST THING YOU DO IS YOU GET UP AND YOU YOU YOU FEED THIS CAT SOME SOMETHING AND AND YOU MAKE SURE THAT IT CAN GET TO ITS LITTER BOX WELL .
UHHUH .
FOR SOME REASON DURING THE NIGHT THE DOOR WAS NOT QUITE WIDE ENOUGH FOR IT TO GET THROUGH AND UH THE NEXT MORNING UH WHEN MY ROOMMATE GOT UP AND AND UH DID NOT FEED IT RIGHT AWAY IT DECIDED THAT THAT IT WAS GOING TO PROTEST .
AND SO IT JUMPED UP ON MY BED AND ANOINTED MY BLANKET .
FOR ME LOOKING LOOKING AT ME EYE TO EYE .
ALL THE TIME WHILE IT WAS DOING IT ALL RIGHT HAVE I GOT YOUR ATTENTION NOW .
OH YES ANIMALS HAVE A WAY OF TALKING .
ALFIE DID I TELL YOU IF I COULD HAVE GOTTEN A HOLD OF THAT CAT THAT DAY .
I I DO NT KNOW THAT I D UH THAT I D TRADE MY DOG IN FOR THE WORLD UH IT WAS ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO SHE GOT SICK ON ME AND I TOOK HER TO THE UH TO THE VET S BECAUSE SHE WAS NT EATING AND AND UH SHE WAS NT ABLE TO JUMP SHE YOU KNOW LOST ALL HER ACTIVITY AND UH SHE STAYED THERE FOR ONE DAY AND THE DOCTOR CALLED ME UP AND SAID UH SHE HAD A LOW WHITE CELL COUNT AND THAT UH SHE WAS NT SHE WAS DYING AND UH SUGGESTED THAT I TAKE HER TO A WORKING HOS DOG HOSPITAL ANIMAL HOSPITAL SO I TOOK HIS SUGGESTION AND I UH TOOK THE THE DOG TO A HOSPITAL THE DOG HOSPITAL THERE AND THEY SAID THEY D KEEP HER THERE FOR THREE DAYS WELL SHE ENDED STAYING THERE FIVE DAYS AT A HUNDRED AND SOMETHING DOLLARS A DAY BECAUSE SHE WAS IN INTENSIVE CARE IT COST ME OVER FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS .
OUCH .
PLUS THE THE UH THE VET SENT ME A BILL FOR WHAT HE DID AND UH THEN SHE RECOUPED SHE WAS OKAY FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS AND THEN SHE GOT SICK ON ME AGAIN AND I BROUGHT HER TO A DIFFERENT VET THIS TIME AND I TOLD THE VET WHAT MEDICATION I HAD GIVEN HER AND EVERYTHING AND UH HE GAVE ME THE MEDICATION THE SAME MEDICATION THAT I GAVE HER THE LAST TIME AND SHE WAS OKAY AND SHE S BEEN OKAY EVERY SINCE IT S BEEN ABOUT TWO YEARS NOW .
HUH WELL THAT S GREAT IT REALLY IS I I M GLAD THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO PULL OUT OF IT THAT WAY AND SO CHEAPLY THE SECOND TIME .
YEAH WELL THE SEE THE PROBLEM IS IF IF THE IF SOMEONE WOULD HAVE CAME UP TO ME AND SAID IT S GOING TO COST YOU FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO KEEP YOUR DOG ALIVE WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE HAD SECOND THOUGHTS .
YEAH OF COURSE YOU WOULD .
BUT WHAT THEY WELL WHAT THEY DO IS IS THEY SAY WELL IT S GOING TO COST YOU KNOW TWENTY DOLLARS FOR TESTS AND FORTY DOLLARS FOR THIS AND AND YOU KNOW AND IT CREEPS UP ON YOU YOU DO NT KNOW THAT UH YOU KNOW YOU REALLY Y YOU DO NT KNOW WHAT IT S GOING TO UNTIL IT S ALL OVER .
UH TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE MY MOM HAD AN ELDERLY CAT WHO UH WHOEVER EVIDENTLY GOT A HOLD OF IT AND UH THE CAT GOT SICK SO SHE TOOK THE CAT TO THE VET AND SHE HAD THE CAT THERE FOR TWO DAYS AND THEN THE CAT DIED SO THE DOCTOR HAD CALLED HER UP AND SAID UH YOUR CAT DIED AND YOU OWE ME THIS BILL AND OH BY THE WAY DO YOU WANT ME TO TO BURY THE CAT .
SO IT COST HER THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS UH AND SHE DID NT GET THE CAT BACK SO YEAH THEY HAD TO PAY FOR ALL THE MEDICAL UH BILLS THAT THE CAT RAN UP PLUS THE BURIAL EXPENSES .
AND UH YOU KNOW SHE JUST BROUGHT THE CAT IN BECAUSE HE WAS NT FEELING GOOD SO THAT .
REALLY GEEZ .
THAT WAS KIND OF A SURPRISE AT LEA .
YEAH YOU KIND OF WONDER WHAT REALLY HAPPENED .
YEAH WELL EVEN THE YOU KNOW THEY THEY CLAIMED THEY DID THE BEST THAT THEY COULD HAVE HAVE AND THEN THE CAT UH DIED SO .
MY GOODNESS .
I M I M LOOKING FOR ANOTHER CAT FOR THEM UH .
I I VE I VE GOT A LITTLE KITTEN UH THAT S STILL UH JUST BEING BORN RIGHT NOW SO ANOTHER FIVE OR SIX WEEKS I LL BE BRINGING THE LITTLE KITTEN OVER TO UH TO MY FOLKS .
WELL THAT THAT THAT THAT WILL MAKE THEIR DAY .
YEAH I I THINK IT WILL BECAUSE THEY RE BOTH IN THEIR IN THEIR SEVENTIES AND UH THE CAT UH ALTHOUGH IT S A LITTLE BIT OF WORK FOR THEM SOMETIMES IT TURNS IT TURNS OUT TO BE UH UH A PLEASANT EXPERIENCE FOR THEM UH I THINK THEY ENJOY THAT .
ONLY WORK INITIALLY .
YEAH .
FOR CATS ANYWAY YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
WELL LISTEN IT S BEEN A PLEASURE TALKING TO YOU .
WELL THE SAME HERE .
AND YOU TAKE CARE .
OKAY .
BYE NOW .
MAYBE WE LL TALK AGAIN SOMETIMES .
OKAY WHAT IS THAT SOUND .
THAT S MY BUZZER AT THE DOOR .
OH OKAY I LL LET YOU GO .
OKAY .
RIGHT .
THANK YOU .
OKAY WELL I CAN TELL YOU PRETTY MUCH MY TWO FAVORITE SHOWS .
OKAY .
AND THEY .
KIND OF ARE IN DIFFERENT SPECTRUMS I THINK .
UM ONE OF THEM IS QUANTUM LEAP .
OKAY .
AND THE OTHER ONE IS NIGHT COURT .
AND I THINK I THINK THEY RE REAL DIFFERENT I MEAN I DO NT THINK THEY HAVE ANYTHING IN COMMON .
UM QUANTUM LEAP HAS I MEAN QUANTUM LEAP IS KIND OF A COMEDY IN ITS OWN WAY I GUESS BUT UH MOSTLY IT S IT S KIND OF SCIENCE FICTION AND IT S UM IT S ADVENTURE AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
AND THEN NIGHT COURT IS JUST PURE YOU KNOW WEIRD FUN YOU KNOW JUST IT S IT S NOTHING SERIOUS ABOUT IT AT ALL .
SO I DO NT KNOW WHY THE TWO OF THEM HAPPEN .
TO BE MY TWO FAVORITE SHOWS BUT THEY THAT S THE WAY .
IT IS SO .
IT S FUNNY THAT THOSE ARE MY TWO MY HUSBAND S TWO FAVORITE SHOWS TOO .
AND I ENJOY BOTH WATCHING BOTH OF THEM BUT I USED TO DID NT LIKE NIGHT COURT .
UHHUH .
AND I AND THE ONLY REASON .
I THINK I LIKE IT NOW IS BECAUSE I VE SEEN IT SO MUCH AND I M INVOLVED WITH THE CHARACTERS BUT .
I USED TO THINK UM DAN FIELDING WAS JUST TOO TOO VULGAR AND TOO CRUDE FOR ME .
HE IS .
AND I TOLD MY HUSBAND THAT S THE WHOLE POINT BUT .
YEAH THAT S RIGHT I MEAN .
I I JUST IT S I FIND HIM DEGRADING AT TIMES .
I GUESS THAT IS THE POINT BUT SOMETIMES IT JUST .
WELL THEY THEY REALLY HAVE CHANGED HIM THOUGH .
IF IF YOU VE WATCHED IT .
THIS SEASON UM HE S BECOMING I MEAN HE STILL IS IN HIS OWN WAY DEGRADING AND EVERYTHING BUT UH HE S INVOLVED IN THAT CHARITY AND UH IT S TAKING UP SO MUCH OF HIS TIME AND SO MUCH OF HIS THOUGHT THAT HE REALLY HAS IN FACT THERE WAS ONE SHOW THAT HE EVEN TURNED DOWN A DATE WITH SOME YOU KNOW BEAUTIFUL WOMAN JUST BECAUSE THE IDEA THAT HE WAS HIS MIND WAS ON THE OZONE LAYER .
OH .
AND YOU KNOW GLOBAL WARMING AND ALL THIS OTHER KIND OF STUFF .
AND HE YOU KNOW WAS TOO DEPRESSED YOU KNOW TO SO THAT WAS PART OF I GUESS HIS CHARACTER BUILDING OR WHATEVER BUT .
I THINK IT ADDS A PROBABLY ADDS A LITTLE BIT OF DEPTH TO HIS CHARACTER .
I HAVE NT WATCHED UM .
WHICH OF COURSE .
HE NEEDED .
YEAH I THINK SO WHICH IN QUANTUM LEAP YOU GET EVEN THOUGH THE PERSON IS INVOLVED IN SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE S LIVES YOU STILL SEE A A REAL PERSON IN THOSE SITUATIONS .
HE GETS UM HE S DOING AMAZING THINGS .
UHHUH .
BUT HE S DOING THEM WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF WHAT .
A NORMAL PERSON WOULD DO .
RIGHT RIGHT THAT S A GOOD POINT .
AND I THINK THAT S I LIKE THAT .
SO WHAT DO YOU WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER YOUR FAVORITE SHOWS .
UM I THINK MY FAVORITE SHOW IS HUNTER .
OKAY .
AND I I LIKE THE OLD SER SERIES BETTER WHEN UM .
DEDE .
DEDE WAS IN THERE .
YEAH .
YEAH I AGREE .
AND UM SO UH UH AND THEN THE BLOND THAT THEY TOOK OUT THE ONE .
THAT GOT KILLED .
YEAH I CA NT REMEMBER WHAT .
HER NAME IS BUT IS .
YEAH I DID NT ENJOY HER .
I I SHE WAS TOO MUCH OF A OPPOSITE OF DEDE AND I THINK THAT S WHAT .
THEY TRY TO DO BUT I THINK WE WANTED TO SEE DEDE THERE .
UHHUH .
OR SOMEBODY LIKE HER .
WELL BUT SEE I READ AN ARTICLE ABOUT IN T V GUIDE ABOUT UH ABOUT HUNTER AND ABOUT HIS YOU KNOW LATEST YOU KNOW HIS THREE GIRLS WHATEVER .
YOU WANT TO CALL THEM .
UHHUH .
AND THEY SAY THAT UH THAT THERE WAS ABSO THAT THERE WAS LIKE A CONFLICT BETWEEN HER AND HIM UH THAT THEY NEVER REALLY COULD GET HER INTO UH ANY CHARACTER THAT THEY COULD USE .
I MEAN YOU KNOW UH .
THE SECOND LADY .
YEAH THE SECOND ONE .
UHHUH .
THE BLOND .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THEY DID NT REALLY INTERACT HARDLY AT ALL .
THEY DID NT .
I MEAN THEY WERE NEVER PARTNERS .
YEAH SHE WOULD GO HER .
WAY AND .
YEAH .
HE WOULD DO HIS AND I THINK THAT S WHAT .
I DID NT LIKE .
AND AND AND EVEN EVEN AT THE BEGINNING DEDE AND AND HUNTER WOULD DECIDE THAT ONE OF THEM WOULD GO DO THIS WHILE THE OTHER ONE WOULD DO WOULD GO THIS BUT UH IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS ALMOST TWO DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW LIKE HUNTER WAS THE BOSS AND THIS OTHER GIRL WAS NOT AND YOU KNOW YOU .
KIND OF YOU RE WONDERING YOU KNOW WELL WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN .
RIGHT .
SO YEAH I I .
KIND OF AGREE WITH THAT .
AND I LIKE THE NEW LADY BETTER BUT I D JUST AS SOON THAT THEY DID NT HAVE THE ROMANCE THERE .
I D JUST AS SOON HAVE THE THE POLICE STORY WITHOUT ALL THE ROMANCE .
WELL I M AFRAID THAT S WHAT .
THEY THEY REALLY WANTED TO DO UM .
YEAH I THINK MOST SHOWS WERE DOING THAT AND THEN THEY WENT AWAY FROM IT .
UHHUH .
AND NOW THEY RE STARTING TO GO BACK TO IT AND MAYBE THAT S WHAT .
THE PUBLIC WANTS I DO NT KNOW BUT I JUST I LIKE THE THE CUT AND DRY SOLVE THE MYSTERY AND THAT S WHAT .
I ALWAYS ENJOYED ABOUT IT .
YEAH WELL SEE THERE WAS THAT SPARK BETWEEN DEDE AND HUNTER FOR A WHILE .
YEAH .
BUT THEY THEY LIKE STARTED IT AND THEN THEY D PULL IT BACK AND THEY D START IT AND PULL IT BACK .
AND THAT REALLY MADE IT .
A VERY INTERESTING UH SHOW TO WHERE YOU NEVER REALLY KNEW WHICH WHICH .
ONE WAS GOING TO SHOW UP .
YOU KNOW WHETHER IT WAS GOING TO WHERE THEY RE GOING TO BE REAL CLOSE OR WHETHER THEY RE JUST GOING TO BE PARTNERS YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
AND THAT THAT I .
KIND OF THOUGHT WAS GOOD BUT UM YOU KNOW IT S I GUESS YOU KNOW YOU ALWAYS KIND OF SIT THERE AND YOU SEE THESE TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER AND YOU ALWAYS WONDER WHY THEY DO NT YOU KNOW GET TOGETHER .
YEAH .
OR WHATEVER .
AND SO I GUESS THAT S WHAT .
THEY DECIDE TO DO .
JUST GO AHEAD AND .
YEAH .
QUIT THE WONDERING AND AND .
BUT IT S IT S ALWAYS BEEN A FORMULA UH FOR T V THAT THE MINUTE THAT TWO PEOPLE THAT THE TWO MAIN STARS GET MARRIED THAT THE SHOW ENDS UP YOU KNOW DYING .
YEAH .
A A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS AND YOU KNOW THIS IS PROBABL MAYBE IT S NOT A GOOD EXAMPLE .
I VE BEEN WATCHING NICKELODEON .
ALL LAST WEEK BECAUSE THEY HAD WHAT .
THEY CALLED MAXIMUM SMART .
THEY HAD GET SMART FOR UH TEN HOURS .
A DAY FROM SEVEN OCLOCK AT NIGHT UNTIL SIX OR UNTIL FIVE OCLOCK THE NEXT MORNING .
OH .
ALL THE GET SMART EPISODES YOU COULD EVER SEE .
WELL THE THE LAST DAY ALL .
THEY DID WAS THE LAST SEASON TO WHERE THE TWO OF THEM GOT MARRIED .
UHHUH .
AND THAT WAS I MEAN THAT WAS THE KILLER THE SERIES DIED RIGHT AFTER THAT .
I DID NT .
BECAUSE WELL GO AHEAD .
I WAS GOING TO SAY I DID NT EVER WATCH MOONLIGHTING BUT I HEARD THAT S .
WHAT KILLED IT .
UHHUH SAME THING .
THAT UH INTERPLAY DIED WHEN THEY GOT MARRIED AND SO THE SHOW DIED .
YEAH THE IT SEEMS LIKE YOU CAN DO SO MUCH MORE OF THE SUBTLE HINTS AND THE SUBTLE LITTLE PLAYS ON THINGS BEFORE THEY THEY BEFORE THEY GET MARRIED .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THE MINUTE .
THEY GET MARRIED EVERYTHING S SUPPOSED TO BE CUT AND DRIED AND .
RIGHT .
AND WELL OF COURSE ANOTHER ONE OF THEIR MISTAKES I THINK IS THEY HAVE A TENDENCY TO CHANGE CHARACTERS OR TO CHANGE THE CHARACTERS UH UH PERSONALITIES .
HALFWAY THROUGH .
WELL ESPECIALLY AFTER THEY GET MARRIED .
YEAH .
UM COUPLE OF EXAMPLES WOULD BE UM WELL LIKE I SAID THIS ONE ABOUT MAX S OR GET WELL SMART THE FEMALE CHARACTER BARBARA FELDON .
UHHUH .
SHE HAD BEEN AT THE BEGINNING .
THE THE INTELLIGENT ONE THE THE ONE .
WHO ALWAYS SOLVED THE THINGS AND AND FIGURED OUT AND KEPT MAX FROM GETTING REAL MESSED UP .
WELL IN SHORT WHENEVER THEY GOT MARRIED SHE GOT DINGY .
OH .
YOU KNOW WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT .
YEAH .
IT MADE NO SENSE .
I I M GUESS IT S FALLING BACK INTO OUR TRADITIONAL STEREOTYPE .
WHICH .
A LOT OF SHOWS .
UNFORTUNATELY THAT S PROBABLY TRUE .
YEAH WHICH KIND OF LIKE IN THE BIG SOAP OPERA SHOWS WHICH .
I DO NT ENJOY BECAUSE OF THAT BUT .
WELL DO YOU .
YOU WATCH UM WHAT IS THAT SHOW WHO S THE BOSS .
THAT S UH THAT S ON TUESDAY NIGHTS I THINK .
I VE SEEN IT BEFORE BUT I DO NT WATCH IT REGULARLY .
YEAH WELL I .
USUALLY TUESDAY NIGHTS I M OUT SO .
I HARDLY EVER WATCH IT BUT AS AS I VE SEEN IT THEY VE THEY VE DONE SORT OF THE SAME THING TO WHERE THEY VE THEY STARTED TO LET THEM GET TOGETHER AND THEN THEY PULLED THEM APART .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK THEY RE THINKING ABOUT THAT EXACT THING ABOUT THE IDEA THAT IF THE SHOW LETS THEM UH GET TOGETHER THEN YOU LOSE PART OF WHAT .
THE SHOW S ALL ABOUT .
UHHUH .
SO .
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT WAS KIND OF WEIRD .
YEAH IT S FUNNY HOW WE UH WE WE ROMANTICIZE PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
LIKE FOR INSTANCE WHERE AS THE TEENAGER YOU KNOW YOU ROMANCE A ROMANTICIZE A ROCK STAR BUT WHEN HE GETS MARRIED THEN YOU DO NT CARE ANY MORE .
UM RIGHT .
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND I THINK IT S THE SAME WITH YOUR CHARACTERS ON T V .
DO YOU THINK THAT S WHY MOST ROCK STARS NOWADAYS KEEP THEIR MARRIAGES SECRET OR AT LEAST THEY KEEP IT QUIET .
PROBABLY YEAH .
I MEAN .
I KNOW IT AFFECTED ME WHEN I WAS YOUNGER .
I M NOT INTO ROCK STARS .
YEAH .
TOO MUCH LATELY BUT .
NO LIKE MADONNA AND SEAN PENN .
NOW I DO NT PARTICULARLY LIKE EITHER ONE OF THEM .
UHHUH .
BUT UM UH THEIR MARRIAGE WAS SO HIGHLY PUBLICIZED THAT THERE WAS NO WAY THAT THEY COULD STAY TOGETHER .
YEAH .
OR AT LEAST THAT S THE WAY .
I LOOK AT IT .
UHHUH .
SO I DO NT KNOW .
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HARD WOULD NT IT .
YEAH I WOULD THINK SO .
I JUST THE THE PUBLICITY IN AND OF ITSELF MUCH LESS THE I MEAN WHEN YOU GET MARRIED YOU VE GOT RELATIONSHIP TO DEVELOP IN THE FIRST PLACE SO HAVING TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE WATCH YOU DO THAT .
YEAH IT S THEY WOULD NT BE EASY .
YEAH .
SO UM WELL THAT S KIND OF INTERESTING .
YEAH .
SO UM WELL I GUESS THAT S ABOUT ALL .
WE NEED TO DO IS NT IT .
YEAH I THINK WE VE COVERED OUR TIME .
IT S BEEN GOOD TALKING TO YOU .
YEAH IT HAS BEEN BECKY I REALLY APPRECIATE IT .
YOU RE THE FIRST MAN .
I VE TALKED TO EVERYONE ELSE HAS BEEN A FEMALE SO THIS IS A CHANGE .
WELL I THINK I VE UM YOU RE THE SECOND FEMALE .
I VE TALKED TO .
YOU VE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF VARIETY HUH .
YEAH IT S KIND OF NICE .
OKAY WELL THANKS SO MUCH .
UHHUH .
BYEBYE .
BYEBYE .
OKAY DEE ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE LATIN AMERICAN POLICIES .
YEAH TO A POINT IT S NOT MY BEST SUBJECT .
REALLY YEAH IT S NOT MINE EITHER BUT UH I KNOW I KNOW OUR POLICY LIKE IN NICARAGUA I AM FAMILIAR WITH THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE UH SOME FRIENDS THAT LIVE ON THE NICARAGUAN BORDER AND THEY ARE MISSIONARIES THERE AND THEY THEY LIVE THERE AND THEY HAVE TO TRAVEL BY BOAT FORTYFIVE MINUTES TO GET TO THEIR CAR AND STUFF AND UH I KNOW THAT THEY HELPED A LOT OF THOSE SANDANISTAS REFUGEES COMING ACROSS THE BORDER AND THEY HOUSED THEM AND STUFF THEY HAVE BEEN DOWN THERE ABOUT THREE YEARS NOW AND THEY WROTE THAT IT S KIND OF WEIRD THEY HAVE BATS IN THEIR ROOF BUT THE BATS EAT THE BAD SPIDERS SO THEY LEAVE THE BATS YOU KNOW SO .
YEAH IT S A WHOLE WHOLE DIFFERENT CULTURE OR .
UHHUH .
IT IT S WEIRD DOWN THERE BECAUSE THERE S ALWAYS LIZARDS AND THINGS RUNNING AROUND THAT PEOPLE LIVE THERE THEY JUST THEY TAKE IT FOR GRANTED AND IT S LIKE WE GO DOWN THERE ON VACATION IT S LIKE OH HOW CAN THESE PEOPLE LIVE WITH THESE LIZARDS AND LIKE BATS IN THEIR HOUSE .
YEAH I THINK THEIR POLICY WITH THEM THAT THOUGH IS UH I DO NT KNOW I THINK I WISH WE WOULD HAVE JUST I M NOT THAT UP ON THE POLICY OF WAYS I KNOW THAT S KIND OF OLD BUT I DO NT KNOW I JUST I M GLAD THAT THE SANDANISTAS ARE NT IN POWER ANYMORE BECAUSE I THINK THAT THEY WERE VERY WICKED AND UH PROBABLY SOME OF THE BIGGEST DRUG DEALERS THAT THE WORLD HAS PROBABLY EVER SEEN AND I FEEL LIKE MOST OF THE LEADERS IN LATIN AMERICA ARE PROBABLY YOU WOULD BE SAFE TO SAY THAT THEY WERE JUST VERY VERY YOU KNOW BIG INTO DRUGS .
VERY VERY CORRUPT LIKE THE PANAMANIANS ARE WERE VERY CORRUPT .
RIGHT .
THE THING ABOUT IT THOUGH IS THE PANAMANIANS IS A LOT OF SERVICEMEN DOWN THERE A LOT OF A LOT OF AMERICAN SERVICEMEN ARE INVOLVED .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE I GUESS THERE WAS A BIG BIG UH SCAM THAT THAT ALL THESE GUYS UP THOUSANDS OF SERVICEMEN .
UHHUH .
GOT CAUGHT FOR RUNNING A DRUG RING .
YEAH .
SO IT S IT S LIKE EVERYBODY IS INTO IT IT S JUST GREED .
YEAH .
HUMAN GREED INTERESTINGLY MUMBLEX IN HONDURAS .
UHHUH .
IT S VERY PROAMERICAN .
UHHUH .
AND WE HAVE I MY GIRLFRIEND USED TO UH BE IN THE NAVY AND SHE WAS BASED UH BASED IN PANAMA .
UHHUH .
IN HONDURAS VERY UH UH PROAMERICAN .
UHHUH .
AND THERE S A LOT OF MEN I DO NT KNOW HOW MANY AMERICAN UH SOLDIERS ARE THERE BUT THERE S A LOT I MEAN THEY UH AND YOU CA NT THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT YOU CA NT TRUST THEM EITHER BECAUSE YOU THINK YOU DO NT KNOW HOW CORRUPT THEY ARE I MEAN THEY KEEP PEOPLE IN POWER LIKE THE SHAH OF IRAN AND .
UHHUH .
THINGS LIKE THAT I MEAN IT S THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS THEY WILL PROBABLY SAY THIS IS THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS .
YEAH .
BUT I DO NT KNOW HOW CORRUPT THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT IS BUT THE .
YEAH THEY NEED TO HAVE MORE CHECKS AND BALANCES IN THEIR GOVERNMENT TO GET RID OF THE CORRUPTION BUT I THINK FIRST THOUGH I DO NT KNOW THEY NEED TO I THINK THEY NEED THE REPENTANCE ON THE LEADERSHIP OF THE DIFFERENT NATIONS FOR ALL THEIR UH YOU KNOW THE ATROCITIES THAT THEY COMMIT AND THE DRUG DEALINGS AND IN THE JUST IN THE DRUG CRIMES BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE A LOT OF THE LEADERSHIP IN THOSE NATIONS ARE SO ENGROSSED IN THE DRUG CRIMES THAT UNTIL THEY REPENT OR THEY ARE MOVED FROM POWER THAT YOU KNOW BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY OF THEM THAT THE NEXT ONE TO COME UP IF YOU JUST KNOCK ONE OFF AND THEN HAVE ANOTHER ONE AND I KNOW A LOT OF THOSE NATIONS THERE S UH BRAZIL I KNOW IS LIKE FORTY PERCENT EVANGELICAL CHRISTIAN .
NOT JUST GO TO CHURCH BUT YOU KNOW REALLY ON FIRE FOR GOD AND THEY ARE JUST SURPASSING AMERICA LATIN AMERICA BY THE DRUGS YOU KNOW IT S JUST INCOMPREHENSIBLE AND UH SO I JUST THINK THAT I THINK THAT GOD IS GOING TO HONOR THAT AND THAT HE IS GOING TO PUT IN SOME GOOD LEADERSHIP AND I KNOW THE PRESIDENT OF I BELIEVE COSTA RICA IS A CHRISTIAN AND HE GOES TO NO GUATEMALA BECAUSE HE GOES TO VIRGO CHURCH IN GUATEMALA CITY THE CHURCH IS IN REAL CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM AND HE IS A FORMER PRESIDENT OF GUATEMALA HE S AN ELDER AT VIRGO CHURCH AND YOU KNOW THAT THAT GOD IS DOING SOMETHING AND HE IS RAISING UP SOME LEADERS AND THE PEOPLE WANT HIM BACK AS PRESIDENT BAD BUT THEY HAVE A RULE IN GUATEMALA THAT HE CA NT HAVE ANOTHER TERM AND SO THE THE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO OVERRIDE THAT I MEAN NOT JUST THE CHRISTIANS BUT ALL THE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY SEE WHEN A RIGHTEOUS MAN IS IN AUTHORITY THE PEOPLE REJOICE .

THAT S THE UNDOING OF EVERYTHING AND IT S THE WE HAVE NO MORALS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE CRIME AND ALL THAT IN THE CITY IT S JUST THE KIDS HAVE NO MORALS .

IN CENTRAL AMERICA SO I WAS READING AN ARTICLE IN THE UH NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC AND I DO NT KNOW I DO NT THINK THEY HAVE ANY MORE MONEY THAN ANY OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES .
UHHUH .
THEY DO NT HAVE OIL OR ANYTHING AND THEY DO NT HAVE BIG TOURISM SO MAYBE IT IS THEIR FAITH THAT ENABLES THEM TO KEEP THE CRIME OUT .
UHHUH I KNOW THAT COSTA RICA THEY DO NT ALLOW ANYBODY TO COME THAT UH TO COME ANY UH WHAT DO YOU CALL WHAT DO YOU CALL IMMIGRANTS THEY DO NT ALLOW ANYTHING LIKE THAT LIKE I COULD NOT GO TO COSTA RICA AND LIVE AS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN THEY WOULD NOT PERMIT ME TO LIVE THERE TO WORK THEY WOULD NT THEIR JOBS ARE THERE FOR COSTA RICANS THEY DO NT ALLOW PEOPLE TO MOVE IN LIKE LESS NATIONS YOU KNOW .

WELL YOU RE YOU RE ABLE TO YOU RE ABLE TO UH VOTE AND GO TO WAR AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO .
YEAH DEFINITELY ABLE TO GO TO WAR TWENTY YEARS AGO BUT NOT VOTE .
OH THAT S RIGHT THAT S ONE OF THE CHANGES .
NOT VOTE THAT WAS ONE OF THE CHANGES THAT CAME ABOUT IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS UM YEAH TWENTY YEARS AGO IS NINETEEN SEVENTY UH NINETEEN SEVENTY I HAD BEEN MARRIED TWO YEARS .
UHHUH .
UM WE HAD ALL THE GREAT CIVIL RIGHTS LEGISLATION OF NINETEEN SIXTYEIGHT .
UHHUH .
AND UH AROUND HERE ON THE UH EAST COAST UH .
UHHUH .
WE WERE HEAVY INTO AFFIRMATIVE ACTION .
YES .
AND UH THAT WAS A UH A GREAT SHOCK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND UH A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT FOR SOME PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF .
UHHUH UHHUH .
UM I WAS GAINFULLY EMPLOYED BY SAFEWAY STORES INCORPORATED .
UHHUH .
AND UH TRYING DESPERATELY TO UH GET AHEAD WITH THE COMPANY .
UHHUH .
UH THE PROBLEM WAS THAT MY HAIR WAS TOO LONG .
UHHUH .
AND UH MUMBLEX YOU WERE NT ALLOWED TO HAVE A UH MUSTACHE OR A BEARD AND UH .
UHHUH UHHUH .
YOU KNOW JEANS JUST FLAT OUT WERE NT ALLOWED .
UHHUH .
UNLESS YOU WORKED ON NIGHT STOCK AND .
UHHUH .
IF YOU WANTED TO GET AHEAD WITH THE COMPANY WELL IF YOU WERE A UH BLACK FEMALE YOU WERE DESTINED TO BE STORE MANAGER IN SIX TO NINE MONTHS IF YOU WERE WHITE MALE YOU RE TALKING SIX YEARS .
HUH .
AND THAT S BASICALLY WHERE I ENDED UP I UH I JUST FLAT OUT COULD NT GET HOLD YOU KNOW GET AHEAD WITH THE COMPANY BECAUSE THEY WERE DEAD IN AFFIRMATIVE ACTION .
UHHUH UHHUH .
UM ON OTHER FRONTS UM .
AND IS THE COMPANY NOW UH WELL REPRESENTED UH DEMOGRAPHICALLY AT THE HIGHER ECHELONS .
UM .
DID IT WORK .
I THINK SO I I I I STOPPED WORKING FOR THEM IN UH SEVENTYEIGHT SEVENTYNINE .
UHHUH .
AND UH IT S I THINK THEY RE THEY RE LIKE ALL COMPANIES WELL REPRESENTED .
UHHUH .
AND UH YOU KNOW EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE FINE .
UHHUH .
I I VE KIND OF LOST TOUCH WITH THE COMPANY WE HAD A FALLING OUT .
UHHUH UHHUH .
BUT UH AS FAR AS UH AS THEIR MANAGEMENT GOES UM I M NOT SURE THEY RE ANY ANY BETTER OFF THAN THEY WERE WERE BEFORE MANAGEMENT WISE .
UHHUH .
BUT UH OTHER CHANGES UM JUST PEOPLE SEEM TO BE MORE OUTSPOKEN NOW INDIVIDUALLY RATHER THAN COLLECTIVELY .
UHHUH .
UM BACK IN THE SEVENTIES WE HAD UH A LOT OF UH PROTESTS AGAINST THE WAR AND UH BRING OUR TROOPS HOME AND THINGS WERE MORE ORGANIZED .
UHHUH .
AND UH I VE NOTICED THAT NOW MORE AND MORE INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE ARE SPEAKING OUT FOR THEIR OWN RIGHTS RATHER THAN MASSING TOGETHER .
UHHUH UHHUH .
UM .
SO THERE S LESS YOU THINK NOW THERE S LESS OF A A SOCIAL MOVEMENT AND MORE INDIVIDUAL MOV LOTS OF INDIVIDUAL MOVEMENTS .
YEAH .
IN A SENSE .
I M NOT SURE IF THAT WAS BECAUSE YOU KNOW EIGHTIES WAS LIKE THE UH THE ME DECADE .
THE ME DECADE UHHUH .
AND UH EVERYBODY WAS INTO ME AND THEN WE ARE GETTING BACK INTO US BUT UM IT IT IT S I VE SEEN UH UH A GREAT DEAL OF CHANGE AS FAR AS UM CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND THINGS UM .

UHHUH .
AND UH A LOT OF I SEE AMONG SOME OF MY FRIENDS AND EVEN MORE AMONG SOME OF MY STUDENTS WHO ARE YOU KNOW MAYBE TWENTY A REAL SENSE OF YOU KNOW AMERICA S LOSING IT .
YES .
AND LOSING IT IN THE COMPETITIVE MARKET AND A REAL KNOWL UH A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING HOW THAT COULD BE IN THE SENSE THAT HOW COULD AMERICA HAVE GONE FROM BEING NUMBER ONE TO POSSIBLY BEING NUMBER TWO TO YOU KNOW OUR FORMER ENEMIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND UH SO I SEE I SEE A LOT OF UH A LOT OF PESSIMISM GROWING UM AND AT THE SAME TIME I THINK THERE S THERE S THERE S A GROWING ENVIRONMENTALIST MOVEMENT AND SENSE OF CORPORATE RESPON INCREASED CORPORATE RESPONSIBLE TOWARDS UH YOU KNOW ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND THAT MIGHT POTENTIALLY BE SORT OF THE CIVIL RIGHT THE EQUIVALENT OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT IN IN THE NEAR FUTURE IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW SOME REAL LANDMARK BILLS PASSING AND THINGS LIKE THAT SUCH THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE THE THING ABOUT CIVIL RIGHTS IS PEOPLE TAKE IT FOR GRANTED NOW I MEAN MY GENERATION DOES NT CA NT REST ON THE THE GLOW OF HAVING ACHIEVED CIVIL RIGHTS BECAUSE WE WERE BORN INTO AN ASSUMPTION THAT YOU KNOW YES THERE S STILL SOME RACISM BUT YOU KNOW BASICALLY THINGS ARE THE ASSUMPTION THINGS ARE BASICALLY KIND OF TAKEN CARE OF AND THERE S A NOTION OF FAIRNESS .
YES .
THAT S UM WHILE STILL FAR FROM PERFECT IS MUCH MORE ESTABLISHED I THINK .
BUT EVEN UH I THINK UH ALONG THE LINE OF THE UH GOALS OF CIVIL RIGHTS .
UHHUH .
UM THERE ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE SOME PREJUDICE TO SOMEONE BY ANYONE .
OH OF COURSE .
I MEAN YOU KNOW .
IT S HUMAN NATURE .
YOU KNOW DO NT LIKE THE WAY YOU LOOK DO NT LIKE THE WAY YOU DRESS DO NT LIKE YOUR HAIR DO NT LIKE YOU KNOW IT S JUST SOMETHING THAT ALWAYS SETS PEOPLE OFF YOU KNOW YOU EITHER LIKE SOMEONE OR YOU DO NT LIKE SOMEONE OR YOU RE JUST COMPLETELY INDIFFERENT .
YEAH YEAH .
AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT IDEALLY YOU THEY YOU KNOW THE WORLD WOULD LIKE YOU TO BE COMPLETELY INDIFFERENT SO UM BUT I I I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT UM IT S IT S BEEN A LONG TIME COMING UM AND BEING A UH A VERY OLD HIPPIE .
UHHUH YES .

AND THEN THEY TURNED AROUND AND CALLED THEM JUNKYARDS AND .
YES .
STARTED MAKING PROFITS OFF .
YES .
THEM AFTER THE WAR AND NOW WE GOT TO THE POINT WHERE THE JUNKYARDS YOU VE GOT TO PAY THEM TO TAKE SOMETHING THERE .
UHHUH .
SO THINGS HAVE REALLY CHANGED A LOT I THINK THE UH THE OTHER PART ABOUT UH AMERICA S DECLINE I THINK HAS TO DO WITH .
A PERCEIVED DECLINE ANYWAY YEAH .
YEAH THE PERCEIVED DECLINE HAS TO DO WITH UH UM THE ATTITUDES AND THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM UH I HAVE CHILDREN IN IN S I HAVE THREE CHILDREN IN SCHOOL RIGHT NOW AND I M NOT IMPRESSED WITH THE TEACHERS THAT ARE TEACHING THEM UH I HAD WHEN I WAS DOWN IN DALLAS FOR TWO YEARS I HAD UH MY CHILDREN COME HOME FROM SCHOOL WITH PAPERS THAT WERE CORRECTED BY THE TEACHER THAT HAD WORDS SPELLED CORRECTLY MARKED WRONG .

UHHUH .
YOU KNOW I HAD A REAL PROBLEM WITH THAT .
YEAH WELL I D I D SAY ACTUALLY I MEAN AS SOMEONE WHO S INVOLVED IN EDUCATION I D SAY THAT MAYBE ONE OF THE CHANGES IS THAT THE ROLE OF THE TEACHER HAS INCREMENTALLY GOTTEN LOWER AND LOWER VALUE AND SOCIETY I MEAN RELATIVE PAY WHICH IS A MAJOR WAY WE VALUE PEOPLE HAS BEEN POORER AND POORER OVER THE YEARS UH YOU KNOW THAT THERE S BEEN COST OF LIVING INCREASES BUT NOT QUITE IN PROPORTION TO COST OF LIVING AND YOU KNOW IT S JUST MORE AND MORE UH A REAL LOW INCOME SORT OF JOB AND VERY LOW PRESTIGE I MEAN THERE S THAT THAT OLD SAYING THOSE WHO CAN DO IT AND THOSE WHO CA NT TEACH .
THIS IS THE WAY OF LET S MAKE FUN OF THE TEACHERS THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO CA NT DO ANYTHING .
YEAH .
AND IF YOU HAVE THAT KIND OF SOCIAL ATTITUDE IT S HARD TO GET SUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO OVERLOOK ALL OF THAT WORK FOR LOWER PAY WORK FOR LOW SOCIAL PRESTIGE JUST BECAUSE THEY CARE ABOUT GOOD EDUCATION .
YEAH .
AND YOU GET MORE AND MORE PEOPLE MUMBLEX AND UP THERE BECAUSE IT S UH IT S THE SAFETY NET OF THOSE OF YOU KNOW AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE OR SOMETHING THEY CAN ALWAYS TEACH .
UM I M NOT SURE IF YOUR FAMILIAR WITH THE MOVEMENT THEY HAVE HERE IN MARYLAND BUT THEY RE TRYING TO GET A UH A UH A MERIT SYSTEM HERE IN MARYLAND RATHER THAN A UH TENURE SYSTEM .
UHHUH .
FOR ALL THE YOU KNOW ELEMENTARY MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOLS .
UHHUH .
SO THAT THE TEACH .
OKAY DEANNA UH ON CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IN OUR STATE THEY GIVE THE DEATH PENALTY FOR SHOOTING OF A POLICEMAN .
UHHUH .
AND I BELIEVE ALSO IN SHOOTING OF UH RAPE I MEAN KILLING A RAPE VICTIM .
UHHUH .
I MEAN SOMEONE IN THE PROCESS OF RAPE AND I DO NT KNOW WHAT .
EL I DO NT REALLY REMEMBER WHAT ELSE .
UHHUH .
BUT .
HOW DO YO WH WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT .
I THINK IT S JUSTIFIED .
YEAH YEAH .
VERY MUCH SO .
I AGREE I I AGREE YOU KNOW I .
I THINK IT SHOULD BE IN OTHER CASES OTHER THAN JUST SHOOTING A POLICEMAN .
YEAH OH I DO TOO I DO TOO .
I MEAN I THINK THEY RE DOING THEIR DUTY BUT I THINK IF THEY RE GOING TO COME OUT AND KILL SOMEBODY ELSE THEN THEY DESERVE IT .
THEY OUGHT TO GET IT FOR KILLING A CIVILIAN JUST AS EASILY AS A POLICEMAN .
THAT S RIGHT I AGREE .
YEAH .
I AGREE .
UH I HEARD SOMETHING ON THE NEWS .
THE OTHER NIGHT .
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT UH OH I KNOW WHAT .
IT WAS IT WAS IN OUR IN OUR LITTLE LOCAL PAPER OUR LITTLE LEWISVILLE PAPER .

EVERY WEEK UH THERE S A LITTLE THING AT THE BOTTOM THA IT S LIKE A CALL IN SURVEY .
THAT SAYS YOU KNOW DO YOU THINK SO AND SO AND THEN YOU CALL THIS NUMBER AND YOU PRESS LIKE ONE FOR YES AND TWO FOR NO .
RIGHT UHHUH .
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THE QUESTIONS .
THE OTHER DAY THIS LAST PAPER AND I HAVE NT SEEN THE RESULTS OF IT I M ANXIOUS TO WAS DO YOU THINK THAT UM CAPITAL PUNISHMENT OUGHT TO APPLY TO DRUG DEALERS .

AN YOU KNOW IF IF YOU KNOW I I THINK TO BE YOU KNOW BEING CONVICTED IS ONE THING YOU KNOW AND THAT S AND THAT S GREAT IF THEY RE CON IF THEY RE SENTENCED TO DEATH TO ME .
YOU COULD NOT SENTENCE THEM TO DEATH UNLESS THE CASE WAS FOR SURE .

IT GETS THERE AND THEY VE BEEN CONVICTED AND THEN THEY VE BEEN SENTENCED TO DEATH THEY RE SURE .
I MEAN THERE S NO DOUBT I MEAN I .
UHHUH THEN IT SHOULD HAPPEN YEAH .
THERE CAN BE NO SHADOW OF A DOUBT IN MY MIND THERE HAS TO BE NO SHADOW OF A DOUBT TO GET THAT PENALTY .

AND IF THEY FIND WHO S DOING THAT TO THOSE LITTLE GIRLS AS FAR AS I M CONCERNED HE COULD .
HE COULD FRY .

YEAH I THINK IT WOULD BE WORTH IT .
EVERYBODY .
WO .
WELL I WAS WATCHING A SHOW ABOUT THIS THE OTHER NIGHT AND YOU KNOW THEY WERE LIKE IN A I THINK IT WAS ON FORTYEIGHT HOURS .
OKAY .
OKAY NOW WHEN YOU .
BABYSIT WHAT AGE GROUP CHILDREN DO YOU SIT WITH .
WELL GOSH ALL KINDS UM MOSTLY BETWEEN THE AGES OF TWO AND TEN .
UHHUH .
UM LAST LIKE A FEW SUMMERS AGO I KEPT TWO CHILDREN .
EVERY DAY FOR THE ENTIRE SUMMER AND I MEAN THEY BECAME LIKE MY CHILDREN .
I D THINK SO .
AND UM AND THEY LIVE IN AN APARTMENT COMPLEX SO WE SWAM A LOT AND WE PLAYED ON THE PLAYGROUND .
A LOT AND THEN WE WOULD GO TO A MOVIE ON THURSDAYS AND UM THERE WAS ALWAYS AN ACTIVITY YOU KNOW THEY HAD THEIR FAVORITE T V SHOWS AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT WE WATCHED AND THEN WE TOOK NAPS AND UM I DO NT KNOW IT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING TO DO .
CHILDREN ARE SO FULL OF ENERGY .
UHHUH .
AND OH THEY WERE THEY JUST THE THEY JUST KEEP YOU GOING .
NOW WAS THIS A ONE PARENT OR TWO PARENT FAMILY .
UH ONE PARENT .
ONE PARENT .
YEAH .
SHE S JUST .
HOW MUCH TIME DID SHE SPEND WITH THEM .
NOT MUCH AT ALL .
I MEAN I WOULD GET THERE AT EIGHT OCLOCK IN THE MORNING THE CHILDREN USUALLY WERE NT AWAKE BY THEN .
AND SHE WOULD GET HOME AT LIKE FIVE THIRTY IN THE AFTERNOON .
UHHUH .
AND THEY WOULD HAVE DINNER AND THEN IT WAS TIME FOR THEM TO GO TO BED .
UHHUH .
UM NOW AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME .
THE CHILDREN WERE TWO AND SIX .
BUT THEN I ALSO I VE BEEN BABYSITTING THIS CHILD UH FOR ABOUT EIGHT YEARS HE S NINE NOW AND UM YOU KNOW I VE WATCHED HIM GROW UP AND HE S LIKE A LITTLE BROTHER TO ME .
UHHUH .
AND IT S CHANGED OVER THE OVER THE YEARS UM WE GET ALONG A LOT BETTER NOW THAT HE S OLDER .
UHHUH .
AND UH WE DO DIFFERENT THINGS NOW WE USED TO PLAY BALL .
A LOT BUT NOW IT S HE LIKES TO WATCH T V AND HE S INTO WRESTLING .
AND UM I KEPT HIM ON FRIDAY NIGHT WE WENT SH WE WENT TO GO SEE A MOVIE AND UM THINGS LIKE THAT BUT I FEEL LIKE I DO NT KNOW WHEN I HAVE CHILDREN I WANT TO BE ABLE TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH THEM .
YEAH MUMBLEX YOU SAY YOUR YOU GO TO SCHOOL .
UHHUH I GO TO L S U .
AND WHAT ARE YOU STUDYING .
UH COMMUNICATIONS .
WELL SOUNDS LIKE YOUR GETTING A LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN COMMUNICATING WITH CHILDREN .
OH YEAH I MEAN I LOVE CHILDREN .
UHHUH .
UM I DO NT KNOW SEEM WHEN I WAS GROWING UP MY MOM STAYED AT HOME WITH ME AND MY BROTHER UNTIL WE WERE IN JUNIOR HIGH .
AND I DO NT IT WOULD I THINK IT WAS VERY BENEFICIAL TO US .
UHHUH .
I MEAN LIKE IN THE SUMMER .
WE WERE ALWAYS IN THE LIBRARY PROGRAMS READING BOOKS AND WE WENT SKATING A LOT AND YOU KNOW SHE WAS JUST ALWAYS THERE FOR US BUT NOWADAYS IF THERE ARE TWO PARENTS TO A FAMILY THE MOTHER WORKS JUST AS HARD AS THE FATHER DOES AND THE CHILDREN EITHER STAY AT HOME AND GET INTO TROUBLE OR THEY RE STUCK IN A DAY CARE .
AND I JUST I JUST DO NT WANT MY CHILDREN TO HAVE TO BE RAISED LIKE THAT .
ALL MY FRIENDS THEY THEIR PARENTS WORKED ALL THE TIME THEY GOT TO STAY AT HOME BY THEMSELVES AND WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I THOUGHT THEY WERE LUCKY BECAUSE THEY GOT TO GET AWAY WITH THINGS .
UHHUH .
LIKE I COULD NT RIDE MY BIKE ACROSS THE STREET BUT THEY COULD BECAUSE THEY RE MOM WOULD NEVER KNOW IT .
YEAH .
BUT NOW I REALIZE THAT IT WAS BETTER BECAUSE UM THEY HAVE GOT INTO A LOT OF TROUBLE .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE OF LACK OF SUPERVISION .
WELL THAT THAT CERTAINLY CAN HAPPEN NOW IF YOU YOU SAY YOU RE IN COMMUNICATIONS .
UHHUH .
UH WHAT BASE OF COMMUNICATIONS WOULD YOU BE MOST INTERESTED IN GETTING IN TO .
WELL I M MAJORING IN UH PUBLIC RELATIONS .
PUBLIC RELATIONS SO .
YEAH .
SO YOU WOULD HAVE A JOB WITH A COMPANY .
YES MAAM .
RATHER THAN UH RADIO OR TELEVISION OR NEWSPAPERS OR .
RIGHT .
WHAT HAVE YOU .
UHHUH .
YEAH AND UH THEN YOU D BE WILLING TO GIVE UP YOUR JOB TO STAY HOME AND WITH OR STAY WITH THE CHILDREN .
WELL I WOULD LIKE TO UH STAY AT HOME WITH MY CHILDREN FOR AT LEAST THE FIRST FIVE YEARS .
UHHUH .
BUT WHAT WHAT .
I PLAN TO DO IN THE FUTURE IS UM GO AHEAD AND GET MY UPPER EDUCATION AS FAR AS MY MASTERS .
UHHUH .
AND WORK ON MY DOCTORATE AND TEACH UM COLLEGE .
UHHUH .
AND IN THAT CASE THEN I LL BE I LL BE AT HOME WHEN MY CHILDREN ARE AT HOME BUT I D LIKE TO STAY AT HOME WITH THEM UNTIL THEY GET IN AT LEAST INTO KINDERGARTEN .
UHHUH .
WHERE THEY RE AT SCHOOL FROM WHAT EIGHT TO THREE OR SOMETHING AND THEN I WOULD BE AT MY SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
TEACHING .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND UM .
WELL THAT THAT S UH IS AN ADVANTAGE OF BEING IN THE EDUCATION FIELD .
I SPENT THIRTYFOUR YEARS IN EDUCATION .
OH REALLY .
YES AND .
WHAT GRADE .
SO OH I STARTED OUT WITH COLLEGE AND THEN WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL AND THEN I PREFERRED THE HIGH SCHOOL AGE LEVEL MUCH BETTER THAN I DID THE COLLEGE .
OH DID YOU .
BECAUSE YOU HAVE A CLOSER RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UH STUDENTS .
WHAT DID YOU TEACH .
THAT I TAUGHT PHYSICAL EDUCATION .
OH OH I STARTED OUT AS A P E MAJOR .
UHHUH .
IN EDUCATION .
I WANTED TO BE A P E TEACHER .
WELL .
I SURE DID .
I UH I FOUND THAT UH IT WAS A PERFECT COMBINATION FROM THE STANDPOINT OF HAVING VACATIONS OFF AT THE SAME TIME .
OH YEAH .
AND UH AND IT WORKED OUT FINE FROM THAT STANDPOINT UH PLUS THE FACT THAT UH WHEN I LEFT UH USUALLY UH MY HUSBAND WAS SELDOM HOME FOR MAYBE FORTYFIVE MINUTES OR SO AND THEN OUR SON HE HAD TO GET ON THE BUS .
UHHUH .
AND HE DID GET ON THE BUS IT WAS HIS RESPONSIBILITY AND HE NEVER EVER THOUGHT OF UH NOT GOING TO SCHOOL .
HE SAID IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT HE WAS CERTAIN I HAD A HOT LINE TO HIS SCHOOL .
BECAUSE UH I UH .
ABSOLUTELY .
WELL I I WAS IN PHYSICAL EDUCATION THEN AND I JUST KEPT GETTING PUSHED INTO ADMINISTRATION WOUND UP IN ADMINISTRATION AND SO .
OH .
HE THOUGHT SURELY THAT I OR I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT A HOT LINE .
TO KNOW IF HE EVER SKIPPED SCHOOL WHICH OF COURSE WAS NOT THE CASE AND I WOULD NT HAVE CHECKED ON HIM .
HOWEVER UH THERE ARE THERE ARE POINTS BOTH .
DIRECTIONS IN THAT UH FROM THE STANDPOINT OF PARENTS WORKING AND NOT WORKING .
YEAH .
UH I LISTENED TO MORE THAN ONE PARENT SAY I DO NT KNOW WHAT .
THIS CHILD WANTS .
I M WORKING TWO JOBS THEY .
EACH HAVE THEIR OWN TELEVISION THEY .
EACH HAVE THEIR OWN TELEPHONE THEY .
EACH HAVE THEIR OWN ROOMS THEY .
EACH HAVE THIS THEY .
EACH HAVE THAT .
I D SAY BUT WHAT .
THEY DO NT HAVE IS YOU .
THAT S RIGHT .
THEY NEED SOME ATTENTION .
ABSOLUTELY .
AND UH I THINK OUT BECAUSE THAT IS THE WAY OF GETTING ATTENTION .
WELL SEE WHENEVER MY MOM STAYED HOME WITH US WE DID WITHOUT A LOT I MEAN WE WERE IT S HARD TO MAKE IT ON ONE INCOME .
THAT S RIGHT .
BUT WE DID AND AND WE LIVED IN A TRAILER FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS .
HUH .
AND UM YOU KNOW WE WE ONLY HAD ONE CAR WE ONLY HAD ONE TELEPHONE YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
WE DID NT GET TO EAT OUT ALL THE TIME BUT I I FEEL LIKE THAT IT HELPED ME NOW BECAUSE I APPRECIATE THE VALUE OF THE DOLLAR .
RIGHT .
AND UM I ALSO HAD THE SUPERVISION THAT I NEEDED WHILE I WAS GROWING UP AND I HOPE THAT I CAN PROVIDE THAT FOR MY CHILD TOO .
AND WE CERTAINLY UH WE NEED MORE OF THAT WE NEED MORE PARENTS WILLING TO SUPERVISE THOUGH WE VE HAD SUCH A BREAKDOWN IN THE FAMILY STRUCTURE .
OH WE HAVE .
FROM THE STANDPOINT OF OF UH CHURCH AND SCHOOL AND EVERYTHING ALONG THE WAY .
AND THAT I THINK HAS CONTRIBUTED MUCH TO UH THE DELINQUENCY .
THAT WORKS GRANT AND THE POOR SCHOOL RESULTS THAT WE RE HAVING .
UH THAT THE STUDENTS UH PARENTS HAVE JUST NOT REALLY TAKEN ENOUGH INTEREST IN THEM FROM THE VERY VERY BEGINNING AND I THINK MY FEELING WAS THAT THE VERY BEST TEACHERS SHOULD BE IN GRADES ONE TWO AND THREE .
TO GET THE STUDENTS OFF TO A GOOD START LET THEM HAVE POSITIVE UM UH EXPERIENCES .
UHHUH .
FROM THE LOWER LEVELS SO THEY WANT TO CONTINUE LEARNING AND UH KEEP GOING AND NOT WAIT UNTIL THEY RE THEY RE IN THE NINTH AND TENTH GRADES IT S TOO LATE THEN YOU CAN NOT .
IT IS .
REVERSE THAT TREND AT THAT POINT .
IT S WAY TOO LATE .
RIGHT .
I AGREE .
AND UH WHILE PARENTS VERY OFTEN WILL BE INVOLVED WITH THE SCHOOL ACTIVITIES WHEN THE CHILD S IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND THEY GET INTO THE HIGH SCHOOLS SO OFTEN THEY SEEM TO DROP AWAY AT THAT POINT .
AND THAT IS JUST AS VALUABLE .
IT IS .
AT THAT TIME AS TO THE RUSH IN THE ELEMENTARY .
BECAUSE ALL THE PEER PRESSURE .
YES RIGHT .
IT STARTS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND THE PARENT REALLY NEEDS TO BE THERE FOR THE CHILD .
RIGHT .
AND UH THE CHILD NEEDS TO TAKE PRIDE IN THE FACT THAT THEIR PARENT IS DOING SOMETHING .
UH WE WERE FORTUNATE IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT MY SON DID PLAY FOOTBALL AND I DID KEEP STATISTICS FOR HIS TEAM AND .
OH GREAT .
HIS DAD DID TAKE MOVIES OF THE FOOTBALL TEAM AND MOVIES OF THE BASKETBALL TEAM AND WE TRIED TO BE A PART OF IT BUT NOT OVERSHADOWING HIM OR MAKING HIM FEEL THAT WE HAD TO BE THERE ALL THE TIME .
YEAH .
SO WH I FEEL THAT I LEARNED A GREAT DEAL FROM MY STUDENTS UH WITH REGARD TO WHAT .
THEIR BIGGEST COMPLAINTS WERE WITH PARENTS .
AND A THING SUCH AS UH ONE OF THE BIGGEST COMPLAINTS I WELL REMEMBER BECAUSE I SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH SENIORS .
UH WAS UM CARRYING THEIR MUMBLEX WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE .
I DID NT HAVE THIS OR THAT .
UHHUH .
AND I KNOW I NEVER EVER SAID THAT BECAUSE I KNEW THAT THAT WAS ONE THING .
THAT WAS REALLY IRRITATING TO YOUNG PEOPLE .
WELL I GUESS THAT WAS GOOD THAT YOU WERE YOU WERE HEARING IT FROM OTHER STUDENTS .
YES AND I HAD TO DEAL WITH THEIR PROBLEMS AND I COULD TALK ABOUT THE KINDS OF PROBLEMS .
WHICH .
THEY WERE BRINGING THAT THEY HAD JUST IN GENERAL ASPECT AND OUR SON WOULD SHARE THIS AND THEN HE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR HIMSELF ALONG THOSE SAME TYPES OF OF UH LINES .
SO THAT .
WELL UM .
I THINK HE BENEFITED FROM MY EXPERIENCES .
DOES YOUR SON WORK FOR T I .
NO .
OH .
NO HE UH WORKS UH FOR A DIFFERENT COMPANY .
YEAH IN THE DALLAS AREA BUT WHEN HE WENT AWAY TO COLL AND HE WAS ON THE LAWNS FROM THE TIME .
HE WAS IN THE SEVENTH GRADE AND UH A SMALL MUMBLEX AND ALL THE WAY THROUGH COLLEGE AND HE HELD THREE JOBS .
WALLY WAS IN COLLEGE AND WE DID NT EVEN KNOW IT .
OH GOODNESS .
HE DID NT EVEN TELL US .
UH THAT HE HAD THREE JOBS BUT WHEN HE GRADUATED HE HAD A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR BANK ACCOUNT AND UH WE HAD TOLD HIM THAT IF HE EVER WANTED TO GO TO COLLEGE .
HE COULD GO IF HE GOT MARRIED HE WAS ON HIS OWN IF HE FLUNKED OUT HE WAS ON HIS OWN .

OR OR THEY JUST PUT IT IN THE BACK OF THEIR MIND AND LET IT SLIDE .

THE SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR WAS SAYING AS WHAT WAS THE TOPIC .
FITNESS AND EXERCISE .
OH GOD .
NO WHY DO NT YOU GO FIRST .
OKAY UM I LIKE TO DO UH WEIGHT TRAINING AND AND CYCLING .
AND JUST WALKING UH SWIMMING .
I USED TO DO A LOT OF BASKETBALL AND RUNNING AND VOLLEYBALL UNTIL I HAD SOME KNEE SURGERY LAST FALL .
AND THE DOCTOR SAID THAT RUNNING AND JUMPING IS NT REAL GOOD FOR MY KNEE ANYMORE SO I HAD TO KIND OF CHANGE MY LIFESTYLE A LITTLE BIT .
WELL LET ME ASK A PERSONAL QUESTION HOW OLD ARE YOU .
THIRTYEIGHT .
OH WELL THEN YOU SHOULD SEE OVER THIRTYFIVE .
EVERYTHING GOES DOWNHILL FLOP .
WELL THE REST OF ME IS IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE .
IT S JUST THAT LEFT KNEE .
THAT JUST DOES NT WANT TO DO EVERYTHING .
IT USED TO .
OH YOU RE LUCKY THEN BECAUSE I VE BATTLED ARTHRITIS .
ALL MY LIFE .
REALLY .
I MEAN EVEN SINCE I WAS LIKE ABOUT TWO OR THREE .
OH .
THEN THEY DIAGNOSED IT AND USUALLY MOST PEOPLE ARE JUST ABSOLUTELY CRIPPLED AND UH I DO WATER AEROBICS .
OH I BET THAT HELPS .
RELIGIOUSLY DO WATER AEROBICS .
UHHUH .
I USED TO DO IT ABOUT SIX TIMES .
A WEEK AND NOW I M DOWN TO ABOUT FOUR BUT IT S ABOUT THE ONLY THING .
THAT KEEPS MY MOBILITY IN SH IN THERE UH I TRIED WEIGHT TRAINING AND I M TELLING YOU YOU JUST I JUST CA NT LIFT THE THINGS .
YEAH .
AND THE SHOCK ON THE SYSTEM IS IS JUST TOO MUCH SO I HAVE STUCK TO WATER AEROBICS BASICALLY YOU KNOW THE WEIGHTLESS THING AND .
YEAH .
TRYING TO KEEP THIS SHAPE .
THAT WAY BUT YOU KNOW IT S HARD TO FIND .
I MEAN IT S REALLY HARD TO FIND A PLACE .
THAT S GOING TO OFFER WATER AEROBICS BECAUSE WHAT .
I M FINDING IS THAT IF THEY DO OFFER IT YOU GET THE CROWD OF WOMEN .
THAT ARE I THINK THEY FEEL THIS IS GOING TO BE AN EFFORTLESS SWEATLESS WAY .
THAT S RIGHT .
TO GET IN SHAPE .
THAT S RIGHT .
WITHOUT HAVING TO SPEND ANYTHING OR IT S THE GERIATRIC CROWD .
THAT S RIGHT .
SO I VE CONSIDERED EVEN BECOMING LICENSED TO TEACH IT .
WELL I MEAN IF IF YOU KNOW WHAT .
YOUR ROUTINE IS YOU CAN DO THAT BY YOURSELF AND YOU PROBABLY DO .
YEAH BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN INDOOR POOL .
THIS IS TRUE .
SO TO FIND AN INDOOR POOL WHERE EITHER YOU CAN DO THIS BY YOURSELF WITHOUT YOU KNOW DRAWING A LOT OF LOOKS MEANS YOU RE REALLY GOING TO DO A STRENUOUS WORKOUT ACTIVITY MUMBLEX .
YOU LOOK VERY ODD IN THE WATER .
WELL THAT .
THAT WAS THE ONE PLACE WHERE I WAS ALSO ABLE TO DO WEIGHT TRAINING AND THAT DOES LOOK VERY ODD IN THE WATER .
I CAN BELIEVE THAT .
HAVE YOU TRIED THE UH THE POOL AT THE SPRING CREEK FITNESS CENTER .
NO AND YOU KNOW THAT S THE ONLY PLACE .
I HAVE NT TRIED AND PEOPLE HAVE TOLD ME .
NOW THAT S THE TEXINS FACILITY .
YES .
I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THING IS JUST LOVELY .
IT IS .
THEY KEEP IT AT EIGHTYONE DEGREES YEARROUND .
HUH .
HE DO YOU USE THAT FACILITY .
A LOT .
UM A FAIRLY A FAIRLY GOOD AMOUNT UH MORE ON THE WEEKENDS UH I TRY TO BEAT THE TRAFFIC IN THE MORNINGS WHEN I .
WORKOUT IN THE MORNINGS I TRY TO COME DOWN TO THE DALLAS FITNESS CENTER .
HUH .
DO YOU KNOW IF THEY HAVE CHILD CARE THERE .
UM HAVE YOU DONE YOUR ATTITUDE SURVEY FOR THIS YEAR YET .
YOU NEED TO PUT THAT ON THERE SERIOUSLY .
THEY DO NT I DO NT I DO NT WORK AT T I .
OH YOU DO NT .
NO I USED TO WORK AT T I .
OH .
AS MATTER OF FACT .
I WAS THE ONLY WOMAN THAT THEY HAD IN THE FIELD IN A MANAGEMENT POSITION ACTUALLY WHEN I WAS WORKING THERE .
I WAS THE ONLY WOMAN .
THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH IN THE INDUSTRY AND I USED TO FILL OUT THOSE ATTITUDE SURVEYS .
YEAH .
AND UH UH ME AND THE INSURANCE ADJUSTERS ARE ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH EACH OTHER AND MY HUSBAND STILL WORKS THERE .
YEAH .
AND UM I GET MY ATTITUDE EXPRESSED THROUGH THEM BUT I FIND IT TO BE VERY SOMETIMES IT S KIND OF SHOOT YOURSELF IN THE FOOT SHORT MUMBLEX MENTALITY TO SAVE A FEW BUCKS .
THIS IS TRUE .
UH AND NEVER HAVING LIVED IN TEXAS BEFORE I STARTING WORKING FOR T I AND I CAME DOWN HERE AND YOU KNOW THEY DID AN ATTITUDE SURVEY LIKE SIX WEEKS AFTER I HAD BEEN WORKING HERE AND I ASKED ABOUT YOU KNOW DAY CARE FOR THE SHIFT WORKERS .
YEAH .
AND BOY .
I WAS PULLED IN BY MY MANAGER AND TOLD THAT YOU JUST DO NT SAY THAT YOU KNOW .
WELL IT S NOT .
IT WAS NOT APPLICABLE TO ME AND I WAS KIND OF HORRIFIED .
NOW WHAT YEAR ARE WE TALKING ABOUT .
WE RE TALKING NINETEEN SEVENTYEIGHT .
OKAY UH THINGS HAVE BECOME MUCH MORE ENLIGHTENED SINCE THEN .
THEY COULD NT HAVE GOTTEN ANYMORE IN THE DARK AGES .
YEAH YOU KNOW WE STILL DO NT HAVE A DAY CARE FACILITY BUT PEOPLE ARE MORE SYMPATHETIC TO IT .
I UNDERSTAND I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY RE NOW COVERING WOMEN S PREVENTATIVE HEALTH CARE .
YES .
YES .
AND UH THE REASON .
I M AT HOME IS WHEN I HAD MY KIDS AND I WAS SCHEDULED TO GO BACK AND I TELL YOU HOW MUCH IN THE DARK AGES .
IT WAS .
UM I HAD BEEN RATED NUMBER ONE IN THE FIELD AND THEN I TOOK UH WHEN I BECAME PREGNANT I ALSO GOT MENINGITIS .
OH .
AND THEN DELIVERED THE FIRST BABY THREE MONTHS EARLY .
MY GOSH .
AND THEY PUT THE BABY ON A HEART LUNG MONITOR WHEN I TOOK HER .
HOME AND THE INSURANCE CARRIER WAS NOT GOING TO COVER THIS BECAUSE IT WAS CONSIDERED PREVENTATIVE TREATMENT .
COULD YOU HOLD THE PHONE FOR ONE SECOND .
SURE .
THANKS .
OKAY I M BACK .
AND THEN THEY USED TO UH AND THEN I HAD A SECOND ONE EIGHTEEN MONTHS LATER THEY TOLD ME TO PUT THEM BACK TO BACK AND OF COURSE TO MAINTAIN AND I WAS FLAT ON MY BACK FOR THE LAST FIVE MONTHS WITH THE SECOND ONE .
WOW .
BECAUSE THAT S WHEN I GO INTO LABOR MUMBLEX FOUR AND A HALF MONTHS AND I DO NT EVEN KNOW IT .
OF COURSE .
IT S REAL EASY TO TAKE CARE OF THE FIRST ONE WHEN YOU RE ON YOUR BACK .
OH YEAH VERY EASY VERY EASY AND THEY THEY PUT ME ON TWENTYFOUR HOUR FETAL MONITORING THEN TO TO TRY TO CONTROL THE LABOR AND SEE HOW FAR .
IT WAS GOING AND AFTER THE BABY WAS BORN SINCE IT .
WAS NT PREMATURE THEN THEY SAID THEY WOULD NT COVER THE COST OF THE MONITOR .
I THINK THAT S KIND OF WHEN MY HUSBAND HIT THE ROOF .
REALLY .
BECAUSE IT WAS A UH THIRTEEN THOUSAND DOLLAR BILL BUT AFTER THE SECOND BABY WAS BORN I WAS GOING TO GO BACK TO WORK .
YEAH .
AND THAT WAS WHEN THEY HAD GOD .
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE EIGHTYFIVE LAYOFF .
YEAH .
AND I LL TELL YOU HOW THEY HANDLED THIS AND I WAS JUST OUTRAGED I DID NOT KNOW THAT SINCE I WAS ON PERSONAL LEAVE OF ABSENCE THAT I HAD BEEN UH TERMINATED UNTIL I FILED MY INSURANCE CLAIMS ABOUT FOUR MONTHS LATER AND THEY DID NT HAVE ANY COVERAGE UNDER MY NAME AND I WENT BACK AND I SAID WHAT .
THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE YOU KNOW .
YEAH REALLY .
AND THEY TOLD ME THAT UH OH WELL YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOUR HUSBAND WORKS HERE AND HE S GOT A GOOD SALARY .
WE DID NT THINK THAT YOU D BE COMING BACK ANYWAY AND UH YOU KNOW WE VE GOT PEOPLE HERE THAT REALLY YOU KNOW NEED TO BE WORKING AND SO THAT WE HAD JUST YOU KNOW IT WAS THIS WAY .
WE DID NT HAVE TO LAYOFF .
AN ACTIVE PERSON AND WE D JUST LET YOU GO .
AND IT TOOK ME ABOUT A YEAR OF ARGUING I SAID YOU KNOW I VE GOT TO PUT THIS IN WRITING TO ME .
YEAH .
AND BECAUSE UNTIL THEY PUT IT IN WRITING I COULD NT GET MY INSURANCE BENEFITS AND I COULD NT GET MY UH TERMINATION BENEFITS EITHER .
THERE YOU GO .
I WAS JUST PISSED AS HELL THAT THEY COULD DO THAT .
I I CAN BELIEVE THAT .
BUT I I GUESS THINGS HAVE GOTTEN BETTER I VE BEEN TOLD THAT THIS FLEX HOUR AND THOSE KIND OF THINGS .
OH YEAH FLEX TIME IS GREAT .
I STILL DO NT THINK THAT THEY AFTER MY EXPERIENCES THAT THEY COULD YOU KNOW GET ME TO GO BACK EVER AGAIN .
I I CAN UNDERSTAND .
I CAN UNDERSTAND .
WELL IT S BEEN GOOD TALKING WITH YOU .
BUT LET ME ASK YOU .
THIS SINCE YOU USE TEXANS HOW MUCH IS IT .
A MONTH .
OH SHOOT IT S ONLY ABOUT TEN BUCKS .
A MONTH .
NOW THAT S FOR INDIVIDUAL .
YEAH I MEAN UH TO ADD DEPENDENTS IS IS YOU KNOW MAYBE ANOTHER DOLLAR OR SOMETHING .
IT S NO BIG DEAL .
THAT S IT .
YEAH .
NOW IF YOU IF YOU PAY YOUR MONTHLY CHARGE DO YOU THEN PAY SEPARATELY FOR CLASSES YOUR TAKING .
UH YOU DO FOR CLASSES FOR CLASSES BUT TO I MEAN TO USE ANY OF THE FACILITIES IS IS NO EXTRA CHARGE .
GOD THAT S CHEAP .
YEAH IT IS .
THAT S REALLY CHEAP .
DO YOU HAVE TO BE AN ACTIVE T I .
EMPLOYEE TO JOIN TEXANS OR .

AT ALL I MEAN THERE S A GREAT DEAL OF SACRIFICE THAT HAS TO BE MADE ON THE PART OF A FAMILY IF THE IF THE WIFE IS GOING TO ACTUALLY BE A MOTHER .
UHHUH UHHUH THAT S INTERESTING BECAUSE THAT RELATES TO THE THING THAT THAT STRIKES ME THE MOST AND I M SURE YOU VE YOU VE LABELLED THE CAUSE BECAUSE WHAT STRIKES ME THE MOST IN THE CHANGES IN SOCIETY IS THE WAY KIDS BEHAVE AND .
UHHUH I THINK THAT THAT MUMBLEX THEY HAVE TO BE RELATED .
THAT S RIGHT THAT S RIGHT AND YOU KNOW I MEAN I WAS THINKING IT JUST YOU KNOW MY COMPLAINT WOULD WOULD BE UM THAT I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THE KIDS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD RUN WILD AND THEY THEY DESTROY PROPERTY AND THEY YOU KNOW STEAL EACH OTHER S TOYS AND STUFF AND .
UHHUH .
THERE S JUST NO RESPECT FOR FOR PEOPLE OR PROPERTY AND I GUESS YOU KNOW WHEN YOU STOP TO THINK OF IT THESE KIDS HAVE PROBABLY BEEN DEPRIVED OF A LOT OF ATTENTION THAT THEY VE NEEDED ALL THEIR LIVES .
UHHUH I THINK THAT THAT S PROBABLY TRUE .
SCARY .
I JUST WISH THERE WAS A WAY I KNOW THAT IN IN YOU KNOW IN SWEDEN WHAT THEY HAVE THERE IT S REALLY THEIR MEDICAL PLAN BUT IT ALSO DEALS WITH THIS SUBJECT BECAUSE IF A WOMAN UH IS WORKING .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK EVEN IF SHE S NOT AND HAS A CHILD THE GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIZES HER TO STAY HOME AND RAISE THE CHILD .
BUT FOR HOW MANY YEARS .
I DO NT I DO NT KNOW .
UHHUH .
UNTIL IT UM I M SURE UNTIL AT LEAST SCHOOL AGE AND MAYBE LONGER .
OH THAT S GREAT .
WHAT THIS DOES IS IT ALLOWS THE GOVERNMENT TO SUBSIDIZE HER TO BE THE MOTHER OF HER CHILDREN RATHER THAN TO SUBSIDIZE CHILD CARE .
UHHUH .
TO RAISE THE CHILD FOR HER .
RIGHT .
AND I THINK THAT THAT S A REAL A MUCH MUCH MORE VIABLE SOLUTION REALLY .
UHHUH NO I AGREE A HUNDRED PERCENT A HUNDRED PERCENT I GUESS I WAS LUCKY BECAUSE I WAS TEACHING AND SO I WAS ABLE TO JUST GO TO A CLASS AND TEACH WHEN MY SON WAS LITTLE AND SO I D BE GONE YOU KNOW AN HOUR AND FIFTEEN MINUTES OR SOMETHING AT A STRETCH .
OH YEAH THAT S GREAT .
AND THEN YEAH VERY SOON HE WAS OLD ENOUGH TO JUST GO AND SORT OF STAY IN MY OFFICE AND .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW NOBODY SEEMED TO HAVE A BIG PROBLEM WITH THAT SO THAT S AN INTERESTING ISSUE THOUGH UM YEAH .
UM GOODNESS WHAT ELSE .
OH THERE S BEEN SO MANY HOW DO YOU JUST .
RIGHT I VE ACTUALLY ANOTHER ONE THAT I A QUESTION I WOULD HAVE IS I GUESS I M BEING YOU KNOW BEYOND THE AGE OF THINKING OF THIS THIS PROBLEM I HAD AN ARGUMENT RECENTLY WITH MY BOSS I THINK IT WAS ABOUT THE NEED FOR WOMEN TO WORK BUT I THINK YOU PUT YOUR FINGER ON IT WHEN YOU SAID THAT THEY RE NOT RESPECTED IF THEY DO NT WORK BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE I KNOW WOMEN I KNOW ARE DOING VERY MENIAL JOBS IN A CERTAIN SENSE CERTAINLY FINANCIALLY .
UHHUH .
AND I MEAN WHEN I SEE THE AMOUNT OF CLOTHES THAT THEY BUY AND AND HOW MUCH IT COSTS THEM TO BUY FAST FOOD ON THE WAY HOME .
YEAH UHHUH .
I M SURE THAT THEY RE NOT MAKING QUOTE MAKING MONEY FOR THE FAMILY ON THIS .
YEAH REALLY .
AND AND PROBABLY YOU RE RIGHT .
I DO NT SEE HOW THEY COULD BE ESPECIALLY NOT IF THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR CHILD CARE .
WELL NO EVEN FAMILIES THAT DO NT HAVE CHILD CARE I MEAN YOU KNOW WHEN I THINK OF THIS ONE FRIEND WHO MAKES PROBABLY TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND I M SURE SHE SPENDS AT LEAST THAT IN CLOTHES PLUS YOU KNOW FAST FOOD EVERY DAY AND OUT TO LUNCH EVERY DAY .
UHHUH .
AND .
YOU RE PROBABLY RIGHT IF SHE SAT DOWN AND LOOKED AT IT SHE D BE LIKE GOD WHAT AM I DOING THIS FOR YOU KNOW .
EXACTLY AND I MEAN YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH THEY DO NT HAVE CHILDREN THEY THEY HAVE RELATIVES AND YOU KNOW THE HUSBAND WOULD CERTAINLY LIKE A LOT MORE ATTENTION AND AND SHE WOULD NT HAVE TO HIRE SOMEBODY TO CLEAN THE HOUSE AND DO THE GARDENING AND SO I I GUESS YOU RE RIGHT IT S IT S OUR SOCIETY DEMANDS WOMEN TO WORK IF THEY RE GOING TO BE RESPECTED .
UHHUH .
REALLY SAD .
YEAH RELIGION HAS CHANGED TOO .
OH THAT S TRUE .
UM UH SOME PEOPLE NOW IT SEEMS LIKE ARE TURNING BACK TOWARD ACTUALLY TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY RE IN IT FOR INSTEAD OF JUST UM IT IT S IT SOME PLACES STILL IT SEEMS LIKE IT S A SOCIAL CLUB .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW IT S JUST A PLACE TO GO TO VISIT UH TO WEAR YOUR NICE CLOTHES AND AND TO SIT AROUND AND TALK BUT UM I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE REALLY YOU KNOW SEARCHING NOW TO FIND FIND OUT WHO THEY ARE AND WHO GOD IS AND WHAT ALL THAT REALLY MEANS NOW .
UHHUH SO THAT MIGHT BE A POSITIVE CHANGE IN SOCIETY .
YEAH OH IT S IT S UM IT S BEGINNING I THINK .
UHHUH UHHUH I GUESS I HAVE NT SEEN THAT AS MUCH IN THIS AREA ALTHOUGH EVERY NOW AND THEN YOU HEAR ABOUT IT .
UHHUH .
UH BUT AMONG YOU KNOW PEOPLE I KNOW I DO NT SEE A GREAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAVE HAD SERIOUS QUESTIONS ALL ALONG AND YOU KNOW ARE SORT OF PURSUING IT .
UHHUH .
BUT UM THE CHURCHES HERE ARE GROWING LEAPS AND BOUNDS AND I THOUGHT IT WAS MORE BECAUSE OF THE THE VERY TRANSIENT NATURE OF THE AREA .
UHHUH .
AND THAT PEOPLE WERE GOING BASICALLY JUST AS YOU SAID AS A SOCIAL TO MEET PEOPLE AND THAT BUT UM IT S HARD TO JUDGE AND THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS CHANGING I SUPPOSE .
YEAH .
JUST YOU KNOW THE WHOLE THE WHOLE ENVIRONMENT I FIND .
UHHUH .
UM SORT OF YOU KNOW I WONDER WITH WITH ALL OUR CHEMICALS AND AND THAT AND AND THE FOODS WE EAT AND YOU KNOW YOUNG PEOPLE THAT I KNOW ARE GETTING VERY SERIOUS DISEASES AND .
OH YES WELL I GUESS THAT S ALWAYS HAPPENED .
PROBABLY .
MAYBE NOT AS MUCH AS NOW BUT .
WELL IT S JUST IT S MAYBE IT S MORE UNUSUAL NOW WHEN YOU KNOW SOMEBODY QUITE YOUNG GETS CERTAIN KINDS OF CANCER AND IN THE PAST MAYBE THE SAME PERCENTAGE GOT THEM BUT WE DID NT KNOW IT OR I DO NT KNOW WELL I GUESS WE VE SORT OF RUN DRY A LITTLE BIT .
OKAY .
IT WAS NICE TALKING TO YOU .
NICE TO TALK TO YOU .
OKAY BYEBYE .
BYEBYE .
WELL KATHLEEN DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM .
I CERTAINLY DO .
UH I THINK .
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT PROBLEM IS .
I THINK WE HAVE A LOUSY SCHOOL SYSTEM .
AND I THINK A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT WE DO NT TRAIN OUR TEACHERS VERY WELL .
AND THEN WE PUT THE SCHOOLS IN THE HANDS OF PROFESSIONAL EDUCATORS INSTEAD OF THE TEACHERS AND THE PARENTS .
AND THEN .
OH WE DO NT UH WE PUT TOO MUCH UH RESPONSIBILITY ON THE TEACHERS .
FOR THINGS .
THAT ARE REALLY NOT EDUCATION .
THEY RE SOCIAL SERVICES .
HUH .
THAT SEEMS LIKE YOU VE THOUGHT THIS THROUGH QUITE A BIT BEFORE .
WELL I AS A MATTER OF FACT I JUST FINISHED EDITING A BOOK ON THE TOPIC .
SO I HAVE SOME RATHER STRONG OPINIONS .
THAT S INTERESTING .
DO YOU UH YOURSELF .
AND AND I M SURE THEY RE COLORED BY WHAT .
I VE EDITED .
DO YOUSELF HAVE CHILDREN WI WHO ARE OR HAVE BEEN THROUGH THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM .
YES I DO .
AND I WAS NOT VERY HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS .
I SEE .
SO IF YOU WERE TO IMPROVE IT WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO IMPROVE IT .
WELL I THINK I WOULD START WITH A BOUT WITH GETTING RID OF ABOUT TWOTHIRDS OF THE ADMINISTRATORS .
UHHUH .
AND ALL THE AUXILIARY PERSONNEL .
THE SCHOOL BUREAUCRACY .
THAT EXISTS MAINLY TO PERPETUATE ITSELF .
RIGHT .
AND THEN I WOULD PROVIDE UH USE THE MONEY THAT WE VE PAYING THEM TO UH PROVIDE SOME SPECIAL HELP IN TRAINING AND PARTICULARLY UH MENTOR TEACHERS .
UHHUH .
TO WORK WITH THE BEGINNING TEACHERS AND THE TEACHERS .
WHO MAY HAVE BEEN AT IT .
A LONG TIME BUT HAVE BEEN MAKING THE SAME MISTAKES FOR A LONG TIME .
SURE .
SURE .
AND THEN LET THEM TRY SOME INNOVATIVE THINGS AND SEE WHAT .
UHHUH .
WORKS .
AND THEN UH HAVE SOME SORT OF MECHANISM FOR PASSING THAT KNOWLEDGE ALONG TO OTHER TEACHERS .
WHO COULD BENEFIT FROM THE SAME SORTS OF THINGS .
UHHUH .
AND THEN FROM THE PARENTS SIDE HAVE THE PARENTS SUPPORT THE SCHOOL .
GET INVOLVED .
PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT S HAPPENING .
TALK TO THE TEACHERS .
UH TALK TO THEIR KIDS ABOUT SCHOOL .
AND SUPPORT THE INSTITUTION AND A INSTEAD OF BECOMING ADVERSARIES TO THE TEACHERS SO THAT THE UH THE TEACHER S IN THE MIDDLE .
UHHUH .
THAT S UH SOME .
PRETTY GOOD IDEAS .
WHY DO NT YOU DO SOMETHING WITH THOSE .
WELL I VE DONE ABOUT ALL .
I CAN DO WHICH IS GET THE MANUSCRIPT IN GOOD SHAPE SO THAT IT CAN BE PUBLISHED AND READ BY A LOT OF PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
WELL YOU SHOULD UH RUN FOR A SCHOOL BOARD POSITION .
OH WELL .
THAT I M NOT SO SURE ABOUT .
I VE GOT A LOT OF THINGS TO KEEP ME BUSY .
UHHUH .
THAT .
HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING LIKE THAT .
ANYTHING POLITICAL .
WELL MY MOTHER WAS ON THE SCHOOL BOARD .
UHHUH .
AS WE WERE COMING UP .
AND UH THAT BASICALLY IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH .
OUR OUR FAMILY HAS BEEN DIRECTLY YOU KNOW THEY VE ALWAYS BEEN INVOLVED .
MY PARENTS THROUGH THE THE P T .
A ORGANIZATION .
AND MY MOTHER WAS ON THE SCHOOL BOARD FOR EIGHT YEARS .
UHHUH .
BUT UH THAT WAS THAT S THE EXTENT OF WHICH .
I GUESS THAT S MORE THAN THAN SOME PEOPLE LESS THAN OTHERS .
THAT S MORE THAN A LOT .
I WOULD UH TEND TO AGREE WITH YOU THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM .
THE METHODS OF CORRECTING IT .
I HAVE NT THOUGHT THROUGH QUITE TO THE DETAIL .
WHICH .
YOU HAVE .
BUT I BELIEVE THAT THERE S DEFINITELY A BASIC PERCEPTION AND IMAGE PROBLEM WITH THE FACT OF EVEN BEING A TEACHER .
UHHUH .
AND IF THERE WAS A WAY TO THROUGH THE PUBLIC MIND SET THAT IMAGE TO BE A LITTLE HIGHER ESTEEM A LITTLE UH UH A LITTLE MORE PRESTIGE TO BEING A TEACHER .
AND WITH THAT OF COURSE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO PAY THEM .
A ACCORDINGLY .
IF WE PAID THEM MORE IT WOULD ATTRACT MORE THE THE HIGHER EDUCATED PEOPLE TO TO EITHER MOVE INTO THAT FIELD OR TO CONTINUE IN THAT FIELD .
YEAH .
AND THEN IF YOU PAID THEM MORE YOU D ALSO BE ABLE TO DEMAND A HIGHER QUALITY PRODUCT OUT OF THEM .
I THINK THAT S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT .
THEY THE THING .
THAT WORRIES ME ABOUT THAT IS THAT IF YOU JUST RAISE SALARIES ACROSS THE BOARD YOU RE GOING TO BE .
UH REWARDING PEOPLE .
WHO VE BEEN DOING A LOUSY JOB .
AND .
SURE .
INSTEAD OF GETTING THE UH IMPROVEMENT THAT WE WANT .
SURE .
SO WE D HAVE TO HAVE SOME WAY TO UH REWARD AND RECOGNIZE THE TEACHERS .
WHO ARE DOING A GOOD JOB AND GIVE THEM .
A .
A PAT ON THE BACK AND RESPECT AND SOME HONOR AND .
UHHUH .
MORE MONEY .
IT UNFORTUNATELY IT S A AND IT S A BUSINESS OR AN OCCUPATION THAT THE RESULTS ARE NOT AS TANGIBLE .
UHHUH .
YEAH .
IT S IT S HARD TO TELL .
AS OTHER ONES SO IT S VERY IT S VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY THAT THIS TEACHER IS DOING A BETTER JOB THAN THIS OTHER ONE OTHER THAN I GUESS HOW YOU KN HOW A PERSON SCORES IN THE BEGINNING BEFORE THE CLASS AND THEN AFTER THE CLASS .
YOU KNOW IF THERE S SOME GAUGE THAT THEY COULD MAKE .
YEAH .
UH ALSO I VE ALW I VE THOUGHT AROUND ABOUT THE IDEA OF MAKING TEACHING AND THE BEFORE YOU CAN GET A CERTIFICATE YOU HAVE A A CERTAIN RESIDENCY PERIOD .
SO MUCH LIKE A DOCTOR .
MAYBE NOT THE FOUR YEARS DEFINITELY .
BUT SOME CERTAIN TYPE OF OF POSITION WHERE YOU RE OVERSEEN TO BEGIN WITH .
YEAH .
NOW THAT S A VERY GOOD SUGGESTION .
UH JUST SOMETHING TO I RATHER THAN THROW SOMEONE IN INTO THAT ENVIRONMENT UH YOU KNOW IT .
YEAH .
I DO NT THINK .
I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE SOMETHING .
STUDENT I DO NT THINK STUDENT TEACHING IS ENOUGH .
I THINK .
UHHUH .
THAT AT LEAST .
WHAT .
I USED TO OBSERVE IN STUDENT TEACHING WAS THAT SOME COLLEGE KID .
WHO MIGHT NOT BE ALL THAT BRIGHT TO BEGIN WITH WAS THROWN INTO A CLASS ROOM WITH A TEACHER .
WHO WAS HARRIED AND OVERWORKED AND UH HAD TOO MANY KIDS TO HANDLE AND TOO MANY THINGS TO DO AND TOO MANY INTERRUPTIONS .
RIGHT .
TO PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO THE STUDENT TEACHER .
AND THEN THE STUDENT TEACHER DID NT STAY BUT ABOUT SIX WEEKS .
UHHUH .
SO THERE REALLY WAS NO TIME TO TRY .
MUCH OF ANYTHING AND GET SIGNIFICANT FEEDBACK .
THAT WOULD HELP THE THE STUDENT TEACHER IMPROVE VERY MUCH .
SURE .
SURE .
THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS .
THAT COULD BE DONE IN THAT LINE INCLUDING THINGS LIKE VIDEO TAPING .
BECAUSE IT WOULD NT BE HARD WITH ALL THE ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT .
THAT S AROUND THESE DAYS TO VIDEO TAPE UH EITHER A MASTER TEACHER TEACHING A CLASS SO THAT THEN .
STUDENTS COULD WATCH THAT AND UH CRITICIZE THE METHODS USED AND AND ANALYZE IT .
FIGURE OUT WHAT WORKED AND WHAT DID NT WORK .
UHHUH .
AND THEN ALSO TO VIDEO TAPE .
THE STUDENT TEACHERS SO THEY COULD CORRECT THEIR OWN PERFORMANCE .
SURE .
SURE .
THAT S GOOD AS A A A TEACHING AID .
BUT MORE YOU SEE THESE COMMERCIALS .
THAT HAVE JIMMY WALKING INTO CLASS LATE AND IT HAPPENS THAT THE TEACHER IS AN INSTRUCTOR .
WHO IS IN NEW YORK WHILE JIMMY S IN ROME .
HUH .
AND YOU KNOW THE WHOLE ELECTRONIC CLASSROOM IDEA .
I DO NT KNOW IF I .
I M IN FAVOR .
I DO NT THINK THAT S GOING TO WORK .
YEAH IN FAVOR OF YEAH I THINK ESPECIALLY IN THE YOUNGER YEARS YOU NEED TO HAVE MORE OF THE THE PERSON CONTACT RATHER THAN JUST THE FACT THAT YOUR MACHINE BEING FED INFORMATION TO TO LEARN HOW TO LEARN .
YEAH .
WELL ANOTHER THING .
I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL WOULD BE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF OF SAY A NATIONAL CURRICULUM .
BECAUSE ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH GETTING GOOD TEXTBOOKS IS THAT WE HAVE SUCH A FRAGMENTED SYSTEM FOR UH CURRICULUMS THAT THE TEXTBOOK MAKERS PRODUCE A TEXTBOOK .
THAT WILL SELL IN TEXAS AND CALIFORNIA .
AND THEN EVERYBODY ELSE IS STUCK WITH THAT REGARDLESS OF WHAT .
THEY WANT TO TEACH .
HUH .
IS THAT .
BECAUSE IT .
BECAUSE THAT S WHERE THE TWO BIGGEST MARKETS ARE OR .
WELL THAT S THE TWO STATES .
THAT ADOPT ON A STATE WIDE BASIS .
I SEE .
UH AND SO IT UH I USED TO WORK FOR A TEXTBOOK PUBLISHER AND IT WAS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT IF YOU COULD GET YOUR BOOK ADOPTED BY TEXAS THEN YOU HAD A BUILTIN MARKET BECAUSE THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT THREE OR FOUR TEXTBOOKS IN EACH SUBJECT AND ALL .
YOU HAD TO DO IS JUST GET YOUR SHARE OF THOSE ADOPTED .
UHHUH .
IN THE INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS .
HUH .
AND YOU KNOW A THIRD OF THE TEXAS MARKET WITH ITS MILLIONS OF KIDS IS A HECK OF A LOT OF TEXTBOOKS .
SURE .
SURE .
AND THEN THE STATES .
THAT EITHER DO NT ADOPT ON A STATE WIDE BASIS OR DO NT HAVE AS MANY KIDS JUST HAVE TO FOLLOW ALONG AND TAKE WHAT .
TEXAS GETS .
RIGHT .
MUMBLEX CALIFORNIA IS THE BIGGEST FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS BUT TEXAS UH ADOPTS STATE WIDE ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE TWELFTH GRADE .
I SEE .
WELL DEFINITELY IS A NATIONAL PROBLEM IF THAT THEY NEED TO ADDRESS .
YEP .
SURE IS .
DEFINITELY IS .
AND I HOPE MAYBE WE RE GOING TO GET SOMEWHERE WITH A LITTLE MORE ATTENTION BEING PAID TO IT WITH UH REAGAN S UH NEW EDUCATION SECRETARY AND UH YOU KNOW TRYING TO DO SOME UH TRYING TO PRODUCE SOME NEW PROGRAMS ANYWAY .
RIGHT RIGHT .
EXCUSE ME .
WELL I VE ENJOYED SPEAKING WITH YOU .
I HAVE GOT TO GO .
I VE GOT ANOTHER LINE CALLING .
THANKS .
ALL RIGHTY .
GOODBYE .

YEAH WELL BYE .
UH BYEBYE .
HI KAY .
HI .
I UH WAS THINKING ABOUT SALARIES AND BENEFITS AND .
UHHUH .
UH WAS WONDERING WHAT S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO YOU BESIDES A SALARY IN A JOB .
WELL UM I WE JUST RECENTLY GRADUATED FROM RICE UNIVERSITY AND UH WE WERE GOING THROUGH A LOT OF JOB INTERVIEWS AND THINGS AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE IMPORTANT TO ME UH WHEN MY HUSBAND WAS LOOKING FOR HIS JOB WAS UM HOURS YOU KNOW WE HE D BEEN IN GRADUATE SCHOOL SO I WAS USED TO HIS NOT BEING HOME AT ALL .
YEAH .
SO I WAS YOU KNOW DID NT WANT HIM TO HAVE A JOB THAT WOULD MAKE HIM KIND OF BE ON CALL ALL THE TIME AND HAVE TO GO IN AT ANY TIME AND .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW EVEN ON THE WEEKENDS AND UM AND THINGS SO THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO ME AND ALSO INSURANCE FOR THE FA OUR FAMILY .
SURE .
BECAUSE WE D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF OUR MEDICAL NEEDS AND NOT BE THINKING SO MUCH ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN AFFORD IT .
YEAH I DO NT EVER WANT TO HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT THAT S REAL IMPORTANT TO ME UM YOU KNOW WE HAVE THAT THAT AETNA .
UHHUH .
THAT S WHAT WE THE INSURANCE THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW .
UHHUH US TOO .
WHEN WE WERE IN COLORADO THEY HAD UM A DIFFERENT TYPE OF H M O THERE THAT I REALLY LIKED A LOT .
UHHUH .
IT WAS UM NOT THAT KIND OF H M O S WHERE YOU HAVE TO GO TO THEIR THEIR SORT OF LIKE CLINICS YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
BUT THIS WAS JUST AN H M O WHERE YOU COULD GO TO PRIVATE PRACTICE DOCTORS AND TO THE REGULAR HOSPITALS AND ALL THAT BUT IT WAS WITH A CERTAIN LIST OF OF DOCTORS THAT YOU KNOW PARTICIPATED .
UHHUH .
IN THE H M O AND UM .
WELL THAT S NICE .
YOU KNOW THEN YOU ONLY HAD TO PAY THE FOR US IT WAS A FIVE DOLLAR COPAYMENT EVERY TIME YOU WENT TO THE DOCTOR AND UH THREE DOLLARS FOR THE PRESCRIPTIONS .
UHHUH THAT S GOOD .
AND UH I ESPECIALLY LIKED THE PRESCRIPTION ESPECIALLY SINCE MY CHILDREN TEND TO HAVE EAR INFECTIONS ALL THE TIME .
UHHUH .
THAT THOSE PRESCRIPTIONS CAN BE VERY EXPENSIVE .
OH I KNOW WE JUST WENT THROUGH THAT OURSELVES WE JUST YOU KNOW ARE LIKE FIFTY DOLLARS FOR THIS SERIES OF ANTIBIOTICS AND THINGS .
OH I KNOW ESPECIALLY IF YOU GET WHAT IS IT SECLOR I THINK THAT .
UHHUH .
THAT JUST ABOUT BREAKS THE BANK RIGHT THERE .
YES YES IT S PRETTY BAD WELL YEAH AND WE UM WE WERE INTERESTED IN HAVING DENTAL INSURANCE TOO BECAUSE UM HAVING BEEN IN SCHOOL WE KIND OF PUT THINGS OFF .
UHHUH .
AND ONLY WENT IN WHEN WE KNEW THERE WAS A PROBLEM SOMEWHERE AND STUFF AND .
DO .
WE WANTED TO BE ABLE TO GO IN AND HAVE OUR TEETH CLEANED AND JUST CHECKED ALL OVER AND .
DO YOU HAVE THE BASIC PLAN OR DO YOU HAVE THE THE OTHER ONE .
WE HAVE UM YOU KNOW WE RE AT AETNA WITH AN UH EX WE HAVE LIKE THE MEDI THE DENTAL INSURANCE IS SEPARATE IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN .
RIGHT .
I DO NT THINK IT S THE BASIC I THINK IT S THE OTHER ONE .
THE ONE THAT S LIKE YOU GET ADDITIONAL THEY LL PAY A LITTLE BIT MORE .
UHHUH .
I THINK FOR THE DIFFERENT PROCEDURES .
UHHUH .
WE JUST HAVE THE BASIC RIGHT NOW AND FOR MOST THINGS IT TENDS TO COVER IT WE DO NT TOO MANY MAJOR UM EXPENSES AT THIS POINT BUT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND DO DENTISTS THAT WILL ACCEPT PRETTY MUCH WHATEVER THE BASIC PLAN PAYS A COUPLE OF TIMES WE VE HAD TO PAY OH I DO NT KNOW THREE TO FIVE DOLLARS BUT .
UHHUH .
THAT S NOT THAT BAD .
NO THAT S GREAT YEAH WE NEED TO GO SHOPPING FOR DENTISTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT TOO YES AND LET S SEE BESIDES INSURANCE OTHER THINGS THAT WE LOOKED AT UM WELL MY HUSBAND DOES NOT LIKE TO COMMUTE .
UHHUH .
VERY FAR AND AND WE DO NT LIKE HIM TO BE YOU KNOW HAVING TO DRIVE AN HOUR TO WORK OR SOMETHING .
NO WE DO NT LIKE THAT EITHER .
SO WE KIND OF LOOKED FOR WHERE WHERE THE UH HIS OFFICE WOULD BE LOCATED AND .
IS HIS OFFICE IN PLANO .
WELL HE S AT YOU KNOW HE S AT THE ONE THAT S AT UM SEVENTYFIVE AT UH SIX THIRTYFIVE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND SO WE BY LIVING IN PLANO WE RE JUST ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES AWAY .
OH THAT S NOT BAD .
UM ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY FINISH ALL THE CONSTRUCTION OUT HERE .
RIGHT .
AND WE DID NT WANT HIM TO LET YOU KNOW TO LIKE WE HAD SOME JOB OFFERS IN THE NEW YORK AREA AND WE THOUGHT WELL YOU KNOW HE WOULD BE REALLY COMMUTING .
OH YES YOU RE NOT KIDDING .
AND NOT ONLY IS IT YOU KNOW TROUBLE TO HAVE TO DRIVE BUT IT TAKES TIME AWAY FROM YOUR HOME AND YOUR FAMILY WHEN YOU RE OUT DRIVING .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND UM SO THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO US AND BECAUSE LIKE I SAY WE KIND OF FELT DEPRIVED THAT HE HAD BEEN IN SCHOOL AND BEEN AWAY FROM US FOR SO LONG .
THAT WE WERE ANXIOUS TO DO EVERYTHING WE COULD TO HAVE YOU KNOW MADE US BE MORE TOGETHER AND AND WHAT OTHER CAN YOU THINK OF ANOTHER THING THAT YOU GUYS LOOKED AT AND .
WELL THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO US TOO .
UHHUH .
UM WE WE D LIKE YOU KNOW OTHER BENEFITS THAT ARE PROVIDED UM THE ATHLETIC FACILITIES THAT YOU SOME SOMETIMES TAKE ADVANTAGE OF .
UHHUH .
I THINK THAT S THAT S PRETTY NICE BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT SINCE WE VE COME HERE WE HAVE NT DONE IT TOO MUCH THOUGH WE HAVE NT ENROLLED IN TOO MANY OF THE CLASSES OR OR ANY OF THAT BUT THAT S THAT S A NICE BENEFIT TO HAVE .
UHHUH THAT S TRUE .
THAT S REALLY IMPORTANT UM ALSO WHAT UM OPPORTUNITIES THERE WOULD BE FOR ADVANCEMENT I THINK WE LOOKED AT BESIDES JUST YOU KNOW WHAT SALARY YOU WOULD BE HAVING NOW BUT WHEN WHEN COULD UH YOUR SALARY INCREASE .
RIGHT .
UM IS THERE WAS THERE SOMEWHERE TO GO .
YEAH THAT S THAT S ONE OF I THINK THE HARD THINGS RIGHT NOW I MEAN THEY RE GOING THROUGH SOME TOUGH TIMES .
UHHUH .
TO SAY THE LEAST I KNOW MANY OF US ARE THANKFUL THAT HE STILL HAS A JOB .
YES THAT WE CAN MAKE OUR MORTGAGE PAYMENTS AND YEAH THAT S REALLY TRUE .
UH ONE OF THE DRAWBACKS I THINK OF WORKING FOR A BIG COMPANY IS OFTEN TIMES YOU DO HAVE TO FOLLOW PRETTY RIGID UM GUIDELINES UM IF IF AN EMPLOYEE IS ESPECIALLY EXEMPLARY I THINK IT S OFTEN IN A SMALLER COMPANY IT S A LITTLE BIT EASIER FOR THEM TO SAY HEY YOU KNOW THIS PERSON DID A WONDERFUL JOB GIVE HIM A BIG BONUS KIND OF THING A LOT OF TIMES .
UHHUH .
SMALLER COMPANIES HAVE BONUS PLANS WHERE I THINK IN A LARGE COMPANY IT S HARD TO DO THAT BECAUSE THERE RE JUST SO MANY PEOPLE TO DEAL WITH .
UHHUH .
AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE GUIDELINES YOU KNOW FOR SALARY INCREASES AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEONE WHEN YOU RE DEALING WITH A LARGE COMPANY .
UHHUH .
BUT .
BUT WE ALSO WERE INTERESTED IN UM YOU KNOW BEING SURE THAT HE FELT LIKE HE LIKED THE PEOPLE THAT HE WOULD BE WORKING WITH .
UHHUH .
AND THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME OPPORTUNITY FOR FRIENDSHIPS THAT WAY SO THAT YOU WOULD FEEL HAPPY GOING TO WORK EVERY DAY AND .
RIGHT .
RATHER THAN THINKING OH I REALLY I CA NT STAND THESE PEOPLE BUT SO THAT S SOMETHING THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO HIM IN THINKING HE COULD WORK UNDER .
HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN IN HIS PRESENT POSITION .
OH JUST SINCE LAST SUMMER .
UHHUH .
IT S ONLY BEEN NOT EVEN A YEAR YET SO .
WELL I WAS GOING TO SAY IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU YOU PICKED OUT A LOT OF GOOD THINGS YOU KNOW FOR HIM TO TO UH TO CHOOSE IN A POSITION AND HAVE A LOT OF THOUGHT PUT INTO IT IN A BIG COMPANY THOUGH YOU ALSO GET MOVED AROUND A LOT .
YES WELL .
HE MAY BE HAVING TO DRIVE OVER HERE TO LEWISVILLE SOME TIME .
OH YEAH .
OR WE MAY BE HAVING TO DRIVE TO PLANO YOU NEVER KNOW .
YOU NEVER KNOW WE RE HOPING THAT THAT WO NT BE THE CASE .
WE I THINK ONE OF THE MOST DECIDING FACTORS OF WHY WE CHOSE UM THIS AREA IS THAT UM MY HUSBAND WAS RAISED IN IRVING .
UHHUH .
AND SO HE WE HAVE A LOT OF FAMILY HERE HIS SIDE OF THE FAMILY AND BEING WHEN WE WERE DOWN IN HOUSTON WE WERE ISOLATED I MEAN IT S NOT THAT FAR BUT PEOPLE WOULD HA WE DID NT HAVE ANYONE IN TOWN THAT WAS OUR FAMILY .
RIGHT .
AND ALTHOUGH WE HAD REALLY GOOD FRIENDS AND WE HAD CHURCH AND SCHOOL SUPPORT AND THINGS UM WE WERE ANXIOUS TO MOVE CLOSE TO FAMILY MEMBERS JUST BECAUSE WE WANTED OUR CHILDREN TO KNOW THEIR GRANDPARENTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
YEAH WE RE VERY .
SO THAT REALLY MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE I THINK IN WHY WE CHOSE T I AND CHOSE TO MOVE THIS WAY .
WE RE VERY FAR FROM OUR FAMILIES AND IT S REALLY HARD I HAVE LITTLE CHILDREN AND UM THEY WERE THE ONLY GRANDCHILDREN AND SO OUR OUR FAMILIES ARE ARE REALLY FAR AWAY IN FACT THIS IS A LITTLE OFF THE TOPIC BUT YESTERDAY MY MOTHER HAPPENED TO BE ON A TRAIN GOING FROM PHOENIX TO BACK TO CHICAGO .
UHHUH .
AND IT STOPPED IN DALLAS FOR HALF AN HOUR SO I LOADED THE KIDS IN THE CAR .
AND WE WENT DOWNTOWN AND MET HER TRAIN FOR HALF AN HOUR AND BROUGHT HER A LITTLE SNACK AND AN EASTER BASKET AND .
OH THAT S NICE .
I THINK IT IT MADE HER TRIP A LITTLE BIT NICER .
YEAH AND IT IS I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO YOU KNOW WANT TO BE CLOSE TO YOUR FAMILY AND .
YEAH AND IT S IT S HARD I MEAN JUST FOR US TO SNATCH A HALF HOUR LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
IS A SPECIAL OCCASION FOR US SO UM .
YEAH THAT S THE SAME .
IT S NICE .
WAY WE FELT .
IT S NICE THAT YOU CAN HAVE YOUR FAMILY CLOSE LIKE THAT .
WE RE REALLY ENJOYING IT I WONDER WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE I MEAN I WANTED TO BE CLOSE TO FAMILY BUT I ALSO THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HARDER TO BE CLOSE TO FAMILY .
YEAH SOMETIMES IT CAN BE .
BUT IT S TURNED OUT REALLY GOOD AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW WE RE REALLY SATISFIED WITH THAT CHOICE AND WE YOU KNOW KIND OF FELT LIKE UM IT WAS WORTH IT .
THAT S GOOD .
TO US BUT ANYWAY WELL I MY CHILDREN JUST RAN OUT THE DOOR SO I NEED TO GO CHECK ON THEM .
OKAY .
WELL I VE REALLY ENJOYED THE CONVERSATION .
WELL I HAVE TOO .
AND UH NICE TO HAVE MET YOU AND YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY .
OKAY YOU TOO .
BYEBYE .
BYEBYE .
OKAY DO YOU HAVE YOU NOTICED ANY NEW UH TRENDS IN POLITICS .
WELL THE ONE I THINK IS INTERESTING IS THE CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES POLICE CHIEF WHO SAYS HE WO NT RESIGN AND DID YOU HEAR YESTERDAY THAT MAYOR BRADLEY SAID THAT UH HE SHOULD .
OH REALLY NO I DID NT HEAR THAT .
I THINK IT S I THINK WHAT S INTERESTING IS THAT UH THE POLITICAL ACTIVISTS JESSE JACKSON AND A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE WENT OUT THERE AND ARE DEMONSTRATING I FIND IT INTERESTING THAT UH OUTSIDERS WOULD BOTHER TO GO IN HOW DO HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE JESSE JACKSON GETTING INVOLVED .
UH I THINK SOMETIMES IT S GOOD FOR PEOPLE OUTSIDE THEY GET A DIFFERENT PERSP UH PERSPECTIVE ON AN ISSUE AND STUFF SO YEAH I DO NT SEE ANY PROBLEM WITH OUTSIDERS GOING IN AND GETTING A LITTLE BIT INVOLVED .
WELL DO YOU .
I THINK THOUGH THAT IT SHOULD STILL BE UH SORT OF UP TO THE MAJORITY IN THE AREA I DO NT KNOW ON SOMETHING LIKE THAT THEY WOULD NT REALLY VOTE ON IT OR ANYTHING THOUGH .
BUT DO YOU THINK GATES SHOULD RESIGN .
UH PROBABLY SO JUST BECAUSE THEY WERE UNDER HIS AUTHORITY AND HE OBVIOUSLY FAILED SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE .
WELL WELL SPEAKING OF THAT KIND OF ISSUE HAVE YOU KEPT UP WITH JOHN WILEY PRICE .
YEAH .
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIM .
OH UM I THINK HE S GOT GOOD INTENTIONS BUT I M NOT SURE IF THE WAY HE GOES ABOUT WHAT HE DOES IS REALLY RIGHT .
HE S AN INTERESTING PERSON I WAS TALKING TO SOMEONE WHO SAID THAT UH FOR ALL HIS OBVIOUS ATTENTION TO EFFORTS TO GET MEDIA ATTENTION THAT HE ACTUALLY IS A WORKER ON THE UH I GUESS HE S ON THE COUNTY UH OH BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OR .
RIGHT .
MUMBLEX AND THE THE THE UH AT THOSE MEETINGS HE REALLY COMES QUITE WELL PREPARED AND IS WELL INFORMED AND IS A HARD WORKER .
UHHUH .
AND IS REALLY QUITE AGREEABLE UH AND THAT THIS STUFF WE SEE IN THE YOU KNOW IN THE MEDIA IS UH WELL HE S REALLY JUST TRYING TO MAKE A POLITICAL STATEMENT I I FIND THAT AN INTERESTING ELEMENT OF POLITICS THAT WE DO NT THAT THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD NOT KNOW THAT JOHN WILEY PRICE APPARENTLY IS A IS A YOU KNOW OF COURSE HE S GOT IN THIS THIS DEAL OF RACISM AND THE YOU KNOW NAME CALLING AND ALL THIS BUT APPARENTLY HE S A A WORKER UH YOU MAY DISAGREE WITH HIM BUT I I I FIND THIS WHOLE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS UH FOURTEEN ONE AND TEN FOUR ONE IN DALLAS .
OH I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD GO AHEAD AND GO TO THE UH FOURTEEN ONE I TO ME IT S JUST FAIR YOU KNOW AN EQUAL IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY AREA SHOULD HAVE AN EQUAL VOICE .
I AGREE WITH YOU BUT DID YOU SEE THE MAP THEY DREW UP ON UH ON HOW THEY WERE GOING TO DIVIDE UP THE DISTRICTS .
NO .
IT WAS IT WAS THE STRANGEST I M I M NOT SURE IT WAS GERRYMANDERED BUT THE WAY THEY DREW THESE LITTLE PATTERNS AND STUFF I I I GUESS I M A LITTLE CYNICAL OF THE OF THE POWER BASE I I I AND I DO NT QUITE UNDERSTAND WHY THE POWER BASE UH DOES NT UH WHY THEY DO NT GO WITH FOURTEEN ONE I YOU KNOW AND YOU KNOW THE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE IN THE ELECTION THAT A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THEY SAID PARTICULARLY THE THE UH I THINK IT S HISPANICS DO NT VOTE BECAUSE THEY DO NT THINK THAT THEY HAVE ANY AFFECT AND IT S .
YEAH .
I I GUESS I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH DALLAS IN THAT UH THE FOURTEEN ONE IT I DO NT KNOW YOU CAN YOU CAN DISAGREE WITH AL LIPSCOMB AND UH WHAT S WHAT S THE LADY S NAME .
DIANE RAGSDALE .
YEAH YOU CAN DISAGREE WITH UH WHAT THEY RE DOING AND WHAT THEY RE SAYING BUT IN REALITY I THINK THEY RE THEY RE TRYING TO REPRESENT THEIR CONSTITUENTS .
YEAH .
A AND I THINK DALLAS IS DOING ITSELF A DISSERVICE I THINK THEY OUGHT TO GET ON WITH SOMETHING IMPORTANT .
YEAH THEY REALLY MAKE THEMSELVES LOOK BAD AND I DO NT KNOW WHY CERTAIN GROUPS ARE FIGHTING SO HARD TO KEEP THE TEN FOUR ONE .
YEAH AND I BUT I THINK EVEN I EVEN THOSE PEOPLE ARE IT S LIKE PAUKEN AND BOX AND THESE PEOPLE I THINK IT S IT S KIND OF INTERESTING THAT EVERYBODY S SO BUSY POLITICKING THAT THE QUESTION IS ARE WE GETTING ANYTHING GOOD DONE IT S LIKE THIS WHOLE SCHOOL ISSUE ARE YOU INVOLVED IN THE SCHOOLS AT ALL .
NO HUHUH .
PUBLIC SCHOOLS THIS WHOLE THING DOWN THERE WHERE THEY RE THEY RE TRYING TO UM UH YOU KNOW DEVOTE ALL OUR MONEY AND RAISE OUR TAXES AND BETTER SCHOOLS AND AND IT ALL SEEMS YOU KNOW LIKE EVERYBODY S TRYING TO ONEUPMANSHIP ON EVERYBODY ELSE SO .
YEAH YEAH I .
I I HAVE GOT TO RUN TO A MEETING .
OKAY .
IT WAS GOOD TALKING TO YOU I DO NT THINK WE VE GONE OUR OUR TEN MINUTES BUT I THINK WE VE WE VE TALKED LONG ENOUGH .
OKAY GOOD TALKING TO YOU .
OKAY GOOD NIGHT .
BYE .
WELL HOW HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE IMMIGRATION LAWS .
AT CURRENTLY I THINK THEY ARE A LITTLE RESTRICTIVE .
UH PARTICULARLY FOR UH CERTAIN ETHNIC GROUPS OR FROM CERTAIN COUNTRIES .
UM I THINK WE SHOULD PERMIT UH MORE IMMIGRATION FROM EASTERN EUROPE FOR EXAMPLE UH PARTICULARLY THE UH THE JEWISH UH UH PEOPLE FROM RUSSIA .
I THINK WE COULD PERMIT MORE OF THEM IN THAN WE HAVE PERMITTED IN THE LAST UH SEVERAL YEARS .
AND I THINK WE HAVE UH UH TOO MUCH RESTRICTION ON THE UH ON THE ORIENTALS ALSO BUT OF COURSE THAT S JUST MY OPINION .
YEAH WELL I M NOT REAL SURE WHY I GOT THIS TOPIC BECAUSE I DO NT THINK I CHECKED IT OFF ON THE LIST .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE I KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE CURRENT IMMIGRATION LAWS .
UHHUH .
WELL WE SEEM TO UH TO FAVOR CERTAIN UH UH COUNTRIES PARTICULARLY SOUTH AMERICAN COUNTRIES .
AND UH THERE IS NO UH UH I HAVE NOTHING OF COURSE AGAINST UH THE UH THE SOUTH AMERICANS OR UH OR HISPANICS IN THAT SENSE BUT I THINK WE UH ARE MORE RESTRICTIVE OF THE UH SO CALLED EASTERN UH EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THAN WE UH WE SHOULD BE .
OF COURSE THAT S FROM MY OWN BIAS SINCE MY ANCESTORS FROM EASTERN EUROPE SO .
OH .
AND UH SO I THINK UH YOU KNOW THE UH EMBARGO WE PLACED ON THE UH ON THE RUSSIAN JEWS ALTHOUGH WE MUMBLEX OF UH SPENT YEARS AND YEARS UH LOBBYING FOR THEIR RELEASE AND THEIR ABILITY TO UM IMMIGRATE FROM RUSSIA .
UHHUH .
AS SOON AS THAT OCCURRED WE SIMPLY SAID THAT UH INSTEAD OF THE UH HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND OR SO WHO WANTED TO IMMIGRATE TO THIS COUNTRY WE CUT THAT BY UH TWO THIRDS .
SO .
HUH .
I DO NOT QUITE GO ALONG WITH THAT BUT .
NO THAT DOES NT MAKE A WHOLE OF LOT SENSE .
NO .
AND I STILL THINK YOU KNOW AGAIN KIND OF HAVING UH UH WITHIN THIS CENTURY COME FROM A UH AN IMMIGRANT FAMILY OR IMMIGRANT FAMILIES ON BOTH .
SIDES .
UHHUH .
BOTH MY MOTHER S PARENTS AND MY FATHER S PARENTS WERE IMMIGRANTS SO I M A LITTLE TOUCHY EVERY NOW AND THEN ABOUT THAT .
YEAH .
WELL UH MY UH MY FAMILY IS FROM UH EUROPE FROM WELL FROM ENGLAND AND IRELAND .
UHHUH .
AND UH HAVE BEEN IN THIS COUNTRY FOR OH MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS .
OH MY .
ALMOST TWO HUNDRED YEARS SO I DO NT HAVE ANY ANY UH RELATIVES THAT I AM OR OR UH SEVERAL GENERATIONS BACK THAT I AM FAMILIAR WITH THEIR NAMES AND HOW THEY FIT INTO THE FAMILY .
THEY WERE ALL THEY WERE ALL BORN HERE .
UHHUH .
SO I DO NT HAVE ANY REAL STRONG TIES WITH ANY WITH WITH THE IMMIGRATION LAWS .
I DO NT BECAUSE I DO NT I DO NT HAVE ANY PERSONAL FEELINGS ABOUT THEM AND I HAVE NT TAKEN THE TIME OR EFFORT TO LEARN WHAT .
THEY ARE .
WELL I THINK IN A WAY THOUGH UH UH I ALSO HAVE UH AN OPPOSITE POINT OF VIEW WHICH IS UH ALTHOUGH I BELIEVE WE SHOULD UH PERMIT UH YOU KNOW CONSTANT IMMIGRATION INTO THIS COUNTRY .
UM .
UH I THINK WE SHOULD UH PRIMARILY FOR ECONOMIC REASONS I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE UM SOME QUOTAS OF COURSE MY FAMILY AND I AGAIN AGAIN THAT WAS YOU KNOW MY GRANDPARENTS CAME OVER DURING THE TIME WHEN UH THERE WERE QUOTAS .
SO THEY HAD TO WAIT UH YOU KNOW IN UH CERTAIN PARTS OF EUROPE FOR YEARS BEFORE THEY WERE PERMITTED TO COME OVER .
UHHUH .
SO YOU KNOW BUT UH .
YEAH .
I I .
I THINK UNRESTRICTED IMMIGRATION I THINK IS NOT UH IS NOT BEST UH .
WELL I AGREE WITH THAT I I THINK IF IMMIGRATION WAS ENTIRELY UNRESTRICTED UH NOT ONLY WOULD WOULD THE UNITED STATES BECOME OVER POPULATED WELL MORE OVER POPULATED AWFULLY QUICKLY I THINK IT IT WOULD BRING IN A LOT OF UH PEOPLE .
THAT ARE RUN OUT OF OTHER COUNTRIES OR IN TROUBLE IN IN OTHER COUNTRIES .
I THINK THEY D COME HERE TRYING TO FIND A NEW MARKET FOR THEIR THEIR BRAND OF CRIME .
UHHUH .
WELL YOU KNOW THERE S ANOTHER ASPECT OF THIS TOO .
THEY RE ALSO UH UH DIMINISHING THE UH HEALTH RESTRICTIONS .
WHICH .
I WAS NOT AWARE AWARE OF THAT .
WELL YES .
THERE ARE WERE SOME UH REGULATIONS OVER I DO NT KNOW WHETHER THEY RE LAWS PASSED OR OR WHATEVER .
THEY RE CALLED UH JUST RECENTLY WHERE UH PEOPLE WITH CERTAIN DISEASES CAN NOT BE EXCLUDED UH FROM UH IMMIGRATION .
AGE IS ONE FOR EXAMPLE AND UH RECENTLY UH TUBERCULOSIS WHICH AT ONE TIME IF YOU HAD TUBERCULOSIS .
YOU COULD NOT GET INTO THIS COUNTRY .
UHHUH .
UH THEY DROPPED THAT ALSO .
SO I THINK IN IN SOME AS SOME WAYS WE ARE UH BECOMING A LITTLE TOO EGALITARIAN IN THAT IN THAT SENSE BUT UH I THINK WE SHOULD BE A LITTLE MORE CIRCUMSPECT ABOUT IT .
AGAIN MY OPINION .
YEAH .
THINK WE VE TALKED LONG ENOUGH .
I THINK SO .
ALL RIGHT .
WELL I VE ENJOYED TALKING TO YOU .
I I I HAVE TALKED LONG ENOUGH .
OKAY .
THANKS .
THANK YOU .
BYE .
GOODBYE .

BUT I D USED TO GO ON I WORKED FOR A MORTGAGE COMPANY IN WISCONSIN AND I DID A LOT OF BUSINESS IN UH UM COLO WELL DENVER AND THAT S THAT S PROBABLY ONE OF THE STRANGER THINGS WHEN YOU SEE THE AIR INVERSIONS .
UHHUH .

OH SURE MY PARENTS JUST LIVE UH THIRTY MILES SOUTH OF DENVER AND IT CAN BE SUNNY AND AND NO PROBLEM IN DENVER AND THEY LL BE HAVING SNOW .

UH IT S GETTING TO BE MORE AND MORE OF A POSSIBILITY .
YEAH .
IT USED TO BE NO PROBLEM JUST BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A A RUGGED TERRAIN AND WITH TREES EVERYWHERE BUT NOW .

EVEN I MEAN I M ORIGINALLY FROM PITTSBURGH PENNSYLVANIA AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT UM THEY VE EVEN HAD IN EASTERN OHIO AND WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA THEY VE EVEN HAD I M GOING TO SAY MINI TORNADOES FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD .
UHHUH .

RIGHT .
UM SO I DO NT KNOW WHAT S HAPPENING IF IT S YOU KNOW WE ARE THE GREENHOUSE I DO NT REALLY KNOW .
YEAH ME NEITHER .
IT S JUST YOU KNOW .

IT S DEFINITELY NOT AS UM I KNOW I ASSOCIATE THE POLLUTION WITH WEATHER IN GENERAL SO I GUESS ONE THING WE DO MISS IS THAT S A SMALLER TOWN AND IT W IT WAS IT JUST SEEMED A LITTLE BIT MORE PLEASANT IN TERMS OF THE ATMOSPHERE YOU KNOW .

RIGHT .
YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
WHAT DO YOU THINK .
WELL I THINK IT IS UH BASICALLY THE SAME WAY IT IS CERTAINLY HAS AFFECTED UH U S POLICY THOUGH THERE IS .
UHHUH .
THERE IS NO QUESTION IT HAD AN OVERWHELMING EFFECT OF HOW WE APPROACHED THE THE THING IN UH IRAQ .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE UH THE WHOLE THING THAT WAS BAD ABOUT VIETNAM IT WAS NO DIFFERENT FROM IRAQ I MEAN IT WAS UH ONE COUNTRY PICKING ON A SMALLER WEAKER ONE .
RIGHT THE DEVASTATION YEAH .
YEAH THE ONLY DIFFERENCE WAS THAT THE GOVERNMENT SAID OKAY IF WE WERE GOING TO SUPPORT THIS SMALLER COUNTRY THEN WE ARE GOING TO SUPPORT IT A HUNDRED PERCENT AND WE ARE GOING TO CONSIDER OURSELVES AGAINST IN WAR .
UHHUH .
AGAINST THESE PEOPLE AS WELL .
YEAH AND IN FULL .
WHICH UH .
FACTION YEAH .
RIGHT WHICH REALLY WAS NOT THE ATTITUDE WITH VIETNAM IT WAS SORT OF OF A PRESIDENT S WAR .
YEAH .
RATHER THAN A .
IT JUST KIND OF .
COUNTRY S WAR .
DRAGGED ON UH I DO NOT KNOW HOW YOU WERE HISTORICALLY BUT I WAS A LITTLE BIT OLDER BEFORE I REALIZED JUST HOW LONG IT HAD BEEN GOING ON SINCE .
RIGHT .
L B J AND .

IT REALLY WELL YEAH IN FACT BECAUSE IN TERMS OF WHEN YOUR THERE IS AT LEAST TEN YEARS BETWEEN US SO IN TERMS OF WHEN YOU WERE IN SCHOOL I AM SURE THAT IT WAS YOU KNOW THE MAJORITY OF YOUR HIGH SCHOOL AND JUNIOR HIGH YEARS .
UHHUH .
UH ONE OF THE THINGS I DID NOT LIKE WAS THE WEAPONS THE WEAPONS I CA NT EVEN SAY IT THE WEAPONRY TH SYSTEMS THAT THEY USED .
YEAH .
UH IT JUST DID NOT SEEM THAT UH I DO NOT KNOW TECHNICALLY WE KNEW WHAT WE WERE DOING EITHER .
RIGHT .
AND THEN YOU HEARD ABOUT THE THINGS LIKE AGENT ORANGE ET CETERA AND YOU WOULD THINK YOU KNOW JUST UH HOW COULD THE GOVERNMENT OR THE PENTAGON UH WHO OR WHOMEVER IS IN CHARGE THERE BEEN SO CARELESS .
YEAH RIGHT .
UH .
OF COURSE NOW I W UH NOW EVERYONE S MORE UH YOU KNOW ENVIRONMENTALLY .
CONSCIOUS YEAH .
UH INTELLIGENT THAN THEY WERE BACK THEN I MEAN BACK THEN IT WAS NOT COMMONLY KNOWN THAT SACCHARIN WAS BAD FOR YOU AND ALL THESE OTHER THINGS .
NUTRISWEET .
THAT PEOPLE .
YEAH AND ALL THESE OTHER THINGS THAT IS TRUE UH .
THAT PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THEMSELVES NOW .
UH MONETARILY TOO I JUST DO NOT THINK WE HAVE DONE ENOUGH FOR THE UH VIETNAMESE PEOPLE AS A WHOLE UH IN SOUTH VIETNAM IN GENERAL IN HELPING THEM RESTORE THEMSELVES .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND I DO NT KNOW IF IT IS BECAUSE THERE ARE NOT ANY OIL FIELDS THERE .
YEAH I DO NOT KNOW IF THEY UH I DO NOT KNOW IF THEY HAVE THAT RESOURCE OR NOT .
YEAH I MEAN I DO NOT THINK THEY DO BUT I JUST THINK IT IS KIND OF A SHAME THAT UH YOU STILL HEAR THINGS ABOUT THE CHILDREN THAT ARE ORPHANS THERE AND .
YEAH .
UH SO ON A WHOLE I DO NOT KNOW WAR IS NOT GOOD AND THAT ONE I PROBABLY UH MY MAIN OPINION WOULD BE W W WE SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE IT .
RIGHT .
WELL .
YEAH .
THAT IS WHAT I KNOW ABOUT THE VIETNAM WAR .
UNLESS YOU .
YEAH WELL YOU KNOW A LITTLE UH A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN I DO EXPLAIN IT I DID NOT UH GET TO LIVE THROUGH IT THAT THE PEOPLE THAT I KNOW THAT IT DID .
UHHUH .
UH FELT VERY STRONGLY MOST OF I WORK FOR A GOVERNMENT CONTRACTOR .
UHHUH .
SO MOST OF THE GUYS I WORK WITH ARE UH OH AT LEAST SOME OF THE GUYS I WORK WITH RATHER ARE VETERANS .
UHHUH OH VIETNAM .
AND UH FROM VIETNAM .
JEEZ YEAH .
AND I HAVE NOT TALKED TO ANY OF THEM THAT THAT WERE NOT YOU KNOW GLAD THAT THEY WENT OR OR RATHER THOUGHT THAT THE REASON THEY WENT WAS A GOOD ONE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW .
AND THAT THAT .
MOST OF THEM ARE VER VERY STRONGLY THAT THAT THE REASON FOR AMERICA TO BE THERE WAS A GOOD ONE .
UHHUH .
THEY JUST FELT THAT THE WAY AMERICA BACKED THEM UP WAS NOT WAS NOT AT ALL RIGHT .
IN TERMS OF THE PERSONAL .
YEAH IN TERM OF UH .
YEAH THE BITTERNESS IS MORE ON A PERSONAL .
YEAH .
LEVEL THAN ON A .
PERSONAL LEVEL AND AND THE FINANCES HOW THEY STARTED YOU KNOW LIKE AIR ATTACKS AND STUFF LIKE THAT DROPPED OFF LIKE CRAZY .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE THE CONGRESS WOULD NOT APPROVE YOU KNOW .
THE MONEY IS .
SO .
AFTER YEAH .
YEAH .
I MEAN I THINK IT STARTED ACTUALLY LIKE LIKE IN THE LATE FIFTIES I MEAN LIKE IN FIFTYEIGHT FIFTYNINE .
HUH I I .
SO IT REALLY I MEAN BECAUSE I KNOW IN NINETEEN SIXTYTHREE I MEAN I WAS NINE YEARS OLD .
WHEN KENNEDY WAS SHOT .
UHHUH .
SO I MEAN I REMEMBER UH RIGHT AROUND THEN THAT S WHEN I FIRST STARTED HEARING ABOUT VIETNAM BUT THEN AS I GOT OLDER AND STUDIED IN SCHOOL I REALIZED IT WAS EVEN GOING ON BEFORE THAT .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW AND YOU THINK TO YOURSELF OH MY GOODNESS EISENHOWER .

UHHUH .
UM I THIS WAS MY TWENTIETH HIGH SCHOOL REUNION IN CHICAGO .
UHHUH .
AND BASICALLY UM THE CHOICES I MEAN YOU KNOW YOU PROBABLY HEARD THAT IN THE FIFTIES WOMEN LIKED TO STAY HOME AND ALL THAT .
RIGHT UHHUH .
THAT S KIND OF UM THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT IT WAS IN THE SIXTIES AND EARLY SEVENTIES .
RIGHT .
IT WAS SORT OF JUST TO UM GO PROTEST .
UHHUH .
AND UH JUST EVERYBODY BE DAMNED AND LIVE WITH SOME ONE AND YOU KNOW .
UHHUH I KNOW THAT TH .
SOCI SOCIAL MORALS WERE A LITTLE BIT LACKING .
UHHUH I KNOW THAT UH IN IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES UH I THINK WOMEN WERE THE FIRST PEOPLE TO TO MAKE A MOVE AS FAR AS INDIVIDUALS .
UHHUH .
UM UH BEFORE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WANTED TO PROTEST WERE LARGE GROUPS LIKE UH BLACK PEOPLE OR YOU KNOW JUST LARGE LARGE GROUPS OF PEOPLE BUT BUT THE .
RIGHT IT WAS MORE IT WAS MORE CIVIL RIGHTS ORIENTED .
RIGHT .
OR RACE ORIENTED RATHER THAN GENDER BASED YEAH .
AND I THINK I THINK THE WOMEN S MOVEMENT KIND OF BROUGHT IN INDIVIDUAL LIVES WHERE YOU HAD WOMEN S MOVEMENTS AND YOU HAD GAY MOVEMENTS .
UHHUH .
AND JUST THE SMALLER GROUPS OF PEOPLE .
IT DID .
AND I THINK SINCE THEN IS IS WHEN A LOT OF THE WOMEN S ROLES HAVE STARTED TO CHANGE .
IT DID AND SOME OF THE OTHER STUFF THAT UM I THINK THAT CHANGED IT YOU UH WHEN I FIRST GOT OUT OF COLLEGE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO THEY WERE ALWAYS SAYING WELL IF YOU IF YOU WERE ASSERTIVE YOU WERE A LIBBER OR YOU WERE AGGRESSIVE NOT ASSERTIVE AND INDEPENDENT .
UHHUH .
AND IN TERMS OF THE CORPORATE COMMUNITY I VE SEEN A BIG CHANGE IN TERMS OF MEN FINALLY BEING QUOTE UNQUOTE USED TO WOMEN .
UHHUH .
WHO ARE IN UH CONTROLLING POSITIONS .
EXACTLY .
AS HIGHER YOU KNOW CORPORATE IN THE CORPORATE HIERARCHY .
UHHUH .
SO I THINK THAT S GOOD .
I THINK THAT UH YOU KNOW YOU CAN JUST LOOK AT HOME LIFE AND SEE I VE BEEN TALKING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE A ABOUT EDUCATION AND THINGS .
UHHUH .
AND AND WHAT WHAT WHAT AFFECTS THE SCHOOL SYSTEM AND I THINK THAT A BIG THING THAT EFFECTS IT IS THAT THE MOTHER IS NOT HOME ANYMORE .
RIGHT .
UM LIKE SHE USED TO BE SHE USED TO BE KIND OF A KIND OF A A ROCK YOU KNOW .
THE MAINSTAY YEAH .
IN THE HOUSE YEAH AND UH SINCE SINCE EVERYONE IS GOING OUT AND WORKING NOW WHETHER IT BE BECAUSE OF FINANCES OR JUST THE ECONOMY .
AND RESTRUCTURING STEPFAMILIES YEAH .
UH THE MOTHER S NOT THERE ANYMORE AND THE CHILDREN ARE I THINK I THINK A LOT OF SOCIETY IS SUFFERING NOT TO SAY THAT WOMEN SHOULD NT YOU KNOW GO OUT AND DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO BUT I THINK THAT UM .
RIGHT .
SOCIETY S REALLY GOING TO HAVE TO GET USED TO IT AND THEY RE NOT QUITE USED TO IT YET AND THAT S I .
THE SCHOOLS OR THE MO THE SCHOOLS OR THE PARENTS YEAH .
YES UHHUH .
UM I M TRYING TO THINK OF WHAT ELSE I HAVE A LOT OF OPINIONS ON THIS EXCEPT ALL OF A SUDDEN I WENT BLANK .
A LOT OF THE THINGS UM THE DEMOGRAPHICS DO I MEAN THERE ARE MORE I DO NT HAVE THE NUMBERS IN MY HEAD RIGHT NOW BUT A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT BROUGHT FEMINISM I MEAN THERE ARE JUST MORE WOMEN IN IN IN THE DEMOGRAPHICS JUST GENERALLY .
RIGHT UHHUH .
IN THE UNITED STATES IN TERMS OF BEING .
UHHUH .
I MEAN I M THE TYPICAL BABY BOOMER I HATE THAT TERM .
OH YEAH .
BUT IN TERMS OF WOMEN .
YEAH .
WOMEN GOING OUT I MEAN TWENTYTHREE I REMEMBER THAT .
WHAT S IT LIKE TO BE TWENTYTHREE AS A WOMAN TODAY I MEAN WHEN I WAS TWENTYTHREE THE ISSUES WERE EITHER GO TO GRADUATE SCHOOL OR GET MARRIED .
UHHUH .
UM THOSE WERE THE GENERAL ISSUES .
SPEAKING OF GETTING MARRIED I WAS TALKING TO SOMEONE YESTERDAY ON THIS ON THE PROJECT .
UHHUH .
AND UH UH WE WERE TALKING ABOUT CHILD CARE AND HE ASKED ME IF I HAD ANY KIDS HE WAS ABOUT FORTY OR FIFTY YEARS OLD AND I SAID NO I M JUST TWENTY .
HE WAS ANCIENT YEAH .
AND I SAID NO I M JUST TWENTYTHREE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW BECAUSE I DO NT THINK OF MYSELF AS NEEDING TO HAVE CHILDREN BUT H THE FIRST THING HE SAYS IS WELL DO NT YOU MISS THAT PART OF YOUR LIFE AND I JUST I MY MY MIND JUST WENT .
YOU DID NT KNOW WHAT YOU RE GOING TO BE MISSING .

UHHUH OKAY .
DID YOU GO TO BAYLOR BY ANY CHANCE .

OH OKAY THAT S EVEN BETTER .
AND I I JUST HAPPEN TO WORK AT A WACO STATION BECAUSE YOU KNOW .
I WENT TO OR YOU IN RADIO OR TELEVISION OR NEWS .
BROA BROADCAST NEWS T V .
UH MY JOURNALISM DEGREE IS IN .
OKAY SO WHAT ARE YOUR OPINIONS ON IT .
WELL LET ME PREFACE IT I M A I WAS A STAFF OFFICER IN VIETNAM IN SIXTYNINE AND SEVENTY .
UHHUH .
AND I M IN ACTIVE RESERVE NOW SO UH I M PROBABLY NOT GOING TO HAVE THE MUMBLEX YOU THINK I WOULD HAVE .
UHHUH .
UH IT S I WAS AN INTERESTING IN THAT I THINK THAT HE GAVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SOME UH UH A SENSE OF THE FACT THAT THAT UH WARS ARE REALLY RUN BY POLITICIANS .
UHHUH .
UH I ARE YOU OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER THE WAR .
N NOT MUCH I M TWENTYEIGHT SO NO I REALLY DO NT REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT IT I GUESS I WAS ABOUT TEN WHEN IT ENDED RIGHT .
YEAH .
I WAS BORN IN SIXTYTWO SO WHEN DID IT END .
WELL DECEMBER SEVENTYTWO WAS WHEN WE BOMBED NORTH VIETNAM AND THEN THEY RELEASED THE PRISONERS IN EARLY SEVENTYTHREE .
YEAH .
IN THAT IN THAT TIME FRAME .
BECAUSE I WAS TEN AND I DO NT REMEMBER A LOT ABOUT ANYTHING AT THAT TIME IN MY LIFE VERY MUCH IN .
I THINK .
GREAT DETAIL .
THE THE SIGNIFICANT THING IS IS TODAY DID DID YOU UH DID YOU SEE BARBARA WALTERS INTERVIEW WITH SCHWARTZKOPF .
NO I DID NT .
MUMBLEX .
BUT I I DID READ THE BOOK I HA DO HA I HAVE SIX YEARS OF COLLEGE SO I DID READ AND STUDY ABOUT THE VIETNAM WAR THOUGH SO I AM PRETTY FA YOU KNOW I M MORE .
WELL WHA WHAT S .
FAMILIAR WITH IT THAN .
YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON IT .
MINE I THINK UH I THINK THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF REBELLION IN OUR NATION AND THAT I THINK IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO TO TRY AND NOT TO TAKE AWAY TO YOU KNOW JUST LEAVE THEIR FREEDOMS THERE AND TO YOU KNOW GET RID OF SOME OF THE ATROCITIES THAT WERE GOING TO I DO NT I DO NT KNOW I DO NT REALLY I M TIRED OF PACIFIST THOUGH SEE ON THE OTHER HAND I M A PAC I M REALLY STRUGGLING WITH IT AM I A PACIFIST PHYSICAL PACIFIST I M A CHRISTIAN AND I BELIEVE THAT THE REAL WARFARE IS NOT WITH SADDAM HUSSEIN OR THE NORTH VIETNAMESE BUT IT S IN SPIRITUAL KINGDOMS AND THAT THE REAL WARFARE IS DONE YOU KNOW IN YOUR PRAYER CLOSET ON YOUR KNEES SO IN A WAY IN A SENSE I M A PACIFIST BUT I M REALLY NOT YOU KNOW WHAT I M SAYING .
YES .
I DO NT THINK JUST LAY BACK AND NOT DO ANYTHING I THINK LETS GO TO WAR BUT LET S GO TO WAR PRAYING AND LET S GO TO WAR FOR THAT WAY SO .
WELL WELL THE DIFFICULTY I HAVE IS THAT UH ARE WE OUR NEIGHBOR S KEEPERS .
UHHUH .
AND THIS IS WHAT I FIND PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT IN THAT UH IF WE SEE INJUSTICE AND WEATHER IT S IN A UH YOU KNOW CHICAGO OR UH .
UHHUH .
OR OR DALLAS I I THINK IF WE SEE IT YOU KNOW WE SEE JOHN WILEY PRICE HOLLERING INJUSTICE I THINK THAT S WRONG NOW THE QUESTION IS IS WAS THERE INJUSTICE IN VIETNAM OR WAS .
UHHUH .
THERE INJUST IN IRAQ KUWAIT .
UHHUH .
THE DIFFICULT I POINT IS IS TO WHERE DO WE STEP IN AND UH .
YEAH .
AND I THINK THAT WE THAT S THAT S THE PART I HAVE DIFFICULTY AND THE THE OTHER PART IS THAT THE THE WHEN WHEN YOUR WHEN YOUR WHEN YOUR LOOKING AT VIETNAM AND YOU SAY WELL IS FIFTYEIGHT THOUSAND LIVES WORTH IT AND .
UHHUH .
I DO NT KNOW THAT ANYTHING IS WORTH FIFTYEIGHT THOUSAND LIVES .
STILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH UH YOU KNOW I HAVE NT COME TO AN ABSOLUTE CONCLUSION ON MY OPINION ON THIS BUT AND I KNOW OTHER CHRISTIANS WOULD DISAGREE WITH ME MY HUSBAND AND I ARE KIND OF NOT EVEN IN AGREEMENT ON THIS BUT WE DO NT FIGHT OVER IT OR ANYTHING BUT YOU KNOW HOW CAN YOU KNOW THE BIBLE SAYS BLESS YOUR ENEMIES AND BLESS THOSE THAT CURSE YOU AND IT S LIKE BE GENTLE UNTO ALL MEN APT TO TEACH PATIENT KIND SO IT S LIKE HOW CAN YOU I DO NT KNOW FOR ME I DO NT KNOW YOU KNOW I CA NT SAY THAT I AGREE WITH VIETNAM BECAUSE HOW CAN YOU BE GENTLE UNTO ALL MEN AND AND THEN SHOOT THEM .
WELL THE .
SO .
OTHER ISSUE IS IS IS HOW DO YOU ALLOW UH HOW HOW DO YOU ALLOW INJUSTICE JUST LIKE THE THE POLICEMAN IN IN LOS ANGELES .
UHHUH .
HOW COULD HOW COULD COULD YOU STAND THERE AND WATCH THEM BEAT THAT GUY IF YOUR BROTHER OR YOUR SISTER WERE BEING BEATEN .
UHHUH .
BY THE AUTHORITIES DO WE STEP IN WELL IN SOME CASES WE WOULD AND I I THINK THAT S WHAT MAKES IT SO DIFFICULT .
YEAH IT IS A DIFFICULT THING BUT THEN VENGEANCE IS MINE SAYETH THE LORD AND I WILL PAY SO I THINK GOD IS ULTIMATELY IN CHARGE OF WHAT GOES ON AND I KNOW LIKE NOW MUMBLEX IN CHINA HE DID ALL THESE TERRIBLE THINGS AND THEY WERE TE TERRIBLE AND HE WAS GOING TO BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEM AND BUT IF YOU LOOK BACK AND YOU SAY WAIT A MINUTE WHILE HE WAS IN POWER HE BUILT ROADS HE PUT IN ALL THE TEMPLES HE HE UNIFIED THE CHINESE LANGUAGE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR MISSIONARIES TO DO ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING IN CHINA .
MUMBLEX .
BECAUSE OF ALL THAT AND SO EVEN IN NORTH AND SOUTH VIETNAM I BET YOU D SEE THE SAME THING AND THAT NOW HE BUILDS ROADS SO THEN IT MUMBLEX AND THEN HE DROPPED DEAD TWENTYFIVE YEARS PREMATURE HE DROPPED DEAD AND SO SOMETHING GOOD DID COME OUT OF THAT IN THAT NOW YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN IF LIKE NOW .
YEAH BUT BUT THE OTHER THE OTHER DIFFICULTY IS IS THAT IT S JUST IF IF YOU TAKE THE MUMBLEX TO TO FEED MY SHEEP .
UHHUH .
AND THE QUESTION IS WHO ARE MY SHEEP AND THE IDEA DO WE GO OUT AND FEED THESE PEOPLE WHEN THEY RE HUNGRY .
WELL BLESS YOUR ENEMIES IF YOUR ENEMY IS HUNGRY FEED HIM IF HE IF HE NEEDS YOUR ASKS FOR YOUR SHIRT GIVE HIM YOUR COAT ALSO SO IF THE .
MUMBLEX .
THE THE THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE THEY ASKED US TO HELP THEM RIGHT IS THAT RIGHT .
YES UH THEY DID BUT I THINK THE BIGGEST DIFFICULTY IS IS THAT WHEN YOUR AT AN MUMBLEX ECONOMY LIKE SOUTH VIETNAM WELL THE THEN REALITY UH THE THE POOR FARMER THE POOR RICE FARMER WAS GOING TO PAY TAXES .
UHHUH .
AND THE QUESTION IS WHO WAS HE GOING TO PAY IT TO .
YEAH .
UH THE COMMUNISTS ARE THE ALL ALLEGED DEMOCRATS UH .
UHHUH .
DEMOCRATIC FORMED GOVERNMENT AND I I THINK THAT S I THINK I THINK UH THAT S A LITTLE WAS A DIFFICULT PART THERE AND AND I WE DID NT UNDERSTAND THE CULTURE WE COULD NT UH WE HAD UH WE HAD A A YOUNG LADY THAT WAS FOURTEEN THAT WORKED ON OUR IN THE UNIT I WAS COMMANDER OF THAT APPEARED TO BE EIGHT OR NINE YEARS OLD AND AND THE PEOPLE LOOKED LIKE CHILDREN .
UHHUH .
I MEAN YOU COULD NT IMAGINE THAT ONE WOULD WOULD WOULD CONCEAL A BOMB AND .
YEAH .
AND DO THESE KIND OF THINGS I THINK SOCIALLY IT REALLY DESTROYED A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT THAT WENT OVER AND SAW THESE PEOPLE YOU JUST COULD NT BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD THAT THEY WOULD BE MEAN AND AND AND AND DROP BOMBS AND KILL PEOPLE AND THEN .
UHHUH .
WE WOULD TURN AROUND AND AND NAY PALM THEM YOU KNOW IF .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK THERE WAS A LOT OF A LOT OF TEARING OF EMOTIONS AND I THINK THAT IF ANYTHING THAT WHEN MUMBLEX HE WAS SAYING THE IDEA THAT WE LEARNED WE L WE LEARNED A LOT FROM VIETNAM .
UHHUH .
NOW IT WAS IT WAS IN GENERAL BAD BUT AND I DO NT KNOW THE PROBLEM IS NOW I M I M CONCERNED A LITTLE BIT .
THAT NOW THAT THE GULF WAR IS ON THAT WE RE GOING I THINK IT WAS A GOOD WAR AND IT WAS OKAY .
YEAH .
TO GO BEAT UP ON PEOPLE AND I THINK THAT I THINK WE NEED TO A LITTLE MORE JUSTICE AT HOME I M NOT SURE HOW WE GET THAT WONDER IF THERE S A CONNECTION THERE BUT MUMBLEX .
YEAH BUT THEN AGAIN YEAH I D SAY IT IS WRONG TO MUMBLEX AND I M NOT SAYING PRESIDENT BUSH MADE THE WRONG DECISION I THINK I M LACKING IN MY I DO NT THINK I CAN COME TO A COMPLETE CONCLUSION ON HOW I FEEL ABOUT THE VIETNAM WAR BECAUSE I M GOING TO INTERPRET THAT THROUGH THE BIBLE AND I VE KIND OF ALWAYS I VE BEEN A CHRISTIAN FIVE YEARS AND I VE KIND OF AVOIDED THAT THAT THOSE THE WAR THINGS AND HOW GOD APPROACHES THAT BECAUSE I THINK IT S JUST NOW COMING UP TO WHERE I REALLY FEEL LIKE I NEED TO COME YOU KNOW NEED TO DECIDE .
WELL THE DIFFICULTY IS .
WHAT I FEEL .
IS IF YOU LOOK IN THE OLD TEST MEAT AND IN THE NUMBERS OF PLACES THAT UH THE LORD WENT OUT AND JUST SIMPLY STRUCK DOWN AND THAT WAS PART OF THE PROBLEM WHEN THEY WENT INTO THE PROMISE LAND .
YEAH .
THAT THEY THAT THEY UH THEY DID NT DESTROY EVERYBODY .
RIGHT THEY .
MUMBLEX .
LEFT A WOMAN AND A CHILD AND A .
AND .
MUMBLEX THE SHEEP YEAH .
AND THAT THAT YOU KNOW AND YOU I THINK THAT S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHEN WE GET TO HEAVEN WE RE GOING TO ASK GOD .
I KNOW .
WHY DID YOU DO IT THAT WAY .
BUT THEN AGAIN THOUGH JESUS THE GRACE PUSHES YOU BEYOND THE LAW YOU KNOW WHAT I M SAYING LIKE SO HE DID NT JUST SAY DO NT KILL YOUR DO NT KILL YOUR ENEMIES BUT NOT ONLY DO NT KILL THEM BLESS THEM YOU KNOW AND SO THEREFORE WHEN WE HAVE AN ENEMY COME AGAINST US I REALLY FEEL LIKE THAT I REALLY FEEL LIKE I KNOW I DO FEEL THIS STRONGLY THAT WHEN IF WE HAD SOMEONE COME AND ATTACK US THE BEST WAY TO HANDLE IT WOULD BE TO BLESS THEM AND HUMBLY GO TO THEIR OTHER KING OR THE OTHER RULER AND SAY WHAT HAVE WE DONE TO OFFEND YOU WHAT CAN WE DO TO RECTIFY THIS SITUATION AND THAT GOD WOULD MOVE IN THAT SOVEREIGNLY .
MUMBLEX .
AND HE WOULD GET THE GLORY THOUGH NO KING NO BUSH WOULD NT BECAUSE IT WOULD NT MAKE ANY SENSE YOU KNOW WHAT ARE I M SAYING .
YEAH .
IT WOULD LOOK ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUSLY STUPID BUT IT WOULD WORK OUT BECAUSE IF YOU FOLLOW THE SCRIPTURAL PRINCIPALS IT S GOING TO WORK OUT BECAUSE THOSE ARE THAT S THE BEST WAY TO DO IT YOU KNOW BUT THE THING IS IS THAT THEN GOD GETS THE GLORY NOT A PRESIDENT NOT A KING AND I THINK THAT S A PROBLEM FOR A LOT OF POLITICIANS IS THEY WANT THE GLORY .
WELL AND I I AND EVEN IF THE EVEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHEN SOMEBODY S ASSAULTED .
UHHUH .
WHAT DO YOU DO TURN THE OTHER CHEEK .
N WELL I BELIEVE PERSONALLY I HO I I MUMBLEX WOMAN ALWAYS SAYS MY HUSBAND ALWAYS GOES THREE THAT I GUESS YEAH IF THE ONE IF SOMEBODY BROKE IN MY HOUSE I WOULD PRAY THAT I WOULD HAVE THIS FAITH TA TO TO TAKE AUTHORITY OVER THAT AND I KNOW PEOPLE THAT HAVE DONE THAT I MEAN I KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD PEOPLE BREAK IN THEIR HOMES AND JUST SAY I BIND YOU IN JESUS NAME YOUR N I JUST AND REBUKE ANY ENEMY BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT S A SPIRITUAL WAR THAT S GOING ON AND IT S NOT NORMAL FOR SOMEONE TO COME INTO SOMEONE ELSES HOME MUMBLEX THAT S NOT NORMAL THERE S SOMETHING GOING ON THERE AND THAT I WOULD HAVE DISCERNMENT BY THE HOLY SPIRIT TO DEAL WITH PRIDE OVER THAT DO YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN .
YEAH .
AND THEN THE SAME IN VIETNAM YOU WOULD YOU WOULD NT HANDLE VIETNAM THE SAME WAY YOU WOULD HANDLE UH SADDAM HOUSSEIN BUT I WAS I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ALL THE KILLING BUT I M NOT A NEW AGER I DO NT BELIEVE MUMBLEX I AM NOT FOR ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT I M NOT FOR ALL THESE NEW AGE THINGS I I YOU KNOW I DO NT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH UH NATIONAL IDENTITY AND I M AN AMERICAN AND HAVING DIFFERENT NATIONS AND ALL OF THIS BUT I M CONCERNED ABOUT THE KILLING THAT WENT ON THERE BECAUSE I JUST FEEL LIKE GOD HAS A BETTER WAY TO HANDLE IT THAN THAT AND .
ARE ARE YOU A T IER .
NO NO I WORK THERE AS A TEMPORARY .
OH REALLY .
BUT ARE YOU AT T I .
OH YEAH .
SO YOU HAVE TO DO THE RANDOM DRUG TESTING .
OH YEAH YEAH YEAH IN FACT WITH ME THIS IS IT S NOT MUCH TO TALK ABOUT I M SO MUCH FOR IT I DO NT REALLY HAVE MUCH TO COMMENT ABOUT IT THERE VE BEEN SOME INTERESTING SUBJECT THAT THEY VE CALLED ABOUT HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU CALLED OR HAVE YOU BEEN PARTICIPATING IN THIS .
OH ABOUT TEN OR ELEVEN CALLS .
OH YOU GOT TEN WELL .
RIGHT .
YOU YOU VE PASSED ME UP THIS IS ABOUT SIX TIMES .
OH AS CONTRACT PERSON WE HAVE TO DO RANDOM DRUG TESTING TOO .
YEAH .
IT DOES NT BOTHER ME I DO NT FEEL LIKE IT S REALLY A VIOLATION OF PRIVACY OR ANYTHING .
NO I THINK IT S GOOD IN FACT I DO NT KNOW WHAT THE STATISTICS WERE BUT I THINK THAT THEY WERE SURPRISED TO FIND IT SO LOW I THINK THEY WERE EXPECTING TO FIND UH LIKE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE AT T I AND I THINK IT WAS TREMENDOUSLY DOWN .
AS FAR AS THE NUMBER OF DRUG USERS YOU MEAN .
YEAH .
HUH .
AS FAR AS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THEY ACTUALLY FOUND THAT WERE DRUG USERS BUT I THINK THAT WHEN I WAS AT T I OF COURSE WE HAD ALL THE INFORMATION BEFORE THEY STARTED .
RIGHT .
AND THEY SAID THAT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT THE HEAVY DRUG USERS WOULD EITHER QUIT OR GO IN REHABILITATION PROGRAMS AND I THINK THAT S WHAT HELPS YOU KNOW THAT IN THE WARNING THAT YOU HAVE A DRUG PROGRAM THE PEOPLE THAT ARE WORRIED ABOUT IT OR ARE TAKING DRUGS ACTUALLY GO AND THEN USUALLY A LOT OF THEM PARTAKE IN SOME OF THE BENEFITS OF REHABILITATION AND EVERYTHING .
RIGHT YEAH SO THAT S REAL BENEFICIAL FOR THE COMPANY AND THE EMPLOYEE .
YEAH AND OUR NUMBERS HAVE BEEN WAY DOWN I DO NT KNOW WHAT THEY WERE .
WHEN I WORKED FOR THE TEMPORARY AGENCY AS A PERMANENT PERSON AND SO WE HAD WHEN WE SENT TEMPORARIES TO T I WE HAD TO HAVE THEIR DRUG TESTED .
YEAH .
AND WE DID HAVE A COUPLE OF CASES WHERE WE REALLY THE PERSON SAID THAT THEY HAD NT USED ANYTHING AND THEIR TEST CAME BACK POSITIVE AND NORMALLY WE DID NT RETEST THEM BUT THERE WERE A COUPLE OF PEOPLE THAT WE REALLY THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE TELLING THE TRUTH AND WE RETESTED THEM LIKE THE NEXT DAY AND THEY CAME BACK NEGATIVE .
OH REALLY .
THE SECOND TIME SO THAT THAT S THE ONLY THING I THINK THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT OF A PROBLEM .
OH YOU RE THAT S A GOOD POINT BUT AT T I THEY BEFORE THEY HAD THE TESTING I VE FORGOTTEN SEEMS LIKE IT S A YEAR AGO SEPTEMBER SOMETHING LIKE THAT THEY TOLD US THAT THE AGENCY THAT DID IT WAS THE ONE THAT DID IT FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND OF COURSE THAT S CRITICAL JUST AS THE POINT THAT YOU BROUGHT UP THAT WHOEVER DOES YOUR TESTING S GOT TO BE YOU KNOW HAVE A LOT OF QUALITY CONTROL THAT THEY KEEP TRACK OF EVERYTHING THEY DO NT MAKE MISTAKES THAT WOULD BE TERRIBLY EMBARRASSING .
RIGHT .
FOR SOMEONE TO REALLY COME BACK POSITIVE AND THEY WERE NOT AND I HAVE NT HEARD OF ANY NOW I M NOT IN PERSONNEL OR ANYTHING .
YEAH .
BUT UH THEY SAY THAT THERE IT S ALMOST DOWN TO ZERO WHERE PEOPLE COME BACK AND SAY THEY ARE POSITIVE AND THEY RE NOT IN OTHER WORDS THERE S VERY FEW MISTAKES AND THAT OF COURSE HAS GOT TO BE CRITICAL IT S GOT TO BE IF YOU HAVE A DRUG TESTING PROGRAM IT S GOT TO BE WITH A VERY VERY GOOD AGENCY YOU DO NT JUST HAVE SOME LOCAL GROUP DO IT IT S GOT TO BE A HIGHLY QUALIFIED AGENCY .
RIGHT YEAH NOT JUST SOME DOCTOR S OFFICE SOMEWHERE .
NO YOU DO NT WANT TO DO THAT IT S GOT TO BE A LABORATORY THAT DOES QUALITY CONTROL AND DOUBLE CHECK AND I THINK THAT T I IS LATCHED THEMSELVES UP WITH AN ESTABLISHED GROUP AND THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR ANY COMPANY THAT DOES IT AND NOT TO HAVE JUST A VERY CASUAL THING IT S GOT TO BE WITH A YOU KNOW FIRST CLASS TOTALLY INDEPENDENT AGENCY NOT LOCAL OF COURSE OURS I THINK WELL I THINK IT WAS IN THE SOUTH SOMEWHERE BUT IT WAS NT EVEN IN DALLAS YOU KNOW THE ONE THAT DID US .
OH REALLY .
YEAH .
HUH DO THEY HAVE A POLICY WHERE THEY COUNSEL PEOPLE IF THEY COME BACK POSITIVE OR DO THEY FIRE THEM RIGHT AWAY .
OH NO THEY RE NOT FIRED THEY ARE THEY HAVE ONE CHANCE TO THEN GO IN A PROGRAM YOU COME BACK POSITIVE YOU HAVE ONE CHANCE TO GO IN AND GO INTO THEY HAVE A LOT OF UH REHABILITATION BOTH FOR ALCOHOL AND FOR DRUG USE AND THEY HAVE UH A LOT OF UH THEY HAVE AN AGENCY WHERE YOU CAN GO FOR PERSONAL PROBLEMS FINANCIAL OR WHATEVER .
RIGHT .
AND SO THEY THEY THEY DO NT NO IT S NOT FIRING FIRST IT S UH DEFINITELY TRYING TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO REHABILITATE IN FACT AGAIN BEFORE YOU GO YOU KNOW THAT S WHY I SAID WHEN THEY FIRST STARTED IT THEY HAD A REHABILITATION PROGRAM IN EFFECT THAT SAID IF YOU WORRIED ABOUT THIS AND YOU MAY HAVE TAKEN DRUGS GO AHEAD AND GET REHABILITATED FIRST AND THEY WO NT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT .
RIGHT I THINK THAT S REALLY GOOD .
OH SURE .
I KNOW SOME PLACES JUST FIRE PEOPLE ON THE SPOT IF THEY COME BACK POSITIVE OR SOMETHING .
OH YEAH NO THAT S NOT RIGHT IT S REALLY AN ILLNESS OR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO SAY THAT IT IS YOU KNOW IT S A WEAKNESS AND ALL AND WHO ALL OF US HAVE WEAKNESSES OF ONE KIND OR ANOTHER AND I THINK THAT THOSE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THAT AND HOWEVER THEY GOT INTO IT I HAVE CHILDREN I ALWAYS WORRY ABOUT THE THE CLASSICAL THING THAT YOU SEE ON T V WHERE THE DRUG PUSHERS GIVE IT TO THE KIDS FOR FREE YOU KNOW AND GET THEM SUCKED IN AND THEN THEY SELL IT TO THEM YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
THE CLASSICAL THING IS TO GIVE IT AWAY I ALWAYS WORRY ABOUT MY TEENAGE DAUGHTERS GOING TO SOME PARTY AND THEY SLIP IT TO THEM I DO NT KNOW I DO NT EVEN HAVE THAT MUCH KNOWLEDGE TO KNOW WHETHER THAT WOULD GET THEM ADDICTED OR NOT YOU KNOW THAT S A REAL WORRY .
YEAH SOME OF THE STORIES YOU READ ABOUT COCAINE THAT S LIKE PEOPLE TRY IT ONE TIME AND THEY RE ADDICTED MY HUSBAND IS A COUNSELOR AND HE WORKS MOSTLY WITH ADOLESCENTS .
OH YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT THAT .
SO YEAH I HEAR A LOT OF HORROR STORIES ABOUT THINGS LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
BUT MOST OF THE TIME IT S THEY GET INTO THE WRONG CROWD FIRST AND THEN THEY START A DRUG PROBLEM .
YEAH .
IT S USUALLY NOT A ONE TIME ACCIDENTAL THING I DO NT THINK .
YEAH I KNOW I M GLAD OF THAT AND I HAVE KNOCK WOOD PRETTY GOOD LUCK OR VERY GOOD LUCK WITH MY DAUGHTERS SO FAR THAT S MY CONFERENCE CALL I HAVE ONE DAUGHTER STILL AT HOME ONE S AT U T AND ONE S AT HOME GETS DOZEN CALLS A NIGHT .
OH WELL I LL LET YOU GO IF YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND TAKE THAT .
NO NO I DO NT CARE ABOUT THAT SHE LL BE ON THE PHONE ALL NIGHT .
YEAH IT SEEMS IF YOU WATCH WHAT KIND OF CROWD THAT START RUNNING AROUND WITH AND KIND OF KEEP UP WITH WHO THEIR FRIENDS ARE .
RIGHT .
THAT S BEST WAY TO AVOID TROUBLE FROM WHAT I CAN GATHER .
DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN .
NO NOT YET WE RE EXPECTING A BABY .
OH GREAT .
IN JULY SO WE RE STARTING .
FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE I VE GOT TWO AS I SAID I VE AT U T NOW IN AUSTIN AND ONE AT HOME AND I ALWAYS SAY THAT I VE LEARNED SO MUCH MORE FROM THEM THAN I EVER TAUGHT THEM .
YEAH .
IT S A FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE .
OH WE RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IT .
OH YEAH .
YOU KNOW ONE THING MY HUSBAND BELIEVES IS IF YOU SUSPECT YOUR KIDS ARE HAVING ANY KIND OF PROBLEMS HE BELIEVES YOU SHOULD TAKE YOUR KIDS IN FOR A RANDOM TESTING LIKE ON A SATURDAY MORNING IF THEY VE BEEN OUT AT A PARTY FRIDAY NIGHT .
YEAH .
IF YOU RE NOT TOO SURE WHAT S GOING ON HE TELLS PARENTS ALL THE TIME HAUL THEM INTO THE DOCTOR S OFFICE AND GET THEM CHECKED .
THE KEY THING THAT I THINK THAT WE TRY TO DO IS THAT BRING ALL THE FRIENDS OVER HERE HAVE OUR HOUSE AS A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN COME AT ANY TIME SO THAT YOU ALWAYS SEE THEIR FRIENDS .
RIGHT .
RATHER THAN MAKE THEM NOT WELCOME AND THEY RE ALWAYS OVER IN SOMEONE ELSE S HOUSE SO OUR WE VE BEEN LUCKY THAT OUR HOUSE IS USUALLY THE PLACE WHERE THE KIDS COULD COME YOU KNOW .
UHHUH YEAH I THINK THAT S A REALLY GOOD THING TO ENCOURAGE .
AND THEN YOU CAN KEEP AN EYE YOU CAN MAKE JUDGMENTS AND MAKE COMMENTS OR WHATEVER YOU WANT BUT AT LEAST YOU SEE WHAT S GOING ON AND YOU ALWAYS HAVE YOUR HOUSE WELCOME THEN YOUR CHILDREN THINK THAT YOU KNOW YOU RE COOL PARENTS AND ALL THAT .
RIGHT .
WELL GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR EXPECTED BABY THERE .
OH WELL THANKS .
MY WIFE WAS YELLING WAS TALKING IN MY EAR SHE SAID REMINDED ME TO SAY THAT THEY RE VERY CHEAP UNTIL THEY GET TO START DRIVING .

OH MY GOSH .
SO UM I GET SHOTS FOR IT NOW TOO THAT HELPS A WHOLE BUNCH .
UHHUH .
BUT ONE GOOD THING ABOUT IT SEE I DO NT HAVE TO MOW THE GRASS OR MUMBLEX .
I MEAN THAT S REALLY NICE .
YEAH YOU SAID THAT YOU HAD A GARDEN WHAT ALL THINGS DO YOU PLANT IN IT OR DO YOU LIKE TO PLANT IN IT .
WELL THE FIRST THING WE ALWAYS PLANT IS TOMATOES .
UHHUH .
EVERY YEAR I DO NT CARE IF WE DO NT HAVE ANYTHING ELSE WE RE GOING TO HAVE TOMATOES AND THEN WE PLANT CUCUMBERS AND .
UHHUH DO YOUR CUCUMBERS COME GOOD .
OH YEAH .
REALLY SOMETIMES WHEN MY DAD HAS LIKE THAT S THE ONE THING NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO TOUCH EXCEPT MY DAD HE TAKES CARE OF ALL THE CUCUMBERS BECAUSE HE SAID THE VINES ARE JUST SO AT OUR HOUSE AS SOON AS YOU TOUCH A VINE IT S LIKE IT COMPLETELY DIES .
REALLY .
UHHUH .
IT MUST BE THE UH .
SOMETIMES WE HAVE REALLY GOOD LUCK WITH THEM BUT THEN THERE LL BE LIKE MAYBE TWO YEARS IN A ROW THAT WE CA NT GET ANYTHING .
NOW THAT S I MEAN THAT S SOMETHING THAT GROWS LIKE A WEED HERE .
OH WOW .
I MEAN IT GROWS LIKE A WEED WE HAVE TO ALLOW EXTRA ROOM FOR THOSE BECAUSE YOU KNOW I MEAN EXTRA SPACE .
YEAH BECAUSE THEY TAKE UP A LOT .
BETWEEN THE ROWS AND ALL YES BUT I MEAN WE USUALLY GET IF WE PLANT FOR EVERY ONE PLANT WE PROBABLY GET FIFTY TO SIXTY CUCUMBERS OFF OF IT .
HOLY SMOKE .
I MEAN JUST PULLING THEM AS FAST AS YOU CAN WE USUALLY GIVE THEM TO EVERYBODY .
UHHUH .
ANYBODY THAT WANTS A CUCUMBER CAN HAVE IT BUT WE TRIED IT TOO WHERE YOU RUN IT UP A FENCE .
UHHUH .
AND UM WE HAD SOME WEIRD CUCUMBERS BECAUSE THEY GREW INSIDE THE FENCE I MEAN LIKE THE LITTLE THING WOULD BE HALF ON ONE SIDE AND HALF ON THE OTHER .
OH MY GOSH .

UHHUH .
I KNOW WE DO THAT TOO YOU KNOW AND AT THE FIRST YEAR BECAUSE I WAS FROM THE CITY WHEN WE GOT MARRIED AND THE FIRST YEAR THAT WE PLANTED I COULD NT FIGURE OUT I MEAN THE WELL THE FIRST YEAR AFTER .
UHHUH .
I MEAN WE PLANTED THEM BUT THE FIRST YEAR YOU KNOW AFTER WE D HAD A CROP .
YEAH .
ALL THESE LITTLE THINGS LIKE WE HAD CUCUMBERS COMING UP YOU KNOW IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR OKRA AND I THOUGHT HOW DID THIS GET HERE .
UHHUH .
I KNOW I DID NT PUT THAT SEED THERE AND IT WAS WEIRD BUT THE BIRDS HAD YOU KNOW EVIDENTLY JUST DEPOSITED THEM FOR US .
UHHUH WELL SOMETIMES TOO WHEN WE TAKE OUT OUR GARBAGE AND WE USUALLY YOU KNOW WE JUST DUMP IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GARDEN YOU KNOW AFTER YOUR GARDEN S BASICALLY DONE .

RIGHT AND UH THERE S USUALLY NOBODY RUNNING AGAINST YOU KNOW THE INCUMBENTS .
RIGHT OR YOU DO NT KNOW WHAT THEY ST YOU KNOW WHERE THEY STAND OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT .
RIGHT SO UH BUT I I FEEL THAT UH A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE GOTTEN LAZY ABOUT VOTING .
YEAH I THINK YOU RE RIGHT .
AND IT S IT S THEY RE AND ALSO THEY RE FED UP WITH THE SYSTEM AND THEY SAY WELL WHY SHOULD I EVEN VOTE .
YEAH OR SOMETIMES THEY DO NT LIKE EITHER OF THE CHOICES .
RIGHT .
FOR THE CANDIDATES SO THEY THINK WELL YOU KNOW WHY VOTE .
RIGHT THE LESSER OF THE TWO EVILS IS HOW WE USUALLY LOOK AT IT .
YEAH REALLY ESPECIALLY IN TEXAS .
OH I KNOW IT .
THE LAST GUBERNATORIAL RACE WAS OH IT WAS AWFUL .
IT REALLY WAS YEAH .
SO I DO NT KNOW I I IT LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THE NEXT UH FEW YEARS GO .
YEAH DID THEY GET THE SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT HALF THE PEOPLE DO NT VOTE .
YEAH I THINK WELL IT S IT S DEFINITELY A PROBLEM AND I THINK IT COULD GET WORSE .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW WE GET THIS LACKADAISICAL ATTITUDE AND SAY HUH YOU KNOW WHY SHOULD WE VOTE THEN YOU KNOW IT COULD UH IT COULD LEAD TO SOME SERIOUS THINGS .
YEAH IT ALSO SEEMS LIKE MAYBE A ANOTHER CANDIDATE THAT NOBODY WANTS COULD SLIP IN .
UHHUH .
IF YOU KNOW NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE ARE VOTING .
RIGHT UH YEAH WE CAN GET UH YEAH IF WE GET SOMEONE IN THERE LIKE THAT THEN YOU KNOW THEY COULD MAKE ALL SORTS OF CHANGES THAT THEY WERE YOU KNOW HAD ENOUGH PULL .
YEAH IT S KIND OF LIKE IN LOUISIANA WHERE THAT UH GUY THAT S LIKE A KU KLUX KLAN .
YES .
MEMBER SOMETHING GOT ELECTED .
UHHUH .
KIND OF SCARY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THAT .
YEAH AND UH WHO S THE OTHER GUY LAROUCHE THAT UH IS SORT OF THE UH SOCIALIST NOT SOCIALIST BUT COMM HE S SO OFF THE WALL THAT UH HE S GONE IN AND TRIED TO GET INTO CITY ELECTIONS AND UH BUT HE S GOT HE S BEEN PUT AWAY FOR UH CREDIT CARD FRAUD I BELIEVE .
OH GOSH .
YEAH LYNDON LAROUCHE THAT S IT .
YEAH .
AND UH YEAH .
YEAH PEOPLE WILL SIT HOME AND ASSUME OH THAT GUY WOULD NEVER GET ELECTED .
UHHUH .
NEXT THING YOU KNOW YOU VE GOT HIM .
RIGHT IF YOU DO NT GO AND VOTE THEN YOU KNOW VERY GOOD CHANCE THAT THEY THEY WILL .
YEAH .
BECAUSE A LOT OF THE PEOPLE LIKE THAT THEY LL STRIKE A CHORD IN SOMETHING YOU KNOW IN SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT SO WILL SAY LOOK YOU KNOW THIS GUY S GOT EVERYTHING TOGETHER YOU KNOW I LIKE WHAT HE SAYS AND HE LL BE SO FAR OFF THE WALL THAT THEY LL ELECT HIM .
RIGHT YEAH .
AND UH I THINK THAT S SORT OF WHAT HAPPENED WITH LOUISIANA .
YEAH .
BECAUSE BECAUSE UM THE GUY DID GET ELECTED CORRECT .
RIGHT .
THAT S WHAT I THOUGHT .
YEAH HE SURE DID .
AND UH MUMBLEX BUT YOU KNOW THEY CAN ALWAYS FOOL US YOU KNOW HE MIGHT DO A GOOD JOB .
YEAH I THINK ONE THING THAT MAYBE WOULD HELP PEOPLE VOTE IS IF THE POLLS WERE EITHER OPEN MORE DAYS OR YOU COULD MAIL IT IN OR SOMETHING LIKE IF YOU HAVE IF YOU HAVE REAL STRICT WORK HOURS AND YOU CAN ONLY GO LIKE AT SEVEN IN THE MORNING OR AFTER WORK AND YOU HAVE TO STAND IN LINE FOR SO LONG .
OH YEAH .
I THINK THAT DISCOURAGES A LOT OF PEOPLE .
WHAT WE DO USUALLY IS UH VOTE UH ABSENTEEISM .
UHHUH .
AND UH I KNOW HERE YOU KNOW YOU DO NT HAVE TO HAVE ANY REASON YOU CAN JUST GO AND VOTE .
RIGHT .
AND THE POLLS ARE OPEN WHAT WAS IT A COUPLE OF WEEKS THE HOURS ARE GOOD AND THEY RE EVEN OPEN ON SATURDAYS .
UHHUH .
AND A COUPLE OF SUNDAYS AND SO WE VE GOT PLENTY OF TIME TO GO BECAUSE DOWN HERE IN HOUSTON IT S UH THE LINES ARE LONG .
YEAH I M IN DALLAS AND THEY RE LONG HERE TOO .
SO UH BUT UH .
YEAH I VOTED ABSENTEE ONE YEAR I REALLY WAS GOING TO BE GONE SO I DID IT BUT UH IT WAS NICE I WOULD BE TEMPTED TO DO IT AGAIN .
WELL UH I RECOMMEND IT BECAUSE YOU JUST WALK RIGHT ON IN AND THERE S USUALLY NOT ANYBODY IN LINE .
RIGHT .
AND UH YOU KNOW THAT VOTE S JUST AS GOOD AS YOU KNOW THE ONE ON ELECTION DAY .
YEAH I THINK THEY SHOULD CHANGE THE WHOLE SYSTEM SO THAT IT S EASIER .
UHHUH YEAH .
I THINK MORE PEOPLE WOULD DO IT IF IT WAS NT SUCH A HASSLE .
UM YEAH I VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH UH SOME OF THE CAMPAIGNS AND THE STATE CONVENTIONS OF THE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND IT S REALLY INTERESTING TO SEE THE PROCESS AS FAR AS WHAT GOES THROUGH AS FAR AS THE VOTING AND THE UH HOW THE UH THE NOT THE BALLOTS BUT UH MY MIND HAS GONE BLANK I VE BEEN MUMBLEX ALL EVENING .
HOW THEY DEVELOP UH WHAT THE CANDIDATE STANDS FOR .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THE VIEWS AND UH YOU KNOW EVERYBODY GETS TO VOTE ON YOU KNOW WELL SHOULD HE BE FOR THIS AND ON AND ON AND ON AND UH IT S IT S INTERESTING .
YEAH THAT WOULD BE I USUALLY VOTE A LOT OF TIMES I LL VOTE A STRAIGHT PARTY TICKET JUST BECAUSE I DO NT TAKE THE TIME TO FIND OUT WHAT EVERY YOU KNOW OTHER THAN THE MAJOR CANDIDATES WHAT THEY STAND FOR .
UHHUH .
ON WHAT ISSUES SO I LL JUST TRUST WELL THE PARTY KIND OF GOES ALONG THESE LINES SO I LL GO AHEAD AND VOTE .
RIGHT THERE FOR A WHILE THAT WOULD THAT WORKED WE VE UH I KNOW I HAVE UM I LL STICK TO UH TO THE YOU KNOW SOMETIMES I LL STICK TO A CERTAIN PARTY DEPENDS ON THE GUY .
UHHUH .
BUT UH IF IT UH GETS DOWN BETWEEN TWO THEN I LL I LL VOTE FOR THE PARTY .
YEAH .
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE OTHER GUY OR YOU KNOW THEY RE BOTH JUST AS BAD AND I LL SAY WELL I KNOW WHAT THIS GUY STANDS FOR AS FAR AS FOR HIS PARTY AND UM BUT YEAH YOU KNOW THAT S NOT THE BEST WAY BUT .
NO I GUESS IT D BE BEST IF YOU KNEW EACH PERSON AND WHAT THEY STOOD FOR AND WHY AND EVERYTHING .
BUT IT GETS TO THE POINT WHERE I MEAN YOU VE GOT TO HAVE THE TI FIND THE TIME ALSO TO READ ABOUT THE GUY AND AND BE ABLE TO FIND THE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT HE STANDS FOR .
RIGHT AND TRY TO DETERMINE IF WHAT YOU READ WAS OBJECTIVE OR NOT .
RIGHT OR WHAT YOU VE HEARD ON T V WHICH I THINK IS JUST OUTRAGEOUS .
YEAH .
I I DO NT AGREE WITH HOW THE MEDIA HANDLES ELECTIONS .
YEAH .
I YOU KNOW I M TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT THE POLLS YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THIS IS HOW HE STANDS SUCH AND SUCH A DAY .
YEAH .
THE WAY THEY BREAK IT OUT IT S JUST IT S JUST RIDICULOUS .
YEAH I THINK IT COULD AFFECT THE OUTCOME YOU KNOW COULD MAKE IT UNFAIR .
UHHUH IT REALLY COULD AND UH THEN HOW SOMETIMES HOW THE MEDIA WILL BLOW THINGS OUT OF PROPORTION AND WILL RUN AN ISSUE INTO THE GROUND WHICH IS GOOD AND DEAD AND THEY KEEP DRAGGING IT ON AND IT COULD HAMPER THE OUTCOME OF AN ELECTION FOR THE GUY THAT SHOULD HAVE WON .
OH YEAH .
YEAH SO UH .
YEAH THE PRESS HAS A LOT OF POWER .
THEY REALLY DO I I SOMETIMES THINK THAT THAT SHOULD BE LIMITED MORE .
YEAH OH BUT BOY YOU TRY GET INTO THAT YOU D REALLY OPEN A CAN OF WORMS .
OH YES OR THEY I AGREE WITH THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS YOU KNOW AND ALL THE AMENDMENTS BUT SOMETIMES IT S FOR THE PUBLIC S OWN GOOD THAT WE DO NT HEAR THINGS .
YEAH SEEMS THAT THEY SHOULD REGULATE THEMSELVES A LITTLE BIT AND I DO NT THINK THEY EVER CARE TO .
NO THEY DO NT .
WELL I CA NT THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE REALLY ABOUT THE POLLS OR VOTING TO TALK ABOUT .
WELL I ENJOYED TALKING TO YOU .
WELL IT WAS GOOD TALKING TO YOU .
ALL RIGHT .
BYE .
BYEBYE .
OKAY DO YOU HAVE ANY UH IDEAS ON UNIVERSAL HEALTH INSURANCE DO YOU HAVE ANY STRONG OPINIONS .
YEAH I THINK IT S PROBABLY A GOOD IDEAL .
YOU DO .
UH I THINK GIVEN UH GIVEN WELL GIVEN THAT THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO DO NT HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE IT S PROBABLY A REAL SMART THING .
UHHUH .
AT LEAST TO HAVE SOME BASIC COVERAGE FOR EVERYONE I MEAN YOU HEAR THESE HORROR STORIES OF PEOPLE HOMELESS PEOPLE GOING TO THE HOSPITAL AND .
YEAH .
AND BEING THROWN OUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO INSURANCE .
RIGHT .
AND HAVING TO GO TO SOMEPLACE ELSE YOU KNOW IT WOULD BE NICE IF NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE OR WHO YOU ARE WHAT HAPPENED YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU YOU JUST GO TO THE HOSPITAL AND THEY SAY OKAY JUST JUST TAKE HIM AND WE WILL WORRY ABOUT WHO HE IS LATER SO .
YEAH .
THAT WOULD BE A NICE THING .
YEAH I FEEL LIKE THERE SHOULD BE SOME KIND OF COVERAGE MADE BUT I I M REALLY LEERY OF A KIND OF A GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATIVE HEALTH INSURANCE OR MEDICAL PLAN BECAUSE I JUST FEEL LIKE EVERYTHING THAT THE GOVERNMENT TAKES OVER IS JUST GOING TO BE RUN MUCH POORLY AND IT IS GOING TO BE ABOUT SIX TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE .
YEAH I KNOW THAT THAT S CERTAINLY TRUE BUT I WONDER ABOUT LIKE LIKE IN CANADA .
UHHUH .
IN CANADA WHERE EVERYBODY UH EVERYBODY AUTOMATICALLY HAS INSURANCE IN CANADA .
RIGHT AND THEY HAVE THAT IN ENGLAND TOO BUT I THINK THAT IT S A PRETTY POOR THEY GET A LOT LOWER QUALITY CARE THAN WE DO NOW I KNOW SOME PEOPLE DO NT AGREE WITH ME BUT UH I KNOW YOU HAVE TO WAIT REAL LONG TIME TO GET FOR CERTAIN SURGERIES THAT ARE NT EMERGENCY AND YOU DO NT HAVE THE KIND OF CHOICES THAT WE HAVE HERE .
YEAH .
AND UH I VE WORKED A LOT IN DOCTOR S OFFICES AND HOSPITALS AND I REALLY DO NT WANT TO GIVE UP HAVING THOSE CHOICES .
THAT S TRUE THAT S THAT S TRUE .
I THINK I MEAN THERE IS A NIGHT AND DAY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GOOD DOCTORS AND BAD DOCTORS AND GOOD HOSPITALS AND BAD DOC HOSPITALS .
THAT S TRUE THAT S TRUE .
AND IN ENGLAND AT LEAST AT THE TIME WHEN I WAS FAMILIAR WITH IT ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO THEY JUST TOLD YOU WHAT DAY YOU HAD TO SHOW UP AND WHERE YOU HAD TO SHOW UP AND WHO YOUR DOCTOR WAS GOING TO BE .
OH YOU SO DID NT GET ANY CHOICES AT ALL .
NO NO I MEAN THAT .
OH THAT S A PROBLEM .
YEAH .
YEAH BECAUSE I KNOW I KNOW EVEN AMONG EVEN NOW THE WAY WE HAVE IT NOW THERE ARE STILL .
IT S GETTING WORSE IS NT IT .
YEAH I MEAN LIKE WE HAVE .
YEAH .
AN H M O ALLOWS US TO PICK OUR OWN PHYSICIANS .
RIGHT RIGHT .
I MEAN I PICKED A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN AND JUST DID NT LIKE HIM YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
I HAD TO SWITCH BECAUSE I JUST THOUGHT HE WAS A QUACK SO .
RIGHT THAT S EXACTLY THE PROBLEM THERE S JUST SO MANY SUCH VARIATION AND IT S BUT SEE I GUESS WHAT THEY HAD IN ENGLAND AND I GUESS IN CANADA IS SOCIALIZED MEDICINE .
YEAH .
SO MAYBE THAT S LIKE THE EXTREME OF IT DO YOU THINK .
YEAH YEAH THAT IS THE EXTREME AND WHAT THAT WHAT THAT I THINK THAT TENDS TO DO THOUGH IS I THINK THAT TENDS TO IT PROBABLY HAS TWO A GOOD AND A BAD SIDE .
UHHUH .
FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WANTING TO BECOME DOCTORS WHICH AGAIN A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE MOTIVATED BECAUSE THE MONEY IS NT I GUESS AS MUCH .
RIGHT .
FOR DOCTORS ANYMORE .
RIGHT .
SO YOU WIND YOU WIND UP GETTING THE PEOPLE WHO REALLY WANT TO BE DOCTORS BEING DOCTORS .
REALLY WANT TO .
BUT THEN AGAIN YOU KNOW YOU DO NT GET THOSE PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE GOOD .
RIGHT .
AND ARE REAL SMART AND DECIDED HEY I WANT TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY SO I WILL GO INTO MEDICINE YOU DO NT GET THOSE .
RIGHT OR THAT YEAH EXACTLY OR PEOPLE ALSO GET THE FEELING THAT WELL JEEZ YOU KNOW YOU DO NT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT YOU HAVE A LOT OF JOB SECURITY THERE AND IT S MORE OF UH SENIORITY I WOULD IMAGINE KIND OF THING INSTEAD OF HAVING A SKILL OR OR WHATEVER TO ADVANCE .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
SO YOU DO NT NECESSARILY GET THE KIND OF QUALITY CONTROL OR THE KIND OF I DO NT KNOW .
YEAH IT WOULD BE NICE TO SEE SOMETHING WHERE AT LEAST .
I THINK WE HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING WE REALLY DO .
I MEAN EVEN SOMETHING THAT SAYS YOU KNOW LOOK FREE MAJOR MEDICAL FOR ALL YOU KNOW EVERYONE AND THEN .
YEAH .
BEYOND THAT YOU COULD WORK OUT ON YOUR OWN IF YOU WANT .
YEAH I KNOW I I DO NT KNOW I HAVING WORKED IN DOCTOR S OFFICES AND STUFF I SEE IT FROM A PHYSICIAN S POINT OF VIEW AND I .
UHHUH .
I THINK THE PROBLEM WITH THE SKYROCKETING COST RIGHT NOW IS THE INSURANCE COMPANIES BECAUSE .
OH YEAH .
I DO NT SEE DOCTORS GETTING REAL RICH AND I THINK HOSPITALS DO MAKE MONEY BUT NOT NEARLY AS MUCH AS INSURANCE COMPANIES .
OH RIGHT NO .
I THINK THEY ARE REALLY MAKING A KILLING AND NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT IT NOBODY S .
YEAH THEY ARE THE ONES WHO MAKE I MEAN THEY ARE THE ONES THEY HAVE YOU KNOW THE MUMBLEX ALTHOUGH I MEAN IT S THE UNFORTUNATE PART OF THAT IS THAT THE PEOPLE I THINK TEND TO FORGET THAT DOCTORS ARE HUMANS AS WELL .
UHHUH .
SO THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE TO CHARGE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE OR CERTAIN TYPES OF OF DOCTORS GIVEN THAT YOU KNOW SOMEONE DECIDES TO HAVE A MALPRACTICE SUIT AGAINST THEM WELL THEY COULD TAKE YOU KNOW IT COULD BE MILLIONS I MEAN UNFORTUNATELY .
RIGHT .
AND IF THE DOCTOR WHETHER IT WAS YOU KNOW I MEAN I M SURE THERE ARE THOSE CASES WHERE WHERE THE DOCTOR IS WRONG OR MALICIOUS OR SOMETHING .
RIGHT RIGHT .
BUT YOU KNOW THEIR YOU KNOW .
THEIR MISTAKES ARE MADE .
MISTAKES YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
EVERYBODY MAKES MISTAKES UNFORTUNATELY .
SURE .
IT SHOULD NT BE A BILLION DOLLAR YOU KNOW INDUSTRY IT SHOULD BE .
YEAH .
I MADE A MISTAKE AND THIS IS THIS IS THEIR COMPENSATION NOT .
SO YEAH I THINK THAT S THE LEGAL PART OF IT COMING INTO IT TO .
YEAH THAT IS A BIG PROBLEM .
I WONDER IF WE SHOULD HAVE A LIMIT ON HOW MUCH PEOPLE CAN SUE FOR .
THAT WOULD BE NICE .
OR OR I DO NT KNOW BECAUSE THEN THAT S WHERE THE INSURANCE COMPANY THEN IF PEOPLE WERE NT HAVING TO SPEND THESE HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY ON GETTING INSURANCE COVERAGE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW .
IT WOULD BE A LOT BETTER YEAH .
YEAH .
I MEAN I M SORT OF IN A IN A GOVERNMENT RUN MEDICINE PROGRAM SORT OF I M IN A .
ARE YOU .
WELL WELL I M A GRADUATE STUDENT .
OKAY .
AND UH .
AT WHERE .
AT UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER .
OH OKAY .
IN ROCHESTER NEW YORK .
UHHUH .
I LL BET YOU ARE IN TEXAS .
I WHAT I M IN TEXAS YEAH YEAH .
I WAS GOING TO BET THAT OKAY UH YEAH AND AS IT AS IT TURNS OUT MY WIFE HAS PRETTY DECENT COVERAGE THROUGH HER COMPANY .
UHHUH .
AND CAN GET ME COVERAGE AS WELL .
OH GREAT .
BUT I YEAH WHICH IS GREAT .
YEAH .
AND BECAUSE THE UNIVERSITY THE UNIVERSITY OFFERS ME TWO PLANS THEY OFFER WHAT THEY CALL THE MANDATORY VERSION .
OH .
WHICH IS BASICALLY MAJOR MEDICAL AND THEY OFFER THE MUMBLEX PORTION WHICH IS .
UHHUH .
WHICH IS YOU KNOW SORT OF EVERYTHING ELSE YOU NEED SORT OF YOUR YOUR YOUR BASIC CARE .
UHHUH .
BEYOND MAJOR MEDICAL AND STUFF .
OKAY .
AND THEY DO NT AND EVEN THOUGH MY MY WIFE S INSURANCE COVERS ME .
YEAH .
FOR EVERYTHING .
UHHUH .
I STILL HAVE TO PAY THEM A HUNDRED AND SOME ODD DOLLARS A SEMESTER .
OH NO .
AND THAT S FOR THE MANDATORY PORTION OF THE INSURANCE .
THAT THAT THAT CA NT BE LEGAL .
YEAH I M NOT ACTUALLY SURE IF IT IS OR NOT BUT PEOPLE SORT OF KEEP FIGHTING IT AND I M AND I MEAN TO KEEP FIGHTING IT .
OH MY GOSH .
BUT YOU KNOW IT S JUST ONE OF THESE THINGS WHERE I JUST DO NT WANT TO SPEND MY TIME .
HOW CAN THEY HOW CAN THEY MAKE YOU PAY FOR INSURANCE COVERAGE .
WELL THE REASON THEIR RATIONAL IS IS THEY MAKE EVERYONE PAY FOR IT SO THAT IT IT KEEPS THE COST OF UNIVERSITY HEALTH SERVICES DOWN AND EVERYONE CAN USE IT YOU KNOW IT .
HOW HOW DOES IT KEEP THE COST DOWN .
BECAUSE EVERYONE IS NOW FORCED TO PAY FOR THIS AND THERE IS LIKE AN .
OH SO THEY JUST USE THE MONEY FOR SOMETHING ELSE BESIDES YOUR INSURANCE POLICY .
WELL NO WELL YEAH WELL WHAT THEY USE IT NO WHAT THEY USE IT FOR IS IS IS UNIVERSITY HEALTH SERVICES WE HAVE A .
OKAY .
WE HAVE A HOSPITAL HERE AND A SUBPORTION OF THE HOSPITAL .
OKAY SO YOU RE SUBSIDIZING THE HOSPITAL .
RIGHT OBVIOUSLY WE RE PAYING FOR THE WELFARE STATE NOW AS IT TURNS OUT AS IT TURNS OUT UH MY WIFE AND I HAVE CHOSEN TO USE THE UNIVERSITY AS .
UHHUH .
HEALTH SERVICES AS OUR PRIMARY CARE FACILITY WE CAN DO THAT .
OH GOOD .
SO IN IN BUT IN EFFECT I M PAYING TWICE FOR ONE SERVICE SO .
YOU ARE YOU ARE I KNOW AND SEE THAT S THE THING THAT IS THE THING NOW THAT I M IN MY THIRTIES NOW AND I HAVE THREE KIDS AND I MEAN I M VERY LIBERAL I M EXTREMELY LIBERAL AND UH I BUT NOW I JUST IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS I HAVE GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE I AM SAYING I JUST CAN NOT AFFORD TO PAY ANYMORE .
UHHUH .
TO HELP PEOPLE OUT I I WANT TO KEEP HELPING PEOPLE OUT BUT I NEED FOR THE GOVERNMENT OR THE AGENCIES TO FIND A WAY TO DO IT ON THE AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU KNOW THAT I CAN AFFORD .
YEAH .
I JUST CA NT AFFORD ANYMORE .
YEAH .
IT S IT S JUST OUTRAGEOUSLY IT S JUST STARTING TO GET ME ANGRY AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I AM STARTING TO FEEL LIKE I I WELL I GUESS IT HAS TO DO WITH A LOT OF THE STUFF THAT I FIND OUT I AM PAYING FOR NOW .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
WELL THAT S THAT S CERTAINLY TRUE .
I MEAN IF I CA NT AFFORD TO HAVE SOME KIND OF VOLUN OPTIONAL OPERATION FOR MYSELF BECAUSE OUR OUR MEDICAL COVERAGE HAS GOTTEN INCREASINGLY WORSE OVER LET S SEE THE PAST FIVE YEARS TO THE POINT NOW WHERE EVEN IF WE NEED SURGERY OUR INSURANCE ONLY COVERS EIGHTY PERCENT OF IT .
RIGHT WHICH IS RIDICULOUS .
AND RIGHT AND SO NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS TO ME IF I GET IN A CAR ACCIDENT THIS AFTERNOON I HAVE NO WAY OF YOU KNOW NO WAY OF BEING ABLE TO AFFORD THE OUTRAGEOUS MEDICAL COSTS .
YEAH .
BECAUSE MY INSURANCE IS NOW ONLY EIGHTY PERCENT OF WHATEVER IT S GOING TO BE AND UH SO ON TOP OF THAT UH THEN WHAT IF I WHAT IF WE DECIDE TO HAVE UNIVERSAL HEALTH INSURANCE I M SUBSIDIZING .
EVERYBODY ELSE .
AND WHAT IF THEY ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET INTO A DOCTOR AND A PROGRAM THAT S GOING TO SAY OKAY WELL YOU REALLY NEED TO HAVE THOSE VARICOSE VEINS FIXED OR YOUR TEETH FIXED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
RIGHT .
AND I AM PAYING FOR IT YOU KNOW STUFF LIKE THAT HAS HAPPENED WITH EDUCATION AND WITH OTHER THINGS THAT YOU HEAR ABOUT AND IT S JUST WAIT A MINUTE YOU KNOW MY KIDS ARE NT GETTING THAT HOW COME THEIR THEIR KIDS ARE GETTING THAT .
YEAH EXACTLY I DO NT I DO NT UH .
AND I KNOW IT S ONLY IN A FEW CASES AND I DO NT WANT THEM TO UH TO CUT FUNDING FOR WELFARE PROGRAMS OR ANYTHING I DO NT WANT THEM TO DO THAT BECAUSE I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE THEY LIVE RIGHT ON THE EDGE AND THEY NEED THAT .
UHHUH .
BUT BUT .
YEAH IT S IT S ONE OF THE STRANGE I THINK IT S STRANGE THAT AS YOU GET OLDER .
UHHUH .
I THINK I THINK THE TENDENCY IS THAT AS PEOPLE GET OLDER .
UHHUH .
AND GAIN I DO NT WANT I DO NT WANT TO SAY MORE RESPONSIBILITY BUT YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE HOMES AND KIDS .
UHHUH .
AND SO FORTH .
RIGHT .
THEY TEND TO LOSE THAT LIBERALISM THEY HAD WHEN THEY WERE YOUNGER .
WELL YEAH THAT S AND IT S UH IT S FUNNY BECAUSE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I HEARD A QUOTE FROM WINSTON CHURCHILL LET S SEE IF I CAN REMEMBER IT ANYBODY WHO S NOT A LIBERAL IN HIS TWENTIES HAS NO HEART AND A PERSON WHO IS NOT A CONSERVATIVE IN HIS FIFTIES HAS NO BRAIN IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
THAT S PROBABLY VERY TRUE .
YEAH AND I DO NT KNOW I GUESS THAT S WHAT S HAPPENING TO ME BUT I I THINK IT S JUST STARTING UH IT S IT S I I DO NT KNOW MAYBE OTHER PEOPLE I DO YOU THINK IT S A SIGN OF THE TIMES THAT PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO SAY ALL RIGHT WE REALLY MEAN IT NO MORE TAXES OR MAYBE THIS IS JUST MY OWN PERSONAL .
NO I THINK I THINK PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO REALLY MEAN IT I MEAN EVERYWHERE YOU YOU LOOK YOU ARE GETTING SOMETHING NEW I MEAN YOU START OFF .

WELL THE ONLY THING .
WE VE TAKEN BACK RECENTLY ARE PLANTS .

WELL WH DO YOU THINK THAT UH CONSUMER GOODS GOODS ARE GENERALLY GETTING BETTER OR WORSE IN QUALITY .
WELL I BELIEVE THEY RE BETTER .
I DO TOO .
I BELIEVE ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO THAT WE WENT THROUGH A TERRIBLE TIME BUT I DO NT I I BELIEVE THAT THEY RE BETTER NOW YOU KNOW WH .
I THINK SO .
I DO NT THINK THEY RE SHODDY NOT AS SHODDY .
ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES I THINK ARE PRETTY GOOD R RELIABLE .
HOWEVER I DID NT LIKE IT VERY WELL WHEN THE TRANSMISSION WENT OUT ON MY CAR WITH SIXTYTHREE THOUSAND MILES ON IT .
RIGHT .
AND I DO NT LIKE IT VERY WELL IF WHEN MY ELECTRIC BLANKET .
THAT WAS ONLY ONE YEAR OLD WENT OUT AT UH ON ONE SIDE .
OH DID YOU RETURN IT .

I HAD TAKEN THE FIRST ONE BACK .
I DID NT THINK THAT IT HEATED WELL ENOUGH .
IT NEVER DID GET ANYTHING BUT JUST MODERATELY WARM TOOK IT BACK AND UH THE PEOPLE TOLD ME WELL THAT S THE WAY .
IT S SUPPOSED TO BE AND I FELL FOR IT AND UH WHEN I GOT THIS .
ONE .
IT DID A LIT IT HEATED A LITTLE BIT WARMER AND THEN AFTER ONE YEAR .
IT STARTED HEATING ONLY ON ONE SIDE .
HUH SO EITHER .
YOU OR YOUR HUSBAND CAN BE WARM BUT NOT BOTH .
ALSO I TOOK AN IRON BACK AFTER HAVING IT ONLY ONE YEAR .
OH .
NOW I FIGURE TH UH ANYBODY .
THAT IS DUMB ENOUGH TO IRON NEEDS TO HAVE AN IRON .
THAT WILL LAST A LONG TIME AND ONE YEAR OF IRONING ONLY ONCE A WEEK IS NOT LONG ENOUGH FOR IT TO LAST .
NO HUHUH .
DID THEY REPLACE IT .
WELL WITHOUT EVEN ANY QUESTION BUT I THINK IT WAS THE STORE .
UHHUH .
WALMART .
WALMART I WAS GOING TO SAY IT MUST HAVE BEEN WALMART .
YES .
AND UH WELL HAVE YOU BEEN BUYING ANY CLOTHES LATELY .

I HAVE NT BOUGHT ANY NEW CLO WELL THE LAST THING .
I BOUGHT WAS A DRESS LAST SUMMER .
AND THE BUTTONS TURNED ON IT .
OVE OVER THE WINTER .
THE BUTTONS TARNISHED SLIGHTLY AND I HAVE NOT GONE BACK ABOUT IT .
THAT WAS POOR QUALITY I THINK .
I THINK IT IS TOO AND IT WAS AN EXPENSIVE DRESS .
I WONDERED IF IT WERE NT EXPENSIVE .
YES IT WAS .
AND THEY SHOULD HAVE PUT BUTTONS ON IT .
THAT WOULD LAST FOREVER .
THAT S RIGHT THAT S WHAT .
I THINK TOO .
AND ONE BELT LOOP THE WO UH YOU KNOW LIKE THE CHAIN LINK CHAIN BELT LOOP .
YES .
HALF OF IT RAVELED OUT .
AND THAT WAS I BELIEVE A LESLIE FAYE DRESS AND IT WAS I THINK OVER A HUNDRED DOLLARS .
YOU SPENT THAT MUCH ON YOUR DRESSES .
YEAH I DO NT USUALLY BUT I DID THAT ONE .
YOU RE REALLY DIVULGING VERY PERSONAL INFORMATION .
BUT I THINK IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THAN THAT FOR THAT MONEY IS WHAT .
I MEAN .
OH OF COURSE I DO TOO .

OKAY I THINK SO .
AND NORMA IT IS JUST WONDERFUL TO TALK TO YOU .
GOOD TALKING TO YOU TOO I VE ENJOYED IT .
YOU ARE A GOOD ONE TO TALK ABOUT CONSUMER GOODS BECAUSE YOU KEEP UP ON IT .
ALL THE TIME .
WELL WE LL BE TALKING TO YOU LATER .
BYE BYE .
BYE BYE .
OKAY I DO NT KNOW WHICH END DO WE PUSH BUT OKAY .
OKAY WELL UM LET S SEE I I THINK THERE S A LOT OF PEOPLE .
THAT DO NT VOTE BECAUSE THEY DO NT REALLY THINK THEIR THEIR UH OPINION IS GOING TO BE HEARD AND YOU KNOW THERE S SUCH A SMALL VOICE AND SUCH A HUGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES AND THAT YOU KNOW THEIR YO VOTES NOT GOING TO MAKE THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE AND WHETHER YOU VOTE FOR ONE PERSON OR THE OTHER PERSON THE ISSUES IS WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT .
YOU BELIEVE IN AND THAT PERSON IS GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF UH SINCE THERE S SO MANY ISSUES THIS ONE PERSON CAN BELIEVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS ON .
RIGHT YEAH .
ALL OF THEM SO IT WOULD BE REALLY DIFFICULT TO HAVE THAT ONE PERS PERFECT PERSON .
THAT BELIEVED EXACTLY WHAT .
YOU BELIEVED .
THAT S TRUE YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE UH UH I THINK THE THAT IT ENDS UP THE PEOPLE .
THAT UH VOTE EVERY TIME UH ELECTIONS COME AROUND ARE MORE THE THE POLLY UH THE PARTY TYPE FOLLOWERS THE GUYS .
THAT UH YOU KNOW FOLLOW THE PARTY LINES YOU KNOW AND .
YEAH .
THEY YOU KNOW JUST GO IN AND IF THEY RE REPUBLICAN THEY .
VO VOTE REPUBLICAN .
EVERY YEAR YOU KNOW AND UH THE PEOPLE .
THAT ARE INDEPENDENT YOU KNOW ARE THE ONES .
THAT DO NT UH DO NT REALLY UH SHOW UP EVERY YEAR BECAUSE THEY CA NT SEEM TO TO DECIDE WHICH ARE THE GOOD ASPECTS AND WHICH ARE THE BAD ASPECTS OF A CANDIDATE .
RIGHT YEAH .
YEAH .
THAT S GOOD .
YE I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS BACK WHEN ANDERSON WAS RUNNING I WAS HOPING THAT THINGS WOULD CHANGE AND HE D ACTUALLY GET ELECTED AND PARTY POLITICS WOULD START GOING DOWN THE TUBES BUT UM .
YEAH .
THAT DID NT WORK .
YEAH THERE S UH A LOT OF EXTREMES ON THE PARTIES TOO WITH THE .
YOU KNOW THE REAL UH FAR SIDE OF THE DEMOCRATS THEY RE REAL LIBERAL NOW AND TO WHERE PROBABLY FIFTY OR A HUNDRED YEARS AGO UM THE DEMOCRAT PARTY BEING LIBERAL LIKE THEY ARE NOW YOU KNOW WOULD NEVER BE THOUGHT OF IT WOULD BE THE OTHER WAY THAT THE REPUBLICANS WERE REAL LIBERAL MINDED AS FAR AS LIKE UH MORAL STANDINGS AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS .
UHHUH .
BUT .
YEAH YEAH THAT S UH AND THEN AND THEN PEOPLE ALWAYS GET UPSET ABOUT IT TOO BECAUSE YOU KNOW EVERY YEAR .
THE THE THE POLITICIANS ARE THE ONES .
THAT ARE USUALLY PUSHING FOR MORE PEOPLE TO VOTE .
UHHUH .
THEY THEY .
EACH THINK THAT UH IF MORE PEOPLE VOTE THEY LL GET MORE VOTES HUH .
YEAH .
I M ALWAYS AMAZED AT THAT THAT EACH CANDIDATE THINKS IT S GOING TO BE THE PEOPLE .
THAT COME OUT THAT WILL VOTE FOR HIM YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
THAT S THAT S TRUE .
I THINK IN UH THE TEXAS GOVERNOR ELECTIONS I THINK MORE PEOPLE TURNED OUT TO VOTE AGAINST SOMEBODY THAN FOR SOMEBODY THIS TIME .
YEAH WELL THAT UH MUMBLEX I KNOW THAT THERE .
S CERTAIN ISSUES .
THAT CAN REALLY MOTIVATE PEOPLE BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A PR PR PREDOMINATELY CATHOLIC TYPE AREA .
OH REALLY .
AND WHEN THINGS START UH WHEN WHEN ABORTION COMES ON THE ISSUES AND PEOPLE JUST GET ALL INSP INSPIRED YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
AND UH STILL ON THE OTHER HAND .
WE RE ALSO UH THIS PARTICULAR COMMUNITY IS A CATHOLIC COMMUNITY BUT UH UH DOWN IN D C WHERE WHERE THINGS ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT UH YOU KNOW IT S IT S WOMEN S RIGHTS AND THE AND THAT SORT OF MOVEMENT AND SO IT S UH QUITE THE OPPOSITE SO ELECTIONS START GETTING VERY UH THE ELECTIONS WHERE THEY HAVE THAT TOPIC SEEM TO BE A LITTLE BIT BETTER ATTENDED THAN SOME OF THE OTHER ONES .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
BUT UH .
YEAH THAT S TRUE THAT THE DIFFERENT PLACES IN AMERICA .
THAT UH YOU KNOW DIFFERENT ISSUES WOULD BE A LOT MORE IMPORTANT THAN SAY IN ANOTHER PLACE .
YEAH I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY WHY SOME OF THE THE RURAL AREAS THE VOTER TURNOUT IS NT AS MUCH BECAUSE IT DOES SEEM SOMETIMES LIKE THE LOBBYISTS IN D C ARE LIKE CONTROLLING THINGS FOR THE THE MIDWEST .
UHHUH .
AND UH IT DOES NT MATTER WHO .
THEY PUT IN OFFICE THEY RE GOING TO FALL SUBJECT TO UH THE PRESSURE THAT THE LOBBYISTS CAN PUT .
RIGHT .
YEAH AND IT S UH REAL TRUE THAT UH YOU KNOW THEY LL SAY ONE THING .
TO GET ELECTED AND THEN ONCE THEY DO GET ELECTED THEY DO NT HAVE THE POWER OR THE AUTHORITY OR THE WILLINGNESS TO DO THOSE THINGS THAT THEY PROMISED YOU KNOW BEFOREHAND .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW MAYBE IT JUST WAS NT POSSIBLE AT ALL IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU KNOW LIKE THE NO NEW TAXES THING .
YOU KNOW THAT S UH WITH THE ECONOMY GOING THE WAY .
IT IS AND EVERYTHING THAT WAS NEARLY RIDICULOUS .
YEAH .
THING TO EVEN TRY TO DO .
YEAH .
WELL I DO NT THINK HE S GOING TO HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT NEXT YEAR .
I THINK HE CAN PROBABLY RAISE TAXES AND STILL GET ELECTED .
RIGHT .
UH .
RIGHT AFTER THE WAR .
UHHUH .
THAT REALLY UH .
UNFORTUNATELY THAT WILL PROBABLY EVEN DROP LOWER THE VOTERS TURNDOWN MUMBLEX EVEN MORE BECAUSE MORE DEMOCRATS WILL THINK THAT THEY DO NT HAVE A SHOT SO THEY WO NT EVEN BOTHER TURNING OUT .
UH THAT S TRUE YEAH .
THEY LL JUST SAY OH WELL YOU KNOW THE REPUBLICANS HAVE THIS ELECTION .
WE LL SEE YOU IN FOUR YEARS .
RIGHT .
YEAH .
MUMBLEX HOPE SOME OF THE LOCAL WELL THAT S WHAT .
THEY THEY KEEP SAYING THAT IT SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE WITH OLDFASHIONED VALUES ARE THE ONES .
THAT ARE NT TURNING OUT AT THE AT THE BOOTHS THEY THEY SAY THAT THESE OLDER VOTERS .
THAT UH YOU KNOW THEY THEY FEEL LIKE THE KIDS ARE RUNNING THE THE COUNTRY SO THEY THEY DO NT COME OUT TURN OUT TO VOTE AND THEY RE THE ONES .
THAT UH YOU KNOW REALLY KNOW WHAT S GOING ON HAVE THE EXPERIENCE AND SEEN YOU KNOW HOW POLITICIANS CAN YOU KNOW SCREWUP OR WHAT EVER .
UHHUH .
BUT I KNOW MY GRANDMOTHER HAS NT VOTED IN YEARS .
RIGHT THAT S YOU KNOW NEITHER HAS MINE AS A MATTER OF FACT .
AND UH THAT S TRUE THEY I THINK THEY LOOK AT IT AS WELL EVERYBODY THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE THINK THIS WAY WHEN THAT S NOT NECESSARILY TRUE .
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT S WHAT .
THE MEDIA SAYS .
WELL THE MAJORITY BELIEVES THIS WAY SO UH THEY DO NT EVEN BOTHER TURNING OUT TO VOTE TO EXPRESS THEIR UH OPINIONS .
SO THAT S THAT S TRUE .
YEAH WONDER IF THEY RE GOING TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT MUMBLEX .

I M THINKING ABOUT IS THEY SHOULD BE SELFSUPPORTING LIKE UH THE PRISONERS MAKE LICENSE PLATES OR FARM OR SMALL INDUSTRY INSIDE THE PRISONS .
ANYTHING TO WHERE THEY CAN BE SELFSUPPORTING WITHIN THEMSELVES .
IN OTHER WORDS THEY RE IN THERE FOR A PURPOSE PUT THEM TO WORK .
UHHUH .
RATHER THAN SITTING THERE .
IT S THE SAME THING LIKE THE WHOLE CRIMINAL I SHOULD NT SAY CRIMINAL BUT THE WHOLE POLICE DEPARTMENT OF THE UNITED STATES .
I FEEL THE SAME WAY .
UH SOMEONE GETS PICKED UP FOR DRUNK DRIVING HE SHOULD PUT ENOUGH IN THERE .
THAT GOES BACK INTO PAYING FOR THAT POLICEMAN BEING OUT THERE .
UHHUH .
SO IT .
S SELF DEFEN YOU KNOW SELFDEFENSE ON THAT POINT .
UH AS FAR AS MY DEFENSE BUDGET UH THEY RE CUTTING IT BACK NOW WHAT TWENTYFIVE PERCENT .
I WOULD NT WANT TO SEE IT CUT ANY MORE THAN THAT .
YEAH .
BUT AGAIN I D LIKE TO SEE SOMETHING ON THE OTHER END BACK INTO EDUCATION .
BUT NOT IN THE EDUCATION .
WE HAVE TODAY .
SO I M LOST ON THAT ONE .
I WOULD LIKE TO BE A LITTLE MORE INTO INVESTIGATING SOME OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD AND THEIR EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS .
AND TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING A LITTLE BETTER THAN WHAT .
WE VE GOT .
UHHUH .
YEAH ITS TOUGH TO TO SAY WHAT UH YOU KNOW WHAT UH AS FAR AS THIS THAT GOOD OR BAD OR WHAT .
BUT UH I WAS JUST TALKING TO SOMEBODY ELSE AND ALL THOSE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THEY PAY ALL THE WAY THROUGH COLLEGE AND STUFF LIKE THAT .
THEY SO UH .
WELL NOT SO MUCH PAY .
I M NOT TRYING TO SEE THE GOVERNMENT PUT OUT ANY MORE .
NO .
YEAH I KNOW WHAT .
YOU ARE SAYING .
BUT I M JUST SAYING THAT EVEN THE DIFFERENCES UH IS THAT YOU KNOW SOME COUNTRIES PAY FOR STUDENTS TO GO TO THROUGH COLLEGE AND ETCETERA .
BUT HERE IT YOU KNOW IT S JUST UP TO HIGH SCHOOL .
YEAH .
BUT SEE WE DO NT EVEN PUSH THE FACT TO THE HIGH SCHOOL KIDS THAT THERE .
S OTHER MEANS OF EDUCATION OUT THERE RATHER THAN COLLEGE .
TO GO EITHER AS AN APPRENTICE WHICH .
THEY THEY DO IN OTHER COUNTRIES .
JUST DOING IT WHICH .
I THINK WOULD BRING THE EDUCATION BACK UP .
YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
WHY NOT AN APPRENTICE OUT TO A A COMPANY AND LEARN FROM DOWN ON THE BOTTOM AS A WOOD WORKER OR YOU KNOW JUST A TECHNICIAN .
YOU CAN LEARN ON THE JOB .
UHHUH .
WHICH OF COURSE AGAIN WHICH M WOULD MEAN AGAIN OUR EDUCATION BUDGET WILL GO DOWN IF THIS IS IN A FEW YEARS I MEAN IT S NOT GOING TO BE OVERNIGHT .
YEAH .
BUT THAT WOULD COME DOWN .
I THINK THE PRO YOU KNOW THAT S ONE REASON UH YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE THE EDUCATION IS THAT WHAT .
IT TAKES FOR THESE COMPANIES TO BRING SOMEBODY ON BOARD .
UH THEY RE NOT WILLING TO YOU KNOW TO PUT THAT YOU KNOW .
THE TRAINING FOR ONLY A CERTAIN AMOUNT .
SO UH IT S YOU KNOW AS FAR AS THE TECHNICAL SIDE .
BUT UH EVEN LIKE ONE ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS NOW IS LIKE PARALEGALS AND STUFF .
I MEAN THEY THEY RE TRYING TO GET MORE PEOPLE INTO THAT FIELD .
BUT THEY CA NT JUST BRING SOMEBODY IN WITHOUT EVEN HAVING GONE TO YOU KNOW SCHOOL IN THAT AREA BEFORE THEY CAN WORK YOU KNOW FOR A LAWYER AS A PARALEGAL .
EXCUSE ME .
I SEE IT BEING DONE .
I KNOW OF A FRIEND .
THAT WORKS FOR MY LAWYER .
THAT HAS HAD NO TRAINING WHATSOEVER AND SHE S TRAINING HER .
UHHUH .
WELL YEAH I I M WELL YA I YOU KNOW I M ASSUMING THAT IT CAN BE DONE .
UH MY PERSPECTIVE IS THAT YOU KNOW I VE BEEN WITH A COUPLE OF BIG COMPANIES NOW .
AND IT S LIKE THEY D ARE UNWILLING TO PUT THE TIME IN .
YOU KNOW THEY WANT SOMEBODY YOU KNOW WHEN THEY THEN WHEN THEY BRING THEM OFF BRING THEM IN THAT THEY HAVE SOMETHING YOU KNOW A CERTAIN AMOUNT TO CONTRIBUTE .
OBVIOUSLY THERE S UH YOU KNOW THERE S A LOT TO LEARN UH AFTER THAT .
BUT BUT UH THAT S TRUE .
I M I M SURE THERE S A LOT OF UH YOU KNOW BUSINESSES ARE SMALL YOU KNOW SMALL BUSINESSES .
THAT COULD UH .
LET ME CHANGE MY CHANNEL I VE GOT A CORDLESS PHONE .
LET ME SEE IF THAT CLEARS THIS UP .
IS THAT BETTER .
YES .
OKAY .
WOW .
MUMBLEX YEAH IT WAS A CORDLESS PHONE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WE HAD A BAD UH FREQUENCY THERE OR SOMETHING .
SO WE HAD SOME INTERFERENCE SO I CHANGED THAT .
YEAH .
IT SOUNDED YOU WERE CALLING FROM AROUND THE WORLD SOMEWHERE .
ANYWAY SO UH .
WELL .
BUT UH YOU KNOW I THINK UH THEY MAYBE THEY NEED TO UH HELP PROMOTE THAT MORE .
GIVE INCENTIVES LIKE UH IF THEY DO BRING SOMEBODY ON THEY WILL PAY SOME OF THEIR COSTS OR GIVE TAX BREAKS OR WHATEVER .
IT IS YOU KNOW FOR THEM TO TRAIN PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW STUFF LIKE THAT .
PROGRAMS LIKE THAT YOU KNOW .
I DO NT KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF OPTIONS THEY VE GOT .
WELL THAT S SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT .
GERMANY S SUPPOSED TO BE DOING .
SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THAT RIGHT NOW .
AND UH THEY HAVE JOBS OUT ON YOU KNOW BULLETIN BOARDS SO PEOPLE KNOW WHAT IS OPEN FOR AN APPRENTICES IN DIFFERENT FIELDS .
BUT SEE THAT AGAIN WOULD CUT SOME OF OUR BUDGET DOWN FOR EDUCATION BUT BUILD UP OUR EDUCATION WITH THE PEOPLE .
AT PEOPLE PER AT HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL .
UHHUH .
WHICH .
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE .
RATHER THAN SO MANY KIDS GETTING OUT OF SCHOOL .
THEY RE THEY GO ON THE UNEMPLOYMENT LIST BEFORE WE HAVE TURN AROUND .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE THEY DO NT HAVE ANY EDUCATION .
I DO NT MEAN COLLEGE .
AND I M FOR COLLEGE .
BUT THERE S A LOT OF PEOPLE .
THAT DO NT WANT THEIR HIGHER EDUCATION AS FAR AS QUOTE QUOTE COLLEGE IS CONCERNED .
THEY VE HAD IT .
YEAH .
I THINK I JUST HEARD SOMETHING THE OTHER DAY IT WAS LIKE ONLY IT WAS EITHER SIXTY PERCENT OR FORTY PERCENT GO TO COLLEGE .
AND THEN OUT OF THAT PERCENTAGE ONLY SO MANY CAN GET THEIR DEGREE .
UHHUH .
SO I THOUGHT THAT WAS INTERESTING .
BUT UH YOU KNOW MOST PEOPLE I KNEW HAVE GONE AND GOT THEIR DEGREE .
SO .
OH YEAH .
BUT THERE S A LOT OF THEM OUT THERE .
THAT HAVE NT .
YEAH .
WELL I JU YOU KNOW I .
THAT S .
UH WAS BASIC IN A YOU KNOW MIDDLE UPPER MIDDLE CLASS AREA AND YEAH SO I THINK UH THAT DEMOGRAPHIC AREA THERE YOU KNOW A LOT OF THEM DO GO ON .
AND THEY GO TO COLLEGE ETCETERA .
WELL IT SEEMS TO ME THAT KIDS .
THAT A GET OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL THAT PARENTS HAVE GONE TO COLLEGE AND COLLEGE HERE AND COLLEGE .
THERE .
THAT ARE REALLY NOT INTERESTED IN GOING TO COLLEGE AND FORCED INTO IT USUALLY ARE YOUR DROP OUTS .
WHERE IF THEY RE SAID HEY IT S JUST AS ADVISABLE TO GO INTO SOMETHING .
YOU ENJOY AND YOU LIKE .
BECAUSE YOU CAN GET JUST AS FAR AS BEING A JOURNEYMAN CARPENTER OR AN ELECTRICIAN OR PLUMBER OR ANYTHING ELSE LIKE THAT .
MAKE AS MUCH MONEY AND IF THEY ENJOY IT MORE THEY LL MAKE A LO HAPPIER LIFE FOR THEMSELVES .
YEAH .
QUESTION .
YOU THREW THAT QUESTION ON ME ABOUT THE DEFICIT PUT IT ON YOUR SHOE NOW .
WHAT WOULD YOU DO .
WELL AS AS FAR AS THE YOU KNOW THE DEFICIT THAT S A WHOLE NOTHER UH MY PERCEPTION OF THE BUDGET YOU KNOW THE GOVERNMENT .
AND THEY HAVE SO MUCH TO SPEND AND THERE S NOT ENOUGH MONEY TO SPREAD AROUND .
BUT THE DEFICIT BASICALLY IS THAT THE TRADE SURPLUS BETWEEN THE OTHER COUNTRIES AND THAT WE HAVE MORE MONEY OR GOO YOU KNOW MORE MONEY GOING OUT AND TOO MANY GOODS COMING INTO THIS COUNTRY YOU KNOW .
AND UH YOU KNOW PART OF THAT PROBLEM I THINK IS STILL YOU KNOW UH LIKE JAPAN STILL DOES NOT LET US COMPETE FAIRLY IN THEIR COUNTRY .
AND AND OBVIOUSLY THE THE DEMAND FOR THEIR GOODS IS QUITE HIGH HERE SO THEY CAN GET THEIR GOODS IN HERE .
AND UH YOU KNOW TO START EVEN THAT OUT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO YOU KNOW AT LEAST THREATEN THAT YOU KNOW WE RE GOING TO GIVE THEM HIGHER TARIFFS ETCETERA TO RAISE THEIR PRICES TO YOU KNOW OURS .
BUT UH IT S JUST THAT UH THEY RE EH I THINK YOU RE YOU RE GOING TO FIND THAT JUST BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES YOU KNOW THERE IS SUCH A DEMAND HERE THE MARKET YOU KNOW .
AND UH UH THE MONE YOU KNOW MONEY BEING SPENT AND THE GOODS FLOW IN AND WE DO NT SELL YOU KNOW WE DO NT UH SELL PRODUCTS ABROAD AS MUCH AS WE BRING IN .
SO .
WERE .
YOU WATCHING I THINK UH ONE OF THE NEWS STATIONS .
I COULD NT EVEN TELL YOU .
WHICH .
ONE .
I WATCHED .
BUT THEY HAD ON THERE WHERE THE THE OUTPUT FROM THE UNITED STATES WAS BASICALLY FROM SMALLER BUSINESSES RATHER THAN THE LARGER ONES ARE EXPORTING .
UHHUH .
WELL I GUESS UM I LL START OUT AND THAT IS UM I DO NT KNOW WHAT SECTION OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM THEY RE TALKING ABOUT WHETHER IT S THE FIRST EIGHT GRADES THE HIGH SCHOOL OR COLLEGES I HAVE MIXED VIEWS ON ALL THREE OF THEM .
UHHUH WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE THE LOWER GRADES YOU KNOW K THROUGH SEVEN .
WELL I I I SHOULD IMAGINE THE LOWER GRADES WHAT WOULD WHAT WHAT S WHAT S CERTAINLY DRAWN EVERYONE S ATTENTION TO THAT IS THE FACT THAT UH MANY OF THE INNER CITY AND UH I GUESS WHAT WE D CALL UH GHETTO OR POORER DISTRICTS .
UHHUH .
INCLUDING RURAL DISTRICTS DO NT SEEM TO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE THE STUDENTS THAT IND INDEED MANY UH MANUFACTURING AND OTHER .
RIGHT .
ENTERPRISES WANT THEY CA NT SEEM TO THEY CA NT SEEM TO READ PROPERLY DO MATH .
UHHUH .
PROPERLY AND CONFORM TO WHAT EMPLOYERS WANT .
YEP I UH .
SO THAT S GOT EVERYBODY EXCITED HIGH SCHOOLS I M NOT TOO SURE IT SEEMS THAT HIGH SCHOOLS AT LEAST PRODUCE CANDIDATES A A ALTHOUGH I HAVE GREAT MISGIVINGS ABOUT THE S A T S THAT GO ON TO A VARIETY OF COLLEGES IT SEEMS A GREAT DEAL OF OUR PUBLIC COLLEGES HAVE FOREIGN STUDENTS IN THEM UH FROM UM A MYRIAD OF NATIONS AND UH AND ALSO UM UH I THINK THAT UH A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF UH THE COLLEGES PRODUCE A FAIRLY DE UH PUBLIC COLLEGES PRODUCE A FAIRLY DECENT STUDENT .
UHHUH .
OR FAIRLY DECENT GRADUATE I SHOULD SAY .
YEAH I I I JUST READ SOME THINGS RECENTLY WHERE UM UH COLLEGES NOW UH GRADUATE PROGRAMS IN GENERAL NOW TRAIN BASICALLY THEY RE FIFTY PER CENT FOREIGN UH .
OH I DID NT REALIZE IT WAS THAT HIGH .
YEAH OH JUST ABOUT F YEAH BUT WHEN YOU CONSIDER UM .
WOW .
WHEN YOU CONSIDER UH .
ESPECIALLY IN TECHNICAL AREAS SCIENCE .
YEAH .
ENGINEERING AND COMPUTERS .
WELL THAT S WHAT I WAS GOING TO POINT OUT I THINK IT MOSTLY IS THAT TECHNICAL .
YEAH ESPECIALLY IN THOSE AREAS IT S UM I KN IT S IT S ALMOST FIFTY PER CENT FOREIGN LIKE FORTYEIGHT PER CENT AND THAT INVOLVES BOTH CANADIAN .
YEAH .
AND UH UH EUROPEAN MIDDLE EASTERN AND AND FAR EASTERN YEAH .
WOW .
I I THINK UM I THINK I HAVE SIMILAR VIEWS THAT S YOU KNOW WHERE OUR ELEMENTARY GRADES UM I IT S AMAZING I HAVE A FRIEND WHO S AN E WHO S AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER .
YEAH .
AND SHE SAID THAT THEY RECENTLY YOU KNOW THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THEY HAVE TO THEY HAVE TO PAT THE KIDS DOWN BECAUSE THEY BRING GUNS TO SCHOOL SHE TEACHES IN THE CITY .

YEAH THAT YEAH THAT MUST BE AN INNER SCHOOL I JUST READ A AN .
UHHUH .
AMAZING ARTICLE I GUESS .
YEAH .
IN THIS MONTH S NE THIS WEEK S NEW YORKER ABOUT BALTIMORE .
UHHUH .
UH WHICH UH WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT I DO NT KNOW I THOUGHT IT WAS RATHER SLANTED IN FAVOR OF THE MAYOR OR OR OR THE POLITICIANS IN THE IN THERE I D I DO I DO KNOW A FEW PEOPLE AND HAVE BEEN .
UHHUH .
HAVE DONE SOME BUSINESS UP IN BALTIMORE BUT IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE INNER SCHOOL SYSTEM THERE WAS THE ONE THING THAT DID NT S THE INNER CITY SCHOOL SYSTEM WAS THE ONE THING THAT DID NT FLOWER TOO WELL THEY TALKED ABOUT INDIVIDUAL CASES OF PEOPLE TRYING HARD BUT IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT .
UHHUH .
I I I I THINK IF I WAS GOING TO FAULT IT NOW IF I M I M LOOKING TO CARRY ON A CONVERSATION .
YEAH .
THAT WAY I THI THERE S A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT REALLY BOTHER ME I THINK WHEN I LEARNED THE OTHER DAY UH UH THAT UH THE AVERAGE AMERICAN THE AVERAGE AMERICAN .
UHHUH .
NOW WATCHES SEVEN POINT TWO HOURS OF TELEVISION A DAY AND THAT SCHOOL CHILDREN A A ARE NOT FAR OFF THAT MARK WITH SIX POINT EIGHT .
NOW I DO NT KNOW WHAT SCHOOL CHILDREN WHAT YEAR THAT IS .
RIGHT .
I MEAN THAT S A HELL OF A LOT TIME TO BE SITTING IN FRONT OF THE TUBE .
YEAH A AND IT S UH UH IT S REALLY YOU KNOW KIDS CA NT READ UM .
WELL I .
IT S REALLY THEY YOU KNOW BY THE TIME .
YEAH .
THEY MY WIFE TEACHES UH MIDDLE SCHOOL .
REALLY .
YEAH AN AND THEY CA NT .
OH SO YOU RE CLOSE TO THE SUBJECT .
YEAH BY THE TIME THEY GET THERE THEY CA NT READ THE THEY THEY CA NT READ ANYTHING .
AND YET YOU KNOW I HAVE GRANDCHILDREN I HAVE TEN UH NINE GRANDCHILDREN IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY .
UHHUH .
AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW I CA NT SPEAK TO THE RURAL OR POORER INNER CITY SCHOOLS .
YEAH .
THESE KIDS GO TO A F THEY LIVE IN A FAIRLY NICE UPPER SCALE NEIGHBORHOOD .
YEAH .
AND THEY SEEM TO BE DOING EXTRAORDINARILY WELL .
UHHUH .
I I I MEAN I QUIZ THEM AND I TALK TO THEM AND THEY THEY READ WELL THEY DO EVERYTHING WELL BUT I I I MEAN I THINK THAT S A F THAT S PART OF THE ENVIRONMENT .
YEAH I THINK IT S IT S PROBABLY THE WORK THAT YOUR YOUR CHILDREN YOUR CHILDREN ARE DOING UH UM .
YEAH THAT THAT THAT THAT COULD BE VERY WELL TRUE .
SHE SHE S YEAH SHE CAN TELL .
YEAH .
SHE CAN TELL YOU KNOW WHEN THEY HAVE KIDS COME IN FOR .
RIGHT .
THEY MEET WITH ALL OF THE PARENTS .
YES .
AND SHE CAN TELL BEFORE A PARENT COMES IN NORMALLY .
REALLY .
YOU KNOW GIVE OR TAKE EIGHTY NINETY .
YEAH .
PER CENT YOU KNOW WHAT THE PARENTS ARE GOING TO BE LIKE WHEN THEY COME IN AND THE RESPONSES THE PARENTS WILL GIVE BACK .
NO KIDDING OH I I I .
OH YEAH .
YEAH I GUESS I COULD I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT .
UHHUH .
HOWEVER I M A PRODUCT OF THE NEW YORK CITY PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM FROM FIFTY YEARS AGO .
YEAH .
UH MAYBE NOT THAT LONG AGO BUT AND UM AND SO I I ALWAYS FELT I DID NT GET A REAL GOOD EDUCATION IN THE PU IN THE GRAMMAR SCHOOLS AND PART OF HIGH SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
SO I LIVED IN NEW ENGLAND AT THE TIME I SENT ALL MY CHILDREN TO PREP SCHOOL I WAS F I W I DID NT HAVE THAT MUCH MONEY BUT WE STRUGGLED AND WE DID IT .
RIGHT .
AND I THOUGHT IT I THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL OF IT WAS A GREAT DEAL OF THE SUCCESS THAT THEY HAD IN THEIR EDUCATION WAS DUE TO THE LOW STUDENT TEACHER RATIO .
I THINK I THINK IT S PROBABLY VERY TRUE .
AND I I I THINK THAT COULD THAT S A FORMULA THAT COULD BE APPLIED EVERYWHERE .
UHHUH .
EXCEPT IT MUST COST A HECK OF A LOT OF MONEY IF YOU DO .
UHHUH .
IT IN PUBLIC SCHOOL .
BUT YOU KNOW SURPRISINGLY I I BECAUSE YOU PUT SUCH A COMMITMENT ON EDUCATION .
YEAH .
UM YOUR CHILDREN PROBABLY COULD HAVE GONE TO SCHOOLS WITH UH UH A HIGHER STUDENT TEACHER RATIO .
YEAH .
AND STILL DONE WELL BECAUSE WHEN THEY WOULD COME HOME YOU AND YOUR WIFE .
YEAH .
WOULD SAY YOU KNOW WHAT DID YOU DO TODAY .
YEAH .
IF WE LET S SIT DOWN AND READ TOGETHER .
WELL THAT THAT THAT S .
YEAH .
THAT THAT MUST BE .
UHHUH .
THEN THEN IF THAT S UH I THINK WE BOTH AGREE ON THAT THEN THEN THEN THEN A PARENT .
YEAH OH IT S PARENTAL YEP .
PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT HAS TO BE THERE .
UHHUH YEAH .
AND I GUESS YOU GOT TO TAKE THEM AWAY FROM THE TUBE ALSO ANOTHER THING THAT I HAVE ANOTHER PROBLEM I HAVE IS UH I DO NT REALLY KNOW HOW TO RESOLVE THIS BUT IS THE INCREDIBLE AT LEAST IN THE HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE LEVEL EMPHASIS ON SPORTS WHERE ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY ARE SPENT AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT MO MONEY COULD BE MORE WELL WELL SPENT SOMEWHERE ELSE .
BUT YOU KN YOU KNOW WHAT S REALLY FUNNY IS THAT THEY THERE S BEEN SOME RESEARCH BECAUSE I M A .
YEAH .
I M A COLLEGE PROFESSOR .
OH YEAH .
AND UM UH AND AND W A LOT OF THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT LIKE GEORGETOWN .
YEAH .
WHILE HEWING WAS PLAYING AT GEORGETOWN .
RIGHT .
BASKETBALL GEORGETOWN .
RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT .
AND THEY WERE WINNING .
YEAH .
ENDOWMENT TO THE UNIVERSITY IN OTHER WORDS MONEY THAT COULD TO EVERYTHING EVERYTHING AND NORMALLY GETS DIRECTED AWAY FROM SPORTS REALISTICALLY A LOT OF THE WAS UH WAS PROBABLY TWOTHIRDS I GUESS IT S NOW TWOTHIRDS OF WHAT IT WAS WHEN THEY WERE NATIONAL CHAMPIONS .
IN OTHER WORDS WHILE THEY RE NATIONAL CHAMPIONS .
YEAH YEAH .
PEOPLE DONATE MORE MONEY .
RIGHT .
AVERAGE HUMAN BEINGS LIKE YOU AND I AVERAGE JOES THAT MAKE A DECENT SALARY .
RI BUT I MEAN .
THAT ARE A GRADUATE OF THE SCHOOL .
UH RIGHT .
SEND BIG BUCKS LIKE COUPLE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS BUT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE .
TO TO WHAT UH TO YOU SAY OTHER THINGS THAN SPORTS THOUGH .
BECAUSE NO BEC NORMALLY IT S BECAUSE OF THE SPORTS .
YEAH I KNOW BUT I MEAN THEY DO NT JUST SEND IT TO THE NEW STADIUM OR .
RIGHT RIGHT BUT SEE THE SPORTS BRINGS IN THE MONEY .
REALLY .
BECAUSE WHEN GEORGETOWN WAS NUMBER ONE .
I WELL I GUESS THEY RE .
THEIR THEIR THEIR MONEY THAT WAS DONATED TO THEM FROM COMPANIES .
RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT .
FROM FROM L FROM BUSINESS PEOPLE FROM GRADUATES WHATEVER .
YEAH .
WAS UP INTO YOU KNOW LIKE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS AND NOW IT S DOWN TO LIKE FOURTEEN MILLION DURING THAT TIME PERIOD IN OTHER WORDS .
WELL I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT BENEFIT YEAH .
THEIR INCOME HAS SLOW .
YEAH .
THEIR THEIR AL ALUMNI GIVING AND OTHER FUNDS HAVE SLOWLY DROPPED SINCE THEN .
WELL I I NEVER THOUGHT .
UHHUH .
OF THAT BENEFIT BUT THE CONSEQUENCE .
YEAH .
THEN I MY I GUESS WHAT I D HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT IS .
YEAH .
THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE CHAMPION .
THAT S YEAH IT S IT S AMAZING THE WAY BUT NOW THAT S BIG TIME .
IS NT THAT SOMETHING THOUGH .
YEAH .
I DID NT REALIZE THAT .
BUT BUT UH SMALLER SCHOOLS ARE NT LIKE THAT UH .
NO .
ONLY ONLY THE BIG TIME SCHOOLS SHOW THAT .
YEAH .
BUT YOU RE RIGHT I I THINK THE EMPHASIS ON SPORTS AND AS A SEE I M A I M A I M A FORMER ATHLETE IN A SENSE I SWAM UM .
YEAH YEAH .
BUT SWIMMING NEVER GETS MUCH GLORY SO IT REALLY DOES NT MATTER BUT .
WELL MARK SPITZ MADE A LOT OF MONEY ON IT .
THAT S TRUE THAT S TRUE BUT YOU KNOW THEY STILL .
AND HE DI AND HE CAME BACK THIS YEAR DID NT HE BUT HE DID NT MAKE IT .
HE DID NT MAKE IT NO .
NO .
I I WOULD HAVE LIKED IT IF HE IF HE WOULD HAVE THOUGH .
YEAH .
BUT I THINK UH REALISTICALLY YOU KNOW YOU READ THE .
YEAH .
THE RESEARCH STUDIES AND UH I DO NT THINK HE WOULD HAVE MADE IT SIMPLY BECAUSE THE W THE EVENT HE WAS TRYING TO SWIM THEY EVEN THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT DISTANCE RUNNING .
YEAH .
SO I WOULD ASSUME DISTANCE SWIMMING MIGHT BE SIMILAR THAT AND HE WAS GOOD AT DISTANCE SPITZ AS A SWIMMER YOU KNOW AT .
WELL .
I CAN REMEMBER THAT BUT THE DISTANCE UM THE THE DISTANCE STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE OR WHATEVER SORT OF STARTS TO PEAK AT ABOUT TWENTYEIGHT TWENTYNINE THIRTY THAT S WHY SOME OF YOUR LONG DISTANCE RUNNERS .
RIGHT .
WERE IN THEIR L EARLY THIRTIES .
RIGHT RIGHT .
AND BUT HE S WAS TRYING TO MAKE IT IN THE SPRINTER S EVENT .
RIGHT .
AND MOST OF THEM .
WELL .
ARE UNDER TWENTYFIVE .
I READ I I ALSO READ I WE RE GETTING OFF THE SUBJECT HERE A BIT .
UHHUH YEAH .
BUT I I DO WANT TO ADD THIS TO THAT BECAUSE I I WAS QUITE INTERESTED IN THAT MYSELF .
UHHUH .
BUT I READ WHERE THE REASON THAT HE HAD TO DO THIS IN THE SPRINT EVENTS IS THAT NATIONAL TELEVISION WOULD NT PAY FOR THE L DISTANCE EVENTS AND THEY DID NT THINK THEY COULD CAPTURE THE EXCITEMENT TO GET SPONSORS .
OH YOU RE KIDDING .
IF YOU BROUGHT JUST THE F HERE HE COMES DOWN THE FINISH LINE RIGHT SO IT HAD TO BE IT HAD TO BE .
JEEZ .
WHERE THEY COULD PUT IT IN ONE SEGMENT AND G AND AND I GUESS CAPTURE THE WHOLE THING FOR SOME SPONSOR .
HUH AND THAT .
LET ME ASK YOU ANOTHER QUESTION .
AS AS AN ATHLETE I JUST HATE THAT GO HEAD .
YEAH .
YEAH WHAT WERE SAY WHAT WERE YOU SAYING .
WELL I IF YOU TEACH C UH COLLEGE .
YEAH .
AND AND I KNOW WHEN I WENT TO COLLEGE I I WENT TO SUMMER SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
AND I THOUGHT THAT UH IN FACT THAT MY IDEA OF IT WAS UH RATHER THAN RATHER THAN FINISH EARLY I JUST ENJOYED SOME OF THE SUBJECTS THAT I WAS TAKING AND I HAD THE ABILITY TO TO GO IN SUMMER SCHOOL AND I I DID N .
UHHUH .
TAKE THOSE SUBJECTS SO WHAT THAT LEADS ME MY NEXT THOUGHT IS I UNDERSTAND THERE S A LOT OF TALK NOW ABOUT EXTENDING THE SCHOOL YEAR WHICH SEEMS INORDINATELY SHORT ANYWAY .
UHHUH .
COMPARED TO THE JAPANESE .
RIGHT .
OR THE GERMANS .
YEAH I THINK I THINK .
WELL HOW DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD WORK IN GRAMMAR SCHOOLS AND .
I THINK UH IN IN SOME SENSE UM WHAT I WOULD DO BEFORE I WOULD EXTEND A SCHOOL YEAR IS I WOULD MAKE IT BETTER BEFORE I WOULD CONTINUE THE AGONY .
YEAH YEAH THAT S RIGHT .
AND SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER TOO UM BECAUSE I KNOW A AS A AS A .
AS A FORMER HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER .
YEAH .
I KNOW THAT FROM RIGHT NOW .
WELL THANKS FOR BEING HOME UH ON THE WEEKEND I UH I M ACTUALLY WORKING AT NIGHT AND UH THERE VERY FEW PEOPLE THAT ARE ON THE LIST FOR CALLS UH ON THE WEEKENDS NIGHTS .
UHHUH YEAH WELL SOMETIMES I M HOME AND SOMETIMES I M NOT BUT IF I AM IT S ALWAYS FUN TO TALK .
ARE ARE YOU PART OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM OUT THERE .
I AM AS A MATTER OF FACT I M AT UH NORTH CAROLINA STATE .
UH THE REASON I SAID THAT BECAUSE I VE HAD ABOUT UH THREE CALLS AND MY DAUGHTER HAD ONE TOO FROM DIFFERENT STUDENTS OUT OF NORTH CAROLINA I GUESS THEY PASS THE NAMES AMONGST YOUR COMPUTER STUDENTS OR WHATEVER .
YEAH I THINK I WAS THE ONE WHO DID THAT ACTUALLY .
OH IS THAT RI GREAT GREAT .
YEAH I HAD A UH I TEACH A COURSE IN VOICE I O SYSTEMS .
OH IS THAT RIGHT THAT S WONDERFUL .
SO I KNOW UH YOU KNOW I KNOW ABOUT THIS PROJECT SO I GOT MY STUDENTS TO SIGN UP AND UH APPARENTLY A NUMBER OF THEM HAVE BEEN PARTICIPATING .
OH YEAH I TALKED TO ONE WE RE NOT ON THE SUBJECT OF COURSE I TALKED TO ONE I THINK HE HAD A WHOLE BUNCH OF CALLS HE HAD A ROOMMATE THAT HAD CALLS AND EVERYTHING .
UHHUH .
HE HAD WAY MORE TWICE AS MANY CALLS AS AS I VE MADE UH AND I I M OF COURSE WE AT T I JUST HOPING IT WORKS OUT THAT THE NEW PRODUCTS THAT THEY COME OUT WILL UH SELL LIKE GANG BOOKS BU BUSTERS REALLY .
YEAH .
OKAY YOU FIRST ON THE SUBJECT WHA WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT LATIN AMERICA .
UH LET S SEE THE SUBJECT IS LATIN AMERICA .
LATIN AMERICA YEAH .
I DO NT KNOW WHETHER I HAVE ANY REAL PROFOUND THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT I ACTUALLY WA WAS PLANNING A TRIP TO LATIN AMERICA AND I GOT WARNED OFF BY SOME PEOPLE THEY SAY PERU CA NT BE TRAVELED TO AND THE CRIME RATE IN BRAZIL MAKES IT NOT A PLEASANT PLACE TO GO AND SO ON AND SO FORTH .
OH REALLY T I HAD A PLACE I M NOT TOO SURE I DO NT THINK THEY DO ANYMORE DOWN I THINK IT WAS CAMPINAS I M NOT SURE AND UH I GUESS WE WERE SELLING PARTS TO THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY OR WHATEVER AND THEY HAD QUITE A FEW UH LOCATIONS NOT QUITE A FEW SEVERAL IN LATIN AMERICA I THINK THE ONE IN NEW MEXICO IS CLOSED AND I THINK THE ONE IN IN BRAZIL IS CLOSED BUT I I DO NT KNOW WHY THAT IS A PROBLEM DOWN THERE AND I GUESS THE CRIME RATE IS TERRIBLE UP HERE TOO AND UH AN SOME PEOPLE SAY GO TO NEW YORK BUT I DO NT I DO NT HAVE AN ANSWER TO THE CRIME RATE IT S SAD THAT IS A SAD SITUATION I I D LIKE TO GO DOWN TO MEXICO YOU KNOW AND I KEEP HEARING THAT YOU KNOW THE GOVERNMENT AND AND THE CRIME RATES PRETTY HIGH TOO THAT THAT IS SAD .
YEAH .
UH NOT THAT WE CAN UH SELL ANY GREAT PROGRAM WE HAVE WITH CRIME BUT UH I THINK UH I M KIND OF LIKE YOU I DO NT HAVE ANY STRONG OPINIONS ON IT I GUESS MAYBE THAT S OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM WE HAVE WITH OUR OUR NEIGHBORS DOWN THERE IS THAT WE DO NT HAVE ANY WE HAVE MORE I GUESS TIES WE IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE MORE TIES TO EUROPE AND EVERYTHING AND WE DO NT REALLY ARE NT THAT CLOSE TO EVERYONE IN SOUTH AMERICA I DO NT REALLY KNOW WHY THOUGH .
YEAH I I DO NT UNDERSTAND IT EITHER ALTHOUGH I I THINK A LOT OF SOUTH AMERICANS REGARD THE UNITED STATES AS AS BULLYING AND UH THAT S CERTAINLY FROM A HISTORICAL POINT OF VIEW WOULD BE TRUE .
RIGHT .
I MEAN CERTAINLY WE TOOK FAR MORE FROM MEXICO THAN SADDAM HUSSEIN EVER DREAMED OF TAKING IN IN HIS WILDEST DREAMS FROM HIS NEIGHBORS .
RIGHT YEAH I KNOW THAT I SAW IN A BOOK I WAS READING A SPANISH BOOK UH NOT THAT I READ SPANISH YOU KNOW I JUST YOU KNOW READING SOME SPANISH WORDS AND THERE WAS A COMMENT IN THERE ABOUT THE MEXICANS DO NT REALLY WANT US TO SAY WE RE AMERICANS THEY WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT WE RE NORTH AMERICANS BECAUSE THEY RE AMERICANS TOO YOU KNOW AND I GUESS THAT S TRUE WE DO NT THINK OF ANY ONE ELSE BUT OURSEL I GUESS WE RE KIND OF UH THE SMART ASSES IN THE WORLD I SUPPOSE UH OR OF AMERICA ANYWAY WE THINK OF OURSELVES AS THE ONLY AMERICANS WHEN THEY RE AMERICANS TOO .
YEAH WELL I THINK THEY RE GOING TO HAVE THAT S A TOUGH ROW FOR THEM TO TO HOE BECAUSE I THINK MOST OF THE WORLD IS GOING TO REGARD UH CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMERICANS AND CITIZENS OF MEXICO AS MEXICANS .
AS MEXICANS YES THAT THAT .
AND THEY CAN STAND ON THEIR HEADS IF THEY WANT TOO .
BUT I DO NT THINK THAT THEY RE GOING THEY RE GOING TO CHANGE THAT AND .
NO NO I KNOW .
AND AND REALLY I MEAN NORTH AMERICANS I THINK ARE WHEN YOU SAY THAT EVEN I THI I MEAN I TEND TO THINK OF AMERICANS AND CANADIANS I JUST DO NT THINK OF MEXICANS AS BEING NORTH AMERICANS ALTHOUGH I GUESS STRICTLY SPEAKING THEY ARE .
YEAH NO I MEAN THEY WERE SAYING THAT OF US THAT WE RE THE NORTH AMERICANS AND THEY RE AMERICANS THEY THEY WE ALWAYS SAY WE RE AMERICANS AND THEY THEY WANT US TO SAY WE RE THE NORTH AMERICANS .
OH I SEE .
WE RE NOT AMERICANS WE RE NORTH AMERICANS AND THEY RE SOUTH AMERICANS YEAH .
I DO NT KNOW .
WHATEVER I I DO NT WANT TO MAKE I READ IT SOMEWHERE THOUGH IT S NOT MY POINT I GUESS SO .
YEAH WELL IT S IT S SO INTERESTING I JU I JUST DO NT THINK MEXICO S PROBLEMS ARE GOING TO BE CURED BY SEMANTICS .
NO NO THEY THEY WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE SOME OIL WHAT TEN YEARS AGO AN AND THEY THEY BLEW ALL THAT AND BORROWED ENOU MORE MONEY THAN THEY CAN PAY BACK NOW AND UH UH SO THEY RE NOT EXACTLY BUSINESS MEN I DO THINK WE SHOULD DEAL MORE WITH THEM I DO NT I DO HAVE A LOT OF SYMPATHY IN THAT WE RE HERE IN TEXAS UH FOR THE LANGUAGE YOU KNOW IS VERY FOOLISH I M RELATIV RELATIVELY FAMILIAR WITH TEXAS SCHOOL SYSTEM AND WE SHOULD TEACH SPANISH AT LEAST IN UH GRAMMAR SCHOOL YOU KNOW FOUR OR FIVE GRADES OF IT SO THAT WE CAN SPEAK SPANISH I THINK THAT HELPS WHEN YOU CERTAINLY CAN SPEAK THEIR LANGUAGE UH AND THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH YOU KNOW THE WET BACK PROBLEM YOU KNOW FOR EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT WE RE TALKING ABOUT WHE SAY WET BACK PROBLEM AND THEN WE SHOULD SOMEHOW UH AND I THINK THE GOVERNMENTS ARE WORKING ON THAT TO TRY TO HAVE SOME UH BUSINESSES UH AT THE BORDERS OF BOTH SIDES SO THAT YOU CAN YOU DO NT HAVE THIS PROBLEM OF THEM TRYING TO COME UP HERE AN TO TO GET THE JOBS YOU KNOW THERE THERE MAY BE SOME ORGANIZED WAY TO DO THIS .
YEAH .
I I DO FEEL FOR THEM UH THEY ARE VERY ENVIOUS OF US OR THEY WOULD NT BE COMING UP HERE YOU KNOW RISKING A LOT NOT THAT THEY RE RISKING THEIR LIVES OF COURSE BUT RISKING A LOT UH GETTING THROWN BACK I GUESS IS ALL THAT UH HAPPENS .
YEAH .
YOU PROBABLY DO NT SEE THAT WHERE WE SEE IT YOU KNOW ONCE A MONTH I M SURE IN SAN ANTONIO THEY SEE IT MORE OFTEN THAN THAT .
WELL I GREW UP IN LOS ANGELES .
OKAY WELL YOU SEE IT SAW IT OUT THERE THEN TOO .
AND UH IN FACT I DROVE A CAB WHEN I WAS A GRADUATE STUDENT SO I I KNEW UH THE HISPANIC PART OF L A PRETTY WELL .
UHHUH .
AND CERTAINLY YOU KNOW KNEW THAT PROBLEM KNEW YOU KNOW KNEW ABOUT APARTMENT HOUSES THAT WOULD HAVE EIGHT OR TEN OR TWELVE PEOPLE LIVING IN THEM SLEEPING IN THE SAME BED IN SHIFTS AND ALL THAT .
YEAH .
AND UH IT WAS IT WAS PRETTY WILD .
I THINK A A COMMON FACTOR TO A LOT OF PROBLEMS BOTH WHETHER IT BE CRIME IF IF YOU WANT TO JUMP ON THAT IS MOSTLY UH POVERTY UH AND I THINK A LOT OF THEIR PROBLEMS IS POVERTY IF WE COULD UH UH THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE YO KNO IN THIS COUNTRY IS IS A LOT OF IT S POVERTY WHETHER IT S THE PEOPLE ARE NT TRYING HARD ENOUGH TO GET OUT OF POVERTY I THAT S ANOTHER STORY BUT UH UH IT IS SAD THERE THERE S SO MUCH DOWN IN ALL OF SOUTH AMERICA UH SO MUCH POTENTIAL YOU KNOW WE RE T I OF COURSE IS IS REALLY PUSHING WORLD MARKETS IN THEIR PRODUCTS AND THEY RE THEY RE MOSTLY IN IN EUROPE NOW AND IN IN IN THE ORIENT JAPAN AND SINGAPORE NOW JUST ANNOUNCED BUILDING A PLANT IN SINGAPORE UH THEY RE IN TAIWAN AND JAPAN AND THEY RE THEY HAVE NT HAD WHAT THAT MUCH LUCK IN SOUTH AMERICA AND THERE S GOT TO BE A LOT OF POTENTIAL FOR BUSINESS DOWN THERE FOR THE PRODUCTS CERTAINLY THAT WE MAKE AND EVERYTHING .
YEAH .
AND THERE S GOT TO BE TRADE I GUESS THAT S SOME OF THE ANSWER I GUESS IS BUSINESS UH UH AND I TRY TO BE AN OPTIMIST AND SAY WELL THAT THAT S ONE WAY IS TO HELP ANY PROBLEM WHETHER IT BE CRIME OR CERTAINLY POVERTY OBVIOUSLY IS TO IS TO GET SOME BUSINESS GOING BETWEEN EACH OTHER AND WE NEED WE NEED TO DO MORE OF THAT UH SOMEHOW AND ENCOURAGE MORE BUSINESS .
YEAH .
BETWEEN US .
YEAH .
THEY VE GOT TO HAVE A LOT OF RESOURCES I WOULD THINK AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF OF WELL POTENTIAL THAT WAY A LOT OF IT OF COURSE IS HOT AND JUNGLE AND ALL THAT BUT UH THERE S GOT TO BE A LOT OF POTENTIAL DOWN THERE .
YEAH UH .
WHA WHAT ARE YOU TAKING IN SCHOOL .
I M SORRY .
I DID NT ASK YOU THAT WHAT ARE YOU TAKING IN SCHOOL .
WELL I AM ACTUALLY .
OH YO YOU RE AN INSTRUCTOR .
YEAH .
YEAH YOU RE AN INSTRUCTOR YEAH YOU SAID .
YEAH I M THE I M THE TEACHER I GIVE AS IT WERE .
THAT S GREAT ARE YOU TEACHING COMPUTER SCIENCE WHA YOU SAID WHAT WERE YOU SAYING YOU WERE TEACHING THERE .
YEAH I M IN COMPUTER SCIENCE AND .
GREAT GREAT .
UH VERY INTERESTED IN VOICE SYSTEMS AND IN SPEECH RECOGNITION BUT OF COURSE THIS PROJECT IS REALLY ONE TO COLLECT A DATA BASE OF OF UH OF CASUAL SPEECH UH IN AN ATTEMPT TO GET SOME KIND OF A MODEL OF WHAT SPEECH IS LIKE .
RIGHT I OF COURSE I WORK AT T I AND I M A LITTLE PUZZLED AS TO WHY WHEN THEY GET MY VOICE ONE TIME WHY THAT IS NT ENOUGH I MEAN I M I M I M GETTING A KICK OUT OF THE WHOLE PROGRAM BUT UH THERE S GOING TO BE I GUESS THOUSANDS I DO NT KNOW HOW MANY THOUSANDS OR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF THESE RECORDINGS AND I WONDER HOW THEY RE GOING TO ANALYZE THEM WHETHER IT WOULD BE LISTENING TO THEM OR ANALYZING I GU THEY VE GOT TO BE ANALYZING WITH A A VOICE RECORDER SOME HOW .
YEAH WELL THEY RECORD THESE AND THEN SOMEBODY TRANSCRIBES THEM SO THAT THEY .
UHHUH .
THEY HAVE UH THEY HAVE A SPEECH SIGNAL AND WHAT AND WHAT IS SAID .
RIGHT .
AND THEY HAVE A THEY RE ABLE TO AVERAGE IT OVER A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT OCCASIONS BECAUSE PEOPLES VOICES CHANGE A LOT EVEN FROM MORNING TO EVENING AND THAT S UH A BIG PROBLEM IN SPEECH RECOGNITION .
OH YES I KNOW THEY CHANGE WITH AGE I KNOW MINE CHANGES UH HAS CHANGED UH ALTHOUGH YOU YOU NEVER FOUND YOUR YOUR VOICE ECHOES IN YOUR OWN HEAD WHICH IS MAKES IT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT IT REALLY SOUNDS TO OTHER PEOPLE .
YEAH .

NO .
BUT UH OH I WATCH THINGS LIKE UH SIXTY MINUTES .
UHHUH .
EVERY WEEK UH UGH IT S KIND OF TOUGH TO THINK OF SOME OF THE OTHERS ALTHOUGH I DO WATCH SOME OF SOME OF THOSE FRIVOLOUS THINGS UH .
LIKE ON THURSDAY NIGHTS AT NINE OCLOCK WHEN I GET HOME FROM AEROBICS I WILL WATCH UH KNOTS LANDING .
OH YOU WILL .
YEAH JUST SOMETHING LIKE THAT FOR YOU KNOW UH END OF THE EVENING TYPE OF THING .
RELAX .
BUT UH HOW ABOUT YOU .
WELL I WATCH UM I LIKE NEWS PROGRAMS LIKE YOU MENTIONED AND SOMETIMES I WILL WATCH UM LIKE THE CABLE NEWS NETWORK EVENING NEWS PROGRAM .

UHHUH .
AND OH YOU KNOW I LL JUST SHORT OF HAVE IT ON SOMETIMES TO JUST SORT OF PICK UP LITTLE TIDBITS FROM THOSE I DO NT SIT AND WATCH THEM BUT BUT I ENJOY SOME OF IT AND ESPECIALLY IF I M UH COOKING ON A SATURDAY EVENING OR SOMETHING .
AND ONE OF THOSE IS ON IT KIND OF INSPIRES ME .
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA I NOTICE THAT UM SINCE WE MOVED HERE THAT WE WE DID GET THE CABLE T V AND WHEN THE NEWSPAPER COMES OUT ON SUNDAY I SOMETIMES READ THROUGH THE MOVIES THAT WILL BE LISTED .
UHHUH .
AND I RECORD SOME AND THEN UH WE HAVE JUST TOTALLY CUT DOWN AND WE NEVER GO TO LIKE A VIDEO TAPE RENTAL ANYMORE BECAUSE THERE S ALWAYS PLENTY OF THINGS THAT WE CAN RECORD AND THEN .
YEAH .
AND WATCH AND THEN RECORD OVER IT SOMETHING ELSE AND SO THAT S BEEN REALLY NICE BECAUSE IF YOU DECIDE ONE EVENING YOU WOULD LIKE TO STAY HOME AND HAVE A QUIET EVENING AND WATCH A MOVIE THEN YOU HAVE TWO OR THREE SAVED .
YEAH WE DO SOME OF THAT .
IN FACT I PROBABLY AM MORE INTERESTED IN WATCHING SOME OF THE MOVIES THAT ARE ON T V .
UHHUH .
THAN YOU KNOW OTHER KINDS OF THINGS .
WELL THAT S PROBABLY WHAT I WATCH MOST FREQUENTLY BESIDES LIKE NEWS PROGRAMS IS THE MOVIES AND THEY HAVE A COUPLE OF CHANNELS THAT ARE LIKE NOSTALGIC OLDER MOVIES .
YES .
THAT I HAVE REALLY ENJOYED THAT I M SEEING FOR THE FIRST TIME .
YEAH .
LIKE THE MARX BROTHERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
YEAH THOSE ARE PRETTY GOOD I I LIKE THOSE OLD ONES .
UHHUH .
MUCH BETTER THAN SOME OF THE NEW STUFF .
RIGHT AND SO WE WE HAVE REALLY ENJOYED THAT AND IT S REALLY NICE NOT TO BE RUNNING OUT SOME OF THE VIDEO RENTALS CAN BE EXPENSIVE AND .
YEAH AND BOY THE MOVIE CAN BE UNBELIEVABLE .
UHHUH RIGHT GOING AND PAYING SIX DOLLARS FOR A TICKET FOR ONE PERSON AT THE THEATER OR SOMETHING SO WE I HAVE AND IT S SO CONVENIENT AT HOME AND YOU CAN DO IT ANYTIME Y YOU TAKE THE NOTION .
YEAH .
AND SO I HAVE REALLY ENJOYED THAT BUT BUT THERE ARE I DO HAVE FRIENDS THAT WATCH PROGRAMS LIKE THEY WANT TO SEE A PARTICULAR PROGRAM AND THEY ARE EITHER HOME WATCHING IT OR DEFINITELY RECORDING IT THEY HAVE SOME PROGRAMS THAT THEY WO NT MISS .
UHHUH I M NOT THAT HUNG UP TO MOST THINGS .
I MEAN IF I MISS SOMETHING BIG DEAL .
YES WELL AND THINGS ARE REPEATED .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
SO OFTEN THAT YOU KNOW IF IF I HAVE SEEN JUST A PROGRAM ONCE CHANCES ARE IT LL BE THAT EXACT SAME SHOW .
YEAH .
IF I EVER DECIDE TO TUNE IT IN AGAIN .
YEAH .
THE ONLY ONE I VE EVER SEEN AND IT LL BE SHOWING AGAIN PRETTY FUNNY .
YEAH .
BUT UH T V IS SOMETHING THAT WE TRY AN TO NOT UM DELIBERATELY TRY NOT TO GET HUNG UP ON IT .
YEAH .
LIKE YOU SAY .
WE DO TOO TOO MANY OTHER THINGS TO DO AND TOO MUCH GOING ON .
UHHUH AND WE DO NT WANT OUR KIDS TO TO GROW UP THINKING THAT THAT S WHAT YOU DO WITH YOUR .
RIGHT .
SPARE TIME .
RIGHT I AGREE .
SO IT S A LITTLE BIT SOMETHING THAT WE TRY DOING AND THERE S THERE S A LOT OF GOOD CHILDREN S PROGRAMS THAT YOU COULD WATCH THEY COULD WATCH SEVERAL HOURS EVERY DAY .
UHHUH .
AND YOU COULD SAY OH THAT S A GOOD PROGRAM FOR THEM BECAUSE IT S EDUCATIONAL BUT STILL YOU WANT THEM TO GO OUT AND DO OTHER THINGS EVEN IF THEY RE .
RIGHT .
GOOD PROGRAMS YOU DO NT WANT THEM SITTING THERE WATCHING THEM .
YEAH .
ANYWAY WELL .
OKAY WELL WE PROBABLY EXHAUSTED THAT HUH .
YEAH THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD I I LIKE THAT AND UM I GUESS IT S TIME TO GO .
OKAY I ENJOYED TALKING TO YOU .
YES NICE TO HAVE SPOKEN WITH YOU TOO .
OKAY .
BYEBYE .
GOODBYE .
UH TELL YOU WHAT UM I LL LET YOU START .
OKAY MY MAJOR SOURCE OF INFORMATION I GUESS IS T V NEWS EXCUSE ME I UH WAKE UP TO IT IN THE MORNING THIS IS MY I GUESS MY PRIME TIME FOR NEWS FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHILE I M GETTING READY TO GO TO WORK OH I QUITE FREQUENTLY GLANCE THROUGH HEADLINES OR IN THE NEWSPAPER BUT UH PRIMARILY MINE IS T V NEWS HOW ABOUT YOURSELF .
YEAH I HAVE TO HAVE TO AGREE WITH YOU UM I NORMALLY DO NT HAVE TIME IN THE MORNING TO TO WATCH ANY TYPE OF T V USUALLY CATCH IT GOING TO WORK ON THE RADIO OR WHEN I DRAG THE PAPER IN FROM THE FRONT AND IT MUMBLEX CATCH THE HEAD LINES WHICH IS NORMAL WHAT YOU SEE THE NIGHT BEFORE ON THE EVENING NEWS .
HUHUH TRUE .
SO I VE I VE KIND OF WE HAVE A ONE YEAR OLD IN THE HOUSE SO IT S KIND OF HARD SOMETIMES TO WATCH T V DURING THE NIGHT BUT I USUALLY TRY TO CATCH THE TEN OCLOCK OR UM .
HUHUH .
THOSE TYPE OF MUMBLEX I HAVE TO SAY DURING THE WAR WE RE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WAS PROBABLY FLOODED WITH TOO MUCH INFORMATION AND AS FAR AS THE SUB QUESTION ABOUT THE WAS AM I SATISFACTORILY COVERED I HAVE TO SAY YES BUT WHEN IT CAME TO THE WAR ISSUES WHO S TELLING THE TRUTH BETWEEN THE CHANNELS THERE WAS UH THE CASUALTIES THE AMOUNT OF MISSILES LAUNCHED WERE DIFFERENT AND IT WAS ALMOST TOO MUCH INFORMATION OVER COMMUNICATED .
WELL THAT S TRUE BUT I MY PERSONAL OPINION IS THAT THE VARIOUS NETWORK NEWS MEDIAS WERE TRYING TO INTERPRET THE NEWS TO THE BEST OF THEIR ABILITIES SINCE THEY WERE NOT VERY WELL INFORMED BY THE MILITARY .
TRUE I AGREE WITH YOU .
NOW I CAN APPRECIATE THAT ESPECIALLY AFTER WHAT HAPPENED IN VIETNAM .
YEAH WHICH IS A JOKE .
UH LET S FACE IT TODAY S UH MEANS OF COMMUNICATION WE COULD A NEWSCASTER COULD VERY WELL GIVEAWAY A PIECE OF TOP SECRET INFORMATION .
HUHUH .
AND UH PAT HIMSELF ON THE BACK FOR FOR UH MAKING A GOOD SCOOP .
YEAH THAT S A GOOD POINT UM BUT I WOULD HAVE TO SAY ACROSSTHEBOARD I M SATISFIED WITH THE WAY UH THE NEWS IS SPREAD UM OF COURSE HERE AT TEXAS INSTRUMENTS UH THE RUMOR MILL RUNS RAMPANT THE SECRETARY S PROBABLY THE BEST RESOURCE .
OF WHAT THE LAYOFF STATUS IS .
VERY TRUE I FIND TNEWS VERY ENLIGHTENING TOO .
YEAH .
AND I CHECK THAT EVERYDAY OF COURSE WITH THAT GOES ALONG WITH THE STOCK PRICE OF T I .
YEAH I AGREE YOU I THINK I M GLAD YOU MENTIONED THAT BECAUSE I THINK I HAVE TO SINCE I DO NT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY IN THE MORNING I LL PROBABLY CATCH THE HEAD LINES ON TNEWS THAT S A GOOD POINT .
OF COURSE TNEWS IS MORE OR LESS HEADLINES .
HUHUH .
UH I DO NT THINK MUCH OF THEIR SPORTS COVERAGE .
YEAH TRUE KIND OF .
ONLY GIVE THE SCORES .
YEAH .
BUT UH THAT S ALL RIGHT I M NOT OUTSIDE OF PRO FOOTBALL I M NOT TOO INTERESTED IN OTHER GAMES OTHER SPORTS ANYWAY .
HUHUH .
BUT THE UH TNEWS IS A GOOD WAY TO KEEP UPTODATE I THINK THEY DO A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF SELECTING THE MOST IMPORTANT ITEMS .
YEAH THEY DO SURELY DO UH ANYTHING ELSE CROSSED YOUR MIND I GUESS MOST OF US GO BY THE AUDIO WHICH IS THE TELEVISION OR THE RADIO .
HUHUH .
UM BUT YOU NEED TO CONTINUE TO READ SO YOU PEOPLE LEARN TO READ YOU KNOW .
WELL I SPENT TWENTY YEARS IN PROFESSION COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING MUMBLEX RADIO AND T V AND I KNOW WHAT IT TAKES TO GET SOME OF THOSE LITTLE BITS AND PIECES OF NEWS ON THE AIR .
HUHUH .
I MEAN THERE THERE ARE TIMES WHERE UH THE REPORTER ACTUALLY WILL RISK IS LIFE LIFE AND LIMB I VE SEEN IT HAPPEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN AND UH WELL I REMEMBER ONE TIME UP IN NASHVILLE TENNESSEE ONE OF THE FELLOWS GOT MIXED UP IN A RIOT THAT WAS GOING ON DOWN THERE .
HUHUH .
BUT HE WAS LUCKY HE GOT OUT OF IT FOR SOME REASON BECAUSE HE WAS CARRYING A CAMERA UH THEY LEFT HIM ALONE .
OUCH EVERYBODY GOT EXCITED .
HUHUH .
THAT S TOUGH THAT S TOUGH WELL I VE ENJOYED SPEAKING WITH YOU .
NICE TO TALK TO YOU TOO JIM .
DID YOU GET YOUR CATALOG ON YOUR YOUR GIFTS .
NO .
REALLY I JUST GOT MINE IN THE MAIL SO IT KIND OF SPARKED ME TO KEEP CALLING .

IS THAT RIGHT .
YEAH .
WELL GOOD .
HAVE A GREAT DAY .
YOU TOO .
BYEBYE .
HUH .
OKAY .
I DO NT KNOW HOW MUCH I KNOW ABOUT THIS SUBJECT .
WELL I DO NT KNOW IF I KNOW ANYTHING OR NOT .
YEAH .
BUT I VE I VE GOT SOME OPINIONS ON IT .
OKAY .
GO AHEAD .
SEE THOSE TYPE OF PEOPLE .
THAT THAT HAVE THE MOST OPINIONS ONES .
THAT DO NT KNOW ANYTHING .
YEAH .
WELL UH I VE HAD TEENAGERS AND I NOW HAVE GRANDCHILDREN .
THAT ARE TEENAGERS AND I DO NT KNOW THAT IT MIGHT DO THEM .
A LITTLE BIT OF GOOD TO SEE THE WORLD FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE .
UH I THINK THIS ME GENERATION HAS GONE FAR TOO FAR .
AND THE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE OVERLY IMPRESSED .
AND I THINK IT WOULD NT HURT THEM TO STEP BACK FROM THEMSELVES JUST SLIGHTLY AND SEE THINGS FROM A M FAR MORE DISADVANTAGED VIEWPOINT .
THAT S TRUE .
UH I PERSONALLY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE PEACE CORPS THOUGH .
UM ME EITHER .
I I WENT TO COLLEGE AND THEN STARTED WORKING AND THEN GOT MARRIED AND .
BUT THEY HAVE I READ SOMEWHERE AND I M I M OUT ON A LIMB HERE SOME TYPE OF COLLEGE UH VOLUNTEER WORK FOR TEACHERS THAT THEY ARE STRAIGHT OUT OF COLLEGE AND THEY DO ONE YEAR OF VOLUNTEER WORK TEACHING IN THE UH LOWER INCOME BRACKETS OF THE UNITED STATES .
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD ABOUT THAT ONE .
NO I HAVE NT I KNOW THAT UH MY SISTER I HAVE A TWIN SISTER AND WHEN THEY GRADUATED SHE WENT TO UH TEACH IN A SMALL TOWN DOWN IN SOUTH TEXAS AND I KNOW THAT LIKE IF YOU HAVE COLLEGE NOTES IF YOU TEACH IN A LOWER INCOME BRACKET WHERE THEY DO NT PAY AS MUCH AND THEY CANCEL PART OF YOUR YOU KNOW YOUR COLLEGE NOTE OR WHATEVER .
OH REALLY .
UHHUH .
IF IT S LIKE YOU KNOW REALLY A YOU KNOW A LOWER PAYING JOB YOU KNOW WHERE IN A SMALL TOWN .
YOU DO NT OBVIOUSLY YOU DO NT NEED AS MUCH AS FAR AS TO YOU KNOW TO LIVE .
AND THIS IS MONEY THAT SHE S BORROWED TO FORM HER COLLEGE EDUCATION .
YEAH SHE ONLY TAUGHT THERE ONE YEAR BUT I .
BUT SHE GOT CREDITS FOR IT .
UHHUH .
THAT S VERY INTERESTING .
AND UM I THINK IT WOULD BE I KNOW THAT ALSO ONE OF MY COUSINS .
WHO UH HE IS IN LIKE THE THERAPY TYPE THING AND HE WAS UM SOME GROUP PAID PART OF HIS COLLEGE INCOME BUT THEN HE WAS REQUIRED TO GO BACK AND WORK FOR A CERTAIN NUMBER OF YEARS IN THIS TOWN AT UH UH I MEAN IT S A NURSING HOME OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
HUH .
SO YOU KNOW IF I THINK THAT S A GOOD WAY FOR PEOPLE TO YOU KNOW MAYBE GET PEOPLE TO COME BACK TO THESE SMALL TOWNS TO WORK BY HELPING PEOPLE .
THAT NORMALLY MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO GO TO COLLEGE AND GET THE TYPE OF DEGREE .
THEY WANT .
YEAH I THINK THAT IS AN EXCELLENT PROGRAM I REALLY DO .
I LIKE THAT .
AND IT S IT S BENEFICIAL TO THE SMALL TOWNS TOO BECAUSE .
YEAH .
THEY REALLY REALLY HAVE HAVE A DISADVANTAGE THAT WE WOULD NT UNDERSTAND BECAUSE WE RE IN THE METROPLEX .
AS FAR AS GE YEAH GETTING DOCTORS AND ALL THAT STUFF YEAH .
RIGHT YOU KNOW IF IF WE HAD SOME REALLY MAJOR HEALTH PROBLEM .
THAT REQUIRED A SPECIALIST WE COULD FIND ONE .
IT WOULD NT BE CONVENIENT .
YEAH .
BUT WE COULD FIND ONE .
UHHUH .
WE WOULD NT HAVE TO DRIVE AND SPEND THE NIGHT SOMEPLACE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
YEAH .
SO I I CAN SEE THE ADVANTAGE TO THAT ONE .
THE PEACE CORPS ITSELF IS REALLY A UH DYING OUT IS NT IT .
I REALLY DO NT KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT IT YOU KNOW I I I THINK OF THE PEACE CORPS YOU KNOW MORE LIKE THE SIXTIES AND THAT KIND OF STUFF WHEN .
IT S STILL IN EXISTENCE .
YEAH .
AND DO NT THEY GO INTO OTHER COUNTRIES AND STUFF .
I WANT TO BELIEVE THEY GO INTO OTHER COUNTRIES AND TEACH THEM HOW TO DO THINGS LIKE FARM .
UHHUH .
UH DIG THEIR OWN WELLS SET UP .
THINGS .
THAT MAKE THE YEAH .
THEIR SCHOOLS .
MAKE THEM MORE SELFSUPPORTING .
YES .
THEY .
YEAH .
IT S NOT A PROGRAM TO TEACH THEM TO USE THE AMERICAN MONEY IT S A PROGRAM TO TEACH THEM TO BE MORE SELFRELIANT .
RIGHT .
YEAH .
AND YES YOU RE RIGHT I THINK IT S A SIXTIES PROGRAM .
I THINK IT WAS ONE OF KENNEDY S HOT POINTS THAT HE THAT WAS HIS BIG DEAL .
BUT IT DEFINITELY WOULD GIVE A LOT OF THE KIDS NOW THAT HAVE EVERYTHING GIVEN TO THEM THAT THEY WANT TO SEE WHAT .
IT S LIKE IF YOU DO NT HAVE ALL THE MONEY AND CA NT HAVE WHAT .
YOU WANT WHEN YOU WANT IT .
RIGHT .
RIGHT .
UM I THINK I I VE SINGLED OUT MY GRANDCHILDREN AND BUT ACTUALLY THEY RE THEY RE PRETTY GOOD .
UHHUH .
ALONG THOSE LINES AS COMPARED TO WHAT .
I HAVE SEEN FROM OTHER PEOPLE S CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN MINE ARE NT REALLY THAT BAD BUT AT THE SAME TIME .
I THINK IT WOULD DO THEM .
A WORLD OF GOOD .
YEAH .
BUT THERE S A .
I DO NT I DO NT KNOW THAT YOU COULD REQUIRE EVERYONE TO .
MANDATORY JUST LIKE .
DO THAT FOR YEAH .
LIKE THE DRAFT .
TO DO IT FOR A WHOLE YEAR .
NO .
OR TWO YEARS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I DO NT KNOW THAT THAT WOULD WORK IF .
EVERY TIME .
YOU .
SOMEBODY S WAS DID NT REALLY WANT TO BE THERE AND DID NT HAVE .
THEY COULD BUY THEIR WAY OUT .
YEAH I MEAN THERE WOULD BE LOOPHOLES JUST LIKE THERE IS IN ANYTHING ELSE .
RIGHT YOU KNOW THEY THEY D FIGURE A WAY AROUND THAT ONE IN A HEARTBEAT .
BUT I M WONDERING IF THERE S ANOTHER ISSUE HERE AND MAYBE THIS IS WHY THIS HAS DIED OUT .
CAN YOU GO INTO AND THIS WAS NT .
THE QUESTION BUT IT S IT MAY BE THE MORE OF THE ISSUE VERSUS SHOULD YOUNG ADULTS CAN THEY GO IN THERE AND CAN ANYONE GO INTO WELL OUT OF THE KURDISH COMMUNITY IS A LITTLE BIT EXTREME AT THIS TIME BUT SAY I THINK BANGLADESH WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD EXAMPLE OR SOME SOME REALLY DESPERATE SITUATION AND TEACH THEM TO FARM AND TEACH THEM AND IT DOES NT DO ANY GOOD .
YEAH .
I DO NT KNOW THAT IT DOES .
I I .
YEAH .
DO NT KNOW THAT UM IF YOU STEP BACK FROM THE CURRENT ISSUE AND LOOK AT IT MORE INTELLECTUALLY THERE ARE FOREVER OVER AS LONG AS WE KNOW THERE ARE RACES OF PEOPLE .
THAT ARE DROPPING OUT .
YOU KNOW WE RE LOSING CERTAIN .
UHHUH .
RACES OF PEOPLE .
THERE ARE PEOPLE NOW THAT ARE OBSOLETE POINT AND FACT JUST JUST LIKE ENDANGERED SPECIES OF ANIMALS SO THERE ARE QUOTE TRIBES OF PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
THAT ARE ENDANGERED OR OBSOLETE .
AND I M JUST WONDERING IF YOU RE FIGHTING A NATURAL PROCESS THERE OF BEING WINNOWED OUT .
THERE S A GERMAN WORD FOR IT .
THAT S ELEGANT BUT I NEVER CAN REMEMBER WHAT .
IT WAS UH BUT BUT THAT THEY RE THEY RE BEING WINNOWED BECAUSE THEY RE WHERE THEY ARE THEY RE NOT ADAPTED TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT ESSENTIALLY .
RIGHT YEAH .
UM AND ONE OF THE QUICK EXAMPLES IS THE ABORIGINES .
YEAH UHHUH .
UH WHEN WE WERE IN AUSTRALIA UH SAD LITTLE THINGS .
UH I FELT SORRY FOR THEM .
BECAUSE THEIR SOCIETY IS NT THERE ANYMORE AND THEIR BELIEF SYSTEM AND A ALL THEIR STRUCTURED OF THEIRS ALL THE STRUCTURES OF THEIR SOCIETY ARE GONE ESSENTIALLY .
YEAH .
AND THEY RE JUST KIND OF MORE LIKE A SIDE SHOW THAN ANYTHING ELSE AND THAT S SAD .
YEAH .
BUT I DO NT THINK THERE S ANY WAY .
YOU COULD GO UH THE PEACE CORPS COULD GO IN AND RESCUE THOSE PEOPLE AND I DO NT THINK YOU COULD HAVE DONE IT .
FIFTY OR A HUNDRED YEARS AGO EITHER .
YEAH .
SO I I M WONDERING IF THE PEACE CORPS IS .
WELL .
REALLY AN EFFECTIVE TOOL .
DOWN HERE WITH THE PEACE CORPS WE RE TALKING ABOUT ALL THESE PEOPLE .
THAT ARE NT EVEN IN OUR OWN COUNTRY WHEN THERE S ENOUGH PEOPLE HERE THAT I THINK PROBABLY NEED HELP AND .
GOOD POINT .
COULD BE HELPED .
WE VE GOT ENOUGH WITHOUT LEA WITHOUT A PASSPORT .
THERE S PLENTY .
YEAH .
YES .
I THINK WE OUGHT TO WORRY ABOUT OUR OWN SPECIES .
AND MAYBE RATHER THAN JUST REQUIRE SOMEBODY TO JOIN LIKE THE PEACE CORPS FOR A YEAR MAYBE LIKE UM DURING COLLEGE YOU KNOW MAYBE HAVE SOME KIND OF COURSE WHERE THEY D BE REQUIRED TO DO SOME KIND OF COMMUNITY SERVICE TYPE WORK AND HELP PEOPLE IN THAT AREA OR PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES .
I WONDER NOW IN AND I VE BEEN OUT OF SCHOOL TOO LONG TO ANSWER THIS BUT I WONDER IF THERE ARE NT SOME SOCIOLOGY COURSES .
THERE PROBABLY ARE YOU KNOW FOR BUT I M SURE THAT S PROBABLY LIKE PEOPLE .
THAT DO THAT ARE ARE THE PEOPLE .
THAT ARE GOING TO GO INTO SOCIAL WORK AND STUFF BUT I THINK THAT IT WOULD NT REALLY BE HALF BAD FOR EVERYBODY NOT TO DO SOMETHING YOU KNOW AND REALIZE IT S EVERYBODY .
S RESPONSIBILITY TO UM HELP THESE PEOPLE YOU KNOW AND NO I M NOT SAYING JUST GIVE THEM .
MONEY BUT I MEAN BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE TAUGHT TO BE .
THAT S THE LAST THING .
YOU WANT .
YEAH .
TO DO .
I MEAN I KNOW THAT S WHAT .
MY FATHERINLAW WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GIVE THESE PEOPLE MONEY OR WHAT WAS IT .
THEY WERE BRINGING UP POINTS ASKING AS FAR AS WHETHER THEY NEED TO GIVE UM MORE MONEY TO THESE PEOPLE I MEAN AND THAT S NOT REALLY THE ANSWER I MEAN BECAUSE IF THEY RE ALCOHOLICS THEY LL JUST GO OUT AND SPEND .
YEAH THAT S EXACTLY IT .
IT ON YOU KNOW BOOZE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT .
THEY RE NOT GOING TO TAKE THAT MONEY .
YOU GIVE THEM AND GO TRY TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO DRY OUT WITH IT .
NOW COME ON LET S BE REALISTIC .
YEAH .
THAT S JUST NOT REALISTIC .
OR YOU KNOW TO FIND A JOB WHERE THEY CAN LEARN HOW TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES .
RIGHT .
I MEAN I GUESS WE RE GETTING KIND OF OFF THE SUBJECT HERE BUT .
NO WE RE NOT I DO NT THINK .
I THINK .
YEAH I MEAN IT S .
THAT S MORE REALISTIC THAN GOIN MAKING THEM GO IN THE PEACE CORPS .
TRUE .
YEAH .
I THINK THAT S A LOT MORE REALISTIC .
UH I I THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE SPENDING MORE TIME AND AND AGAIN I DO NT THINK THE THE PEACE CORPS IS IS AS SUCCESSFUL NOW SIMPLY BECAUSE IT S NOT .
IT DOES NT FIT THE CIRCUMSTANCE ANYMORE .
YEAH .
UH WE VE GOT PLENTY IN FACT WE VE GOT FAR TOO MANY .
YOU RE IN UH WHAT .
R FLOWER MOUND .
FLOWER MOUND YEAH .
SO WE RE A LITTLE FA YOU KNOW FARTHER REMOVED FROM LIKE DALLAS AND SOME OF THE AREAS WHERE THEY PROBABLY HAVE MORE OF THE HOMELESS AND THAT TYPE OF THING .
I WAS THAT S EXACTLY WHAT .
I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU .
HAVE YOU EVER HAVE HAVE YOU BEEN DOWNTOWN RECENT .
OKAY .
WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO SOMETHING .
NO I HAD TO PRESS ONE .
GOOD .
UH LET S SEE SO UH WERE WE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE EAST .
SURE .
SHOULD WE HAVE BEEN THERE .
UHHUH .
DID WE DO WHAT WAS CORRECT THERE .
I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE STAYED LONGER .
SHOULD WE HAVE FOUGHT THEM HARDER USED MORE WEAPONS EQUAL TO THEIR CHEMICAL WEAPONS THAT WERE NT USED .
UH I THINK WHAT WE DID WAS GOOD BUT I THINK WE JUST SHOULD HAVE STAYED THERE LONGER AND CONTINUED DOING WHAT WE DID DO .
OH YOU AGREE WITH SCHWARTZKOPF WHO SAYS UH DRIVE ON INTO BAGHDAD .
YEAH I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE STAYED AND KIND OF HELPED THE PEOPLE IN IRAQ OUT NOW BECAUSE IT S KIND OF LIKE A CIVIL WAR GOING ON NOW AND IT S ALMOST LIKE THEY RE KILLING EACH OTHER OFF AND THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE ANYTHING LEFT OF IRAQ AT ALL .
WOULD THAT BE SO BAD WAS THERE ANYTHING THERE TO BEGIN WITH .
WELL I THINK I DO NT THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD IF WE WERE TO COMPLETELY LOSE IT UM .
IT WAS NT OURS .
WELL NO I JUST MEAN THAT THAT THE WORLD IN GENERAL .
WE VE GOT TO TALK SO IT S JUST JUST AS WELL WE ARGUE .
YEAH UM I DO NT KNOW I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE HELPED THE THE INNOCENT PEOPLE IN IRAQ OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE .
I AGREE .
THAN RATHER THAN JUST QUITTING WHERE WE DID .
WOULD NT IT HAVE BEEN WONDERFUL IF WE COULD HAVE FREED THE COUNTRY .
YES BUT I THINK THAT S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE .
YEAH SO OTHER POLITICAL THINGS THAT S GOING ON I HEARD MISTER BUSH SAY EXCUSE ME PRESIDENT BUSH SAY THAT HE UH WANTED TO IMPROVE THE HIGHWAYS .
OH SEE I HAVE NT REALLY BEEN KEEPING UP WITH THEM SO I REALLY DO NT KNOW WHAT HE SAID .
WHAT DID HE SAY ABOUT IT .

SO I M TAKING A LITTLE BIT OF A TIME OFF FROM WORK .
GREAT I HAD I HAD A GRANDDAUGHTER .
OH CONGRATULATIONS AND SO ONE THING THAT I M VERY CONCERNED WITH NOW IS FIRST OF ALL HEALTH BENEFITS BECAUSE IT S MORE IMPORTANT WITH A FAMILY .
RIGHT .
AND YOU KNOW OUR DOCTOR S VI ROUTINE DOCTOR S VISITS COVERED MY HEALTH INSURANCE ONLY COVERS UM THE EMERGENCY CARE .
UHHUH DO YOU HAVE MAJOR MEDICAL BENEFITS .
RIGHT YEAH BUT I DO NT .
THAT THAT HELPS SOME IF IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOUR DEDUCTIBLE IS .
RIGHT .
HOW HIGH IT IS .
WELL MY OUR DEDUCTIBLE S FIVE HUNDRED BUT IT S FOR EACH .
EACH PERSON .
EVENT .
YEAH THAT S PRETTY HAR THAT S PRETTY HIGH .
RIGHT BUT YOU KNOW SO IT COVERS THE EMERGENCY THINGS BUT IT DOES NT COVER IF YOU GET SICK .
RIGHT .
IT DOES NT COVER .
THAT S THAT S RIGHT .
DOCTOR S VISITS THINGS LIKE THAT .
AND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IS A LOT TO COME UP WITH FOR EACH PERSON TO BE ABLE TO START USING YOUR .
OH YEAH IT CERTAINLY IS .
MAJOR MEDICAL TOO .
UH .
YEAH I KNOW WHERE MY DAUGHTER WORKS NOW SHE SHE COURSE WE LIVE IN A A RURAL SORT OF SETTING .
UHHUH .
AND WHERE SHE WORKS SHE HAS NO BENEFITS AT ALL .
WOW .
AND HER WAGE IS NOT NOT VERY GOOD .
UHHUH .
BUT IT S IT S THE TYPE OF AREA WE LIVE IN OF COURSE LIVING EXPENSES ARE NT AS BAD EITHER THOUGH WHICH MAKES A DIFFERENCE .
AND PROBABLY THE MEDICAL CARE IS LESS EXPENSIVE TOO .
WELL SHE HAS TO PAY FOR IT HERSELF .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR THEIR OWN INSURANCE BUT UH .
SO I THINK THAT IN GENERAL THE DOCTOR S FEES ARE PROBABLY LOWER THERE AND SO THE INSURANCE WOULD COST LOWER .
UH WELL FROM WHAT I VE SEEN FROM MY AUNT AND UNCLE REALLY FROM FLORIDA UP TO HERE THEY RE NOT THAT MUCH DIFFERENT .
WELL I KNOW THAT FRIENDS OF MINE HAD A BABY UP IN BOSTON .
UHHUH .
AND THEIR COSTS WERE ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT OF WHAT IT COST TO HAVE IT IN MANHATTAN .
IS THAT RIGHT .
AND THEY WERE AT ONE OF THE BETTER HOSPITALS YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
AND YOU KNOW GOOD DOCTORS IN BOSTON .
WOW THAT S A BIG DIFFERENCE .
AND I WAS AT ONE OF THE BIG HOSPITALS IN NEW YORK .
UHHUH .
BUT THAT S A HUGE DIFFERENCE JUST BETWEEN .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND IT S TWO BIG CITIES THAT I THINK OF AS SOMEWHAT COMPARABLE .
OH YEAH SHOULD BE .
SO I WAS PRETTY SHOCKED AT THAT BUT THE OTHER THING THAT I M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT AND MOST COMPANIES DO NT HAVE SOME ARE STARTING TO HAVE IS DAY CARE .
YES UHHUH .
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE REALLY NICE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE YOU KNOW SOMEONE THAT COULD WATCH MY DAUGHTER AT WORK AND I D GO TO WORK AND IF SHE WERE SICK I COULD GO DOWN AND SEE HER IF SHE NEEDS TO BE FED WHATEVER .
AND IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE CONVENIENT YEAH .
AND I .
IT WOULD BE MORE CONVENIENT TOO .
IT WOULD BE MORE CONVENIENT MORE PRODUCTIVE .
OH YEAH .
I THINK .
MY OTHER DAUGHTER WORKS AND HAS THEY HAVE TO TAKE THEIR TWO CHILDREN TO DAY CARE YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
AND UH IT IT S I DO NT KNOW HOW THEY DO IT I REALLY DO NT YOU KNOW GETTING THEM THERE AND THEN AND GOING TO WORK AND THEN PICKING THEM UP AND .
AND AND YOUR HOURS ARE .
ALL THE PREPARATIONS .
MUCH MORE CONSTRAINED AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND THAT TO ME WELL THAT YOU KNOW THOSE THREE THINGS THE HEALTH CARE VACATION AND DAY CARE .
UHHUH .
ARE PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT BENEFITS .
UHHUH .
I SUPPOSE I SHOULD BE CONCERNED WITH LIFE INSURANCE AND UH RETIREMENT PLANS BUT .
OH I DO NT KNOW I THINK THOSE BENEFITS YOU MENTIONED SOMETIMES THEY RE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOU THE WAGE ITSELF .
YEAH .
IF YOU CAN GET THOSE BENEFITS EVEN UH THEY THEY COME OUT TO MUCH A MUCH BETTER BENEFIT THAN THAN AN INCREASE IN YOUR WAGE A LOT OF TIMES .
RIGHT BECAUSE YOU RE YOU KNOW CERTAINLY SOMETHING LIKE DAY CARE AT THE WORK PLACE .
UHHUH .
WOULD MAKE LIFE SO MUCH SIMPLER .
UHHUH UHHUH .
THAT IT S WORTH PAYING YOU KNOW HAVING A LOWER SALARY I WOULD CERTAINLY ACCEPT A LOWER .
OH YEAH .
SALARY FOR THAT .
OH YEAH IT WOULD MAKE IT A LOT BETTER .
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING ELSE BEING EQUAL BECAUSE YOUR LIFE WOULD BE SO MUCH EASIER .
UHHUH .
AND THERE S A QUESTION OF QUALITY OF LIFE ALSO .
UH WELL AND IF IT WAS THERE YOU WOULD REALLY HAVE A LITTLE MORE UH KNOWLEDGE ON WHAT S GOING ON .
YEAH .
PROBABLY YOU KNOW WITH YOUR CHILD .
RIGHT AND YOU YOU YOU DO NT FEEL LIKE YOU RE A HALF HOUR AWAY IF SHE .
RIGHT .
SOMETHING HAPPENED .
YEAH .
AND YOU RE LESS PREOCCUPIED WITH IT I THINK .
RIGHT YEAH .
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE NT I THINK I B M HAS STARTED HAVING THAT IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS .
I DO NT KNOW MY DAUGHTER ONE DAUGHTER WORKS FOR M C I AND THEY DO NT THEY WHERE SHE WORKS THEY DO NT HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT .
UHHUH IS THAT LOCALLY .
UH PITTSBURGH .
UHHUH .
PITTSBURGH PENNSYLVANIA .
YEAH BECAUSE PITTSBURGH S A BIG ENOUGH CITY TOO .
UHHUH .
BUT YOU KNOW I WOULD NT BE SURPRISED IF THING S LIKE THAT DID NT HAPPEN MORE IN SMALLER COMMUNITIES BEFORE THEY HAPPEN IN BIGGER ONES .
UHHUH .
JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE MIGHT BE MORE FLEXIBLE IN SMALLER LOCATIONS AND .
YEAH .
THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE MANY TIMES SMALL COMPANIES OFFER BETTER BENEFITS IN TERMS OF QUALITY OF LIFE THAN LARGER COMPANIES .
UHHUH .
LIKE UH ONE COMPANY HAD PROPOSED TO ME THAT I COULD COME BACK TO WORK AFTER HAVING THE BABY UM ANY WHERE BETWEEN TEN AND FORTY HOURS A WEEK .
UHHUH .
AND UM CALL MY OWN DAYS CALL MY OWN HOURS .
OH SO THEY WERE VERY FLEXIBLE .
YEAH .
AND THAT THAT WOULD BE GREAT YEAH .
AND WHICH MANY TIMES AT A LARGE COMPANY IT S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
TO DO THINGS LIKE THAT .
THEY SAY YOU RE GOING TO DO IT THIS WAY AND THAT S THE WAY IT S GOING TO BE .
RIGHT .
YEAH .
AND IF YOU GET TWO WEEKS OFF YOU GET TWO WEEKS OFF .
UHHUH .
AND YOU RE NOT ALLOWED TWO WEEKS AND ONE DAY .
YEAH YEAH YEAH .
SO IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHAT YOUR POSITION IS THERE TOO .
TRUE WELL THAT S TRUE IN ANY ANY COMPANY I THINK .
YEAH .
I VE I VE NEVER WELL I CA NT SAY I VE NEVER I VE MAYBE WORKED FIVE YEARS OUT OF OUR MARRIED LIFE .
UHHUH .
OUT OF THE HO YOU KNOW OUT OF THE HOME .
UHHUH .
BUT UH THE REST OF THE TIME I VE BEEN AN AVON LADY AND A MUMBLEX LADY .
WAS THAT WHEN YOU WERE UM WELL THOSE HAVE ITS PLUSES AND MINUSES TOO I VE BEEN A CONSULTANT RECENTLY .
UHHUH .
AND SO I DO NT HAVE ANY BENEFITS AT ALL AND .
UHHUH AND YOU HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF ANY BENEFITS YOU WANT YOURSELF YEAH .
RIGHT AND THE SAME THING MY HUSBAND IS UNFORTUNATELY BEING PAID AS A CONSULTANT .
UHHUH .
AND WE TRIED TO ARGUE THAT HE SHOULD GET MORE SALARY FOR THAT .
UHHUH .
THAN WHAT HE IS AND UM THEY THEY THEY .
USUALLY CONSULTANTS MAKE VERY GOOD INCOME .
RIGHT AND THEY THEY REFUSE TO GIVE HIM MORE SALARY .
IS THAT RIGHT .
BECAUSE THEY SAY THEY CA NT PAY MORE THAN THIS AND THAT AND THEY RE NOT ALLOWED TO PAY HIM MORE .
OH .
THAN WHAT HIS PREVIOUS SALARY WAS AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
AND YOU KNOW TIMES ARE ROUGH NOW SO IT S NEW IT S HARDER TO GET .
UHHUH .
THE UH YOU KNOW INCREASES AND THINGS .
UHHUH .
BUT UM .
A MUMBLEX CONSULTANT REALLY IS SHOULD BE MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE THAN EVERYBODY ELSE YOU KNOW .
YEAH WELL HE S .
SO IT STANDS TO REASON THEY SHOULD REALLY HA HAVE MORE BENEFITS .
RIGHT WELL HE S BEEN DOING A LONG TERM HE S BEING CALLED A CONSULTANT AND HE S REALLY SORT OF A TEMPORARY EMPLOYEE AT A PLACE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND THEY THEY PAY HIM AS A CONSULTANT BUT HE DOES NT GET ANY HEALTH BENEFITS HE DOES NT GET WELL .
UM .
WE DO NT CARE ABOUT RETIREMENT BENEFITS HE DOES NT GET UM VACATION BENEFITS AND .
UHHUH .
HE DOES A LOT OF THINGS THAT GET FACTORED INTO SOMEBODY ELSE S SALARY .
UHHUH .
SO REALLY HIS SALARY SHOULD BE YOU KNOW TWENTY PERCENT OR THIRTY PERCENT HIGHER .
UHHUH .
JUST BASED ON THAT NOT INCLUDING .
YEAH .
THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW IT S A LESS LONG TERM COMMITMENT FOR THE COMPANY .
UHHUH .
AND ALL THAT SORT OF STUFF .
YEAH AND THEY LL DO IT .
WELL I I DO NT THINK THAT IT S IT S WRONG FOR A COMPANY TO REQUIRE DRUG TESTING FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF POSITIONS .
FOR INSTANCE JOBS .
THAT REQUIRE USE OF HEAVY MACHINERY AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHERE THERE S WHERE THERE S UH ENDANGERMENT TO THEIR OWN LIFE AND OTHER PEOPLE S LIVES .
UH I AGREE WITH THAT .
PEOPLE .
THAT ARE UH DRIVING .
UHHUH .
LIKE UH TRUCK DRIVER S AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
I DEFINITELY THINK THEY SHOULD BE TESTED .
AND I M NOT I M NOT OPPOSED TO ANY TESTING .
I MEAN BECAUSE I KNOW I CERTAINLY WOULD NT WANT TO TO UH YOU KNOW BE ENDANGERED BY SOMEBODY IN A COMPANY .
THAT ACCIDENTALLY DROPPED SOMETHING ON ME OR OR YOU KNOW BECAUSE HE WAS ON DRUGS WHILE HE WAS THERE .
YEAH .
UH .
WELL HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT UH COMPANIES DRUG TESTING PRIOR TO HIRING .
OH UH I WAS TESTED UH WITHIN MY COMPANY .
I THINK IT S KIND OF A PUSH TO UH WEED OUT DRUGS IN STATES AND BECAUSE I DO NT KNOW OF ANY OTHER COUNTRIES .
THAT ARE DOING THIS .
UHHUH .
AND I I FEEL LIKE IT S REALLY JUST WITHIN THE UNITED STATES .
IT .
S UH IT S OKAY .
I THINK YOUR RECORD SHOULD STAND FOR ITSELF .
THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU VE BEEN TESTED AT OTHER COMPANIES AND YOU VE ALWAYS COME UP NEGATIVE OR WHATEVER THEN I DO NT SEE WHAT .
THE BIG DEAL IS THAT THEY HAVE TO GO TO ALL THE EXPENSE .
UHHUH .
OF TESTING YOU OVER AND OVER AND OVER .
AND ONCE YOU VE ESTABLISHED THE FACT THAT YOU RE NOT A DRUG USER AND ESPECIALLY IF YOUR PERSONALITY PROVES THAT YOU RE NOT .
I THINK THEY COULD UH SAVE MONEY BY NOT DOING THAT .
YOU KNOW EVERY TIME SAY IF YOU CHANGE JOBS YOU WOULD NT HAVE TO DO IT IF YOU D JUST BEEN TESTED AT YOUR OTHER WORK PLACE .
WELL WHAT ABOUT RANDOM TESTING THOUGH .
OH .
DO YOU FEEL LIKE THAT S AN IN INVASION OF CERTAIN PEOPLE S RIGHTS IF NOT EVERYONE IS TESTED .
UH NOT IF IT S DONE FAIRLY .
AND THAT S PROBABLY MY QUESTION IS HOW HOW DO YOU KNOW IT S DONE FAIRLY .
I DO NT KNOW THAT YOU DO .
IF IT S RANDOM THEN IT S RANDOM .
YEAH .
AND THAT S NOT NECESSARILY FAIR .
WELL THEY MIGHT TELL YOU .
IT S RANDOM .
UHHUH .
BUT THEN YOU KNOW IT S KIND OF LIKE A A LOTTERY .
SOMEBODY IN THEIR LIFETIME MAY WIN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WHERE ANOTHER PERSON DOES NT WIN ANYTHING AND TRIES AND TRIES AND TRIES .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
WELL I HA I KNOW THAT FOR INSTANCE IN THE N C DOUBLE A THEY DRUG TEST AND IT S NOT RANDOM .
OH I SEE .
HOW D HOW DID THEY HOW DO THEY PICK THEIR PEOPLE .
UH WELL I THINK ALL COLLEGE PLAYERS HAVE TO DO AN INITIAL DRUG TEST AT A CERTAIN POINT PRIOR TO THE SEASON .
UHHUH .
AND FROM THAT POINT ON UH AT THE N C DOUBLE A DOES HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT BUT IT S ALMOST DISCRETIONARY ON THE COACH S PART OF EACH IN INDIVIDU INDIVIDUAL INSTITUTION TO IDENTIFY THE ONES .
THAT HAVE THE PROBLEM .
OH I SEE .
SO DO YOU .
AND AND THE ONES .
THAT TEST POSITIVE HAVE TO RETEST AFTER A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME .
RIGHT .
WELL DO YOU THINK THAT SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE WORK PLACE .
YOU KNOW AS LIKE A MANAGER OR SUPERVISOR THINKS OR HAS SUSPICION THAT SOMEONE IS USING DRUGS DO YOU THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SEND THEM .
WELL NOT BEING A .
TO BE TESTED .
DRUG USER .
I DO NT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT PERSONALLY .
RIGHT .
BUT I THINK THAT MIGHT BE A VIOLATION OF SOMEONE .
S RIGHTS .
IF SOMEONE S HAVING PERSONAL PROBLEMS FOR SOME REASON .
THAT S CAUSING THEM TO H BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY .
RIGHT .
AND THEIR MANAGER ASSUMES THEY HAVE A DRUG PROBLEM .
I MEAN IF SOMEONE ASSUMED THAT OF ME I WOULD BE UPSET .
RIGHT RIGHT .
YEAH IT IT WOULD ALMOST BE LIKE A A UH .
IT S AN ACCUSATION AND AND IT S .
UHHUH .
AND IT S BASED ON ON A PERCEPTION THAT SOMEONE HAS AS HOW A DRUG USER WOULD BEHAVE WHEN SOME DRUG USERS BEHAVE UH NORMAL UH YOU KNOW .
AND THEN HOW WOULD YOU FEEL AFTERWARDS WHEN YOU CAME UP NEGATIVE AND YOU KNOW YOUR SUPERVISOR HAS ACCUSED YOU OF USING DRUGS .
RIGHT EXACTLY .
I I DO NT THE I THINK ALMOST THE ONLY WAY .
THAT DRUG TESTING CAN BE DONE FAIRLY IS IF IT S ACROSS THE BOARD FROM FROM THE JANITORS TO THE EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT .
RIGHT .
I AGREE WITH THAT .
BECAUSE I KNOW PERSONALLY MYSELF I VE BEEN IN THE SAME JOB FOR THREE YEARS IT WILL BE THREE YEARS IN AUGUST AND I VE ALREADY BEEN DRUG TESTED THREE TIMES .
WHAT TYPE OF JOB DO YOU HAVE .
WELL I M AN ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEER .
UHHUH .
AND I VE BEEN DRUG TESTED THREE TIMES AND I KNOW MANY PEOPLE .
THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN TESTED IN THEIR LIFETIME AND THE COMPANY .
I WORK FOR IS SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE PLUS .
SO SEE I FOR SOME REASON I VE COME UP THREE TIMES .
THAT S PRETTY HIGH STATISTICS .
WELL DOES YOUR R DOES YOUR JOB REQUIRE YOU TO DRIVE COMPANY EQUIPMENT OR TO AP OPERATE ANY TYPE OF MACHINERY .
THAT MIGHT .
NO .
ENDANGER SOMEONE .
NO NOT AT ALL .
WELL THAT DOES NT I MEAN I .
IT S A LEGAL JOB YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
SO SEE IT S REALLY STRANGE .
THAT IS ODD .
I WAS DRUG TESTED UH NOT FOR THE JOB .
I HAVE NOW BUT FOR THE PRIOR JOB UH BUT I KNOW THAT THEY SENT THAT THE JOB .
I HAD BEFORE THAT WELL THE JOB .
I HAVE HAVE NOW REQUESTED MY UH UH MY UH MEDICAL RECORD FROM MY OLD COMPANY .
OH UHHUH .
SO I DO NT KNOW IF I WAS NT DRUG TESTED BASED ON THAT OR BECAUSE THE MAN .
WHO HIRED ME DID NT REQUEST THE DRUG TEST BECAUSE I KNOW THAT MY COMPANY DOES DRUG TESTING ON OCCASION .
RIGHT .
WELL DOES YOUR THE COMPANY SAY FOR INSTANCE DOES THE COMPANY .
YOU WORKED FOR BEF BEFORE HAVE THE RIGHT OR DO THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO SAY HEY WE VE ALREADY DRUG TESTED HER AND SHE CAME UP NEGATIVE .
WELL NO I DO NT THINK THEY CAN THEY CAN FORCE ANOTHER COMPANY TO NOT DRUG TEST ME JUST BY SAYING THAT I I .
YEAH .
DID NT I MEAN THEY DO NT KNOW THAT I DO NT USE DRUGS .
THEY JUST TESTED ME ONCE .
RIGHT RIGHT .
BUT I USED TO WORK FOR A POWER COMPANY SO IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THEY MAKE SURE THEIR EMPLOYEES ESPECIALLY LINEMEN .
UHHUH .
UH WERE CLEAN .
UHHUH .
AND SINCE I WAS JUST YOU KNOW ONE OF THE OFFICE FOLK I GUESS IT WAS NT AS IMPORTANT TO THEM THAT THEY TEST ME REGULARLY .
BUT I KNOW THEY TEST MOST OF THE SERVICE PEOPLE FAIRLY REGULARLY .
UHHUH .
REG UH JUST ACROSS THE BOARD .
YEAH .
AND ARE THEY TESTED RANDOM .
NO THEY RE ALL OF THEM ARE TESTED .
THEY RE .
ONCE EVERY THREE MO IT S A ROTATION .
OH OKAY .
I SEE .
BUT IT BUT AGAIN IT DEPENDS ON WHAT JOB .
YOU RE IN .
YEAH .
THE MEN .
THAT ARE OUT THERE FIXING POWER LINES ARE TESTED A LOT AND THE MEN .
THAT DRIVE THE TRUCKS .
UHHUH .
WITH WITH THE GUYS .
THAT FIX THE POWER LINES ARE NT TESTED AS MUCH .
UHHUH .
BUT BUT SEE THEY MAKE THAT CLEAR TO THEM AS THEY HIRE THOSE GUYS .
OH I SEE .
WHAT WHAT .
THE DRUG TESTING SCHEDULE IS .
THEY SAY WE WE RE TESTING YOU TOMORROW AND WE LL TEST YOU .
EVERY THREE MONTHS THEREAFTER WHILE YOU WORK HERE .
UHHUH .

PAY ON IT .
THIS MONTH AND .
YES I KNOW YEAH .

WHO HAS TO CONTROL HOW MUCH SPENDING THERE IS .

AND THEN THE TUITION IS ALSO THE SAME THING .
SO THE THING IS IS BASICALLY THAT I SPEND LIKE MAYBE THIRTYFIVE FORTY DOLLARS .
EVERY TWO WEEKS ON ON GROCERIES AND THAT S ABOUT IT .
BUT THE THING UH ALSO IS THAT YOU KNOW LIKE IF YOU WANT TO GO OUT LIKE IF YOU WANT TO GO TO A RESTAURANT OR SOMETHING THEN I HAVE TO MODERATE THAT BECAUSE IT S LIKE I CA NT GO EAT OUT AT A NICE RESTAURANT AND SPEND TWENTY DOLLARS UM YOU KNOW THREE TIMES .
A WEEK .
NO YOU CA NT DO THAT VERY OFTEN .

I MEAN I TOLD MY DAD LI DAD LISTEN IF YOU WANT TO SAVE MONEY .
I WO NT CALL SO OFTEN YOU KNOW HE GOES WE WANT TO KEEP IN TOUCH SO I DOES NT MATTER ABOUT THE MONEY BECAUSE WE NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU .
YEAH SO YOU CALL HIM COLLECT .
NO .
BECAUSE IT IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAT WAY .
WHAT MAKES YOU .

BASICALLY THE UNITED STATES IS THE CHEAPEST COUNTRY TO CALL OUT OF .
YEAH .
AND UM BECAUSE IT S CONSIDERED A LUXURY IN OTHER COUNTRIES .
OH OKAY .
SO YOU JUST CALL HIM DIRECT AND THEN .
RIGHT .
SINCE IT S HIS MONEY ANYWAY YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
AND HE GETS THE AND YOU GET THE BILL AND SEND IT TO HIM .

WELL THEN UH SEE UH THAT S THAT S ONE OF THE POINTS .
WHICH .
I DO NT SEE LIKE I I DO NT GIVE A LOT OF GIFTS DURING CHRISTMAS AND I YOU KNOW I DO NT WA I DO NT LIKE TO GIVE ANY AT ALL .

BECAUSE THE THING IS IS THAT YOU KNOW IT S LIKE IF I WANT SOMETHING .

SO HE GAVE ME .
A BACKPACK AND I I KNEW HE NEEDED AN ALARM CLOCK .
YEAH .
SO I BOUGHT HIM .
AN ALARM CLOCK .
SO .
THAT S GREAT .
THE THING WAS THAT THAT .
UTILITARIAN .
RIGHT BUT .
NECESSARY THINGS NO FRIVOLOUS GIFTS .
RIGHT BUT UM THE THING IS ESPECIALLY REMEMBER WHEN I WAS DOWN IN ARGENTINA .
IT WAS TO ME .
IT WAS RIDICULOUS BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO ONCE A YEAR .
YOU GO OUT AND YOU SPEND ALL THIS MONEY ON ALL THESE PEOPLE AND SOME .
YOU DO NT CARE ABOUT YOU KNOW IT S LIKE .
THAT S TRUE WHY BOTHER .
YEAH .
YEAH .
AND SO BUT THE THING IS IS THAT UM .
WELL ESPECIALLY BEING A COLLEGE STUDENT YO YOUR I DO NT KNOW THAT YOU NEED TO BE INVOLVED IN A LOT OF FRIVOLOUS GIFT GIVING YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
THAT EFFECTS THE BUDGET ESPECIALLY AROUND UH CHRISTMAS TIME AT THE END OF THE SEMESTER .
YOU VE GOT FINALS AND LOTS OF BILLS I WOULD SUSPECT .
YEAH .
WHAT ABOUT WHEN YOU HAVE BREAKS LIKE UM CHRISTMAS OR BETWEEN SESSIONS .
WELL FOR EXAMPLE WE HAD SPRING BREAK NOW AND I WENT SKIING AND I SPENT AROUND LIKE MAYBE TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS .
I EXPECT SO .
SO UH BUT YOU KNOW ITS LIKE UM .
YOU VE GOT TO BUDGET THAT THOUGH .
YOU VE GOT TO SAVE UP IN ABLE TO DO THAT RIGHT .
YEAH YEAH .
I MEAN .
BECAUSE IT S LIKE YOU KNOW SAY YOU KNOW IT S LIKE WE WERE SAYING LET S GO EAT OUT BEFORE SPRING BREAK .

BEFORE SPRING BREAK .

AND IF I FELT LIKE I SPENT WAY TO MUCH THEN UM I WO NT GO OUT YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
AND SO LIKE MY ROOMMATE WENT HOME I WENT SKIING IN OVER THE CAROLINA MOUNTAINS .
WHICH ARE NT ANYTHING .
HUH .
BUT UM BUT IT WAS YOU KNOW IT WAS I GUESS IT WAS WORTH IT .

CAPITAL PUNISHMENT OH I HONESTLY DO NT FEEL LIKE IT S STRICT ENOUGH IN MY OPINION .
IN THE WAY THAT IT S APPLIED .
UHHUH .
OR IT S APPLIED AT ALL .
APPLIED AT ALL .
SO I HOW DO YOU FEEL THAT IT SHOULD BE APPLIED .
WELL I JU I JUST FEEL LIKE THERE S A LOT OF MURDERERS AND RAPISTS AND EVERYTHING ELSE JUST WALKING THE STREETS .
YOU KNOW .
AND THAT THAT THE PENALTY OUGHT TO BE OUT THERE AND BE ENFORCED .
YES .
YES .
NOT GETTING PAROLED LETS SAY IN SO MANY .
YEAH .
YEARS .
I MEAN IF YOUR GOING TO SENTENCE SOMEBODY LETS SAY TWENTY YEARS LET THEM STAY TWENTY YEARS .
THAT S I AGREE WITH THAT COMPLETELY .
I KNOW WE DO NT HAVE ENOUGH PRISONS BUT THERE HAS GOT TO BE SOME KIND OF PUNISHMENT .
THERE HAS .
FOR THESE PEOPLE .
THAT S RIGHT .
BECAUSE IF THEY TURN AROUND THEY CAN GET AWAY THEY GET AWAY WITH IT AND THEY GET AWAY WITH IT AND THEY GET AWAY WITH IT AND THEN THEY DO SOMETHING .
WORSE .
UHHUH .
AND THEY GET A SLAP ON THE WRIST .
THEY GET .
YEAH .
THIRTY DAYS IN JAIL .
YEAH .
AND THEY .
FINAL GET UP TO WHERE THEY KILL SOMEBODY ELSE AND THEY GO THROUGH FOURTEEN APPEALS AND .
UHHUH .
HOW MANY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS .
THAT S RIGHT .
THAT S .
AND IT S .
HONESTLY RIGHT .
THEY HAVE REALLY GOT IT BETTER THAN WE DO IN A LOT OF WAYS .
YOU KNOW .
WELL THEY CERTAINLY ARE LIVING OFF OUR EX .
UH THEY SURE ARE .
AT OUR EXPENSE .
JUST BECAUSE .
I DID NT .
SOME INNOCENT PERSON CAN REALLY IT SEEMS LIKE REALLY MUMBLEX A ROUGH TIME .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
I M NOT SAYING INNOCENT PERSON LET S SAY SOMEONE WROTE A HOT CHECK FOR INSTANCE .
YOU KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE WHEN THEY GO TO PRISON IT THEY REALLY SEEM LIKE IT S A ROUGH TIME FOR THEM .
UHHUH .
AND A MURDERER WELL GO TO PRISON OH HE S JUST THERE TO SERVE HIS TIME AND GET BACK OUT ON THE STREET .
AND AND BE PAROLED AND .
YEAH .
AND HAVE SERVED THE SENTENCE THAT S WHAT THAT S .
WHAT PEOPLE FACE WITH THAT CHOICE .
ONE THING .
I REALLY HATE IS THEY DO NT EXPLAIN TO THE JURORS IN A IN A TRIAL IN A CAPITAL MURDER TRIAL OR IN CASES OF RAPE OR IN DIFFERENT THINGS .
THAT ARE SO HORRIBLE WHAT .
IT MEANS WHEN THEY SENTENCE THEM TO YOU KNOW THEY LL SENTENCE THEM TO NINETY YEARS .
UHHUH .
AND SAY THAT IT S YOU KNOW THAT IT S GOING TO YOU KNOW THAT SHOULD BE LIFE BUT INSTEAD IN IN GIVEN THE CHOICE OF EITHER SENTENCING TO DEATH OR SENTENCING TO LIFE THEY LL GIVE THEM .
NINETY YEARS IN PRISON OR SOMETHING AND THEN TURN AROUND IN THIRTY YEARS THAT YOU KNOW AND LESS THEY RE OUT .
UHHUH .
EVEN IF IF THEY RE EVEN IN THAT LONG .
OR THEY APPEAL AND THEN THEY GET AN APPEAL .
THAT SAYS IT WAS YOU KNOW AN UNJUST AMOUNT OF TIME .
TIME UHHUH .
AN EXTRAORDINARY LONG LENGTH OR SOMETHING .
YES .
I WAS I WOULD JUST BE I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THEM JUST REALLY GET REAL STRICT ON PAROLE .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
I D LIKE TO SEE THE DEATH PENALTY MORE AS A DETERRENT I THINK PEOPLE KNOW THAT NOBODY THAT IT DOES NT YOU KNOW I IT S NOT A DETERRENT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE IT S NOT REALLY EFFECTIVE .
UHHUH .
THERE S SHOULD BE YOU KNOW THIS FOR THIS CRIME THIS IS THE PENALTY .
YOU KILLED .
UHHUH .
SOMEONE .
YEAH .
YOU GET .
YOU KNOW IN COLD BLOOD .
IT BACK YEAH .
OR WHATEVER .
THIS IS WHAT S GOING TO HAPPEN .
YEAH .
AND I MEAN IT SOUNDS HORRIBLE .
IT I HEAR MYSELF SAYING THIS AND BUT I .
YEAH .
BUT IT S .
DO NT KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO WITH SOME OF THESE PEOPLE .
I I KNOW .
THAT ARE BECAUSE THEY LET THEM BACK OUT AGAIN AND THEY DO THE SAME THING OVER .
SAME THING .
AND OVER .
YES .
AGAIN THEN THEY PUT THEM BACK IN JAIL AND THEY GET OUT AND .
YES .
AND MORE AND MORE INNOCENT PEOPLE ARE HURT OR KILLED .
UHHUH .
AND THESE GUYS JUST ARE ON THE ENDLESS MERRYGOROUND IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM .
UHHUH .
AND IT S LIKE I SAID AT OUR EXPENSE .
UH A LOT OF PEOPLE REALLY DOES NT THINK THAT MUCH ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT .
HAS NT HAPPENED TO THEM WHICH .
IT HAS NT TO ME EITHER YOU KNOW .
YES .
THANK GOODNESS .
BUT STILL I IT COULD .
I KNOW I YOU READ ABOUT IT IN THE PAPER .
YES .
EVERY DAY SOMEBODY .
WHO S DONE THIS OR THAT SOMETHING REALLY HORRIBLE .
UHHUH .
AND THEY JUST GET AWAY WITH IT AND NOTHING HAPPENS .
AND AS FAR AS THE OTHER STATES I HONESTLY DO NT KNOW WHAT .
THEIR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS .
YOU KNOW I I .
YEAH .
HAVE NT KEPT UP YOU KNOW ANYTHING .
I THINK .
LIKE THAT .
I THINK TEXAS IS WHA TEXAS THE SOUTHERN STATES SEEM TO BE SOMEWHAT MORE CONSERVATIVE AND STILL HAVE THE DEATH PENALTY AND I THINK I KNOW CALIFORNIA HAD IT FOR A LONG TIME AND THEN THEY UH TOOK IT OFF THE BOOKS THEY REPEALED IT .
UHHUH .
AND PEOPLE LIKE CHARLES MANSON AND AND SOME OF THESE OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE SENTENCED TO DEATH AT THE TIME .
THEY REPEALED THE DEATH PENALTY WERE SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON .
AND ARE NOW NOW THAT EVEN THOUGH CALIFORNIA HAS REINSTATED THE DEATH PENALTY FOR WHATEVER .
VARIOUS CRIMES .
THE PEOPLE .
WHO WERE THERE ORIGINALLY WHEN THEY WHEN THEY CHANGED THE LAWS TO REVOKE THE DEATH PENALTY ARE STILL IN THERE FOR ARE IN PRISON IN QUOTE FOR LIFE AND AND ARE NOW COMING UP FOR PAROLE SOME OF THEM .
UH .
LIKE MANSON .
WHO S COME UP .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW IT S BEEN DENIED FORTUNATELY BUT .
YES .
BUT STILL IT CAME UP THOUGH DID NT IT .
YEAH .
I MEAN YOU KNOW .
WELL THE JURY .
THAT SENTENCED HIM SENTENCED HIM TO DEATH .
UHHUH .
AND THEN WHILE HE WAS ON APPEAL ON HIS THOUSANDTH AND ONE APPEAL THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA REVOKED THE LAW IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES AND THEN THEY REINSTATED IT LATER BUT THE PENALTY DID NT GO BACK .
YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF TIMES .
THE LAW IS IS TOTALLY ON THE CRIMINAL SIDE AND AND IS NT PROTECTING THE REST OF THE PEOPLE .
YES .
THE VICTIM IS REALLY SEEMS LIKE LEFT OUT IN THE COLD MORE OR LESS DOES NT IT .
UHHUH .
IN A LOT OF WELL ESPECIALLY IN THINGS YOU PICK UP THE PAPER AND YOU READ .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW YOU THINK OH MY GOODNESS .
AND THE THE LAWS ARE ALL THE RULES .
SOME OF THE THINGS .
THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO TO TELL THE JURY THAT THIS THIS GUY HAS A A PRIOR CRI CRIMINAL HISTORY YOU KNOW WHERE HE S RAPED TEN WOMEN .
UHHUH .
AND THEN HE GETS UP FOR THIS ONE TRIAL AND THEY DO NT FINDS ANYTHING OUT ABOUT THE FACTS THAT HE S DONE THIS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN .
UHHUH .
AND SO THEY SAY WELL THIS IS YOU KNOW I I DO NT KNOW IF THEY SAY IT S THE FIRST TIME OFFENSE OR WHATEVER BUT THEY GIVE HIM .
A LIGHTER SENTENCE THINKING HE S NOT A HABITUAL CRIMINAL .
OR YOU KNOW PLEAD INSANITY .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
WELL .
AND A LOTS OF THINGS .
TO SOME EXTENT IF THEY WOULD DO SOMETHING WITH SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE .
BUT THAT SEEMS TO BE A GOOD WAY TO GET OFF FOR A LOT OF THEM TOO .
OH YES .
THEY PLEAD INSANITY .
UHHUH .
UHHUH .
AND THEN THREE YEARS LATER THEY RE CURED AND LET LOOSE ON SOCIETY AGAIN .
YES .
I IT JUST .
I MEAN IT S A .
JUST DOES NT MAKE SENSE I .
IT S A SCARY WORLD OUT THERE ANYMORE WHERE YOUR AFRAID TO GO OUT I KNOW IN IN THE DALLAS METROPLEX AREA I DO NT GO OUT HARDLY IF I DO NT HAVE TO AT NIGHT BY MYSELF .
UHHUH .
AND I I CERTAINLY I I GREW UP IN A SMALLER TOWN IN TEXAS AND IT .
WAS NT .
THAT WAY WHEN I WAS YOUNGER .
UHHUH .
WELL LIKE I .
WE COULD GO AROUND AND BOY AND .
SAID I LIVE IN A SMALL PLACE .
YOU KNOW .
BUT UH EVEN THE SMALL TOWNS NOW THOUGH HAS REALLY CHANGED FROM WHEN I WAS A KID BUT NOW I M RAISING CHILDREN .
IT .
JU IT REALLY IS .
YES .
EVER YOU CA NT EVEN WHEN I WAS A KID I WOULD RUN BETWEEN MY NEIGHBORS THREE AND FOUR BLOCKS SOMETIMES AND AS LONG AS MY MOM HAD A GENERAL IDEA WHERE I WAS .
UHHUH .
AND I WAS BACK ON THE TIME AND NOW I DO NT LET MY KIDS OUT OF THE FRONT YARD THAT I CA NT SEE THEM .
SEE THEM .
YEAH .
YEAH .
IT REALLY IS .
WELL WE RE PROBABLY FIXING TO RUN OUT OF TIME PRETTY .
UHHUH .
SOON BUT I VE ENJOYED TALKING TO YOU .
WELL GOOD TALKING TO YOU TOO .
BYE .
BYE .
BYE .
OKAY .
BYEBYE .
OKAY SO WHAT KIND OF CARS ARE YOU LOOKING AT .
WELL WE VE UH WE VE WE VE TEST DRIVEN THE OLDSMOBILE DELTA EIGHTYEIGHT .
UHHUH .
AND A CUTLASS SUPREME AND A USED CADILLAC ABOUT THREE OR FOUR YEARS OLD .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE UH I GET MARRIED IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND I HAVE TWO KIDS AND MY FIANCEE HAS TWO KIDS .
UHHUH .
SO WE NEED A CAR .
THAT S BIG ENOUGH FOR SIX .
YEAH .
AND SO WE WENT I GUESS IT WAS TWO WEEKENDS AGO WE WENT UH CAR SHOPPING .
UHHUH .
AND LOOKED AROUND .
WE FOUND SOMETHING INTERESTING AT CREST OLDSMOBILE CADILLAC UP THERE ON CENTRAL EXPRESSWAY .
UHHUH .
THAT UH IN ADDITION TO GETTING A NEW CAR THERE THEY CAN GET YOU .
A CAR .
THAT S NEW BUT IT S BEEN UH A DEMONSTRATOR MODEL .
OH OKAY .
FOR TWO OR THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS EVEN CHEAPER THAN THE BEST DEAL .
THEY CAN GIVE YOU FOR A NEW CAR .
UHHUH .
SO THEY CALL THIS PROGRAM CARS AND THEY COME .
WITH A NEW CAR WARRANTY AND IT JUST SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE TO ME TO GET THE MOST CAR FOR YOUR MONEY TO GET SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
RIGHT .
THAT S A REAL GOOD DEAL .
IN FACT MY DAD RECENTLY GOT A UM A PONTIAC UH BELIEVE SIX THOUSAND .
UHHUH .
AND HE GOT A DEMO .
OKAY .
AND IT S BEEN A REAL GOOD CAR .
YEAH .
AND IT S IT S LIKE NEW .
UHHUH .
AND IT ONLY HAD HAD VERY VERY LOW MILEAGE ON IT .
SURE .
AND SO I THINK HE GOT A REAL GOOD DEAL .
OF COURSE THEY RE FULLY LOADED USUALLY .
OH YEAH .
SO IT S I THINK IT S A PRETTY GOOD OPTION .
YEAH I THINK SO TOO .
ARE THE UH OLDSMOBILES THAT YOU RE LOOKING AT ARE THEY .
THE DEMOS OR THEY USED ARE THEY NEW .
WELL THE ONES THAT WE WERE TEST DRIVING WERE THE UH WERE THE NEW ONES .
UHHUH .
THERE .
UHHUH .
WELL NOW UH NOW THEY MAY BE THE DEMONSTRATOR MODELS THAT THE SALES REPS DRIVE AROUND IN .
UHHUH .
AND THEN THE CADILLAC IS IS DEFINITELY A USED CAR OR .
YEAH .
UHHUH .
THE GUY SAID IT D BEEN ON THE LOT ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES .
HE SAYS IT LL PROBABLY BE GONE IN A DONE AND IT S PROBABLY GONE BY NOW .
OH NO .
THOSE THINGS GO FAST .
UHHUH .
UH OF COURSE .
WE RE NOT WE CA NT CONSIDER GETTING A BRAND NEW CADILLAC BECAUSE THOSE ARE TWENTYFIVE TO THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS .
YEAH .
BUT WHEN THEY RE THREE YEARS OLD THEY RE THE PRICE ALREADY DROPS IN HALF .
UHHUH .
SO THEN IT BECOMES UH MORE REALISTIC .
RIGHT .
THAT S WHAT .
I M THINKING ABOUT ON MY NEXT CAR IS DO I WANT TO GET ANOTHER BRAND NEW CAR BECAUSE LAST TWO CARS ARE BRAND NEW .
UHHUH .
OR DO I LOOK FOR A USED CAR .
THAT S MAYBE TWO THREE YEARS OLD THAT .
YEAH .
BUT THAT S YOU KNOW LOW MILEAGE AND IN GOOD SHAPE .
BUT I JUST I .
KIND OF WORRY ABOUT GETTING A CAR .
THAT S THAT NEW WITH LOW MILEAGE ON IT BECAUSE YOU WONDER WHY DID THE PERSON .
THAT OWNED IT WANT TO GET RID OF IT .
IS IT .
A LEMON OR .
THAT S RIGHT .
OR IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH IT BUT .
THAT S RIGHT .
I GUESS THAT S A RISK .
YOU HAVE TO TAKE .
WELL YOU CAN REDUCE THAT RISK BY UH HAVING THE CAR CHECKED OUT I MEAN YOU KNOW IF YOU RE GOING TO LOOK AT FIFTY DIFFERENT CARS YOU DO NT WANT TO DO THIS .
UHHUH .
BUT IF YOU VE NARROWED IT DOWN TO ONE OR TWO .
UHHUH .
YOU CAN HAVE THE CAR UH UH CHECKED AT UH AN INDEPENDENT SERVICE STATION .
UHHUH .
AND HAVE THEM GO THROUGH IT FROM TOP TO BOTTOM AND TELL YOU IF THEY CAN FIND ANYTHING WRONG BECAUSE THEY DO NT HAVE ANY FINANCIAL INTEREST IN IT .
RIGHT .
AND THEN YOU LL HAVE A REALISTIC ASSESSMENT OF WHAT .
YOU RE GETTING .
UHHUH .
ABOUT HOW MUCH DO THEY CHARGE TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT DO YOU KNOW .
OH I M THINKING AROUND TWENTY OR TWENTYFIVE DOLLARS .
YEAH THAT S NOT BAD .
NO HUHUH .
IT D BE WELL WORTH IT IF YOU RE CONSIDERING BUYING A CAR .
I WOULD I WOULD THINK SO .
TO FIND OUT .
I WOULD THINK SO .
YEAH YEAH .
WELL IT S KIND OF HARD FOR ME TO TALK ABOUT BUYING CARS BECAUSE I JUST GOT MINE PAID OFF ABOUT A MONTH AGO AND I .
IS NT THAT A GOOD FEELING .
YES I DO NT WANT TO THINK ABOUT BUYING A CAR FOR A WHILE .
I JUST WANT TO ENJOY NOT HAVING ANY CAR PAYMENTS FOR A WHILE .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND ENJOY WATCHING MY SAVINGS ACCOUNT GET LARGER AND UH YOU KNOW HANG ON TO THE ONE .
I VE GOT FOR A FEW YEARS BECAUSE IT S IT S IT S ALMOST FOUR YEARS OLD BUT IT S STILL IN GREAT SHAPE .
I HAVE A MAZDA R X SEVEN .
WELL WHAT .
YOU CAN DO IS TAKE YOUR CAR PAYMENT AND PUT IT IN THE BANK FOR THREE OR FOUR YEARS .
UHHUH .
AND WHEN YOU RE READY TO GET ANOTHER CAR JUST PAY CASH FOR IT .
YEAH I JUST ABOUT COULD REALLY .
YEAH .
BECAUSE I THINK MY CAR IF I CONTINUE TAKING GOOD CARE OF IT IT S GOING TO HOLD A PRETTY GOOD RESALE VALUE .
OH YEAH .
AND UH IF I CONSIDER GOING THE USED CAR ROUTE AND SAVE UP SOME MONEY I SHOULD NT HAVE TOO MUCH TROUBLE AT ALL .
YEAH I I WOULD THINK THAT S TRUE .
COULD YOU HOLD ON FOR JUST A MOMENT .
SURE .
OKAY .
I M ON A CORDLESS PHONE AND I WAS PICKING UP UH SOME BACKGROUND NOISE SO I JUST SWITCHED THE CHANNEL UP ON IT .
I DID NT WANT TO INTERFERE WITH WHATEVER .
THEY RE TRYING TO RECORD .
RIGHT RIGHT THAT S FINE .
ANYWAY .
BUT UH I REALLY I REALLY ENJOY THE CAR .
I HAVE NOW AND I DO WANT TO HOLD ONTO IT AND AND YOU KNOW ENJOY IT WHILE IT S NOT HAVING ANY MECHANICAL PROBLEMS WHATSOEVER .
THAT S RIGHT .
IN FACT .
IT NEVER HAS .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND UH IT S BEEN KIND OF NICE AND I SURPRISINGLY ENOUGH AFTER FOUR YEARS I M NOT TIRED OF THE CAR AT ALL AND .
WELL .
I WANT TO HANG ON TO IT WHILE IT S STILL BEING A GOOD CAR AND WHILE I M NOT TIRED OF IT AND WHILE I M SINGLE .
YEAH .
AND CAN HANDLE A TWO SEATER FOR NOW .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND GET THAT OUT OF MY SYSTEM .
THAT S RIGHT .
BECAUSE ONE OF THESE DAYS I LL BE GETTING A SIX SEATER PROBABLY TOO .
EVENTUALLY .
SO .
YEAH THE FIRST TWO CARS I EVER BOUGHT WELL UH UH I VE BOUGHT THREE CARS AND I VE ALWAYS BOUGHT THEM NEW .
UHHUH .
THE FIRST CAR .
I KEPT FOR THIRTEEN AND A HALF YEARS .
WOW .
AND GOT A HUNDRED AND SIXTYONE THOUSAND OUT OF IT .
UHHUH .
THE SECOND CAR .
I EVER BOUGHT I DRIVE TO WORK NOW .
THAT JUST TURNED TEN YEARS OLD AND I VE GOT A HUNDRED AND TWENTYTWO THOUSAND MILES ON THAT .
UHHUH .
SO THAT THAT S KIND OF IN THE WAY .
I VE DONE THINGS IS TO GET THINGS .
THAT ARE NEW AND THEN KEEP THEM FOREVER .
UHHUH .
BUT UH MY CAR IS USING TWO QUARTS OF OIL .
A WEEK NOW .
OH MY GOSH .
ABOUT ABOUT A QUART .
EVERY HUNDRED MILES .
OH NO .
SO BUT UH IT RUNS FINE ALL .
YOU .
HAV IT S JUST VERY THIRSTY .
YEAH .
IF I JUST KEEP THE OIL IN IT SEEMS TO BE OKAY .
BUT YOU KNOW THAT S A SIGN THAT I M GOING TO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING SOONER OR LATER .
RIGHT .
WHAT KIND OF CAR IS IT .
IT S A A BUICK CENTURY .
UHHUH .
ARE YOU GOING TO TRADE IT IN ON THIS NEW ONE OR .
NO MY FIANCE IS SELLING UH A NINETEEN SEVENTYEIGHT CUTLASS SUPREME THAT SHE HAS .
IT S ACTUALLY .
OKAY .
IN BETTER CONDITION THAN MY CAR .
UHHUH .
AND SO SHE S GOING TO GET SOME MONEY FOR THAT AND TAKE SOME MONEY FROM THE BANK AND THEN TRY TO MAKE AS MUCH DOWN PAYMENT AS POSSIBLE .
UHHUH .
TO KEEP THE MONTHLY PAYMENT LOW .
SO SHE S GOING TO SELL IT RATHER THAN TRADE IT IN .
YEAH .
THAT S PROBABLY THE BEST THING .
YOU LOSE FOUR TO SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS .
A TRADE IN .
OR MAYBE MORE THAN THAT AS I VE LEARNED .
OH REALLY .

YOU RE BUYING BUT THEY JUST ARE GOING TO GIVE YOU THAT MUCH LESS FOR YOUR TRADE IN .
WELL THAT S FACT .
WHAT .
I THINK .

BUT STRANGELY ENOUGH THE BEST OFF I MEAN THE BEST BARGAINING .
I HAD MADE WITH A DEALER ON MY CAR WAS ALSO THE SAME PLACE .

INTERESTING .
TRADE IN BUT IT S A PLACE IN ARLINGTON AND I THINK MAYBE AS YOU GET OUTSIDE THE DALLAS AREA I .
KIND OF I BET YOU .
IT S KIND OF WHAT .
I DECIDED .
WELL MAYBE BECAUSE IT S OUTSIDE OF DALLAS THEY ARE GIVING A LITTLE BIT BETTER PRICES PLUS I WAS GOING THROUGH THAT T I .
FLEET DISCOUNT PROGRAM .
OKAY DID DID YOU USE IT AT THE CAR SHOP PLACE .
WELL IT S BEFORE THEY HAD THAT .
OH OKAY .
I HAD GONE OVER TO TEXINS AND THEY HAD A LITTLE FILE WHERE THEY SAID WHICH DEALERS PARTICIPATED IN THE IN THE FLEET PROGRAM .
THAT S RIGHT YEAH .
AND WHAT .
YOU COULD EXPECT THEY SAID YOU KNOW A FIVE PERCENT OVER COST .
RIGHT .
AND THEN OPTIONS AT COST AND EVERYTHING .
RIGHT .
SO I FIGURED OUT A PRICE BASED ON THAT .
YEAH THAT S GOOD .
BUT I I GUESS I GOT A PRETTY GOOD DEAL BECAUSE I WENT BACK TO THE TOWN NORTH MAZDA RIGHT OFF CENTRAL .
UHHUH .
AND OFFERED THEM .
THE SAME PRICE AS WHAT .
I KNEW I WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET IT FOR IN ARLINGTON .

BYEBYE .
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT A YEAR OR TWO OF PUBLIC SERVICE .
WELL I KNOW IT S HARD FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT GIVING UP THEIR YEARS YOU KNOW FR THEIR CAREFREE YEARS .
UHHUH .
BUT PEOPLE THAT I HAVE KNOWN THAT HAVE DONE THAT LIKE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES ESPECIALLY .
YEAH YEAH .
FROM GERMANY AND FINLAND UM THEY ARE JUST THEY HAVE SUCH A BETTER MORE MATURE OUTLOOK ON LIFE AND I THINK THEY RE BETTER PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE OF IT THEY RE MUCH MORE RESPONSIBLE I KNOW UM THE CHURCH THAT I GO TO UM THE YOUNG MEN GIVE TWO YEARS OF THEIR LIFE WHEN THEY TURN NINETEEN YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
THEY RE ENCOURAGED TO DO THAT MISSIONARY WORK AND I BE I REALLY BELIEVE THAT THE PEOPLE THAT DO THAT ARE BETTER PEOPLE THAT MAKE OUR .
YOU KNOW I .
SOCIETY BETTER .
I REALLY AGREE WITH YOU UM I UH THOUGH I VE NEVER DONE THAT MYSELF I I M WAS A BASICALLY AN EDUCATION MAJOR WHEN I GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE AND I ACCEPTED A JOB THAT AT THE TIME WAS JUST SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE POVERTY LEVEL TO TEACH TO UM VERY RURAL CHILDREN IN A VERY LOW INCOME DISTRICT AND I SPENT A YEAR TEACHING THERE .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK IT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF MY LARGEST EYEOPENING EXPERIENCES BECAUSE I COME FROM NICE MIDDLE CLASS WHITE SUBURBAN HOME .
UHHUH .
AND I DID IT UM FOR ONE REASON I WANTED I WAS WORKING ON A MASTERS DEGREE SO I WANTED TO STAY CLOSE TO WHERE I WAS WORKING ON A MASTERS DEGREE BUT ALSO BECAUSE I JUST THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO LIVE SOME PLACE ELSE SO TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN MY OWN UP BRINGING .
UHHUH .
AND I IT CHANGED IT PROBABLY CHANGED MY POLITICAL VIEWS IT CHANGED MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORLD AROUND ME .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK UM IN FACT I IF I HAD TO DO IT ALL AGAIN I YOU KNOW AFTER THAT YOU KNOW YOU NEVER THINK OF IT BECAUSE I GUESS BECAUSE I PAID FOR ALL OF MY COLLEGE EDUCATION MYSELF I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT DOING THAT BECAUSE I HAD ALL THESE COLLEGE LOANS I D STARTED PAYING BACK .
HUH .
UM BECA SO THAT WAS THAT WAS ONE REASON WHY I NEVER CONSIDERED IT BUT NOW THAT I M FURTHER ALONG AND I M STILL PAYING THESE COLLEGE LOANS .
I I THINK REALISTICALLY YOU KNOW YOU CAN HAVE YOUR COLLEGE LOANS DELAYED NOW BECAUSE I HAD THEM DELAYED BECAUSE I M BACK IN GRADUATE SCHOOL AT THIRTY YEARS OLD .
YEAH .
UM I HAD THEM DELAYED BECAUSE I M BACK IN GRADUATE SCHOOL AND ON THAT FORM IT SAYS IF YOUR JOINING THE PEACE CORPS YOU CAN HAVE THEM DELAYED .
HUH .
AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS YOU KNOW VERY INTERESTING AND I I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT EARLIER I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE DONE YOU KNOW JUST LIKE IS THAT IS THIS IS THAT THE MORMON CHURCH .
YES .
THAT DOES THAT .
YES .
BECAUSE ONE OF MY NEIGHBORS UH DID THAT IN PITTSBURGH FROM PITTSBURGH .
UHHUH .
AND I THOUGHT YOU KNOW THAT REALLY NOW THAT I M THIRTY YEARS OLD I THINK THAT ONE OR TWO YEARS OUT OF MY LIFE WOULD HAVE PROBABLY LIKE YOU SAID TO BE ABLE TO TRAVEL SOME PLACE ELSE WHETHER IT BE THE UNITED STATES OR OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY .
UHHUH .
I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD UM EXPERIENCE FOR ME .
WELL I THINK SO IT PUTS YOU OUT ON YOUR OWN AND .
UHHUH .
AND IN A TIME AFTER HIGH SCHOOL UM THERE S KIND OF A SELFISHNESS I MEAN TEENAGERS IN OUR COUNTRY ARE KIND OF KIND OF A YEAR THAT PARENTS DO NT LOOK FORWARD TO AND .
UHHUH .
AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND I THINK THAT IT WOULD HELP PEOPLE TO BECOME .
YES .
LESS SELFCENTERED .
UHHUH .
AND TO BE MORE RESPONSIBLE WHEN YOU RE OUT ON YOUR OWN TRYING TO UM .
UHHUH .
THINKING LESS OF YOUR OWN NEEDS BUT .
YEAH .
OF OTHER PEOPLE .
AND I THINK YOU KNOW WE HAVE SUCH A NEED NOW YOU KNOW I TAUGHT YOU KNOW I I THINK I WAS PAID UH ABOUT NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO TEACH FOR THE YEAR .
UHHUH .
AND I WORKED IN A VERY RURAL SCHOOL DISTRICT AND I I ONE OF THE THINGS I TAUGHT WAS A COMPUTER CLASS .
UHHUH .
AND THESE KIDS UM YOU KNOW EVERY GIRL I TAUGHT EXCEPT FOR ONE WAS PREGNANT .
OH NO .
MANY OF THE BOYS IN THE ROOM HAD CHILDREN AND THEY WERE THEY WERE HIGH SCHOOL JUNIORS .
UHHUH .
AND I JUST THERE YOU KNOW THEY CAME FROM POVERTY THEY WERE GOING TO CONDITION IN POVERTY AND IT WAS IT WAS THE SCHOOL DISTRICT COULD NT HIRE MANY PEOPLE IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO HIRE AND I THINK YOU KNOW IN THE SENSE THAT ASPECT OF PUBLIC SERVICE FOR EDUCATION IN SOME OF THE INNER CITIES .
RIGHT .
FOR UM JUST SOCIAL WORKERS IN SOME OF THE INNER CITIES AND SOME OF THE RURAL AREAS WHERE THEY JUST NEED ADVICE ON MEDICAL UM THINGS .
UHHUH .
I THINK IT S A REALLY GOOD IDEA AND EVEN IF IT IS OVERSEAS SEE I NEVER I I TELL YOU SOMETIMES I WORRY ABOUT THINGS OVER SEAS BECAUSE WE HAVE SUCH PROBLEMS RIGHT HERE IN OUR OWN COUNTRY .
YES .
UHHUH .
IT WOULD REALLY UM AND I DO NT THE PEOPLE THAT I VE KNOWN LIKE FROM GERMANY AND FINLAND THAT HAVE DONE THAT .
YEAH .
ARE THEY DO MILITARY SERVICE WHICH YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
I DO NT EXACTLY RECOMMEND .
YEAH .
BUT STILL THEY HAVE BENEFITED FROM IT .
RIGHT UHHUH .
AND UM YOU KNOW ALTHOUGH I WOULD NT WANT IT MUMBLEX TO MAKE PEOPLE TO GO OFF TO THE MILITARY VOLUNTARILY BUT .
UHHUH .
IT S IT HAS HELPED THEM AND THEY ARE JUST A LOT MORE MATURE .
UHHUH .
THAN THE AVERAGE STUDENT AND .
YEAH I THINK IT WOULD ALSO HELP THEM IF THEY THEN WENT ON TO COLLEGE I KNOW THAT MY FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS OF COLLEGE WERE UM UH PROBABLY TOO CAREFREE AT THE .
UHHUH .
BEGINNING AND THEN AT THE END I HAD TO BE TOO SERIOUS MUMBLEX .
WELL THAT S RIGHT A LOT OF PEOPLE THEY FLUNK OUT OR THEY GET .
UHHUH .
THEY JUST GET SO EXCITED TO BE AWAY FROM HOME .
UHHUH .
THEY JUST SPEND ALL THERE TIME PARTYING AND .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
THEY DO A LOT OF THINGS TO THEMSELVES THAT THAT WE REALLY DO NT WANT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE DOING AND .
UHHUH THAT S RIGHT .
UM .
I YEAH I THINK I THINK THIS WAS THIS WAS A VERY INTERESTING TOPIC .
YEAH .
UH BECAUSE IT S SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW WE DO NT TALK ABOUT IN THIS COUNTRY PROBABLY ENOUGH .
UHHUH .
UH YOU KNOW .
BE BECAUSE WE RE SO WE LOVE OUR FREEDOM .
UHHUH .
AND OUR FREEDOM OF CHOICE .

AND UM HAVING PEOPLE BUT YOU KNOW OUR LIKE IN OUR CHURCH IT IT IS YOUR FREE TO DO THAT OR NOT .
UHHUH .
YOU RE ENCOURAGED TO DO IT BECAUSE UM YOU KNOW IT IT HELPS YOU AND OF COURSE WE THINK IT S HELPING OTHER PEOPLE .
OH I THINK IT IS .

I REALLY THINK I THINK UM PEOPLE YOU SHOULD I YOU KNOW THE KIDS TODAY I TEACH I SPEND A LOT OF MY TIME TEACHING COLLEGE STUDENTS .
UHHUH .
AND UM I FIND GREAT DISGUST IN THEM IN THEIR IN THEIR UM THEIR SELFCENTEREDNESS .
UHHUH .
AND THEIR INABILITY TO UNDERSTAND UM MULTICULTURAL OR MULTIRACIAL SITUATION .
UHHUH .
AND I REALLY YOU KNOW THEY DO NT UNDERSTAND UH HOW OTHER PEOPLE LIVE UM THEY DO NT UNDERSTAND .
AND THEY RE PREOCCUPIED WITH .
UHHUH .
DRINKING .
YEAH I THINK THAT S UH JUST HAVING A GOOD TIME .
UHHUH AND .
I UH A FRIEND OF MINE IS A PSYCHOLOGIST AND HE ALWAYS REFERS TO IT AS SHORTTERM PLEASURE ORIENTED .
I GUESS HE S A TECHNICAL ASPECT HE LIKES TO APPLY TO IT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW TODAY S YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SHORTTERM PLEASURE ORIENTED .
THAT S TRUE .
AND EVERYTHING HAS TO BE AN IMMEDIATE REWARD AND IT HAS TO BE FUN .
THAT S REALLY TRUE .
UHHUH YEAH .
YEAH WELL I I DO NT KNOW HOW THAT WOULD EVER HAPPEN HERE BUT AT LEAST UM .
WELL THEY SAY I THINK I UM HAVE READ RECENTLY THAT UH THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAS INCREASED THE FUNDING FOR THE PEACE CORPS .
OH REALLY .
UHHUH BECAUSE I GUESS BECAUSE OF THE CHANGES IN EASTERN EUROPE UH THEY VE INCREASED FUNDING FOR THE PEACE CORPS SOME OF THE I GUESS IT S SOME OF THE PEACE DIVIDEND IN THE SENSE YOU KNOWN .
UHHUH .
WHEN THEY RE DECREASING SOME OF THE MILITARY SPENDING .
HUH .
SOME OF THAT MONEY HAS GONE INTO THE PEACE CORPS AND SOME OF THE ARE THE OVERSEAS PROGRAMS UH .
WELL I HAVE SEEN A BIG CHANGE I THINK IN HIGH SCHOOL KIDS THAT MY RELATIVES .
UHHUH .
AND FRIENDS THAT UM I KNOW WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL I HAD AN IDEA OF WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO DO WITH .
UHHUH .
WHAT MY WHAT I WAS GOING TO STUDY AND AT LEAST I HAD SOME INTEREST IN A LOT OF THE YOUTH THAT I COME IN CONTACT WITH ARE THEY SAY OH I WANT TO BE A DOCTOR I WANT TO BE A LAWYER WHY BECAUSE THEY MAKE A LOT OF MONEY .
YEAH YEAH THAT S TRUE .
AND THEY DO NT HAVE A GOAL THEY DO NT HAVE A GOAL THEY DO NT HAVE AN INTEREST IN THEIR OWN FIELD OF STUDY .
UHHUH .
THEY RE JUST LOOKING WHAT S GOING TO PAY THE BIGGEST CASH .
YEAH THAT S VERY TRUE YOU KNOW HOW MANY IS IT THEY SAY WE HAVE SO MANY LAWYERS IN THIS COUNTRY AND I GUESS I I LIVE NEAR WASHINGTON BEING IN IN BALTIMORE IT S SOMETHING LIKE ONE IN FOUR PEOPLE .

UHHUH .
AND AND THA HOW COME EVERYBODY IS A LAWYER YOU KNOW YOU KNOW .

UHHUH .
FOR UH BECAUSE OF A SERVICE THAT THEY COULD PROVIDE .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW IF YOU WANT TO BE A LAWYER BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE A SERVICE THAT PEOPLE NEED .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE LAWYERS IN THIS COUNTRY UM BUT IF YOU RE JUST DOING IT BECAUSE YOU THINK THAT S THE BEST WAY TO .

SOUNDS LIKE WE HAVE NO CONFLICT WE HAD FOR A WHILE I WAS CARRYING ONE CARD AND MY WIFE WAS CARRYING A DIFFERENT ONE AND SINCE THE SLIPS ALL LOOK ALIKE UH YOU COMMINGLE THEM AND THEN YOU GET THE STATEMENT AND YOU TRY TO SORT THEM OUT UH AND IT UH IT CAUSED MORE CONFUSION ABOUT IT I FINALLY SAID GEE THIS IS KIND OF A WASTE OF TIME AND THEN WHEN A T AND T CAME ALONG AND OFFERED A FREE ONE UH I ACCEPTED THAT AND WE VE BEEN USING THAT ONE UH THE INTERESTING THING IS IS THAT UH THE AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU CAN CAN RUN UP ON THEM I DO NT KNOW DO YOU KNOW ANY PEOPLE THAT RUN UP BIG BIG BILLS .
I M I M YOU KNOW I M IN THE AGE GROUP YOU GET OUT OF COLLEGE AND I THINK A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE THEM MAXED OUT .
WELL DID UM WERE YOU ABLE TO GET ONE WHILE YOU RE IN COLLEGE .
UM I DO NT THINK I EVER TRIED .
JUST CURIOUS BECAUSE I HAVE A SON THAT S A SENIOR THIS YEAR AND HE S HEADING OFF WITH ANY KIND OF LUCK BUT THERE HAS BEEN I VE HAD A COUPLE OF ADS FOR FOR FOR TO PROVIDE A CARD FOR A COLLEGE STUDENT UH WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE IDEA OF PROVIDING ONE FOR SOMEBODY LIKE THAT .
UM WELL YEAH I I YOU KNOW IT S YOU KNOW FEASIBLE I MEAN I KNOW A LOT OF COLLEGE KIDS WHO HAVE THEM YOU KNOW WHO HAD THEM BUT JUST DEPENDS .
WELL THAT THAT THAT I GUESS FROM THE FROM THE CARD ISSUER UH THAT SINCE SINCE IT S IT S IN MO THE PARENT GETS IT FOR THEM THAT REALLY THE PARENT BECOMES THE ONE THAT S RESPONSIBLE BUT IT S .
YEAH SO BASICALLY IF YOU WANT TO TAKE THE RISK .
YES IT S WHETHER THE PARENT WANTS TO TAKE THE RISK .
IT S YOUR RISK DO YOU TRUST YOUR YOUR SON .
YEAH TO TO GO RUN UP A BIG BILL AND THE THING IS THERE SOME ADVANTAGES IF HE GOT OFF .
UHHUH .
SOME PLACE AND STRANDED I I M I M LEANING TOWARDS DOING IT .
UHHUH .
FOR FOR CONVEN .
I D SAY DO YOU KNOW HAVE ONE WITH YOU KNOW .
A CONVENIENCE .
AT LEAST A THOUSAND DOLLAR CREDIT LIMIT OR SOMETHING .
YEAH AND THE IDEA THAT YOU KNOW IF HE GOT IN TROUBLE THERE S SOME SOME WAYS OF GETTING OUT AND THAT HE DOES NT HAVE TO CARRY CASH THE UH I I LIKE THE IDEA OF CREDIT CARDS THAT UH I DO NT I DO NT I DO NT CARRY CASH AROUND AND AND UH I DO NT EVEN CARRY CHECKS AROUND I LET MY WIFE TAKE THE CHECKBOOK AND SHE WRITES THE CHECKS AND I RECORD THEM SO IT S UH IT S UH IT S BUT IT S INTERESTING THAT UH THE PEOPLE THAT CAN THAT CAN UH THE AMOUNTS OF MONEY YOU CAN RUN UP WI ON ON CREDIT CARDS AND UH I I HAD RECENTLY HAD SOME DEALINGS WITH A FELLOW THAT THEY HAD RUN UP HE WAS MAKING OH CONSIDERED A MODEST SALARY FOR AN ENGINEER AND HE HAD RUN UP UH MORE THAN A YEARS SALARY IN IN VARIOUS DEBTS TO AND HE WOUND UP DECLARING BANKRUPTCY BUT THERE IT IT S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT YOU D RUN UP TWENTY THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OF UH WELL IT WAS A COMBINATION OF THINGS .
UHHUH .
HE HAD THERE WERE THERE WERE SEVERAL CREDIT CARDS AND THEN THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER BUSINESSES BUT UH I I GUESS WHAT S INTERESTING HAVE YOU SEEN THE THE THE THE ADS WHERE THEY RE OFFERING TO EXTEND PAYMENTS FROM UH THINGS LIKE UH LIKE THE CREDIT UNION S OFFERING .
THE THE EXTENDED LOAN PAYMENT FOR YOUR CAR .
YES YEAH .
YEAH I SAW THAT .
THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT THAT IS IS THAT UH THAT THAT THEY RE ENCOURAGING YOU TO INCUR MORE INCUR MORE DEBT AND .
WELL IT S IT S IT S BUSINESS AND THEY RE MAKING MONEY OFF THAT .
AND THEY MAKE MORE MONEY IF YOU EXTEND YOUR LOAN .
YEAH AND AND IT S SO IT S BUSINESS SO AND YOU NOTICE THAT THEY RE THEY RE ONLY GOING TO DO IT TO LIKE CARS THAT ARE ONE OR TWO YEARS OLD .
YES .
AND SO THEY VE ALREADY SHIFTED THE RISK IF THEY ASSUME THAT CAR THEN THEY JUST HAVE TO SELL IT THEMSELVES AND THEY LL RECOVER THE LOAN .
AND THEY KNOW THAT PEOPLE OWN A CAR THAT NEW UNLESS ABSOLUTELY DIE OF SERVICE MUMBLEX THEY RE NOT GOING TO KEEP ON IF THE CAR WERE OLDER .
UHHUH .
THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT IT IS IS THAT FROM A UH UH AN ECONOMY STANDPOINT OR IN ECONOMICS I I THINKS IT S I THINK IT S POOR POOR UH ECONOMICS TO TO CARRY ALL THAT CONSUMER DEBT .
YEAH .
AT LEAST FROM A TAX STANDPOINT SO IT S INTERESTING THAT THAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IS ENCOURAGED TO INCUR ALL THAT DEBT AND THEN NEXT YEAR NONE OF IT WILL BE DEDUCTIBLE AND THIS YEAR IT S TEN PERCENT OR SO .
YEAH UH .
IT S UH IT S INTERESTING THAT THAT UH THEY ENCOURAGE US TO DO THINGS .
WHAT NOW WHAT S TEN PERCENT WE CAN DEDUCT .
I THINK TEN PERCENT YES .
I DID NT KNOW THAT .
OF YOUR OF YOUR CONSUMER CREDIT OH IF YOU HAD A THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT MEANS THERE S ANOTHER HUNDRED DOLLAR DEDUCTION I VE GIVEN YOU .
I DID NT THINK YOU COULD ANY THING ON A LOAN OR .
YEAH IT S ON UH YEAH .
I MEAN A MORTGAGE I KNOW YOU CAN .
YEAH ON THE THE THERE S THERE S THERE S A PLACE FOR CONSUMER DEBT AND THEN YOU TAKE TEN PERCENT OF IT ON THE .
OH I VE NEVER ITEMIZED YET .
OH OKAY .
SO MAYBE THAT S .
IT S ON SCHEDULE UM .
SCHEDULE A OR .
SCHEDULE A UNDER UH WELL IT S THE SAME PLACE IT S THE SAME PLACE YOU PUT UH INTEREST BUT BUT SEE THAT S WHAT THAT S WHAT MAKES TEXAS SQUIRRELLY LAWS THAT YOU CA NT YOU CA NT TAKE OUT A A SECOND MORTGAGE LIKE SOME STATES WHERE YOU CAN TAKE OUT THE MORTGAGE AND DECLARE THAT AND SO UH IT S FULLY DEDUCTIBLE THE LAWS ARE A LITTLE SQUIRRELLY BUT IT BASICALLY COMES DOWN TO IT S NOT IN YOUR BEST INTEREST TO BORROW MONEY FROM A TAX STANDPOINT .
YEAH .
BUT UH ANYWAY .
YEAH I TRY I I REALLY DO I JUST TRY TO STAY OUT OF DEBT AND I AND I USE MY VISA FOR FOR AS MUCH AS I CAN AND I PAY IT ALL OFF AND .
SOUNDS LIKE YOU RE YOU RE VERY RESPON VERY FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE IT S UH .
UHHUH .
THAT S UH THERE RE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO REALLY RUN MY BOSS DRIVES QUITE A WAYS TO WORK AND HE S GOT JUST ENORMOUS DEBTS AND HE S BUT I MEAN WHAT DO YOU SAY IT S LIKE SHUCKS BOSS I M SURE SORRY YOU VE GOT ALL THAT DEBT WELL HE S HAD HAD TWO KIDS IN COLLEGE AND AND THIS KIND OF THING AND THAT .
UHHUH .
I THINK THAT THE WHOLE CREDIT CARD ISSUE I THINK THEY CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO RUN UP THE DEBTS AND BUT I AGREE WITH YOU .
YEAH .
I DO NT I MUMBLEX MY DEBTS WELL I DID BUY A NEW HOUSE LAST SUMMER .
HELL I TOOK A FIVE YEAR NOTE OUT ON MY CAR WHEN I RIGHT WHEN I GOT OUT OF COLLEGE AND UH I LL NEVER DO THAT AGAIN I STILL GOT A COUPLE OF YEARS ON IT TO GO AND I M .
IT S IT S REMARKABLE HOW MANY PEOPLE AS SOON AS THEY GET OUT OF COLLEGE BUY A NEW CAR AND THAT UH APPARENTLY THAT S BEEN GOING ON FOR A REALLY LONG TIME I DID NT DO IT I I BOUGHT A SECOND HAND CAR WHEN I WAS THE MIDDLE OF MY SENIOR YEAR .
WELL YOU YOU THINK YOU RE STARTING OUT WELL UNTIL YOU START PAYING ALL THOSE BILLS .
YEP .
UH APARTMENT RENT AND .
MISCELLANEOUS THINGS LIKE FOOD AND .
YEAH .
OTHER THINGS THESE HABITS YOU GET INTO EATING AND AND UH IT S IT S IT S AMAZING HOW IT WHAT YOU LEARN .
YEAH SO .
WELL ANYTHING ELSE GOOD TO SAY ABOUT CREDIT CARDS .
UM .
I MIGHT JUST .
YOU KNOW THEY RE CONVENIENT YOU KNOW THAT S PROBABLY ONE BIG THING ABOUT THEM AND UH .
YOU DO NT HAVE TO CARRY THE CASH AND AND UH AND IT S IT S IT S CERTAINLY ACCEPTED MORE PLACES THAN THE PLACES YOU KNOW IT S HARD TO CASH A CHECK IF YOU RE OUT OF STATE AND .
YEAH WELL I WAS USED TO USING MY CREDIT CARD LIKE AT SKAGGS ALPHA BETA IN DALLAS AND STUFF .
YEAH .
AND NOW I M OUT HERE IN PHOENIX .
THEY DO NT ALLOW THEY DO NT DO THA .
THEY THEY NONE OF THESE GROCERY STORES TAKE ANY CREDIT CARDS SO NOW I HAVE TO CARRY CASH WHEN I GO TO THE GROCERY STORE WHICH IS NEW TO ME YOU KNOW I GOT TO HAVE SIXTY BUCKS ON ME OR SOMETHING .
YEAH .
SO UH .
CARRY ALL THAT CASH WITH YOU .
THAT WAS INTERESTING CAUSE I ALWAYS YOU KNOW YOU .
WELL YOU KNOW THEY THEY .
DID NT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT CARRYING THAT MUCH UNLESS I KNEW I .
THEY VE STARTED TOWARDS A LITTLE BIT OF THE DEBIT CARD HAVE YOU SEEN THE DEBIT CARDS WHERE THEY ACTUALLY DEBIT YOUR ACCOUNT WHEN YOU .
YEAH I VE HEARD ABOUT THEM .
YEAH AND I THINK THAT S WHERE .
THAT S MOSTLY LOCALLY THE BANKS WILL LINE UP WITH UH .
YEAH I VE SEEN A COUPLE ALTHOUGH THE SO MANY OF THE GROCERY STORES DO NT DO THAT BECAUSE OF THE THE TIME FRAME WHICH THEY GET PAID IN GENERAL THAT UH THEY I VE SEEN CHECKS DEPOSITED THE VERY NEXT DAY I MEAN CLEARED MY ACCOUNT THE NEXT DAY MY WIFE WILL WRITE A CHECK FOR GROCERIES AND YOU KNOW ALMOST WELL I GUESS IT S THE DAY AFTER UH TECHNICALLY IT S TWO DAYS BUT THE THE THEY TOOK THAT CHECK AND SCURRIED IT TO THE BANK AND THE BANK SCURRIED IT BACK TO MY ACCOUNT AND YOU THOUGHT THERE D BE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF FLOAT BUT APPARENTLY THAT S WHY THE UH THE UH THE UH GROCERY STORES ARE RELUCTANT TO DO THAT BECAUSE THEIR VOLUME THAT IS QUITE HIGH AND THEY HAVE UH THE COSTABILITY OF THE CASH FLOW IS A BIG ISSUE FOR THEM .
YEAH .
ANYWAY WELL IT S GOOD TALKING TO YOU .
ALL RIGHTY .
MAYBE WE LL GET ACROSS WE LL CROSS PATHS AGAIN GOOD NIGHT .
ALL RIGHTY TAKE IT EASY .
SO CHILD CARE YOUR VIEWS .
UH WELL WE ONLY HAVE ONE CHILD RIGHT NOW AND ANOTHER ONE ON THE WAY AND RIGHT NOW I M I M ALL WITH HER DURING THE DAY I IF I WAS LOOKING FOR OUTSIDE CARE I PROBABLY WOULD STAY AWAY FROM PROFESSIONAL CHILD CARE CENTERS AND TRY TO FIND IF I WAS CLOSE TO HOME RELATIVES OR PEOPLE WITH IT IS SAME VALUES AND POSSIBLY RELIGIOUS FAITH OR SOMETHING SIMILAR SO THAT SHE WOULD BE RAISED IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT WOULD BE SIMILAR TO WHAT WE WOULD HAVE IN OUR OWN HOMES AS AS PARENTS .
AND WHAT RELIGIOUS FAITH .
UH LATTER DAY SAINTS .
OH .
SO .
THAT S THAT S GOOD .
SO THAT S WHAT I WOULD TRY TO DO WITH A TEACHING BACKGROUND I VE UM HAD A LITTLE BIT OF EXPERIENCE WITH THE CHILD DAY CARE TYPE SITUATIONS BUT I VE SEEN SOME GOOD ONES AND I VE SEEN SOME REALLY BAD ONES .
UH THEY DO SEEM TO BE AT THE OUTSIDE EDGE OF BOTH EXTREMES DO NT THEY .
UHHUH AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN YEAH IN MOST STATES THERE S NOTHING TO REGULATE THEM .
AND .
AND SO .
WHENEVER THEY ARE THEY SEEM TO REGULATE THE GOOD TOWARD THE BAD INSTEAD OF BAD TOWARD THE GOOD .
RIGHT BY TRYING TO GET THEM TO CONFORM TO CONCERN STANDARDS THEY UH KIND OF UH ELIMINATE A LOT OF THE UH .
BETTER SITUATIONS .
YEAH THE THE UH WHAT AM I TRYING TO THINK OF THAT NOT THE IMAGINATION BUT THE CREATIVITY IN IN THE SITUATION AND SO .
YEAH YEAH THAT S THAT S VERY WELL PHRASED .
UH SO HAVE YOU EVER USED OUTSIDE CHILD CARE .
NO I HAVE NT WE VE HAD LIKE PEOPLE COME IN AND BABYSIT FOR AN HOUR OR TWO BUT I VE NEVER HAD UM .
REAL DAY CARE .
RIGHT SHE S SHE S NOT EVEN A YEAR YET SO .
UH .
WE HAVE NT BEEN IN YOU KNOW A LOT OF NEED YET .
OUR STEP DAUGHTER S TEN NOW .
UHHUH .
AND MOST OF THE DAY CARE HAS BEEN PROVIDE FOR BY GRANDMA .
I LIKE THAT SITUATION THAT S USUALLY REAL GOOD .
BUT QUITE HONESTLY WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE THE BEST DAY CARE SITUATION WAS WHILE WE LIVED UP THE PASS OF WOODLAND PARK .
UHHUH .
THERE WAS UH EXSCHOOL TEACHER THAT UH DID A SMALL AMOUNT OF BEFORE SCHOOL AND AFTER SCHOOL YOU KNOW KINDERGARTNERS OR HALF DAYERS .
UHHUH .
IN HER HOME AND THEY WOULD READ AND PLAY .
HAVE A RELATIVE STRUCT A STRUCTURED .
SEEM TO BE .
ACTIVITIES AND NOT JUST YOU KNOW STICK THEM IN A CORNER AND SAY YOU RE ON YOUR OWN .
UH YEAH AND UH DESPITE OUR BELIEFS SHE WAS UH ONE OF THE MORE UH CHARISMATIC CHRISTIAN FAITHS .
UHHUH .
AND IT WORKED OUT WONDERFULLY .
YEAH I KNOW THAT UH THAT I GUESS IF YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PICK AND CHOOSE AND YOU VE GOT THE TIME AND THAT UH I DO NT KNOW IF THE RESOURCES ARE THE PROPER TERM YOU KNOW JUST THE THE KNOW KNOWLEDGE OF WHO S A AVAILABLE THEN YOU COULD PROBABLY FIND SOME REALLY GOOD CARE .
UH YEAH BUT I DO NT KNOW THAT IT WOULD BE STATE APPROVED .
THAT S TRUE YOU CAN GET SOMEBODY MAYBE WILLING TO BABYSIT BUT ACTUAL YOU KNOW THAT S SOMETIMES DIFFERENT DONE ON A DIFFERENT SCALE I HAVE EVEN CONSIDERED YOU KNOW BABYSITTING MYSELF I HAVE A TEACHING DEGREE AND UH THOUGHT WELL YOU KNOW I COULD STRUCTURE AND THEN FOR ONE REASON OR OTHER DECIDED NOT TO BUT I THINK IF YOU TAKE MORE THAN THREE CHILDREN IN WELL THAT WAS HOW IT WAS THIS VIRGINIA WE VE RECENTLY MOVED HERE TO TEXAS BUT IN VIRGINIA I THINK IF YOU TAKE MORE THAN THREE CHILDREN IN ON MORE THAN A SEVERAL HOURS A DAY BASES YOU HAVE TO BE LICENSED .
I NOW I DO NT KNOW WHAT THE CURRENT TEXAS LAWS ARE BUT I BUT I DO KNOW THAT THE LICENSE DOES NT SEEM TO UH GUARANTEE QUALITY .
YEAH A LOT OF TIMES YOU MIGHT JUST NEED TO GO NOW AND FEEL FILE FOR IT JUST LIKE A BUSINESS YOU MAY NOT HAVE TO PROVE ANY TYPE OF QUALIFICATION FOR IT I DO NT .
UH NOW HERE I BELIEVE THAT CHILD CARE MEETS BY IN LARGE CERTAIN STANDARDS FOR UH BALANCED FOOD IF THEY PROVIDE FOOD CLEANLINESS AND LEVELS OF SUPERVISION .
UHHUH .
LEVELS BEING DEFINED AS NUMBER OF WORKING ADULTS FOR NUMBER OF CHILDREN .
UHHUH .
BUT .
THAT S UH KIND OF A MINIMUM THERE THAT YOU RE GETTING YOUR COVERING BASIC CARE THERE AND NOT ALL THE EXTRAS THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO SEE DONE WITH THERE CHILDREN YOU KNOW LIKE THE EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES THE SUPERVISED PLAY AND SO FORTH .
YEAH UH MY WIFE IS UH AGNOSTIC AND I M UH A BACKSLIDING PRESBYTERIAN .
I LIKE THAT TERM .
AND UH GET I REALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS CHARISMATIC CARE OR THE CHARISMATIC BELIEF WHEN EMPHASIZED ON CARE OR SEMI CHARISMATIC I MIGHT SAY .
UHHUH .
WAS QUITE GOOD .
YEAH IT WAS A GOOD INFLUENCE FOR YOUR DAUGHTER UH .
YES VERY .
WELL THAT S GOOD .
AND AND UH THE CARE IS WHAT I GUESS YOU SHOULD EMPHASIZE IN THE TERM CHILD CARE INSTEAD OF THE CHILD .
UHHUH YEAH A LITTLE BIT OF LOVE AND AND ATTENTION IS WHAT MOST OF THEM NEED YOU KNOW EVEN IF IT S NOT A REAL EDUCATED PROGRAM YOU CAN HAVE GOOD EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM AND AND .
AND NOT HAVE ANY CARE .
RIGHT AND AND THAT S NOT CERTAINLY WHAT YOU WANT FOR YOUR CHILD OR WHAT YOU WOULD GIVE YOUR CHILD YOURSELF AND SO .
AND I M NOT SURE THAT REALLY CHILD CARE PER SE SHOULD INSTILL ANY EDUCATION PER SE DO YOU KNOW HAD A I M SAYING .
WELL EVEN EDUCATED PLAY UH SUPERVISED PLAY CAN TEACH WITHOUT AND I M NOT SAYING TALKING ABOUT SITTING DOWN AND TEACHING THEM MATH OR OR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT JUST KIND OF PROMOTING SOCIAL SKILLS AND UH UH YOU KNOW LIKE MY MY CHILD THAT SHE WANT BE AN ONLY CHILD FOR LONG BUT YOU KNOW SHE WAS AN ONLY CHILD OR MAYBE YOUR DAUGHTER .
PROPER INTERFACE .
NOT HAVING YEAH YEAH JUST .
IT S JUST JUST CORRECTNESS OF OF SOCIAL SKILLS IF YOU WILL .
RIGHT THOSE BASIC THINGS THAT UH THEY WOULD THAT YOU KNOW YOU WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT OF UH I DO NT KNOW IF MANNERS IS A GOOD TERM OR NOT BUT .
YOU KNOW DEALING WITH OTHER THROUGH PROPER MANNERISMS AND POLITENESS AND SO FORTH YOU KNOW THAT SORT OF THING YOU D WANT YOUR CHILD TO LEARN THAT FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF SOMEONE ELSE CERTAINLY YOU WOULD NT WANT YOUR CHILD S DAY CARE PERSON TO YELL AT THEM AND SCREAM AT THEM AND SAY DO THIS DO THAT YOU KNOW YOU D WANT THEM IT PROMOTE POLITENESS AND NICENESS YOU KNOW THE THINGS THAT YOU WOULD WANT ANY CHILD TO LEARN AND .
THE REASON THAT S DONE THROUGH EXAMPLE YOU KNOW NOT AN ACTUAL SIT DOWN LEARN SITUATION SO .
UH YEAH UH IT S A VERY BROAD ISSUE .
UHHUH IT IS .
AND YOU KNOW IT S A SHAME BUT MOST PEOPLE DOING CHILD CARE EARN ALMOST NO MONEY THEY OPERATE AT YOU KNOW THE OWNER OF THE CHI OF A YOU KNOW A LARGE CHILD CARE FACILITY NOW .
UHHUH .
WE RE NOT TALKING SOMEBODY THAT DOES SIX KIDS .
UHHUH .
IN THEIR HOME OR THREE OR WHATEVER .
SOMEBODY THAT DOES NT REALLY PUT A LOT OF OVERHEAD WHATEVER INTO IT YOU MEAN SOMEBODY THAT HAS AN ACTUAL ESTABLISHMENT .
RIGHT .
YEAH .
THEIR EMPLOYEES EARN ALMOST NOTHING .
YEAH I KNOW I I DID THAT FOR SUMMER SO I CAN I CAN VOUCH FOR THAT .
AND THAT S REALLY REALLY A SHAME TOO BECAUSE DO YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND BOTH WORK .
NO JUST HE DOES I M I M HERE DURING THE DAY WITH HER .
WELL THAT S WONDERFUL IF IF YOU CAN MAKE IT THAT WAY .
WELL WE WE DECIDED TO WE LIVE ON A LESSER BUDGET SO THAT WE HAVE THAT THAT S MORE IMPORTANT TO US YOU KNOW AS AS UH THERE MAY COME A TIME WHEN I WILL BE WORKING AGAIN YOU KNOW BUT RIGHT NOW THAT S WHAT WE VE CHOSEN AND WE WANTED TO HAVE SEVERAL WE GOT HER AND WE VE GOT ANOTHER ON THE WAY .
WELL .
AND MAYBE ANOTHER .
LIKE I SAID .
ONE SOON AFTER THAT SO .
THAT S GRAND IF IF YOU CAN PULL IT OFF .
RIGHT .
BUT MORE AND MORE WE RE BEING FORCED INTO A SITUATION WE AS AMERICANS ARE BEING FORCED INTO A SITUATION WHERE YOU VE GOT TO HAVE .
OKAY UM .
LET S TALK ABOUT THE MIDDLE EAST SITUATION .
THE U S INVOLVEMENT IN THERE THEN I GUESS EVEN THOUGH .
NOW THAT S IT S ALL OVER WITH YOU KNOW .
WELL IT IS OVER BUT I DO NT THINK WE RE OUT OF THERE BY ANY MEANS AND UH I WONDER ARE WE GOING TO SET UP YOU KNOW PEACE KEEPING TYPE FORCES FOR LONG TERM YOU KNOW IS THAT SOMETHING WE SHOULD DO OR SHOULD NT DO I DO NT KNOW .
I DO NT KNOW I UNDERSTAND THAT THE U S IS TALKING ABOUT LEAVING MORE OF ITS PLANES AND THINGS OVER THERE UH I GUESS THEY UH THEY RE ANTI U S IN THAT REGION AND NOW THEY RE YOU KNOW LIKE SYRIA AND EGYPT YOU KNOW HAD SOME PRESSURE AGAINST THE U S BUT NOW THEY NOW THEY WOULD NT ALLOW US TO HAVE A BASE IN THAT REGION BUT NOW I THINK THEY ARE RETHINKING THAT .
I THINK THAT S TRUE BECAUSE OF ALL THE SUPPORT THAT CAME THROUGH .
THAT S RIGHT .
THE OTHER THING THAT I THINK IS GOOD FOR LIKE AMERICAN BUSINESSES ARE TO BE INVOLVED IS THE THE REPORTS THAT I HEAR BACK AND OF COURSE ON THE NEWS I TRY TO LISTEN AND ALSO READ BETWEEN THE LINES YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
BUT THEY SAID THAT BECAUSE THE AMERICANS YOU KNOW TOOK SUCH A PROACTIVE STANCE INVOLVEMENT IN THE WAR THAT LIKE SO MUCH OF THE BUSINESS AND THE REBUILDING IN KUWAIT AND THINGS LIKE THAT WILL GO TO AMERICAN BUSINESSES WHERE AS BEFORE THEY MAY BE DEALT WITH JAPANESE FIRMS OR OTHER PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
THEY SAID EVEN THOUGH THE JAPANESE WERE INVOLVED MONETARILY UH THEY STILL LIKE THE FIRST FIRST PRIORITY OUGHT TO GO TO AMERICAN BUSINESSES WHICH I GUESS WILL BE GOOD YOU KNOW WHICH WILL BE GOOD FOR OUR ECONOMY .
RIGHT RIGHT .
BUT I YOU KNOW .
THEY GET SO MUCH OF OUR MONEY FROM OIL ANYWAY .
BOY DO NT YOU KNOW I MEAN WE DO NT SEEM TO SLOW DOWN EVEN WHEN THERE IS A CRISIS .
NO NO .
BUT .
YEAH I THINK THAT S A NICE GESTURE ON THE KUWAITI GOVERNMENT PART TO DO THAT AND A FEW PEOPLE I GUESS WILL MAKE A FEW PEOPLE PRETTY WEALTHY IN CONSTRUCTION AND SO FORTH .
I IMAGINE YOUR OIL COMPANIES THEY MAY SEE .
RIGHT .
PROBABLY THE FIRST BIG RISE IN BUSINESS THEY HAVE SEEN IN YEARS .
GO OVER THERE AND REBUILD ALL THOSE .
UHHUH .
I THINK IT S SUCH A SHAME THAT THE IRAQIS HAD TO JUST GO DESTROY EVERYTHING I JUST .
I DO TOO .
I MEAN WHAT S WHAT GOOD IS THAT IF I CA NT HAVE IT YOU CA NT HAVE IT YOU KNOW THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING A LITTLE KID WOULD DO YOU KNOW .
YEAH BUT LOOK AT THEIR WAR THAT WAS HIS WHOLE WAR IS IS I M NOT SATISFIED WITH WHAT IRAQ HAS I WANT WHAT EVERYBODY HAS .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND AND YOU RE RIGHT IT S LIKE YOU SEE TWO LITTLE PRESCHOOL KIDS FIGHTING OVER A TOY YOU KNOW .
UHHUH UHHUH .
I I AM A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT YOU KNOW I KNOW THEY ARE PUTTING PRESIDENT BUSH RIGHT NOW IN AN AWKWARD POSITION CONCERNING THE .
THE .
THE TREATY OVER THERE RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW WHAT AM I TRYING TO SAY .
THE DEAL WITH THE UH SUPPORTING THE KURDS .
WELL SUPPORTING THE KURDS BUT UH YOU KNOW THE CEASEFIRE .
RIGHT RIGHT THE CEASEFIRE .
I M TRYING TO SAY ANOTHER BECAUSE HE YEAH .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW BECAUSE HE HE WANTS THEM TO UPHOLD THEIR END OF THE DEAL AS FAR AS THE CEASEFIRE BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE S NOT WANTING TO GO IN AND SAY OKAY I M GOING TO FIGHT YOUR WAR FOR YOU WHICH WHICH I THINK IS RIGHT .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW IF IT S AN INTERNAL THING I DO NT THINK WE CAN WALK IN AND SAY GEE I THINK YOU RE RIGHT AND YOU RE WRONG YOU KNOW WE RE NOT THE JUDGE AND JURY .
UHHUH .
UH BUT I KNOW THAT THAT S CAUSING HIM A LITTLE BIT OF UNPOPULARITY WITH THE PEOPLE OVER THERE BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE GEE YOU TOLD US .
YEAH TO HELP OUT .
TO STAND UP AGAINST HIM BUT YOU RE NOT HELPING .
YEAH .
SO I THINK HE S IN A PRETTY AWKWARD POSITION NOW AND I I THINK WE OUGHT TO HELP YOU KNOW .
MAYBE SUPPLY SOME ARMS OR SOMETHING .
YEAH SUPPLY ARMS AND SUPPORT THEM IF THEY NEED HELP BUT I DO NT THINK WE OUGHT TO BE OVER THERE FIGHTING IT FOR THEM AND AND SO I THINK HE S DONE GOOD ON THAT STANCE .
YEAH I THINK BUSH HANDLED HAS HANDLED THIS WHOLE SITUATION QUITE WELL HE STOOD UP TO TO THE BULLY AND .
YEAH .
DID NT BACK DOWN AND UH AND UH SADDAM HUSSEIN MISCALCULATED ALL ALONG .
BOY I WOULD SAY .
THINKING THAT HE WOULD NT COMMIT U S LIVES AND AND FORCES AND AND MONIES TO JUST TO LIBERATE A LITTLE COUNTRY .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND UH THEN HE UNDERESTIMATED HIS ABILITY TO TO WAGE A WAR WITH US I MEAN ONE THING WHEN WE ALL CAME OVER THERE AND SAID OKAY HERE WE ARE GET OUT AND HE SAID NO I CAN I CAN WIN A WAR WITH YOU GUYS .
YEAH YEAH .
AND THAT WAS A HORRIBLE MISCALCULATION .
I AGREE YOU KNOW THEY D ADVERTISED AND SAID IN THE NEWS AND SAID HE HAD THE FIFTH LARGEST ARMY WELL HE MAY HAVE BUT YOU .
NOT ANY MORE .
WELL NOT ANY MORE BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE LOYALTY YOU HAVE TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN YOUR CAUSE .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW I KNOW THEY TRIED TO TURN IT INTO A HOLY WAR BECAUSE TO THEM THAT IS WHAT S HONORABLE YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
IF YOU DIE IN A HOLY CAUSE BUT I THINK THEY ARE SMART ENOUGH .
YEAH .
TO SEE THERE S NOTHING HOLY ABOUT IT WE JUST WANT TO GO IN AND TOOK IT .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW .
SADDAM HUSSEIN IS NOT A RELIGIOUS PERSON BUT HE USES IT .
SURE .
WHEN HE SEES IT TO HIS ADVANTAGE .
SURE .
AND UH AND I THINK THE PEOPLE WERE SMART ENOUGH TO REALIZE THAT AND I THINK THEY RE AFRAID OF HIM IS WHAT THEY ARE .
UH .
THE POPULATION IS AFRAID TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST HIM AND I DO NT THINK HE S GOING TO BE THERE TOO MUCH LONGER .
WELL I HOPE THAT S TRUE .
SOMEONE IS GOING TO ASSASSINATE HIM YOU KNOW .
I WOULD THINK SO I WOULD THINK THAT YOU KNOW I GUESS IN THE BACK OF MY MIND I THINK LIKE MAYBE THE ISRAELI MASSAD PROBABLY HAS IDEAS OF GOING IN AND HUH .
YEAH YEAH .
YOU KNOW I THOUGHT THEY UH SHOWED A TREMENDOUS RESTRAINT IN THEIR REACTIONS TOWARDS EVERYTHING .
UHHUH .
BUT I DO NT BELIEVE FOR A MINUTE THAT THAT MEANS THAT THEY DO NT HAVE IDEAS AND PLANS OF THEIR OWN .
THAT S RIGHT .
BUT I DO AGREE WITH YOU .
YEAH .
I THINK PRESIDENT BUSH HANDLED IT ALL POLITICALLY VERY SMART YOU KNOW GIVING THE SUPPORT OF OF THE OTHER ARABS AND OTHER NATIONS IN THE WORLD AND I THINK THAT S HOW YOU HAVE TO GO INTO SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
RIGHT RIGHT I VE HEARD REPORTS THAT PRESIDENT BUSH WAS STAKING HIS FUTURE ON THIS UH THIS WAR AND THAT SETTING A PRECEDENT SAYING THAT THIS LEAGUE OF NATIONS WILL ALWAYS COMBINE AGAINST BULLIES AND TO STOP THIS KIND OF STUFF IN THE WORLD ANY WOULD BE BULLY WOULD THINK TWICE IF HE KNEW THAT YOU KNOW THERE S THIS UNITED NATIONS OR WORLD GOVERNMENT OR WHATEVER THEY KEEP TALKING ABOUT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD WILL DEAL WITH YOU .
AND DO NT YOU FEEL .
AND YOU CA NT YOU JUST CA NT DO IT AND GET AWAY WITH IT YOU KNOW HOPING THAT YOU KNOW .
THAT S RIGHT .
BECAUSE IT S A WORLD THING AND THE NATIONS WILL COMBINE AGAINST YOU AND YOU CA NT YOU KNOW YOU CA NT JUST DO THIS .
AND DO NT YOU THINK THAT LONG TERM THAT S BEEN A BIG BOOST FOR THE UNITED NATIONS .
OH YEAH .
I MEAN THE UNITED NATIONS BEEN THERE FOR YEARS BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN .
HAD NO HAD NO TEETH .
YEAH THERE ARE SOME TEETH BEHIND IT AND THE FACT THAT WHEN THEY HAVE SANCTIONS AND WE SUPPORT THINGS LIKE THIS IT MEANS SOMETHING .
RIGHT .
AND I THINK THAT S GOOD FOR THE STRENGTH OF THE UNITED NATIONS .
PEOPLE I GUESS I FEEL SORRY FOR JUST THE AVERAGE YOU KNOW IRAQI .
YEAH .
WHO HAS HAD TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THIS AND THE SUFFERING I M SURE WITH NO WATER .
AND REBUILD FROM NOTHING .
NO ELECTRICITY NO SANITATION .
YES .
MUST BE TERRIBLE LIVING CONDITIONS MUST BE TERRIBLE .
YEAH .
AND IT S NOT GETTING ANY BETTER THE SANCTIONS ARE STILL ON .
THAT S TRUE .
YOU KNOW EXCEPT FOR A FEW MEDICAL SUPPLIES THEY ARE ALLOWING THROUGH NOW AND THEN POWDERED MILK I GUESS FOR BABIES AND THINGS AND UNTIL THEY I GUESS YESTERDAY THEY CAME OUT WITH THIS THESE RULES I GUESS OR WHATEVER .
RIGHT THEY SUPPORTED IT .
FOR A PERMANENT PERMANENT CEASEFIRE AND THE KUWAITIS SAID WE DO NT WANT TO HAVE TO REPAY ISRAEL FOR ALL THE BOMBING THAT WE DID THAT WAS IN THERE YOU KNOW .
THAT IS RIGHT .
BUT THAT S ONLY FAIR .
YEAH THEY DID ASK THAT THEY BUILD UP ISRAEL AND KUWAIT .
YEAH .
AND I THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE TO .
YEAH .
THEY LOST .
IT S GOING TO BE REALLY TOUGH FOR THEM TO SWALLOW BUT WE DO NT WANT A KUWAIT THERE THAT S ALSO YOU KNOW JUST HAS NO POWER AT ALL AND THAT THAT YOU KNOW BECAUSE IRAN STILL IS NT TOO FRIENDLY WITH THEM .
WELL THAT S TRUE .
AND WE DO NT WANT YOU KNOW TO BE STABILIZED TO THE POINT WHERE IRAN WILL SAY NOW IS OUR CHANCE YOU KNOW TO GO IN AND WIPE THEM OUT AND .
WELL I DO NT THINK IRAN IS UNDER THE SAME TYPE OF MADMAN TYPE LEADERSHIP .
YEAH YEAH .
BUT THERE S ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY I GUESS .
YEAH YEAH SINCE KHOMEINI DIED OVER THERE THINGS HAVE GOTTEN A LITTLE MORE NORMALIZED .
I THINK SO .
NOT QUITE AS RADICAL A STANCE MORE MODERATES ARE IN POWER NOW .
I THINK THE PERSON WHO REALLY MAY BE AT THIS TIME HAS A HARD ROAD TO TOW IS JORDAN S KING HUSSEIN BECAUSE HE REALLY KIND OF .
YEAH PUT IN THE MIDDLE .
REALLY TRIED TO KIND OF STRADDLE THE FENCE YOU KNOW HE WAS NT NECESSARILY FOR IRAQ BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE DID NT FEEL LIKE EVERYBODY OUGHT TO BE GOING AGAINST IRAQ .
AND YET SO MANY OF THE CITIZENS ARE THE UH THE LEBANESE .
YEAH .
WHO WERE HOPING THIS WOULD EVOLVE INTO A WAR AGAINST ISRAEL .
RIGHT .
AND UH TRYING TO CONNECT WITH ISRAEL ALL THAT TIME AND THERE REALLY WAS NO CONNECTION AT ALL .
NO .
AND UH BUT BOY THOSE LEBANESE IN JORDAN THEY WERE SAYING YOU KNOW THIS WHOLE WAR IS ISRAEL S FAULT BECAUSE ISRAEL TOLD THE UNITED STATES TO ATTACK IRAN IT WAS LIKE IT WAS LIKE YOU KNOW ISRAEL CONTROLS OUR GOVERNMENT .
I KNOW IS NT THAT AMAZING THE WAY THAT THEY WILL FIND THEIR CAUSE NO MATTER WHAT SITUATION THEY SEE THEY RE GOING TO FIND THEIR CAUSE WHETHER IT TRULY EXISTS OR NOT .
RIGHT BUT ONE THING I DID LEARN WAS HOW DEEP THE THE HATRED RUNS TOWARD ISRAEL BY A LOT OF COUNTRIES .
I KNOW .
THEY JUST HATE I MEAN ANYWAY THEY CAN YOU KNOW THEY CAN SEE TO CONNECT INTO SOMETHING AND HATE IT MORE I MEAN THEY JUST I UNDERSTAND MOST OF THE LAND IS NOW ISRAELIS THEY BOUGHT .
THAT S TRUE .
AND ACTUALLY PURCHASED IT AND THEN AND THEN MOVED IN AND STARTED A COUNTRY .
BUT SEE YOU ARE ALSO GETTING BACK TO THE AGES OLD PROBLEM OF ARABISRAELI CONFLICT .
RIGHT .
AS FAR AS PERSONALTIES AND WHO IS THE SELECTED ONE OF GOD AND THEIRS TIE SO MUCH TO THEIR RELIGION .
YEAH RIGHT RIGHT AND THEY BOTH HAVE HOLY SANCTIONS .
SO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS THAN WHAT WE FACE .
OKAY WHAT KIND OF MUSIC DO YOU LIKE .
WELL I UH SEVERAL YEARS AGO A RADIO BROKE IN MY CAR .
UHHUH .
AND I NEVER I GOT OUT OF THE HABIT OF LISTENING TO THE RADIO AND SO I HAVE NT BEEN LISTING I I USED TO JUST LISTEN TO THE ROCK STATIONS .
UHHUH .
BUT UM LATELY I HAVE BEEN GOING BACK TO CLASSICAL MUSIC I DO NT REALLY KNOW WHAT TOO MANY OF THE MOST POPULAR SONGS ARE UNLESS YOU KNOW THEY RE IN THE THE NEWS OR SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
BUT UM SO I TEND TO LISTEN TO SOME OF THE OLDER SONGS THAT WERE POPULAR BACK WHEN I WAS PAYING ATTENTION .
UHHUH .
AND THEN I LIKE SOME CLASSICAL MUSIC .
UHHUH .
AND SOME OF THE PIECES THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND A WHILE I HAVE NT PAID MUCH ATTENTION TO MOST OF THE CURRENT MUSIC WHAT ABOUT YOU .
UM I LISTEN I LISTEN TO A WIDE VARIETY OF MUSIC SOMETIMES I LL TURN ON THE CLASSICAL MUSIC SOMETIMES I LL LISTEN TO JAZZ .
UHHUH .
UH EVERY NOW AND THEN COUNTRY AND WESTERN UM I LL LISTEN TO SOME OF THE ROCK STATIONS I ALSO LIKE THE UH THE THE CLASSIC ROCK STATIONS .
UHHUH .
THAT PLAY THE OLDER MORE MELLOW TYPE ROCK MUSIC UM SOME OF THE SOME OF THE ROCK STATIONS NOW ARE THE I GUESS THE TOP FORTY STATIONS OR WHATEVER THEY JUST IT REALLY GETS ON MY NERVES BECAUSE THEY PLAY SO MANY COMMERCIALS AND .
UHHUH .
SOMETIMES THE DEEJAYS ARE JUST KIND OF ANNOYING AND IRRITATING .
THAT S TRUE .
AND IT GETS KIND OF OLD AND THEY PLAY THE SAME SONGS OVER AND OVER .
AND I JUST GET KIND OF TIRED OF ALL THAT .
UHHUH .
SO LOTS OF TIMES .
I LL JUST PLAY CASSETTES INSTEAD OF LISTENING TO THE RADIO ACTUALLY BUT UH MOST OF MY CASSETTES I GUESS I DO NT I DO NT LIKE HARD ROCK .
NO .
UM I HAVE SOME SOME ROCK AND SOME JAZZ AND A COUPLE MAYBE ONE OR TWO COUNTRY AND WESTERN SOME UH OH I CA NT BELIEVE I CA NT THINK OF HIS NAME UM GARTH BROOKS .
UHHUH .
I HAVE A COUPLE OF HIS TAPES .
AND UM BUT IT S MAINLY IT S MAINLY JUST THE THE LIGHT ROCK TYPE STUFF .
YES I DO NT I NEVER LIKED ANY OF THE HEAVY METAL .
UHHUH .
MUSIC I NEVER REALLY LISTENED TO IT BECAUSE I YOU KNOW I PREFER TO HAVE MORE I GUESS AN ESTABLISHED PATTERN OF MUSIC TO LISTEN TO .
UHHUH .
BUT AND I BACK A LONG TIME AGO WHEN THE RAP MUSIC FIRST CAME OUT .
UHHUH .
IT WAS KIND OF A NOVELTY AND I LISTENED TO SOME OF IT .
UHHUH .
BUT I YOU KNOW NOW THAT THERE S JUST A MILLION RAP GROUPS AND .
AND UH THEY TRY TO TEND TO TRY TO DO OUTDO EACH OTHER WITH RACINESS I THINK .
OH YEAH .
AND SO I YOU KNOW I M NOT ATTRACTED TO THAT AT ALL BUT UM IT MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN MY LIFE NOT TO HAVE A RADIO THAT WAS MUMBLEX EASY ACCESS AND SO NOW THAT I DO HAVE ONE I JUST DO NT AUTOMATICALLY TURN IT ON .
UHHUH .
UNLESS THERE S SOMETHING I M PARTICULARLY LISTENING TO BUT YOU KNOW IF YOU GO TWO OR THREE YEARS WITHOUT HAVING THAT WHAT I GOT THE MOST EXPOSURE TO .
UHHUH .
IT REALLY CHANGED MY LIFESTYLE AND KEPT ME FROM JUST HAVING A YOU KNOW EASY ACCESS TO CURRENT MUSIC AND SO I DID LIKE I SAY TEND TO GO BACK TO ALBUMS AND .
UHHUH .
CASSETTES AND THINGS THAT I HAD ALREADY HAD .
UHHUH .
PURCHASED BUT WE DO NT HAVE A C D YET DO YOU .
NO I DO NT I SURE DO NT BECAUSE I HAVE SO MANY ALBUMS AND CASSETTES I FEEL LIKE GOSH I M GOING TO HAVE TO GO OUT AND BUY A C D PLAYER AND THEN START COLLECTING C D S AND IT JUST .
UHHUH .
I HAVE NT GOTTEN AROUND TO DOING IT YET .
YEAH I I KIND OF DECIDED TO WAIT UNTIL IT IT WAS AROUND A WHILE IT WAS KIND OF LIKE REMEMBER WHEN PERSONAL CALCULATORS FIRST CAME OUT .
YEAH YEAH .
AND THEY WERE REALLY REALLY EXPENSIVE AND THEN NOW YOU CAN GET ONE FOR TWO OR THREE DOLLARS .
JUST LIKE V C R S TOO .
UHHUH UHHUH .
YEAH I THOUGHT OF THAT TOO THAT IF I WAIT IT LL GET A LOT LESS EXPENSIVE AND I CAN DO WITHOUT IT FOR A WHILE .
SURE AND ALSO THEY GET BETTER QUALITY .
UHHUH .
W AND THEY LEARN TO HAVE MORE FEATURES AND THINGS AND .
UHHUH .
WITHOUT AND MAKING THEM LESS EXPENSIVE SO WE RE KIND OF WAITING TO LIKE UH NOW YOU KNOW AND THE PRICE OF CASSETTES HAS GONE DOWN .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE C D S ARE SO POPULAR SO .
THAT S AND A C D IS A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE THAN A CASSETTE EVER WAS TOO RIGHT NOW I THINK .
I HAVE NT EVEN PRICED THEM I GUESS THEY MUST BE .
THEY RE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TEN AND FIFTEEN DOLLARS A PIECE .
OH REALLY .
YEAH .
THAT IS AWFUL .
YEAH I BOUGHT SOME AT CHRISTMAS TIME FOR FRIENDS OF MINE THAT HAVE C D PLAYERS I THOUGHT MY GOSH .
UHHUH .
NOW I KNOW ANOTHER REASON WHY I M NOT GOING TO GET A C D PLAYER FOR A WHILE .
TAKE OUR TIME .
RIGHT .
WELL I CA NT IMAGINE UM YOU CA NT RECORD ON THEM AND SO THEY WO NT BE AS FUNCTIONAL AS LIKE A CASSETTE PLAYER WHERE IF YOU HEARD SOMETHING YOU COULD RECORD IT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW UH IF YOU HAVE I GUESS IF YOU WANTED TO RECORD SOMETHING TO PLAY OUT IN YOUR CAR OR SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
THAT YOU D HEARD OR THAT YOU OWNED AN ALBUM OF SO C D S WO NT BE NEARLY AS HANDY .
YEAH SEE I VE GOT A ON MY STEREO I VE GOT A A UH TURNTABLE AND THEN I VE GOT A DUAL CASSETTE SO I CAN RECORD OFF OTHER CASSETTES .
UHHUH .
BUT I NEVER REALIZED YOU COULD NT RECORD ONTO C I JUST NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT BECAUSE I HAVE NT REALLY LOOKED INTO IT VERY MUCH I DO NT HAVE ONE AND .
UHHUH .
AND I VE NEVER REALLY LOOKED AT ONE VERY CLOSELY BUT THAT THAT WOULD BE INCONVENIENT BECAUSE I HAVE A CASSETTE PLAYER IN MY CAR NOW I GUESS YOU KNOW ONE OF THESE DAYS WHEN I GET A NEW CAR MAYBE I GUESS ALL OF THEM WILL PROBABLY HAVE C D S PLAYERS BY THEN .
YES .
BUT UH I M NOT PLANNING ON DOING THAT FOR A WHILE I JUST GOT MINE PAID OFF .
ENJOY IT .
I M GOING TO STICK WITH THE CASSETTES AND AND UH YOU KNOW UNTIL UNTIL THEY NOW MY SISTER MY YOUNGER SISTER HAS A SHE DOES HAVE A C D PLAYER THAT SHE GOT FOR CHRISTMAS AND SHE S GOT THE THE CASSETTE SO SHE CAN RECORD OFF CASSETTES ONTO C D S I MEAN I M SORRY O OTHER WAY AROUND .
UHHUH .
OFF C D S ONTO CASSETTES .
UHHUH .
UM .
WELL THAT S GOOD .
SO I CAN RECORD SOME THINGS FROM HER AND YOU KNOW GET CASSETTES AND RECORD OFF OTHER ONES OR OFF THE RADIO IF I WANT TO BUT .
UHHUH .
BUT UH I JUST HAVE NT GONE TO C D YET .
WHY WE HAVE NT EITHER BUT WE YOU KNOW WE LIKE THE THE IDEA OF HAVING GREAT EXTRA QUALITY YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
IN YOUR MUSIC AND THINGS BUT BUT I M SATISFIED TO JUST HAVE WHAT I VE BEEN USED TO NOT HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE GREAT FINANCIAL .
UHHUH .
SACRIFICE THAT THAT WOULD BE TO SUDDENLY TRY TO SWITCH OVER TO ALL C D S OR SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
BUT I KNOW ONE THING THAT HAS COLORED MY MUSIC CHOICE IS WHEN WE HAD CHILDREN UM I REALLY STARTED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT KIND OF TELEVISION PROGRAMS I WAS WATCHING .
RIGHT .
AND WHAT KIND OF MUSIC I WAS LISTENING TO AND .
UHHUH .
ACTIVITIES BECAUSE UM YOU KNOW I JUST DID NT WANT THEM TO BE EXPOSED TO A LOT OF THINGS AND A LOT OF THE LOT OF THE SONGS HAVE SOME LYRICS THAT UM .
OH YEAH .
I JUST WAS NT PLEASED WITH .
AND THEY GET WORSE AND WORSE TOO .
YOU KNOW UHHUH AND SO I REALLY THINK WE VE TRIED TO TONE DOWN .
UHHUH .
OUR TASTE THERE TO MAKE UH YOU KNOW OUR CHILDREN NOT BE EXPOSED TO SO MANY NE NEGATIVE THINGS SO EARLY IN LIFE .
UHHUH WELL THAT S AMAZING HOW I USED TO WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE I USED TO HAVE THE STEREO ON ALL THE TIME OR I HAD ON M T V OR SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
BUT EVER SINCE I VE BEEN OUT OF COLLEGE I GUESS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS I LISTEN TO THE STEREO LESS AND LESS NOW I I WILL TURN ON I VE GOT A SMALL JAM BOX IN MY BATHROOM I LL TURN THAT ON WHILE I M IN THE SHOWER AND WHILE I M GETTING READY BECAUSE THERE S REALLY NOT MUCH ELSE I CAN DO .
UHHUH .
AND IT S KIND OF BORING STANDING THERE PUTTING ON MAKEUP SO I LL TURN THE RADIO ON AND .
RIGHT .
AND THEN I LISTEN TO IT WHEN I M IN THE CAR DRIVING TO WORK BECAUSE AGAIN THERE S YOU KNOW THERE S NOTHING ELSE GOING ON I MIGHT AS WELL LISTEN TO THE RADIO WHILE I M DRIVING TO WORK .
RIGHT .
BUT OTHER THAN THAT I VE I REALLY DO NT I DO NT LISTEN TO THE RADIO OR EVEN TO MY ALBUMS OR CASSETTES OR ANYTHING VERY OFTEN ANYMORE I GUESS I M JUST TOO BUSY DOING OTHER THINGS THAT IT S TOO MUCH TROUBLE TO GET UP AND GO DECIDE WHAT I WANT TO LISTEN TO .
AND PUT IT ON THE ON THE TURNTABLE I DO NT KNOW I JUST DO NT DO NT BOTHER TO DO IT VERY MUCH ANYMORE .
YES I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN I I KNOW MY HUSBAND HE UM PLAYS AN INSTRUMENT AND HE PLAYED IN THE BAND WHEN HE WAS IN COLLEGE AND IN HIGH SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
AND SO HE HAS A LOT OF ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF MUSIC AND HE GOES OUT OF HIS WAY TO PLAY MARCHING BAND MUSIC .
UHHUH .
OR LIKE YOU SAY JAZZ OR CLASSICAL TO THE CHILDREN TO TO GIVE THEM SOME EXPOSURE TO DIFFERENT KINDS OF MUSIC .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK THAT S REALLY GOOD BECAUSE THEY RE LEARNING TO LIKE ALL DIFFERENT KINDS AND .
THAT S GOOD WHAT INSTRUMENT DOES HE PLAY .
HE PLAYS THE IT S A EUPHONIUM IT S LIKE A SMALL A REALLY SMALL NOT A TUBA BUT I TH IT S HARD TO EXPLAIN .
UHHUH .
I NEVER HAD KNOWN ANYONE TO PLAY ONE BEFORE .
UHHUH I VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT .
BUT IT S KIND OF LIKE A SMALL SMALL TUBA BUT IT S NOT THE KIND THAT SITS UP ON YOUR SHOULDER .
UHHUH .
BUT IT S A CROSS BETWEEN A TUBA AND AND AN AND YOU KNOW A HORN IT S A BRASS INSTRUMENT .
UHHUH .
SO HE PLAYS THAT AND AND A LITTLE BIT OF PIANO AND .
UHHUH .
BUT HE HAS SOME REAL FOND MEMORIES OF MARCHING BAND .
UHHUH .
AND CONCERT BAND TYPE ACTIVITIES AND HE THINKS THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE KIDS .
UHHUH OH I M SURE IT IS I M SURE IT IS I WAS EXPOSED TO A LOT OF MUSIC WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I MY PARENTS HAD ME TAKE PIANO LESSONS FOR EIGHT YEARS .
UHHUH .
AND SO I WAS I WAS A REAL GOOD PIANO PLAYER BUT THEN I GOT INTERESTED IN A LOT OF OTHER THINGS AND I GOT REAL INVOLVED IN MANY THINGS AND AND NOW I DO NT HAVE A PIANO IN MY APARTMENT OR ANYTHING I COULD SIT BACK DOWN AND PLAY A FEW THINGS .
UHHUH .
BUT NOT LIKE I USED TO BE ABLE TO IT S KIND OF SAD THAT I VE LET THAT SLIP AWAY .
UHHUH .
AND I TOOK GUITAR LESSONS I THINK FOR ONE OR TWO YEARS AND UH THAT WAS ABOUT THE SAME TIME I WAS TAKING PIANO AND THEN I GOT TOO BUSY IN HIGH SCHOOL TO REALLY KEEP UP WITH IT BETWEEN HOMEWORK AND .
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE UH PEACE CORPS OR PUBLIC SERVICE COMMITMENT .
UH THAT S THE FIRST I VE EVER HEARD OF IT .
I HAVE NT HEARD OF IT ANYTHING TOO MUCH ABOUT IT .
UM .
WELL I THINK IT WAS UH THOUGHT UP WHEN THERE WAS SO MUCH CONTROVERSY ABOUT REVIVING A DRAFT AND PEOPLE SAID WELL THEY UH YOUNG PEOPLE .
WHO WERE DRAFTED HAVE TO PROVIDE MILITARY SERVICE TO THE COUNTRY BUT THERE ARE AN AWFUL LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE .
WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM UM SOME SORT OF PUBLIC SERVICE .
UHHUH .
LIKE THE CONSERVATION CORPS BACK IN THE THIRTIES OR UH VARIOUS OTHER THINGS OF THAT SORT .
AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT S IT S NOT A TOTALLY BAD IDEA BUT I DO NT QUITE SEE HOW THEY D MAKE IT WORK .
UHHUH .
HOW WOULD THEY DECIDE WHO GOES INTO UH BUILDING FIRE BREAKS IN YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK AND WHO GOES TO SAUDI ARABIA .
RIGHT YEAH .
I THE MY FIRST IMPRESSION WAS UM IT WOULD BE V VERY GOOD .
I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR PEOPLE TO SERVE BUT I DO NT KNOW IF IT SHOULD BE AN OPTION .
IT WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE SOME OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS LIKE YOU MENTIONED THAT WERE DURING THE DEPRESSION OR COMING OUT OF THE DEPRESSION AVAILABLE FOR KIDS .
AND I THINK THERE ARE SOME AVAILABLE NOW WHERE THEY ARE ABLE TO WORK BUT MAKING IT .
A MANDATORY THING KIND OF .
YEAH THE THE DIFFICULTY WOULD BE IN WHETHER IT S VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY .
RIGHT .
AND THE PEOPLE .
WHO WERE PROPOSING IT SAID THAT IT SHOULD BE INVOLUNTARY THAT IT SHOULD BE LIKE A DRAFT .
UHHUH .
AND SOME PEOPLE WOULD GET MILITARY SERVICE AND SOME PEOPLE WOULD GET CIVILIAN UH .
UHHUH .
SERVICE LIKE WORKING IN HOSPITALS .
THIS I ASSUME IT S THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT THEY HAD CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS DO .
UHHUH .
WHEN PEOPLE WERE DRAFTED AND THEY REFUSED TO SERVE IN THE ARMY THEY WERE ALLOWED TO DO HOSPITAL SERVICE OR UH THINGS LIKE THAT AND IF THEY .
RE OR FARM WORK IN WORLD WAR ONE .
I REMEMBER .
UHHUH .
UH READING ABOUT .
AND AND I SUPPOSE THAT THERE IS UH JUSTIFICATION FOR TAKING EVERYBODY IF YOU TAKE ANYBODY .
UHHUH .
BUT I JUST REALLY THINK THAT THE DIFFICULTIES INVOLVED IN PAYING THEM UH SORTING THEM OUT ASSIGNING THEM .
UHHUH .
TRAINING THEM WOULD BE INSURMOUNTABLE .
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU D HAVE A LOT MORE CONSCIE CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS IF THEY HAD THAT CHOICE .
YEAH WELL IT S A POSSIBILITY .
YEAH YOU KNOW I D I D MUCH RATHER WORK IN A HOSPITAL THAN THAN TO GO WAR AND I M SURE MOST YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WOULD .
AND SO UH .
WELL I THINK THAT IN THE IN THE CASES .
THAT LIKE THAT UH THEY HAD TO BE UH PRETTY THOROUGHLY EXAMINED TO PROVE THAT THEY HAD PACIFIST AND RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND SO FORTH .
UHHUH .
AND THAT THIS WAS NT .
SOMETHING NEW JUST TO KEEP OUT OF GOING TO WAR .
IT WAS UH SOMETHING .
THAT WAS A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF THEIR PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE .
UHHUH .
WELL THAT MAKES SENSE .
AND THEN YOU RUN INTO AGAIN TO UM THE BUREAUCRACY IN RUNNING IT .
YOU KNOW HOW YOU GOING TO .
OH YEAH .
COVER THAT MANY PEOPLE BECAUSE WE VE GOT A LOT MORE PEOPLE NOW THAN WE DID THEN .
SURE AND .
SO .
IN ADDITION TO THAT WE HAVE THE COST BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO PAY SOMETHING FOR .
RIGHT .
THEIR ROOM AND BOARD AND THEN YOU HAVE TO PAY THEM .
SOME KIND OF A STIPEND .
UHHUH .
UH EVEN IF IT S LIKE THE PEACE CORPS WHERE THEY DO NT GET MOST OF IT UNTIL THEY COME HOME .
UHHUH .
YOU HAVE T HAVE TO PAY THEM .
SOMETHING .
PLUS THE TRAINING INVOLVED .
OH YEAH .
YEAH THAT WOULD BE EXPENSIVE IN MOST CASES .
YEAH .
BECAUSE .
NOW I HAD A LOT OF FRIENDS .
WHO WENT TO THE PEACE CORPS UH BACK IN THE MID SIXTIES .
UHHUH .
AND IT REALLY DID SEEM TO BE A WORTHWHILE ORGANIZATION BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I M NOT SURE WHAT .
THE PERMANENT VALUE OF IT WAS .
I DO NT .
UHHUH .
KNOW WHAT .
WE GOT FOR ALL THE MONEY .
WE HAD AN AWFUL LOT OF IDEALISTIC PEOPLE .
WHO WENT OFF TO UH WHAT WAS THEN EAST PAKISTAN IS NOW BANGLADESH .
UHHUH .
AND TO UH ALGERIA AND TO UH SOUTHEAST ASIA AND LOTS OF UH OUTOFTHEWAY PLACES .
BUT I DO NT KNOW IF THEY REALLY HAD SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS IN THE PLACES WHERE THEY WENT .
UHHUH .
IN TEACHING THE PEOPLE HOW TO COPE WITH THEIR LIVES BETTER .
WELL I KNOW IN I PERSONALLY TOOK A YEAR AND A HALF AND WENT AS A MISSIONARY AND TAUGHT CHRISTIANITY IN JAPAN .
UHHUH .
AND I WAS LIVING SUCH A STRINGENT LIFESTYLE THAT IT WAS VERY BENEFICIAL TO ME .
IT TAUGHT ME NOT TO BE SO SELFCENTERED AND IT YOU KNOW TO THINK OF OTHERS .
UHHUH .
BUT I DO NT KNOW IF I WAS DOING IT IN DIFFERENT SITUATION YOU KNOW NOT A REALLY RELIGIOUS BACKGROUND IF IF I WOULD GET A LOT OUT OF IT .
YOU KNOW I THINK I DID BECAUSE IT YOU KNOW IT EMPHASIZED THAT SORT OF THING .
YOU KNOW A LOT OF .
SURE .
SELF EVALUATION .
AND IT WAS DEFINITELY VOLUNTARY TOO .
THEY WERE NOT DRAFTING YOU AND SENDING YOU .
RIGHT .
AGAINST YOUR WILL .
RIGHT .
AND THAT I M SURE THAT WOULD MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE TOO .
YOU KNOW YOU VE GOT .
YEAH .
WELL WHAT ABOUT A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM .
DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA .
UM WELL LIKE I SAY I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME TYPE OF PROGRAMS THAT THEY HAVE AVAILABLE FOR A YOUTH LIKE TEENAGERS TO GO AND DO UM WORK IN THE NATIONAL PARKS AND WORK IN UH NEIGHBORHOODS TO DO UM CLEAN UP AND THAT SORT OF THING .
BUT I DO NT KNOW WHAT ORGANIZATION .
IT S UNDER .
I DO NT KNOW IF IT S A GOVERNMENT RUN OR IF IT S A PRIVATE .
I DO NT EITHER .
CHARITY .
THAT S PUT IT TOGETHER .
BUT I KNOW THAT THAT HELPS A LOT WITH TRAINING AND UM .
YEAH OUT HERE IN CALIFORNIA .
A LOT OF .
THERE S A PROGRAM LIKE THAT FOR UH JUVENILE DELINQUENTS THE THE ONES .
THAT ARE NOT DANGEROUS AND THEY DO NT HAVE TO BE LOCKED UP GO TO THESE UH CAMPS .
AND THEY .
UHHUH .
DO FORESTRY WORK .
THEY MAINTAIN TRAILS AND THEY UH PUT UP SIGNS AND THEY DO FIRE PREVENTION WORK AND CERTAINLY THINGS OF THAT SORT .
UHHUH .
AND THAT I KNOW IS RUN BY THE STATE BUT THERE MAY BE OTHER THINGS .
I M NOT SO SURE WHAT KIND OF UH TRAINING THAT IS FOR THE FUTURE FOR THOSE KIDS .
YEAH HOW MUCH BENEFIT .
IT S PROBABLY A .
IT LL DO THEM IN THE LONG RUN .
A VERY GOOD WAY TO KEEP THEM OFF THE STREETS AND OUT OF TROUBLE BUT WHETHER IT S SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN PUT TO TO ECONOMIC USE LATER ON IS A DIFFERENT SUBJECT .
RIGHT ESPECIALLY IN YOU KNOW IF YOU TAKE A A CHILD .
THAT S FROM THE INNER CITY AND THEN PUT THEM IN THE A MIDDLE OF A PARK IF THEY GO BACK TO THE INNER CITY THEY MAY NOT SEE TREES FOR A WHILE .
THAT S TRUE .
MUCH LESS BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEM .
GOOD POINT OH .
SO THAT S YEAH SO THAT MAY NOT MAY NOT BENEFIT THEM IN THE LONG RUN .
YEAH .
BUT .
YEAH I M SORRY I M GOING TO HAVE TO GO BUT MY OTHER LINE IS BLINKING .
OKAY WELL THANK YOU .
BUT IT WAS GOOD TO TALK TO YOU .
YOU TOO BYEBYE .
WELL UH IT SEEMS TO ME THAT UH THAT I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THE JURY SYSTEM UH I I SHOULD NOT SAY I DO NOT KNOW I DO NOT FEEL VERY UH STRONGER THAT THE JURY SYSTEM SHOULD BE CHANGED IT SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED UH TIME IMMEMORIAL AND WHEN UH DIFFICULT DECISIONS UH ARE MADE UH UH UH THEY GENERALLY PROVE OUT TO BE RIGHT BY THINGS THAT OCCUR LATER ON .
UHHUH .
UH I KNOW IN SOME CASES NOW IN SOME STATES DEPENDING ON THE CRIMINAL CODE UH A UNANIMOUS VERDICT IS NOT REQUIRED AND INDEED SOME JURIES ARE NO LONGER TWELVE PEOPLE THEY ARE DOWN TO AS LITTLE AS SMALL AS SIX PEOPLE IN I THINK IN PETTY IN IN UH IN UH IN MINOR FELONIES AND UH AND MISDEMEANOR TRIALS .
UHHUH .
UH I THINK THAT THE JUDGES SHOULD BE LEFT TO DO MOST OF THE SENTENCING SIMPLY BECAUSE UH THERE IS ALWAYS UH THERE IS .
THERE IS ALWAYS A JURY THAT MIGHT BE SWAYED UH BY THE MOMENT UH TO EITHER TO BE TOO LENIENT OR TOO VENGEFUL I GUESS .
YEAH ON THE OTHER HAND UH ATTORNEY UH UH JUSTICES ARE MORE APT TO UH UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW THE CR THE PRISON CROWDING PROBLEMS AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
YEAH .
AND HAVE THAT SWAY THEIR DECISIONS ONE WAY OR THE OTHER .
BUT I MEAN IS NOT THAT .
YOU KNOW .
UH IS THAT A REFLECTION THEN OF WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING IN THE REAL WORLD IF IF IF THEY KEEP GIVING EVERYBODY HUNDRED YEAR SENTENCES AND THE PEOPLE IN VARIOUS STATES IT DOES NOT SEEM THAT PEOPLE WANT TO BE TAXED TO BUILD MORE PRISONS OR EVEN IN FOR THAT MATTER UH REPAIR THE UH THE LACK OF JUDGES AND AND AND OTHER UH .
YEAH I THINK THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING I THINK UH THE JUDGES ARE TRYING TO SAVE THE PEOPLE FROM HAVING TO .
THE COST OF NEW PRISONS .
YEAH .
THEY .
YEAH YOU KNOW THAT MIGHT BE IT I MEAN THEY .
THEY ARE SAYING .
THEY CERTAINLY .
OH WELL YOU KNOW .
I DO NOT .
THE THE PEOPLE CAN NOT .
I DO NT KNOW HOW .
AFFORD IT .
IT IS IN VIRGINIA BUT IN FLORIDA NOW UH UH UH AT EIGHTEEN YEARS SOMEONE WAS JUST SENTENCED TO EIGHTEEN YEARS I HEARD IT ON TODAY UH WITHOUT ANY SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION FOR UH UH UH UH UH UH WAVING THE NORMAL UH PROCEDURES AND THE EIGHTEEN YEARS WILL UH TRANSLATE INTO SOMETHING LIKE UH FOUR POINT SEVEN IF EVERY IF THE IF THE PRISONER IS A MODEL PRISONER .
YEAH .
AND INDEED THE PRESENT OVERCROWDING CONDITIONS UH PREVAIL .
PLUS I GUESS THERE WAS SOME CREDIT FOR TIME THIS GUY HAD ALREADY SPENT IN JAIL WAITING FOR TRIAL .
RIGHT .
SO UH YEAH YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT ABOUT THAT I I I DO NOT KNOW IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT ONLY ABOUT UH FROM WHAT I READ ONLY ABOUT NINETY PERCENT OF THE CA ONLY ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF THE PA CASES COME FOR TRIAL ANYWAY .
RIGHT .
AND UH ONLY ABOUT UH F FOUR OR FIVE PERCENT OF UH IN THE IN THE VERY END OR LESS THAN LESS THAN HALF THE TRIALS THAT GO TO UH LESS THAN HALF THE CASES THAT GO TO TRIAL UH END UP W WITH .
WITH A CONVICTION .
UH WITH THE JURY ACTUALLY MAKING THE VERDICT .
OH OKAY .
THAT MOST OF IT IS PLEA BARGAINED UH HALF WAY THROUGH OR OR MOST OF THE CASES ARE PLEA BARGAINED ANYWAY .
RIGHT .
BUT UH UH HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE UH ABOUT THE JURY SYSTEM ITSELF DO YOU DO YOU THINK THAT SHOULD BE CHANGED OR DO YOU DO YOU KNOW IN VIRGINIA WHETHER IT IS IF THEY HAVE SMALLER JURIES OR .
UH I DO NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE SIZE OF THE JURIES I KNOW ONE OF MY FRIENDS WAS UH UH BROUGHT UP FOR JURY DUTY .
YEAH .
FOR AND HE ONLY HEARD VERY YOU KNOW PIDDLY TYPE CASES MOST OF IT WAS UH ROBBERIES OR THINGS LIKE THAT YOU KNOW IT WAS NOT ANY SERIOUS CRIMES SO APPARENTLY EVEN FOR THE SMALLEST CRIMES THEY GIVE THE PERSON THE YOU KNOW ANY FELONY ANYWAYS .
YEAH WELL I GUESS WE .
TH THEY GIVE THE PERSON THE OPTION FOR A JURY .
YEAH I GUESS WE ALWAYS FOCUS ON CRIMINAL TRIALS WITH TH WITH THE JURY BUT I KNOW YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO ASK FOR A JURY IN .
UHHUH .
IN ANY SORT OF A CASE THAT EVEN WHERE DAMAGES ARE ARE ARE UH ARE THE RESULT OF SOME SORT OF A UH AN ACTION THAT YOU ARE BRINGING AGAINST SOMEONE ELSE YOU CAN ASK .
UHHUH .
FOR THAT TO BE HEARD BEFORE A JURY TAKES A HECK OF A LONG TIME I GUESS TO GET THERE .
UHHUH .
IN SOME STATES I I I DO NOT KNOW UH I SHOULD IMAGINE VIRGINIA FROM WHAT I READ UH UH IS LIKE EVERY OTHER STATE IT IT IS FACED WITH UH UH ENORMOUS COSTS TO MAINTAIN THE JURY SYSTEM AND THE PRISON SYSTEM AND THE ENTIRE TRIAL SYSTEM BECAUSE I GUESS .
RIGHT .
EVERYWHERE I READ THAT THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF JUDGES .
RIGHT .
NOT THAT THEY WO NT APPOINT THEM BUT THERE IS NO BUDGET FOR THEM I GUESS OR .
HUH .
AND THE COURTHOUSE THAT GOES WITH THEM AND THE BAILIFFS AND THE CLERK UH .
YEAH WHATEVER .
COURT CLERKS SO IT SEEMS UH NO I I I DO NOT THINK I WOULD CHANGE IT THE MORE I VERBALIZE IT I I DO NOT THINK I WOULD WANT TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM .
RIGHT .
I DO NOT .
UH I DO NOT THINK I WOULD EITHER .
KNOW WHAT WE WOULD REPLACE IT WITH .
YEAH I KNOW IT UH DOES SEEM LIKE THE THE THE THE PURPOSE OF GETTING PEOPLE IN JAIL SO THAT YOU KNOW THE THE I CAN NOT THINK OF THE WORD I AM LOOKING FOR ANYWAY THE DETERRENT .
YES .
FOR PEOPLE TO TO COMMIT THE CRI UH TO NOT TO COMMIT THE CRIME IS SORT OF GONE AWAY PEOPLE HAVE I DO NOT KNOW THEY JUST DO NOT CARE ANY MORE THE BENEFIT I GUESS OF CRIME OUTWEIGHS WHAT THE DETERRENT IS .
UH AND YET .
YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT .
THERE ARE THERE ARE SO MANY THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE IN PRISON I MEAN THE PRISON POPULATION UH AS FAR AS I I UH YOU KNOW MY IMPRESSION OF IT IS THAT IT HAS THAT IT HAS DOUBLED IN THE LAST TEN YEARS AND TRIPLED IN THE LAST TWENTY .
UM .
I MEAN IT SO HAS OUR I GUESS OUR POPULATION HAS GROWN SOME TOO BUT THERE THERE DEFINITELY IS UH UH YOU KNOW TO ME THE ONE OF THE WORST THINGS THAT COULD EVER HAPPEN UH FROM WHAT I READ AND SEE AND UNDERSTAND I MEAN I DO NO THINK I COULD HANDLE PRISON .
YEAH .
I MEAN IT WOULD BE .
WELL I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN .
VERY DIFFICULT .
FINDING OUT WHAT THE UH PERCENTAGE OF DRUG RELATED TYPE THINGS ARE .
WELL THERE MUST BE A .
AND UH .
CA A A A VERY GREAT DEGREE OF THAT .
YEAH .
BUT BUT THERE AGAIN I I DO NOT KNOW IF THE THE JURY SYSTEM ITSELF UH COMES IN TO PLAY THERE I WOULD THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SORT OF BOTHERS ME IS THE ABILITY OF COURSE TH IT IS A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT THAT THE PRESS MUST HAVE HERE IS TH THE INTERVIEWING OF JURORS AFTER THE TRIAL I MEAN THAT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT THAT WHEN A JURY MAKES A DECISION THEY SHOULD NOT BE ASKED UH BEFORE TELEVISION CAMERAS AND NEWSPAPER REPORTERS HOW THEY REACHED THAT DECISION I MEAN I DO NOT .
YEAH .
I IMAGINE THERE IS A CERTAIN CERTAIN RIGHT OF THE PRESS TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO ASK THAT BUT I I WOULD THINK I IF I DID ANYTHING I WOULD PROTECT THE JUROR FROM FROM ANY SORT OF AN INQUISITION AFTER .
WELL I KNOW UH ON THE OTHER HAND THOUGH WHEN UH AFTER THE BARRY TRIAL .
YEAH .
UP HERE YOU KNOW THE BIG LOCAL .
YEAH .
TRIAL .
OH YEAH WELL .
AS WELL AS NATIONAL .
I DO A LOT OF BUSINESS UP IN WASHINGTON I WAS THERE DURING THE DURING THE TRIAL ACTUALLY YEAH .
YEAH AND THE OPPOSITE WAS TRUE OF ME UH AFTER THE CASE WAS OVER I WAS LIKE SOMEBODY GET AHOLD OF THESE PEOPLE AND FIND OUT WHY IN THE WORLD DID THEY VOTE THE WAY THEY DID .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
YEAH YEAH .
IT WAS LIKE WELL A PICTURE IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH WE WANT TO SEE I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WANTED HONESTLY DID THEY WANT THE GUY TO I DO NOT KNOW I MEAN JUST BECAUSE YOU FEEL LIKE HE WAS BEING KICKED ON WHICH HE CERTAINLY WAS YOU KNOW I THINK I NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PICKED HIM OUT AND SELECTED HIM TO BE .
OH I FELT THAT WAY .
PROSECUTED .
I FELT .
BUT .
I FELT .
IT DOES NOT MATTER THE GUY WAS OBVIOUSLY .
NO BUT .
GUILTY .
YEAH I ALWAYS BALANCED IN THE IN THE SITUATION I REMEMBER THE JURORS UH I THOUGHT TO MYSELF HOW DID HOW DID THEY ONLY I THINK THEY ONLY UH FOUND HIM .
ONE ONE COUNT .
GUILTY ON ONE COUNT WHICH WAS UH NOT EVEN WHICH WAS A CLASS SOMETHING FELONY WHICH WAS NOT EVEN PUNISHABLE .
YEAH .
UH UH TO THE DEGREE THAT THEY THOUGHT IT BUT I DO NOT KNOW MAYBE WHEN YOU ARE THERE IN THE R IN THE COURTROOM YOURSELF AND YOU ARE SITTING THERE AND YOU HAVE GOT TO MAKE A JUDGMENT ON SOMEBODY AND THE PROSECUTORS DO A LOUSY JOB OR MAYBE THE EVIDENCE WAS NOT AS SENSATIONAL AS THE MEDIA PRESENTED IT I MEAN I .
YEAH .
I AM NOT MAKING EXCUSES FOR THAT MIGHT BE IT .
WELL YEAH I THINK WE ARE GETTING .
I THINK I AM GETTING A CALL COMING IN .
