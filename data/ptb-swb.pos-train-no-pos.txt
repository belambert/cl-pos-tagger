UH SO DO YOU THINK OUR POLITICIANS ARE HONEST AT THIS POINT IN TIME .
GENERALLY I DO NT THINK THEY ARE .
UH MY MY PERSONAL OPINION IS THAT UH THE POLITICIANS ARE OUT FOR THEIR OWN GOOD BECAUSE THEY THEY RE ENTRENCHED .
UHHUH .
THEY DO NT EVER HAVE TO GO OUT AND GET A REAL JOB .
THEY JUST .
UHHUH .
STAY IN THEIR CURRENT JOB YOU KNOW WHAT .
I MEAN .
I AGREE UH WITH WITH BOTH OF THOSE THINGS BUT UH DO YOU SEE ANY WAY OF LIKE ALTERING IT SO THAT THEY WOULD BECOME MORE HONEST .
I THINK BY PUTTING TERM LIMITATIONS ON YOU COULD YOU COULD SLOW DOWN SOME OF THE PROBLEMS .
UHHUH .
UH BUT IT HAS TO BE NOT JUST AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL BUT AT THE YOU KNOW THE STATE AND THE LOCAL LEVEL TOO .
I KNOW SOME SENATORS AND I DO NT KNOW WHICH ONES BUT THEY VE BEEN IN OFFICE SINCE THE THE NINETEEN FORTIES .
UHHUH .
AND I TH THEY VE NEVER HAD A JOB .
I MEAN THEY VE NEVER GONE OUT IN THE REAL WORLD AND AND PAID NORMAL TAXES .
UM .
I KNOW THEY PAY TAXES BUT THEY DO NT .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW THEY THEY GET PAID A HUNDRED AND TWENTYFIVE GRAND A YEAR .
UHHUH .
WHICH IS MORE THAN TWICE MY SALARY BY QUITE A BIT AND YOU KNOW I M GOING LIKE I I DO NT UNDERSTAND HOW THEY RE SUPPOSED TO BE MY SERVANTS AND YET THEY RE PAID MORE THAN I AM .
UHHUH .
AND THEY WORK LESS YOU KNOW LESS THAN I DO .
UHHUH .
UH THE ONLY PROB THE ONLY PROBLEM .
I SEE WITH TERM LIMITATIONS UH IS THAT I THINK THAT THE BUREAUCRACY IN OUR GOVERNMENT AS IS IN WITH MOST GOVERNMENTS IS JUST SO COMPLEX THAT THERE S A VERY LAR YOU KNOW THERE THERE IS A LEARNING CURVE AND THAT YOU KNOW YOU .
D CA NT JUST SEND SOMEONE OFF TO WASHINGTON AND EXPECT YOU KNOW HIS FIRST DAY TO BE AN EFFECTIVE UH CONGRESS PERSON .
UH I THINK I THINK THERE REALLY IS A THERE S A LOT .
THEY NEED TO LEARN YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GET THERE .
I THINK I THINK THAT S TRUE HOWEVER I THINK THAT S ALWAYS BEEN TRUE .
UHHUH .
I MEAN THAT S TRUE OF THE PRESIDENCY TOO AND WE SEEM TO BE ABLE TO GET ALONG WITH THE PRESIDENT TURNOVER EVER EIGHT YEARS OR FOUR YEARS .
AND UH .
YEAH BUT .
THEY I MEAN THERE IS A LOT TO LEARN BUT MAYBE IT WILL KEEP THEM ON THEIR TOES AND A LITTLE BIT MORE ACTIVE IN TRYING TO CATCH UP .
I THINK TWO YEARS IS TOO SHORT .
UHHUH .
I THINK IT WOULD HAVE TO BE EXTENDED UH YOU KNOW A TERM LIMITATION FOR CONGRESS WOULD BE LIKE THREE TERMS OR EVEN FOUR TERMS OR YOU WOULD INCREASE THE LENGTH OF THE OF EACH TERM OF A CONGRESSMAN .
UH BUT MAYBE STANDARDIZING ON ON A A FOUR YEAR TERM FOR CONGRESS .
UHHUH .
SENATE AND THE THE PRESIDENCY AND THEN UH STAGGERING THEM SO THAT YOU DO NT WE ARE NT TACKLING A MASSIVE BALLOT .
EVERY FOUR YEARS .
UH THE OTHER THE OTHER THING THAT UH BOTHERS ME ABOUT OUR SYSTEM IS JUST THAT UH IN FOR FOR IN IN IN CONGRESS .
THE AMOUNT OF POWER .
ANY ANY PARTICULAR CONGRESS CRITTER HAS IS BASED ON THEIR SENIORITY AND HOW LONG THEY VE BEEN THERE SO IT S YOU KNOW FOR YOU KNOW UH SO UNLESS YOU HAVE ACTUAL YOU KNOW ACROSS THE BOARD S UH LIMITATIONS THE UH YOU KNOW THE IDEA OF WELL WE RE GOING TO JUST WE RE I M I M JUST GOING TO YOU KNOW VOTE VOTE AGAINST THE INCUMBENT .
EVERY TIME DOES NT WORK YOU KNOW IT S GOING TO WIND UP HURTING YOUR STATE IF ALL THE OTHER STATES ARE NT DOING IT AT THE SAME TIME .
UHHUH .
I THINK I THINK THAT THAT S TRUE BUT THEN YOU HAVE YOU HAVE THE SAME ABUSE OF POWER ON THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT COIN .
UHHUH .
UH THE C I .
A IS MOVING OUT TO WEST VIRGINIA .
WHICH IS A REALLY STUPID LOCATION FOR A LARGE AGENCY LIKE THAT AND FOR ALMOST ANY AGENCY .
I MEAN THE ACTION IS NT IN WEST VIRGINIA .
I HATE TO TELL THE S THE SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA .
THIS INFORMATION BUT .
UHHUH .
IT REALLY DOES NT E AR THE WORLD DOES NOT REVOLVE AROUND WEST VIRGINIA .
UHHUH .
UH AS FAR AS THIS COUNTRY IS CONCERNED THE WORLD DOES REVOLVE AROUND D C YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
AS FAR AS THE POLITICS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE CONCERNED THE NATIONAL POLITICS AND THE C I .
A IS A A VERY LARGE VERY HIGH PROFILE AGENCY AND TO HAVE IT LOCATED OUT IN WEST VIRGINIA YEAH YOU KNOW IT MIGHT ONLY BE TWO HOUR DRIVE FROM HERE BUT THAT S A TWO HOUR DRIVE .
YEAH .
AND UH YOU KNOW IT IT S A I THINK IT S A MISTAKE TO MOVE LARGE AGENCIES LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
OR IS IT .
THE F B I .
I DO NT REMEMBER BUT I THINK THERE S .
WELL I MEAN L T I DO NT SEE WHY IT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE .
THE C I .
A BECAUSE YOU KNOW OFFICIALLY THEY DO NT DO THEY DO NT HAVE ANY OPERATIONS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES OTHER THAN ADMINISTRATIVE .
YEAH THAT S OFFICIALLY .
UHHUH .
I MEAN WE .
ALL KNOW THAT THAT S NOT NECESSARILY TRUE .
BUT I I THINK THAT THERE ARE THERE ARE ADVANTAGES TO HAVING SENIORITY AND UH TURN OR NOT HAVING A COMPLETE TURNOVER .
EVERY SOME SMALL NUMBER OF YEARS .
I THINK THERE ARE I MEAN THERE S AN INSTITUTIONAL MEMORY THAT YOU NEED TO MAINTAIN .
UHHUH .
BUT I THINK THAT UH ALL WITH ALL THE PERKS THAT WE VE GIVEN THEM I MEAN I HEARD ON THE RADIO BACK A A FEW WEEKS AGO UH DURING THE INCIDENTS WHERE THEY WERE YOU KNOW LIKE THEY ARE NT PAYING THEIR THEIR RESTAURANT BILLS AND .
UHHUH .
THEY RE BOUNCING CHECKS ALL OVER THE PLACE .
UHHUH .
UH ONE OF THE RADIO STATIONS OVER HERE LISTED OFF EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE PERKS .
HI .
SO DO YOU THINK YOU GET GOOD COVERAGE FROM THE SOURCES THAT YOU HAVE .
UH ACTUALLY NO BECAUSE BECAUSE I M IN SCHOOL .
I I .
KIND OF MISS OUT ON MOST OF THE CURRENT EVENTS .
I JUST CATCH THE MAJOR ONES OFF THE NEWS OR IF SOMEONE STARTS TO TALK ABOUT IT .
DO YOU WATCH A LOT OF T V TO GET THE NEWS THEN .
UH I DO NT WATCH A LOT OF IT BUT THAT S THE ON BASICALLY THAT S MY ONLY MAJOR SOURCE OF INFORMATION .
UM .
WHAT ABOUT WHAT ABOUT YOU .
WELL I READ UH I GET A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT THINGS .
I GET A NEWSPAPER .
EVERY DAY AND I TRY TO AT AT LEAST HAVE A FEW MINUTES TO LOOK THROUGH THAT AND I LOOK THROUGH UH I GET A NEWSWEEK .
EVERY WEEK .
WHICH .
I I PRETTY MUCH READ THAT COVER TO COVER AND I AS FAR AS YOU KNOW THAT SATISFIES MOST OF THE SHORT TERM NEWS .
I GET .
UH DO NT WATCH MUCH T V DO NT HAVE ENOUGH TIME AND UH DO NT LISTEN TO THE RADIO TOO MUCH ESPECIALLY THE NEWS CHANNELS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW THEY MIGHT GIVE YOU .
A LITTLE BLURBS LIKE .
YEAH .
THIS HAPPENED OR THAT HAPPENED AND THAT S ABOUT ALL .
I EVER HEAR OF IT .
UH BUT MOST OF MY NEWS PROBABLY COMES FROM NEWSWEEK AND FOR THE LONGER TERM .
I I READ UH LIKE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN AND AND UH READERS DIGEST AND SOME OF THOSE OTHER TYPES OF MAGAZINES .
THAT COME OUT WHICH THEY THE NEWS IS NT LIKE IMMEDIATE .
WHAT .
YOU D GENERALLY THINK OF AS NEWS BUT IT S RECENT MATERIAL .
AND IT S MORE IN DEPTH .
YEAH IT IS IT IS MORE IN DEPTH LESS BROAD .
WELL ACTUALLY IT S PROBABLY IS NT LESS BROAD BUT IT S JUST MORE IN DEPTH AND UH IT IS IT IS MORE SIG IT IS MORE JUST SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION YOU KNOW .
IT IS THE BIG EVENTS NOT THE LITTLE EVENTS .
YEAH .
NOT THE FACT THAT THERE WAS A BIG AUTO ACCIDENT DOWN ON THE CORNER OF BROAD AND MAIN YOU KNOW .
I KNOW WHERE THEY RE JUST TRYING TO FILL IN .
YES OR THEY RE MAKING MAKING TIME BECAUSE THEY TO FILL IN AN HOUR S WORTH OF NEWS .
YEAH .
UH I GET KIND OF BORED WATCHING T V ACTUALLY WHEN I WATCH THE NEWS ON T V BECAUSE .
I KNOW I DO I DO TOO .
IT GOES SO SLOW AND THEN THERE S NOTHING THAT YOU KNOW REALLY IS LIKE OH SO EXCITING .
YEAH YOU MAY FIND ONE LITTLE UH NEWS ITEM INTERESTING SO YOU HAVE TO WAIT TWENTY MINUTES TO TO HEAR ABOUT IT .
YEAH THAT THAT S ABOUT WHAT .
IT ENDS UP BEING .
LISTEN TO THE NEWS TO HEAR THE TRAFFIC REPORT OR SOMETHING .
YEAH ACTUALLY Y YOU MENTION NEWSWEEK I I I DO LIKE UH U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT .
I DO NT GET TO READ IT AS MUCH AS I LIKE BUT THAT S I THINK THAT S A GOOD MAGAZINE .
YEAH I THINK THEY RE ABOUT THE SAME .
I YOU KNOW THEY THEY CERTAINLY HAVE A VERY SIMILAR UH CHARTER AT LEAST IN MY MIND .
AND UH UH WHAT WHAT KIND OF UH WHAT KIND OF NEWS NORMALLY INTERESTS YOU I MEAN WHAT DO YOU WHAT WHAT DO YOU FIND INTERESTING .
WELL .
VERSUS WHAT DO YOU FIND BORING .
RIGHT NOW TRYING TO KEEP ABREAST OF UH WHAT S GOING ON IN EUROPE YOU KNOW WITH ALL THE U S S R S SATELLITES BREAKING OFF TRYING TO BECOME INDEPENDENT AND YOU KNOW EUROPEAN COMMUNITY COMING TOGETHER .
UHHUH .
THAT S GOING TO AFFECT OUR UH ECONOMY QUITE A BIT .
I THINK IT WILL UH THEY THEY KEEP CLAIMING IT S GOING TO HAVE A BIG INFLUENCE BUT WE VE YET TO SEE IT AND TH IT S REAL SHORT TERM YET THOUGH I MEAN IT S ONLY BEEN THREE MONTHS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
OH YEAH .
SINCE THAT HAPPENED SO .
YEAH .
BUT THEY LIKE TO TELL US THAT IT S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT .
I M I M PRETTY SURE IT IS BECAUSE UH .
I THINK IT IS TOO .
ONCE ONCE EUROPE BECOMES UNIFIED AND UH THEIR ECONOMY BECOMES ONE BIG ECONOMY .
WE RE GOING TO BE UH KIND OF HURTING .
YEAH I I THINK THAT S A POSSIBILITY UH IT WE MIGHT ALSO BE HELPED THOUGH BECAUSE IT IT WILL BE EASIER TO DO BUSINESS OVER THERE TOO .
YEAH DEFINITELY .
FOR THE COMPANIES .
THAT ALREADY HAVE A PRESENCE OVER THERE AND UH I KNOW OF AT LEAST ONE COMPANY .
THAT SPECIFICALLY WENT OVER THERE AND ESTABLISHED A PRESENCE BEFORE NINETEEN NINETYTWO SO THAT THEY WOULD HAVE IT WHEN IT .
OH YEAH .
CAME TIME .
SO THEY HAVE A TOE HOLD I GOOD TOE HOLD .
YEP .
BECAUSE ONCE YOU RE IN THERE THEN YOU CAN EASILY EXPAND .
BUT GETTING IN AFTER NINETEEN NINETYTWO IS MORE DIFFICULT .
YEAH BECAUSE WHEN THEY FIRST START OFF THEY RE GOING TO BE HIGHLY PROTECTIONIST SO .
YES .
YEAH .
AND THERE S ALREADY A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT THEY ARE BEING VERY PROTECTIONIST EVEN AMONGST THEMSELVES THEY RE BEING SOMEWHAT PROTECTIONIST YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
LIKE ENGLAND DOES NT WANT TO DO ONE .
THING AND AND SWEDEN DOES NT WANT TO DO OTHER THING AND THEY RE THEY VE ALL GOT THEIR OWN REASONS .
WHICH HAVE TO BE RESOLVED YET .
UHHUH .
AND SOME OF IT I MEAN IS I M SURE WITHIN THOSE PEOPLE S MINDS IT S QUITE JUSTIFIED .
YEAH I I CAN UNDERSTAND THEIR VIEWPOINT THEY RE JUST THEY RE STARTING OFF THEIR ECONOMY S A LITTLE BIT WEAK SO YOU WANT TO .
UHHUH .
GET ESTABLISHED BEFORE THEY .
BEFORE THEY .
COM .
OPEN UP THEIR BORDERS TO EVERYONE .
YEAH TOTALLY .
UH WHAT IS THE UH DO YOU WATCH ANYTHING LIKE WITH SPORTS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT .
ACTUALLY I M NOT REALLY INTO SPORTS .
MY ROOMMATES ARE SO UNFORTUNATELY I FORCED TO WATCH QUITE A BIT OF SPORTS .
AGAINST YOUR WILL .
YEAH WE HAVE TO FIGHT OVER THE REMOTE CONTROL .
YEAH AT LEAST YOU .
GUYS HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL .
IT S SOMETIMES BETTER TO NOT HAVE ONE OF THOSE .
COURSE YOU CAN ALWAYS MISLOCATE IT .
OR MISPLACE IT I MEAN NOT MISLOCATE IT BUT MISPLACE IT AND .
UHHUH .
HEY STEVE .
UH THEY JUST UH THEY JUST STARTED A RECYCLING PROGRAM HERE I THINK .
ACTUALLY THIS IS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH RECYCLING PROGRAM BUT UH INSTEAD OF JUST LIKE TOSSING EVERYTHING AWAY WHICH .
I ALWAYS FELT BAD ABOUT UH I AM STARTING TO SPLIT STU SPLIT STUFF UP .
THE ONLY DISADVANTAGE IS THAT THEY DO NT PICK IT UP AT THE CURB .
THEY MAKE ME DRIVE IT LIKE A MILE DOWN THE ROAD AND SPIT IT OUT DOWN THERE .
WHAT ARE THEY DOING UP THERE .
WELL HERE IN SASKATOON UH MUCH THE SAME THING .
THERE IS NO CURB PICK UP OF UH ANY OF THE RECYCLED PRODUCTS .
UH WE RE IN A COMMUNITY OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE .
UH THERE ARE AREAS WHERE WE COULD UH ACTUALLY WE HAVE A COUPLE OF THE UH HANDICAPPED SOCIETIES TYPES OF PLACES WHERE THE UH ONE .
THEY DO AS JUST A RECYCLING OPERATION AND THEN OTHERS THEY COLLECT THE PAPER AND SHIP .
IT TO OTHER RETAILERS SO UH WE ARE ABLE TO UH HAVE DROP OFF BINS FOR NEWS PAPERS AND CARDBOARD AND THAT KIND OF THING AND THEN THERE ARE THERE S A UH DEPOSIT PROGRAM ON PLASTIC AND GLASS CONTAINERS .
WELL PRIMARILY SOFT DRINK BOTTLES AND SO WE ARE ABLE UH TO TAKE IT TO ONE OF THE UH REHABILITATION CENTERS AND THEN THEY RECYCLE THE CONTAINERS .
THEY REFUND THE DEPOSIT .
WHICH IS ANYWHERE FROM FIVE TO FIFTEEN CENTS .
A CONTAINER AND THEN .
THE THE DEPOSITS ONLY ON LIKE DRINK STUFF .
RIGHT .
OKAY .
ON THE ON PRIMARILY ON SOFT DRINK POPS AND THAT KIND OF THING .
OKAY .
AND UH SO THEY INDUCE RECYCLING OF PLASTIC AND GLASS SOFT DRINK CONTAINERS .
UH WE DO HAVE ONE OF THE SCRAPE METAL DEALERS .
THAT WILL ACCEPT TIN AND ALUMINUM CANS AS WELL .
OH OKAY .
AND ACTUALLY THE RECYCLER THERE IS A DEPOSIT ON ALUMINUM POP CANS AND BEER CANS AND SO THE RECYCLER UH WITH THE HANDICAPPED GROUP WILL ALSO ACCEPT THOSE .
SO UH IT S FAIRLY FAIRLY EXTENSIVE BUT THEN AGAIN IT S UH IT S THE INITIATIVE OF THE INDIVIDUAL PERSON BECAUSE THERE IS NO COORDINATED PICK UP BY THE CITY .
SO DID THEY YOU RE GIVING ARE YOU GIVING THESE PRODUCTS TO THE HANDICAPPED GROUP AND THE HANDICAPPED GROUP IS GETTING THE UH THE MONEY OR OR ARE YOU OR ARE THEY .
SOME HOME DISTRIBUTING THE FUNDS BACK TO YOU .
WELL ACTUALLY THERE S THERE S THE OPPORTUNITY FOR BOTH .
OH .
OKAY .
GENERALLY THE UH THE HANDICAPPED GROUP TAKES CARE OF THE THINGS THAT ACTUALLY THE GOVERNMENT HAS PLACED THE DEPOSIT .
WHICH IS THE INDUCEMENT TO RE RECYCLE THE BOTTLE SO THAT YOU GET YOUR MONEY BACK AND THEN THE RECYCLER RUN BY THE HANDICAPPED SOCIETY PAYS BACK THE COST OF THAT DEPOSIT AND THEN I AND THEN THEY IN TURN WILL GET SOME MONEY FROM THE BOTTLERS AND FROM THE .
THE PEOPLE .
THAT DO THE CANNING OF THE POP AND THE BEER AS AS WELL .
THAT S VERY COOL .
YOU KNOW THERE S A I HEARD ABOUT A SIMILAR PROGRAM IN NEW YORK CITY WHERE UH A THING CALLED LIKE HOMELESS INCORPORATED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT WHAT .
THEY DO IS EMPLOY UH HOMELESS I THINK MOSTLY MEN BUT HOMELESS PEOPLE TO UH GO OUT AND COLLECT ALL THE RECYCLABLE CANS AND AND I THINK IT S MOSTLY CANS .
THERE MAY BE BOTTLES AS WELL BUT LIKE BEER CANS SODA CANS AND WHAT NOT AND THEY UH BRING THEM UP TO A ONE LO ONE CENTRALIZED LOCATION AND UH ARE ABLE TO COLLECT THE MONEY FROM THE VARIOUS BEER AND AND SODA MANUFACTURERS AND UH AND GET MORE MONEY TO THESE PEOPLE .
THAT DESPERATELY NEED IT .
OH YEAH .
UH I GUESS PARTLY BECAUSE OF OUR CLIMATE .
HERE IN SASKATOON AT LEAST THE MAJORITY OF CENTRAL UH WELL I WANT TO SAY CENTRAL CANADA BUT CENTRAL CANADA TENDS TO REFERRED MORE TO ONTARIO AND QUEBEC .
YEAH .
BUT UH WE DO NT HAVE MUCH OF A SITUATION WHERE WE MIGHT CALL THEM HOMELESS PEOPLE .
WE CERTAINLY HAVE A FAIR NUMBER OF PEOPLE .
THAT ARE ON WELFA WELFARE AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND THAT KIND OF THING .
UH THERE .
S PSYCHOLOGICAL PRESSURE AGAINST EMPLOYING PEOPLE TO DO THAT KIND OF THING ALTHOUGH UH SCOUTS AND HOCKEY TEAMS AND BALL TEAMS THOSE KINDS UH REGULARLY DO BOTTLE DRIVES WHERE THEY GO AROUND IN VARIOUS NEIGHBORHOODS AND COLLECT THE BOTTLES AT INDIVIDUAL HOMES .
DO THEY DO IT WITH NEWS PAPERS AS WELL .
THEY HAVE DONE IT .
SOME UH BUT WE HAVE ACTUALLY QUITE AN EXTENSIVE NETWORK OF COLLECTING NEWS PAPERS .
THEY ARE ACTUALLY AT VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE SHOPPING CENTERS .
LIKE THE SHOPPING MALLS .
THERE ARE SEVERAL CONTAINERS WHERE THE GROUP CALLED COSMOPOLITAN INDUSTRIES COLLECTS OR PEOPLE CAN DROP THEIR USED NEWS PAPERS AND OTHER PAPERS IN THE BINS AND THEN THE BINS ARE COLLECTED .
HUH .
UH SOME OF THE .
UH WELL H HAVING SORT OF THE REASON .
WE RE GOING THROUGH THE SCHOOL SYSTEM .
I SEEM TO BE YOUNGER THAN MOST PEOPLE .
WHO WHO TALK ON THIS THING .
I M I M JUST GRADUATING COL GRADUATING FROM COLLEGE .
UH I DID NT REALLY PERCEIVE MUCH OF A OF A PROBLEM WITH THE SCHOOL SYSTEM .
HOWEVER WHEN YOU COMPARE IT TO SCHOOL SYSTEMS LIKE THEY HAVE IN JAPAN AND AD YOU CAN COMPARE JUST ABOUT EVERYTH THING TO JAPAN AND WE LOOK LIKE WH WE DO NT HAVE ANYTHING .
UH IT SEEMS TO BE NOT DIFFICULT ENOUGH FOR STUDENTS .
NOT CHALLENGING ENOUGH .
AND JUST NOT GENERALLY COMPETITIVE ENOUGH .
UH HOWEVER I IF IT WERE NT FOR OUR NEEDLESS UH COMPETITION WITH JAPAN I I D I D THINK THAT THAT THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS SYSTEM WORKS AT A PRETTY GOOD PACE .
I DO NT KNOW .
UH I HAVE NT IT S BEEN UH WELL SEVENTYNINE SINCE I WAS AT SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
AT HIGH SCHOOL .
AND UH I VE SEEN THINGS CHANGE .
I DO NT KNOW IF I VE SEEN THINGS CHANGE ENOUGH THAT I CAN ACTUALLY BECAUSE I WAS NT REALLY LIKE LISTENING TO THE WORLD GO BY BACK THEN SO IT S HARD TO COMPARE .
YOU KNOW WHAT .
I MEAN .
RIGHT .
BUT UH IT SEEMS LIKE WHEN I LI I LIVED IN CHICAGO I I VE LIVED DOWN HERE .
I HEAR THE DROPOUT RATES FROM THE SCHOOLS .
AND I CERTAINLY SEE HOW MUCH I PAY IN REAL ESTATE TAXES EVERY YEAR .
YEAH .
AND I BEGIN TO WONDER IF I M REALLY GETTING MY MONEY S WORTH .
HUH .
I MEAN I I VE SEEN SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS .
SO SO MANY DIFFERENT BAD REPORTS COMING OUT OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM AND I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE GOOD SCHOOLS OUT THERE .
I MEAN SOMEBODY .
S .
RIGHT .
GETTING GETTING A GOOD EDUCATION BECAUSE WE .
CONTINUE TO EMPLOY PEOPLE .
BUT UH I DO NT I DO NT UNDERSTAND THE UH I DO NT UNDERSTAND I GUESS WHY THE SCHOOLS DON SEEM TO HAVE SUCH A HIGH DROPOUT RATE IN THE BIG CITIES .
UH WELL I DO NT PRETEND TO UNDERSTAND THAT EITHER .
UH BUT I M NOT QUITE SURE THAT IT S THE KIND OF THING .
THAT OUGHT TO BE BLAMED ON THE SCHOOLS .
BUT THEN AGAIN I M NOT QUITE SURE WHERE THE BLAME OUGHT TO BE PUT .
UH BECAUSE THE THE DROPOUT RATE IS IN THOSE AREAS W IT S HIGH IN THOSE AREAS WHERE ALSO THERE S POVERTY AND AND CRIME .
AND THEY .
ALL SEEM TO GO TOGETHER .
AND IT SEEMS LIKE IF YOU COULD ELIMINATE ONE OF OF THE PARTS OF THAT CIRCLE WHETHER WHERE YOU HAVE THE DROPOUT RATE AND CRIME AND YOU KNOW GENERAL POVERTY KIND OF CONDITIONS THAT THINGS OUGHT TO GET BETTER .
SO UH A THE OTHER TWO A A THEY RE ALL THREE SOCIAL ISSUES AND COULD BE ADDRESSED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN ANY WAYS .
AND CLEARLY TO ME IS A KIND OF GOVERNMENT THING TO TO FIX BUT IT S JUST LIKE I I DO NT EXPECT THEM TO KNOW WHICH WHICH WHICH PART IS BEST TO FIX JUST LIKE I DO NT KNOW .
IT S IT S A COMPLICATED ISSUE .
I I STILL DO NT THINK I WOULD BLAME IT DIRECTLY ON THE SCHOOL .
I DO NT KNOW IF I BLAME IT ON THE SCHOOL .
I THINK I THINK I BLAME IT I THINK I BLAME IT ON A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT THINGS .
I THINK I BLAME IT ON THE SCHOOL SYSTEM .
UH .
WELL THAT S I MEANT WHEN I SAID THE SCHOOL .
YEAH .
I DO NT BLAME IT ON THE TEACHERS IN THE SCHOOL .
I ALTHOUGH I THINK THAT I DO KNOW FOR A FACT THAT SOME OF THE TEACHERS THAT I KNOW PERSONALLY GET PAID AN AWFUL LOT MORE THAN WELL THEY DO QUITE WELL FOR THEMSELVES .
HUH .
WELL THAT S ODD BECAUSE I DO NT THINK THE TEACHERS IN MY SCHOOL DISTRICT UH WERE WELL PAID .
NO .
NOT ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE WELL PAID .
BUT THERE ARE SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS OUT THERE .
THAT ARE VERY WELL PAID .
I MEAN I KNOW ONE FAMILY .
THAT S GOT THEY RE BOTH .
TEACHERS AND THEY .
BOTH HAVE .
LIKE SECOND JOBS .
UHHUH .
THAT THEY WORK IN THE AFTERNOONS .
THEY .
BOTH WORK ALL SUMMER FULLTIME .
AND FROM THEIR TEACHING JOB ALONE THEY PULL IN FORTY GRAND .
EACH .
YEAH .
WELL IT IT .
I MEAN THAT FAMILY IS MAKING OVER A HUNDRED GRAND .
AND I M I MEAN OKAY OKAY .
YES I AGREE THAT TEACHING OUR KIDS IS IMPORTANT .
RIGHT .
HOWEVER THESE PEOPLE .
WHO ONLY WORK EIGHT HOURS DAY AT IT FROM SEVEN TO THREE .
AND THEY ONLY WORK NINE MONTHS .
A YEAR AND THEY GET AN AWFUL LOT OF BREAKS IN BETWEEN AND THAT S MY TAX DOLLARS THAT I M SPENDING ON THAT .
AND I DO NT EVEN HAVE KIDS .
YEAH WELL THAT S TRUE .
BUT THA THERE S YOU CAN ALWAYS PLAY GAMES WITH UH TALKING ABOUT WHOA LOOK AT THIS .
MY TAX DOLLARS ARE PAYING FOR THIS .
THIS IS WRONG .
BUT WHEN YOU RE TALK W W AND THERE S REALLY NOT MUCH YOU CAN DIRECTLY DO ABOUT THAT .
I THINK THAT THAT IF IF THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE SCHOOL SYSTEM UH FROM IT S BEEN MY PERCEPTION THAT THE SCHOOL TEACHERS AND SCHOOL OFFICIALS ARE NOT THAT WELL UH PAID .
THAT PERHAPS THAT MIGHT BE ONE AREA THAT THAT COULD BE IMPROVED .
UH W YOU HAVE OTHER PROFESSIONAL JOBS AND TH THIS IS A PROFESSION .
AND AS A MATTER OF FACT IT S A PRETTY BIG INFLUENCE ON ON .
OKAY SO YOU HAVE EIGHT CHILDREN .
UM WHAT TYPE OF THINGS DO YOU DO AS A FAMILY TO SPEND TIME TOGETHER .
OH WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME OUTDOORS JOGGING BICYCLING UH GOING TO THE PARK UM SOME TIME WATCHING V C R .
UHHUH .
MOVIES .
UHHUH .
UM GENERALLY CHEAP THINGS .
UHHUH .
YEAH WE KNOW HOW THAT GOES .
UH WITH LOTS OF KIDS YOU DO NT HAVE LOTS OF MONEY FOR RECREATION .
THAT S RIGHT .
WELL THAT S FUN .
SO UM LET S SEE UH SOME OF THE THINGS WE DO TOGETHER AS A FAMILY WE LIKE TO PLAY GAMES .
A LOT AND YOU MAY THINK THIS IS FUNNY BUT ONE OF OUR FUNNEST GAMES WE LIKE TO PLAY TOGETHER IS HIDE AND SEEK AND WE JUST HAVE A HOOT PLAYING HIDE AND SEEK WHEN IT S DARK .
YEAH .
IN OUR HOUSE AND THAT IS SO FUN .
THE KIDS JUST GET A CRACK OUT OF THAT .
UM WE LIKE WE DO LIKE TO GO TO THE PARK TOO YOU UH LIKE YOUR FAMILY .
UM WE DO NT DO A LOT OF VACATIONING .
HAVE YOU TAKEN A LOT OF VACATIONS TOGETHER OR .
MOST OF OUR VACATIONS ARE TO GO AND SEE GRANDMA AND GRANDPA .
UHHUH AND WHE .
WE GET AN OCCASIONAL ONE OR TWO DAY THING .
OH .
BUT MOST OF THEM ARE GOING AND SEEING GRANDMA AND GRANDPA .
OH NOW WHERE DO THEY LIVE .
IN ARIZONA .
OH SO THAT S A BIT OF A DRIVE FOR YOU THERE .
YES .
OH SO YOU LIKE TO GO THERE FOR THE HOLIDAYS AND .
OH WE DO NT GO VERY OFTEN FOR HOLIDAYS .
GENERALLY WE TRY TO GET ALL OF OUR KIDS BACK HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS .
UHHUH .
AND LET GRANDMA AND GRANDPA COME AND VISIT US .
OH UHHUH .
UH WHAT ARE THE AGES OF YOUR KIDS THEN .
THEY RANGE FROM TWENTYFOUR TO FIVE .
OH YEAH .
SO YOU HAVE SOME IN THE NEST AND SOME OUT HUH .
THAT S RIGHT .
HOW OLD ARE YOUR CHILDREN .
WE HAVE OURS START AT TWELVE AND THEN THEY GO DOWN TO FOUR .
I THINK THE HARDEST THING FOR US HAS BEEN IS TO FIND AC YOU KNOW LEISURE TIME ACTIVITIES THAT ALL OF OUR KIDS CAN ENJOY TOGETHER .
I BET YEAH .
WITH THE AGE SPAN THAT WE HAVE YOU KNOW LIKE THE OLDER KIDS LOVE PLAYING BOARD GAMES AND THAT KIND OF THING .
UHHUH .
BUT THE YOUNG KIDS DO NT UNDERSTAND IT .
YES UHHUH .
AND SO THEY GET REAL FRUSTRATED WHEN WE TRY TO DO THAT AND .
YES AND THEN IF YOU WANT TO PLAY SOMETHING ON THE LITTLE KIDS LEVEL THEN THE OLDER KIDS GET REAL BORED AND THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHING ELSE .
SO .
YEAH .
YEAH I CAN I CAN RELATE TO THAT .
UM DO YOU FEEL THAT THE CURRENT TREND IN FAMILIES SPENDING TIME TOGETHER IS A POSITIVE ONE OR A NEGATIVE ONE .
I THINK IT S IMPROVING ACTUALLY .
UHHUH .
WE HAD AN INTERESTING EXPERIENCE .
THE OTHER DAY .
WE WE HAVE PRETTY MUCH A A ROUTINE THAT WE SPEND WE DO NT HAVE OUR KIDS PLAY WITH OTHER KIDS ON SUNDAY .
UHHUH .
AND WE JUST KIND OF KEEP THEM AT HOME .
UHHUH .
AND OUR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR UH WE WERE AT A SOCCER GAME SATURDAY AND OUR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR WAS THERE AND SOMEBODY CAME UP AND ASKED IF THEIR DAUGHTER COULD SPEND SATURDAY NIGHT AT THEIR HOUSE .
UHHUH .
AND SHE SAID NO SUNDAY S OUR FAMILY DAY .
UHHUH .
AND WE KEEP OUR KIDS AT HOME SO WE CAN SPEND TIME WITH THEM .
THAT S GOOD .
AND I THINK THOSE KINDS OF THINGS ARE HAPPENING A LOT WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW .
OH GOOD .
I THINK IT S GONE TO ONE EXTREME WHERE THE FAMILIES WERE JUST RUNNING ALL DIFFERENT DIRECTION .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK MORE PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN SPENDING TIME WITH THEIR KIDS NOW .
I THINK SO AND I FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW LIKE PRESIDENT BUSH BUSH HAS MENTIONED QUITE OFTEN THAT WE ARE TRYING TO BECOME A KINDER AND GENTLER NATION AND IT DOES BEGIN WITH THE FAMILIES AT HOME .
YEAH .
AND SO I I M A FIRM BELIEVER IN THAT TOO .
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE PANICKED HOW KIDS ARE TURNING OUT AND HOW THINGS ARE GOING FOR KIDS AND REALIZING THEY VE GOT TO START DOING SOMETHING .
SO .
YES THAT S THAT S TRUE .
WELL WE SEE THAT A LOT OUT HERE IN UTAH AND UM HOPEFULLY HOPEFULLY IT S GOING TO SPREAD HUH .

I SUPPOSE IS ALSO LIKE A MACINTOSH .
UHHUH .
UH .
WELL THE ONE THING .
I USED TO USE A UH I VE NEVER USED AN .
I B M ACTUALLY .
I USED TO USE A JUST AN APPLE TWO E WHICH OF COURSE IS .
UHHUH .
LOOKS PRETTY PRIMITIVE NOW .
YEAH THAT S WHAT .
I LEARNED A LOT OF LANGUAGES ON WAS AN APPLE TWO E IN MY HIGH SCHOOL .
BUT I DO NT HAVE ANY UH ANY REAL PROGRAMMING CAPABILITIES ON MY UH MAC RIGHT NOW .
UHHUH .
I DO NT HAVE UH ANY COMPILERS .
UHHUH .
SO I M UH .
WELL DO YOU USE YOUR COMPUTER FOR UM JUST THINGS AROUND THE HOUSE OR IN THE MUMBLEX .
I USE IT IN MY BUSINESS .
WELL SEE WHAT DO YOU DO .
I UH DO UH CONSULTATION AND AND TESTING OF VARIOUS KINDS FOR UH ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE PROGRAMS .
OH WOW .
UM AND UH ARE THESE LIKE UH DO THESE PROGRAMS UM ARE ARE THEY BASED ON ON A ON A UM OTHER LANGUAGE OR ARE THEY BASED ARE THEY BASED LIKE A LOT OF THE UM YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE CLASSES WILL HAVE PEOPLE FROM ALL SORTS OF YOU KNOW PARTS OF THE WORLD AND THE TEACHER JUST TRIES TO TRIES TO TEACH ENGLISH YOU KNOW THROUGH NATURAL UNDERSTANDING .
THAT S UH EXACTLY WHAT YEAH THAT S THE KIND OF THING .
I M WORKING WITH EXACTLY .
UHHUH .
YOU SEEM TO BE UH BETTER INFORMED THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON ON THAT .
WELL IT WAS JUST UH WHEN I WAS HIGH SCHOOL I WORKED FOR THE COMMUNITY SCHOOL AND THEY HAD A ENGLISH SECOND LANGUAGE CLASS AND IT ALWAYS SEEMED STRANGE TO ME THAT YOU KNOW ALL THESE ALL THESE PEOPLE .
THAT YOU KNOW SPOKE ENGLISH NOT TOO WELL AND SPOKE YOU KNOW A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT LANGUAGES WERE ALL BEING TAUGHT AT THE SAME TIME .
UHHUH .
I IMAGINE IT S A LOT HARDER ON A COMPUTER BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO YOU KNOW YOU DO NT HAVE AS MANY CUES YOU CA NT DO NT HAVE HAND GESTURES AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
RIGHT .
WELL NOW WE UH WHAT .
I USE A COMPUTER FOR IS TO WRITE MATERIALS THAT .
UHHUH .
ARE LATER PRINTED THOUGH .
MOST OF THE STUFF THAT I DO IS NOT UH INTERACTIVE .
UHHUH .
AND I USE IT FOR T UH DATA ANALYSIS ON TESTING SO .
UH TO SEE HOW WELL THEY RETAIN THE VOCABULARY AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
WELL JUST ACTUALLY JUST UH ITEM ANALYSIS STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE TESTS UH .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WRITE A TEST .
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT SOME DATA FROM IT AND SEE HOW THE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS ARE PERFORMING .
UHHUH .
AND FIND OUT WHICH ONES ARE DISCRIMINATING WELL AND WHICH ONES ARE NT .
UHHUH .
FIND OUT HOW RELIABLE THE TEST IS YOU TRY CORRELATE IT WITH OTHER TESTS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT .
SO IT S INVOLVES A LOT OF SPREADSHEET USE .
YEAH I WOULD IMAGINE SO .
UM SO UM WHAT WERE YOU DOING WHEN YOU WERE USING AN APPLE TWO E .
WELL I WAS DOING SOME OF THE SAME STUFF BUT DOING IT MORE SLOWLY .
AND WITH SMALLER FILES .
I CA NT BELIEVE YOU KNOW I VE GOT UH FIVE UH MEGABYTES ON THIS .
ONE NOW .
UHHUH .
IT IT S MUMBLEX .
AND ON MY TWO E I HAD A HUNDRED TWENTYEIGHT K .
YES IT S AMAZING YOU KNOW HOW HOW LIKE IN THE GENERAL USER COMMUNITY .
THE EXPECTATIONS HAVE JUST GROWN SO MUCH .
I REMEMBER MY FIRST COMPUTER WAS A T R S EIGHTY WITH FOUR K ON IT .
YEAH .
AND YOU KNOW THEN THEN WE THEN I STARTED PLAYING WITH APPLES YOU KNOW AND THOSE HAD FORTYEIGHT OR YOU KNOW IF THEY WERE REALLY GREAT .
OH THE OLD .
THEY HAD SIXTYFOUR K .
THE OLD APPLE UH THE THE ORIGINAL APPLE HAD WHAT YEAH FORTYEIGHT I GUESS DID NT IT .
UH I KNOW .
I KNOW THAT IN MY SCHOOL .
THEY HAD A BUNCH .
THAT HAD SIXTEEN K ON THEM IS ALL AND .
MY GOODNESS .
THERE S I REMEMBER THAT THERE WAS ONE GAME THAT I PLAYED THAT REQUIRED FORTYEIGHT K AND THERE WAS ONLY ONE COMPUTER .
THAT HAD FORTYEIGHT K ON IT AT THE TIME .
UHHUH .
AND YOU KNOW IT S JUST SO AMAZING THAT GENERALLY YOU KNOW IF YOU IF YOU I M NOT SURE ABOUT MACINTOSHES BUT I KNOW I B M S YOU YOU GENERALLY YOU KNOW YOU BUY A MEGABYTE AT A TIME .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THAT S THAT S YOUR LOW THAT S THE LOW END .
UH .
WELL THE S P THIRTY GOES UP TO EIGHT .
UHHUH .
BUT I HAVE NT UPGRADED IT QUITE THAT FAR YET .
I THINK PROBABLY WHEN I GET SYSTEM SEVEN .
I MAY HAVE TO DO THAT AND AND GET ANOTHER POSSIBLY ANOTHER HARD DISK .
I DO NT KNOW .
THEY SAY THAT SYSTEM SEVEN USES .
A LOT OF MEMORY .
UHHUH .
YEAH I IMAGINE MUMBLEX .
UH A LOT OF COMPANIES NOW ARE ARE USING UH DRUG TESTING PARAPHERNALIA AND DRUG TESTING SITUATIONS TO TO ROOT OUT THE THE .
EITHER UH ELEMENTARY OR INTERMEDIATE OR ADVANCED UH DRUG USERS .
UHHUH .
AND UH I KNOW THE THE GOVERNMENT IS UH YOU KNOW GIVES DRUG TESTS AN TO ALL NEW ENTRANTS ALL NEW APPLI APPLICANTS COMING INTO GOVERNMENT .
UHHUH .
AND AND I QUITE FRANKLY DO NT SEE ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT .
I I M I GUESS I M NOT A GOOD CIVIL LIBERTARIAN .
AND AND I I FEEL AS THOUGH UH THAT UH UH YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU YOU RE A DRUG USER .
YOU HAVE A HIDDEN AGENDA .
THAT S DIFFICULT UNLESS YOU REALLY GO INTO A DEEP BACKGROUND .
OF COURSE WE RE WE RE BEING INVOLVED IN MY ORGANIZATION UH WE WE HAVE DEEP BACKGROUND CHECKS AND .
SURE SURE .
AND SO UH BUT BUT SOMETIMES YOU KNOW DRUG USE CAN CAN ESCAPE THAT .
AND UH I HAVE ABSOLUTELY .
HUH .
NO COMPUNCTION ABOUT UH USING ANY AND ALL MEANS TO TO UH UH YOU KNOW WORK OUT FIGURE OUT WHO HAS A DRUG PROGRAM OR WHO HAS A DRUG PROBLEM .
UHHUH .
AND UH AND PUTTING THAT GUY INTO INTO THERAPY TO WHATEVER .
IT IS TO TO YOU KNOW BREAK THIS UH ACTIVITY .
OF COURSE IF HE S FALLEN IN LOVE WITH DRUGS AND THERE IS NT ANYTHING BUT GETTING STONED OR HIGH IS IS THE ONLY THING IN LIFE .
THAT SEEMS TO BE MEANINGFUL THEN MAYBE THERE IS NO HOPE .
YEAH .
WHAT S YOUR UH FEELING .
UH WELL I GUESS I I GUESS I M PROBABLY A LITTLE MORE TO TOWARD THE OTHER DIRECTION .
UH WELL I GUESS MAINLY BECAUSE UH IT S I WELL LIKE THERE S TWO SIDES TO IT .
I GUESS .
UH ONE IS THAT UH IF YOU RE COMING TO WORK UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ANY SORT OF DRUG ALCOHOL WHATEVER OR YOU KNOW EVEN IF IT S SMOKING INHIBITS YOU KNOW YOUR ABILITY TO FUNCTION THEN I I THINK THAT THAT YOU KNOW I DO NT HAVE ANY PROBLEM AT ALL WITH TESTING THAT INDIVIDUAL YOU KNOW ON THE SPOT .
UH BUT I GUESS I FEEL MORE LIKE WHATEVER .
YOU RE DOING IN YOUR OWN PRIVATE LIFE IS YOUR OWN PRIVATE BUSINESS .
UH AND I GUESS PART OF THE REASON .
THERE IS BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT UH THINGS LIKE DRUG LAWS SEEM TO COME AND GO .
YOU KNOW WE HAD PROHIBITION FOR AWHILE AND THEN WE DID NT HAVE PROHIBITION .
UH YOU KNOW WE VE HAD I GUESS LAWS AGAINST UH YOU KNOW VARIOUS OTHER FORMS OF DRUGS FOR THE LAST .
WHAT .
SIXTY OR SEVENTY YEARS I GUESS .
UHHUH .
MAYBE A LITTLE LONGER .
WELL I THINK UH THE DR THE LAWS ON UH UH UH THE FIRST MORPHINE LAWS WERE WERE LIKE NINETY OR NINETEEN TEN OR NINETEEN FIVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
YEAH .
SO EI EIGHTY YEARS OR SO .
YEAH .
YEAH .
UH SO I YOU KNOW IT S IT S HARD TO I GUESS FOR ME TO JUSTIFY WHAT SO SEEMS LIKE YOU KNOW BASICALLY A BREACH OF THE FIRST AMEN YOU KNOW FREEDOM FROM UH SEARCH AND SEIZURE YOU KNOW UH ON SOMETHING .
THAT MAY OR MAY NOT STAND AS A LAW YOU KNOW FIFTY YEARS FROM NOW OR EVEN TWENTY OR TEN WHO KNOWS .
WELL THE THING OF IT IS THE THE THA THA .
I MEAN PROHIBITION CERTAINLY DID NT LAST .
THAT THAT IS UH UH IN IN MANY RESPECTS UH UH YOU KNOW JUST JUST I THINK AN OVER SIMPLIFICATION .
I I THINK THERE TH TH TH THERE S SO MUCH CRIMINAL ACTIVITY UH THAT PEOPLE GO INTO TO TO SUPPORT DRUG HABITS .
WELL BUT YOU GOT TO LOOK AT PROHIBITION THOUGH .
YOU HAD THE SAME PROBLEMS .
THERE RIGHT .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW THEY THEY SUPPORT DRUG HABITS WITH UH WITH UH YOU KNOW WITH THINGS LIKE UH YOU KNOW BURGLARY OR OR PROSTITUTION OR STUFF LIKE THAT YEAH .
OH YEAH .
SURE .
WELL IT GOES BACK TO THAT AGAIN IF YOU LOOK AT PROHIBITION .
I MEAN BECAUSE IT S ILLEGAL IT COSTS MORE .
IF IT WAS LEGAL I MEAN FACE IT .
YOU CAN BUY PHARMACEUTICAL GRADE COCAINE FOR WHAT TEN OR TWENTY DOLLARS .
AN OUNCE .
I I .
I MUST ADMIT THAT .
AND CLEARLY IF YOU RE INTO COKE AND ALL .
YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU KNOW SNORT YOUR BRAINS OUT ALL DAY LONG IF IT WAS LEGAL YOU COULD DO IT REAL CHEAP AND YOU KNOW YOU D BE A MENACE TO NOBODY BUT YOURSELF AS LONG AS YOU STAYED AT HOME AND DID IT .
YEAH .
BUT YEAH GET UH .
YEAH .
I I MUST ADMIT THAT THE PRODUCTION COSTS OF OF THESE DRUGS ARE ARE ZIPPO COMPARED TO THE STREET MARKET COSTS AND AND THE COSTS TO SOCIETY YEAH .
OH YEAH WELL THAT S WHY THERE S YOU KNOW PEOPLE DEALING IT BECAUSE THERE S MONEY IN IT YOU KNOW .
THERE .
S RIDICULOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY .
BUT I I I I THINK THAT THAT THE THAT YOU KNOW THE BEING IN LAW ENFORCEMENT YOU KNOW TH TH TH THEY I I PROBABLY HAVE A KIND OF A DRACONIAN PHILISTINE ATTITUDE TOWARD IT .
AND BUT BUT THE UH UH I I REALLY FEEL AS THOUGH THE INTERDICTION EFFORT IS IS AS SOON AS YOU YOU GET RID OF ONE GOON .
THAT S THAT S THAT S INVOLVED IN DRUGS AND THA .
OH YEAH INTERDICTION S HOPELESS .
I MEAN .
YEAH AND THEN ANOTHER ANOTHER .
ONE WILL JUMP UP .
THERE S NO WAY .
YOU RE EVER GOING TO WIN THAT .
BUT WE WE SEE .
THE TIGHTER YOU SQUEEZE THE MORE THE PRICE GOES UP THE MORE INCENTIVE THERE IS .
I MEAN THAT S A LOSING FIGHT .
YEAH .
A A AS SOON AS WE WIND UP UH UH YOU KNOW FOR WELL IF WE CAN JUST DESTROY THE MARKET BY DESTROYING THE DEMAND BUT BUT PEOPLE .
YEAH YEAH .
WANT TO GET GET STONED AND I I DO NT SEE THAT .
WELL YEAH .
IT GOES BACK TO YOU KNOW WHAT RIGHT WHAT CAN SOCIETY IMPOSE ON PEOPLE .
I MEAN CAN YOU FORCE SOMEBODY TO BE A GOOD PRODUCTIVE CITIZEN .
YEAH .
I DO NT THINK YOU CAN .
I MEAN YOU KNOW I M YOU KNOW WAS RAISED WITH BEING A VERY STRONG BIBLE WORK ETHIC SO YOU KNOW I M ONE OF THESE YOU KNOW TEN TWELVE FIFTEEN TWENTY HOUR .
A DAY TYPE PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
SO YOU KNOW YEAH I CAN REALLY RELATE TO YEAH EVERYBODY OUGHT TO DO THEIR OWN SHARE YOU KNOW .
I DO NT HAVE ANY YOU KNOW LOVE LOST FOR PEOPLE .
WHO ARE ON THE PUBLIC DOLE JUST BECAUSE THEY RE TOO LAZY TO GET A JOB OR THAT KIND OF STUFF .
UHHUH .
BUT YOU KNOW .
NOT VERY GOOD IT S NOT BEEN A GOOD DAY .
I WENT .
I TURNED MINE IN ABOUT TWELVE HOURS EARLY AT NOON .
I DO NT KNOW I FINISHED MINE UP ABOUT ELEVEN AND LEFT IT HERE WITH CAROLYN SO I HOPE SHE S TURNED IT IN .
ARE YOU EATING .
UH I JU GO AHEAD I LL STOP EATING I JUST BARELY GOT .
NO IT S .
HOME FROM THE UNIVERSITY .
SAY WHAT .
I JUST BARELY GOT HOME FROM THE UNIVERSITY .
TELL YOU WHAT WE CAN DO IS UH I CAN PUNCH THE UH ONE .
AND THEN W AFTER FIVE MINUTES WHEN THE UH UH VOICE COMES ON WE CAN TALK ALL NIGHT IF WE WANT .
OKAY GO AHEAD FIRE AWAY .
UH I LOVE THE IRONY OF UH TALKING ABOUT THIS SUBJECT ON APRIL THE .
FIFTEENTH BUT UH I M AFRAID I M I M PROBABLY IN THE MINORITY I I ACTUALLY DO NT THINK THAT WE UH PAY TOO MUCH IN THIS COUNTRY UH .
I AGREE WITH YOU .
UH PARTICULARLY UH IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY W UH I GUESS I DO HAVE A A BONE TO PICK WITH UH UH THE WAY TAXES ARE DISTRIBUTED UH I JUST FINISHED FUMING AT THE FACT THAT WE PAY AN EIGHT AND A HALF PERCENT SALES TAX AND NO INCOME TAX WHEN THE INCOME TAX COULD HAVE BEEN DEDUCTED FROM THE FEDERAL FORM .
HUH .
AND THE SALES TAX CA NT I THINK THAT S REGRESSIVE AND UH UH IT S KIND OF DUMB .
I HATE THE EIGHT AND A HALF PERCENT SALES TAX BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I DO NT MIND THAT IT S ONLY ON YOU KNOW THINGS THAT ARE NT LIKE GROCERIES AND THAT IT S NOT ON THAT .
WELL I MEAN NOBODY TAXES GROCERIES .
OH YEAH THEY DO .
WHERE .
IN ARIZONA .
IS THAT RIGHT .
UHHUH .
BUT WE HAVE A PRETTY LOW INCOME TA I MEAN PRETTY LOW TAX RATE HERE OH I THINK THE THE SALES TAX THEY JUST GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT .
RIGHT .
BUT THAT S THE POLITICALNESS OF TRYING TO NOT CREATE ANY NEW TAXES .
RIGHT BUT I GUESS WHEN I HEAR WHEN I SEE THE COMPARISON BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND UH ANY OTHER WESTERN COUNTRY UH THEIR THEIR RATES ARE LIKE UH FORTYONE FORTYTWO AND OURS ARE LIKE THIRTYSIX THIRTYSEVEN YOU KNOW IF YOU COMPUTE AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL INCOME ALL TAXES LUMPED TOGETHER WE ACTUALLY DO PRETTY WELL T TH THERE S NO OTHER COUNTRY THAT S THAT IS TAXED AS LOW AS WE ARE .
WELL AND I STILL THINK THAT HAVING LIVED IN EUROPE FOR AWHILE YOU KNOW DIFFERENCE IN LIVING CONDITIONS .
YEAH .
ARE CERTAINLY WELL WORTH UH WHAT WE PAY FOR IT .
UHHUH I M I M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN .
WELL I MEAN I THINK I WAS IN GERMANY YOU KNOW FOR SEVERAL YEARS .
RIGHT .
AND I D A LOT RATHER PAY TAXES HERE AND HAVE WHAT WE HAVE THEN HAVE TO LIVE THERE .
OH YOU MEAN LOWEST END OF LIVING IN SPITE OF LOWER HIGHER TAXES YEAH .
HIGHER TAXES YEAH .
I SUPPOSE THAT S TRUE YEAH UH PROBABLY M LESS SO NOW THAN IT WAS TEN YEARS AGO OR WHATEVER BUT .
STILL S THAT WAY TO SOME EXTENT .
YEAH .
I THINK THE OTHER PROBLEM IS YOU KNOW IT IT S EASY TO COMPLAIN ABOUT TAXES BECAUSE THERE S SOMETHING YOU THEORETICALLY CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT .
RIGHT .
BUT I LOOK FOR EXAMPLE AND YOU RE NOT QUITE IN THE SAME SITUATION BUT LIKE SCHOOL TAXES FOR ME .
RIGHT .
BIGGEST BARGAIN IN THE WORLD I WISH I DID NT HAVE TO PAY ANY MORE FO TO MY PHYSICIANS IN A YEAR .
RIGHT .
THAN I HAD TO PAY FOR ALL OF MY SCHOOL TAXES .
YEAH YEAH SINCE UH I SEND MY KIDS TO PAROCHIAL SCHOOL THAT MUMBLEX .
YEAH THAT THAT S PROBABLY A LITTLE TOUGHER ON YOU .
IT S NOT IT S NOT QUITE THE BARGAIN THAT MUMBLEX .
BUT I MEAN I PAY THEM GLADLY THAT S A DECISION I THINK IT S A DUMB DECISION ON OUR PART BECAUSE COUNTRIES LIKE CANADA AND ENGLAND AND GERMANY DO PERFECTLY WELL WITH A UH TWO TRACT SYSTEM IN WHICH RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS COEXIST WITH SECULAR SCHOOLS F WITH THE SAME TAX MONEY BUT UH I MEAN THAT S THAT S THE WAY AMERICANS WANT TO INTERPRET IT I GUESS THAT S ALL RIGHT BUT YEAH I .
AND IF I WERE UH WHEN I WAS SINGLE AND AGAIN WHEN I M RETIRED .
I WILL NOT MIND PAYING UH WHAT IT TAKES TO KEEP THE SCHOOLS GOOD THAT S ALWAYS BEEN A HIGH PRIORITY .
NO I THINK THAT S JUST YOU THOUGH .
I DO YEAH THAT S TRUE I THINK IN PLACES .
I THINK IN PLACES LIKE CALIFORNIA PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO FIND THAT IN IN AREAS THAT ARE FAIRLY WELL OFF IF YOU ADD THE UH UH PEOPLE OF VARIOUS SEXUAL PERSUASIONS AND THOSE WHO NEVER INTEND TO MARRY AND THOSE WHO ARE RETIRED AND THOSE ARE UH JUST LOOKING FOR FUN TH PEOPLE WITH FAMILIES TURN OUT TO BE SUCH A SMALL MINORITY THAT THEY CA NT GET A TAX BILL PASSED NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS .
YEAH .
AND UH .
THERE ARE BIG SECTIONS OF THE COUNTRY WHERE PEOPLE WITH CHILDREN OF SCHOOL AGE ARE SUCH A SMALL MINORITY THAT THEY CA NT GET ANYTHING DONE THAT SEEMS A A LIKE A CULTURAL LAPSE I MEAN PEOPLE ALWAYS USED TO BE WILLING TO ANTE UP FOR THE SCHOOLS THEY .
OF COURSE I THINK WITH THE GRAYING OF AMERICA WE RE GOING TO SEE THAT PROBLEM IN LOTS OF PLACES .
RIGHT YEAH PEOPLE WOULD RATHER UH INCREASE THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND CUT DOWN THE SCHOOLS BECAUSE IT MEANS MORE TO THEM BUT I THINK IT S SAD .
OR BUILD ROADS .
SELFISH AND SHORTSIGHTED YEAH .
WELL .
ARE YOU IN THE MIDDLE OF ANYTHING .
NO .
I M NOT IN THE MIDDLE OF ANYTHING .
I VE JUST ABOUT THE LAST THING .
I DID ABOUT MAYBE OH CLOSE TO A YEAR AGO NOW I GUESS I I HELPED MY DAD ADD ON ANOTHER BEDROOM ON TO HIS HOUSE .
SO I GUESS THAT .
THE WHOLE THING .
YEAH .
THAT THAT WAS FAIRLY LARGE UNDERTAKING .
A A IT S A BEDROOM AND A WALKIN CLOSET AND A BATHROOM .
ALL ON ONE SIDE OF THE HOUSE .

HUH .
THAT WAS THE ONLY THING .
WE DID NT YOU KNOW PUTTING THE CEILING UP AND THINGS LIKE THAT WE DO NT WE WE WERE NT SURE HOW TO DO THAT AND .
MAYBE YOU AND I SHOULD GET TOGETHER .
BECAUSE WHEN I HAD MY LAST BIG PROJECT I HAD THE CONTRACTOR DO THE FRAMING AND I DID ALL THE SHEETROCKING AND THE INTERIOR WORK .
YEAH THAT S THE EXACT OPPOSITE .
WE DID ALL PUT THE ROOF UP AND DID ALL THE ROOFING AND THE PUT ALL THE INTERIOR WALLS UP .
WE JUST DID NT DO ANY OF THE SHEETROCK WALL WORK AND THAT S IT BECAUSE YOU HAVE YOU KNOW GET THOSE JOINTS TO GO TOGETHER .
YE .
AND WHATEVER .

YEAH .
AND ON THE CEILING AND ALL THAT .
I DI WE DID NT KNOW A THING ABOUT ANY OF THAT AND SO .
MY WIFE WISHES I HAD NT DONE THAT .
IT S IT LOOKED VERY HARD TO DO SO .
WE FIGURED WELL JUST I DID NT THINK WE COULD DO IT AND MAKE IT LOOK PROFESSIONAL .
SO WE LEFT IT LEFT IT TO SOMEBODY .
WHO DOES IT FOR A LIVING .
BUT .
I THINK IT TAKES ABOUT THREE OR FOUR TIMES BEFORE IT GETS EASY .
PROBABLY SO AND I .
WE D NEVER DONE IT SO .
YEAH .
WE JUST LEFT IT ALONE .
BUT THAT S I GUESS I M ONLY TWENTYONE SO I MY MY VAST EXPERIENCE OF HOME HOME OWNER S KNOWLEDGE IS NOT VERY MUCH .

I HAVE TO DO MORE OR LESS AROUND THE HOUSE YOU KNOW FOR MY PARENTS SO .
DID YOU YOU FRAMED IT IN F UH ON ON YOU FRAMED IN NEW SQUARE FOOTAGE OR WAS IT .

BUT IT S .
NO I DESIGNED IT FROM SCRATCH AND DID IT .
YEAH .

IN FACT UH I SPENT THE FIRST THREE YEARS AT HOME WITH MY DAUGHTER SO I I GUESS I FELT FAIRLY FORTUNATE THAT I WAS ABLE TO DO THAT AND I DID NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE OF INFANTS BEING PLACED IN DAYCARE AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF HOW CAN A MOTHER PLACE HER CHILD AT THE AGE OF SIX WEEKS OR FOUR WEEKS OR TWO WEEKS OR THREE WEEKS WHATEVER THE EMPLOYER SAYS YOU HAVE TO BE BACK AT WORK IS BASICALLY WHEN YOU HAVE TO BE BACK AT WORK WHETHER IT BE SIX WEEKS OR THREE OR FOUR BUT HOW THESE WOMEN MUST FEEL TO PLACE THEIR CHILDREN INTO CARE AND YOU KNOW IT S OUR SOCIETY SAYING YES THIS UH YOU NEED THIS JOB IT S A LITTLE BIT FINANCIAL TYPE THING BECAUSE UH IF YOU LOOK ALL OVER IN THE OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE EUROPE AND THAT UH THEIR STANDARDS OF LIVING ARE A LOT LESS THAN WHAT OURS ARE AND .
RIGHT .
THAT S PART OF IT TOO BUT UH LIKE MY HUSBAND WAS SAYING MAYBE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WE BROUGHT ON TO OURSELVES IS THAT THESE WOMEN BACK IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES UH WERE STAYING AT HOME WITH THEIR KIDS AND THEN MADE THE DECISION WELL JEEZ YOU KNOW I LL GO OUT AND GET A PARTTIME JOB GOT A PARTTIME JOB AND THEN FINANCIALLY THEY GOT THEMSELVES INTO WELL I LL HAVE THE BOAT I LL HAVE THE CAR AND .
RIGHT .
IT S NICE AND REALLY WOMEN PAST GENERATION WOMEN HAVE DONE IT TO WOMEN OF THIS DAY AND AGE TOO UH BECAUSE IT IS NOW OUR FINANCIAL SITUATIONS ARE AS IT ALMOST TAKES TWO PEOPLE TO BRING IN AN INCOME TO SUPPORT A FAMILY NOW AND .
IT S HARD IT REALLY IS HARD I KNOW THAT MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE TO DO A LOT OF SACRIFICING .
UHHUH .
TO KEEP ME HOME .
SURE I DID IT .
AND UH .
FOR THREE YEARS AND UH IT COST US A LOT OF FINANCIAL PROBLEMS DOING IT AND PRETTY SOON YOU KNOW YOU RE AT THE LIMIT WHERE YOU VE GOT TO SAY OKAY YOU VE SACRIFICED FOR YOU KNOW SO MANY YEARS AT HOME AND YOU RE NOT GETTING ANY FURTHER YOU KNOW ALONG .
RIGHT .
AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE THAT DECISION TO GO BACK TO WORK PARTTIME OR GO BACK TO WORK FULLTIME AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE THAT DECISION AND IT S A TOUGH ONE .
RIGHT I THINK .
AND I .
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE LOOK AT TOO THOUGH IS UH SPEN HOW THEY SPEND THEIR TIME WITH THEIR CHILDREN .
UHHUH .
I THINK WITH WORKING MOMS IF YOU CAN GET THEM MA THE BOSSES TO GIVE YOU ALMOST LIKE A ROTATION LIKE THEY RE GOING TO DO WITH YEARROUND SCHOOL WHERE YOU WORK .
SURE .
OKAY .
WELL UM I USED TO WORK IN A DAY CARE CENTER .
UHHUH .
I WORKED IN UM IN ALL THE DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE DAY CARE CENTER AND IT IS THEY CAN BE DECEIVING TO PEOPLE .
I DID NOT WORK THERE LONG BECAUSE I COULD NT HANDLE THE THE TREATMENT THAT THE CHILDREN GOT AND THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A VERY WELLKNOWN CENTER HERE IN TYLER .
WHO HAD TWO OR THREE UM CENTERS .
UHHUH .
ALL OVER YOU KNOW THE UM CITY AND THEY WOULD UM BE ONE WAY WHEN THE PARENTS WERE THERE AND BE ANOTHER WAY WHEN THE PARENTS LEFT .
YEAH .
SO UM I THINK YOU NEED TO MAKE YOU KNOW IF YOU DO DO DAY CARE CENTERS YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD MAKE FREQUENT CHECKS AND UM TO CHECK IN ON THEM WHEN THEY RE NOT EXPECTING IT .
YEAH .
BECAUSE THEY DO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY WHEN YOU RE NOT AROUND SO .
WELL THAT I KNOW WH THE THINGS THAT WE .
KIND OF LOOKED AT IS IS YOU WANT TO SEE HOW MANY TEACHERS YOU HAVE .
UHHUH .
AND AND HOW MANY KIDS THEY HAVE AND HOW THEY BREAK IT UP .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE WE HAD WE HAD ONE .
THAT SOUNDS KIND OF LIKE WHAT .
YOU WERE IN .
UHHUH .
IT IT WAS A REALLY GOOD ONE AND IN FACT IT WORKED OUT FOR US BECAUSE MY WIFE WE .
KIND OF BARTERED .
MY WIFE DID ARTWORK FOR THEM AND THEN YOU KNOW SO WE GOT OUR DAY CARE FREE .
UHHUH .
BUT THEY DID NT HAVE ENOUGH TEACHERS AND .
WELL THIS ONE WAS SET UP GOOD .
I MEAN THEY HAD TWO TEACHERS .
UHHUH .
TO EVERY ROOM .
UM SOMETIMES THREE .
AND THEY HAD A GOOD SYSTEM LIKE SO WHEN YOU WALKED IN EVERYTHING LOOKS COOL .
UHHUH .
THE PROBLEM .
I HAD WAS THAT THEY DID NOT SHOW AFFECTION TO THE CHILDREN ENOUGH .
THEY DID NOT SHOW THEM CARE TO THESE SMALL CHILDREN .
WHO ARE BEING LEFT .
UHHUH .
UM THEY ONE TIME .
I PICKED UP THIS LITTLE BOY .
WHO WAS CRYING AND THE OWNER CAME AND JUST CHEWED ME UP ONE SIDE DOWN THE OTHER .
HUH .
YOU KNOW HE SAID YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE EVERY CHILD IN HERE WANTING YOU TO PICK THEM UP .
AND I SAID NO THIS CHILD WAS CRYING AND NEEDED SOME COMFORT YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM .
SO UM .
DID DID THEY SEPARATE THEM BY AGE GROUP .
YES .
BECAUSE I D THINK YOU KNOW I THINK THAT S ONE THING .
THAT WAS IMPORTANT .
RIGHT .
THEY DID THEY HAD LIKE UM THE THE CRAWLERS THE BABIES .
THAT DID NT WALK IN ONE ROOM .
UHHUH .
THE ONES .
THAT WERE STARTING TO WALK IN ONE ROOM .
THEN THEY HAD LIKE THE UM THREE THREE YEAR OLDS UPPER FOURS LOWER FOURS UPPER FIVES LOWER FIVES .
YOU KNOW JUST LIKE THAT .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW THEY REALLY DID SEPARATE THEM WELL .
I IT .
SOUND YEAH .
IT WAS JUST THE TEACHERS THEMSELVES .
IT SOUNDS LIKE TO ME YOUR YOUR CONCERN WOULD BE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE LOVING PEOPLE .
RIGHT .
BUT YEAH THAT THEY RE NOT .
AFFECTIONATE PEOPLE THAT THEY RE THEY RE KIND OF PAR .
YEAH .
THEIR SYSTEM .
MAY BE PARENTS THEMSELVES OR SOMETHING .
RIGHT .
BUT THEIR BUT THEIR SYSTEM WAS WAS GREAT BUT UM THE YOU KNOW THE CARING JUST WAS NT THERE .
UHHUH .
THE ONE WOMAN .
THAT TAUGHT THAT DID THE BABIES .
I WORKED WITH HER AND SHE WAS FABULOUS .
UHHUH .
SHE LOVED THEM BABIES AND SHE LOVED THEM AND CARED FOR THEM .
BUT UM EVERY ONE OF THE OTHERS THAT I SAW WAS JUST SCREAMING AND YELLING AND UM YOU KNOW WOULD MAKE ME .
A NERVOUS WRECK SO YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
I I I THINK THAT S PROBABLY A REALLY IMPORTANT THING BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE DOCTORATES AND P H D S AND ALL THAT KIND OF THING AND YOU KNOW KNOW ALL THE TECHNICAL STUFF BUT IF THEY DO NT REACH OUT AND TOUCH THE KIDS THEN THAT DOES NT DO ANY GOOD .
YEAH THESE KIDS ARE JUST IN A DAY CARE CENTER .
ALL DAY .
YEAH .
AND UH WITH NO ANY TYPE OF EMOTIONAL YOU KNOW GETTING LOVE GETTING CARE THEY RE JUST THERE .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
GOING THROUGH THIS ROUTINE .
AN .
WHICH IS LOUSY .
THE OTHER THE OTHER GROUP THAT WE HAD WAS KIND OF INTERESTING .
THE OTHER ONE .
WE WENT TO THE IT WAS A HUSBAND AND WIFE TEAM .
UHHUH .
AND WE KNEW THEM FROM OTHER ASSOCIATIONS BUT UH IT WAS KIND OF INTERESTING BECAUSE SHE WAS KIND OF THE STRICT ONE AND I THINK YOU KNOW SHE WOULD SHE D PUT HER ARM AROUND THE KIDS AND TALK TO THEM AND STUFF YOU KNOW BUT HE WAS ACTUALLY THE MORE UM THE MORE UH WHAT DEMONSTRATIVE TYPE .
UHHUH .
THE MORE LOVING .
HE WOULD YOU KNOW LAUGH WITH THE KIDS AND PLAY WITH THE KIDS AND .
UHHUH .
AND I IT WAS KIND OF INTERESTING TO SEE THAT THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY THE MAN IN THE GROUP THAT THAT DID THAT SIDE OF IT .
AN .
YEAH YOU DO NT SEE THAT MUCH .
YEAH SO THEY HAD A REALLY NICE BALANCE .
WE LIKED THAT ONE .
IN FACT IT WAS CALLED HUMPTY DUMPTY PLAY SCHOOL OR SOMETHING .
THAT S CUTE .
BUT THEY ALSO DID THEY ALSO DID SOME OF THE TEACHING THINGS AND THEN THEY HAD UM YOU KNOW OBEDIENCE OBEDIENCE WAS IMPORTANT .
YEAH THAT HAS TO BE WITH A DAY CARE CENTER .
AND YOU KNOW SO THEY YOU KNOW THEY USED UH OH I THINK THEY USED THE YOU PROBABLY HEARD WHERE YOU KNOW WHERE YOU STAND IN FRONT OF THE CLOCK AND GET YOUR POWER BACK TO CONTROL YOURSELF .
I VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT .
THAT S THAT S A NEW ONE .
AND IT S IT S ONE .
ON ME .
UH I CA NT REMEMBER WHAT .
THEY CALL IT ACTUALLY BUT Y YOU JUST STAND THEM IN FRONT OF A CLOCK AND YOU KNOW IT HAS A SECONDHAND .
THAT GOES AROUND .
UHHUH .
AND THEY HAVE TO STAND THERE .
SO HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IT .
UH I I DO NT SEE ANY PROBLEM WITH WITH TESTING FOR RANDOM DRUGS .
YEAH .
I I MYSELF ALMOST UH AM IN FAVOR OF IT .
UH I WORK AT HONEYWELL AND I WENT THROUGH A A PRETTY I DO NT KNOW I WENT THROUGH A STANDARD DRUG TESTING THING BEFORE I I WAS BROUGHT ON .
UHHUH .
I THINK THAT S PRETTY STANDARD .
AT LEAST AT HONEYWELL .
IT IS .
UH I THINK IT S IMPORTANT TO INSURE THE QUALITY AND AND UH I DO NT KNOW ALMOST THE GOODNESS OF CHARACTER .
YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
THAT KIND OF THING .
WHERE DO YOU WORK .
UH WELL I M A GRADUATE STUDENT RIGHT NOW AT CARNEGIE MELLON .
OH OKAY .
OH OKAY .
AND I I JUST CAME FROM SAINT PAUL .
HUH .
UH INTERVIEWING WITH THREE M .
OH GREAT .
AND UH THEY HAVE A POLICY FOR UH TESTING .
IF YOU IF THEY MAKE YOU .
AN OFFER THEN THEY LL TEST YOU RIGHT BEFORE YOU START .
RIGHT .
AND I GUESS THE ONLY DRAWBACK .
I CAN SEE TO TO DRUG TESTING IS IN IN CASE .
YOU ARE ON SOME SORT OF MEDICATION .
THAT MIGHT GIVE SOME UH SORT OF FALSE POSITIVE RESULT .
UHHUH .
THEN THERE COULD .
YEAH .
BE SOME SORT OF PROBLEM .
BUT I .
YEAH .
AND THAT THAT DEFINITELY HAPPENS YOU KNOW .
I MEAN THOSE THE DRUG TESTS SURE THEY RE ACCURATE BUT THERE S ALWAYS THAT MARGIN OF ERROR .
YEAH .
AND THAT S THAT S SOMETHING TO BE AWARE OF .
ANOTHER THING IS A LOT OF TIMES YOU KNOW THEY ARE NT THAT ACCURATE .
THEY ARE NT THAT SENSITIVE .
LIKE IF YOU RE ON A PRESCRIPTION DRUG OF SOME KIND YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO ABOUT THAT .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW I WAS ON A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT PRESCRIPTION DRUGS WHEN I WAS TESTED FOR HONEYWELL AND UH UH YOU KNOW I KNOW THEY DID NT CATCH THAT OR ELSE THEY WOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING .
UH I M SURE THEY SCREEN FOR JUST A PARTICULAR FEW TYPES .
ALTHOUGH THE LITERATURE .
THEY GIVE WITH YOU SAYS YEAH WE DO THIS AND THEN THEY LIST ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND DRUGS THEY TRY TO TEST FOR .
RIGHT .
UH I DO NT KNOW .
WHAT WHAT PROGRAM ARE YOU IN OVER AT CARNEGIE MELLON .
UH ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING .
OH OKAY .
GREAT .
UH YEAH I M A GRADUATE STUDENT AT U C F IN FLORIDA .
UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA .
OH WOW .
AND THIS IS ACTUALLY A .
AN INTERNSHIP UP HERE .
BUT UH THEY UH EVEN FOR INTERNS THEY THEY DO THE WHOLE RANDOM DRUG OR THE WHOLE DRUG TESTING THING SO .
THEY TEST YOU UH BEFORE THEY BEFORE YOU START OR BEFORE YOU EVEN .
RIGHT .
INTERVIEW OR .
UH THEY ESSENTIALLY NO I SURE DO NT UH THEY ESSENTIALLY UH THEY ESSENTIALLY UH MADE ME .
THE OFFER AND THEN AND THEN UH DID THE DRUG TESTING THING AFTER THAT .
SO UH IT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE YOU GO THROUGH THE THE GENERAL BATTERY OF ALL THEIR TESTS AND AND THEN THEY ESSENTIALLY GIVE YOU .
THE OFFER .
UHHUH .
AND THEN AT THAT POINT .
THEY LL THEY LL ASK YOU TO GO TO A DRUG TESTING AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
OH .
SO UH THERE S SOME NOISE ON THIS END .
I M ACTUALLY IN A MALL CALLING SO .
OH .
YOU PROBABLY WONDERED HUH .
BUT .
YEAH .
WH WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU WERE TO FAIL .
THEN DO THEY GIVE YOU LIKE ONE CH ONE MORE CHANCE OR TWO MORE CHANCES .
YES .
THAT S A GOOD QUESTION .
I BELIEVE FROM WHAT .
I REMEMBER OF THE LITERATURE .
THEY GAVE UH IF YOU FAIL I BELIEVE THEY GIVE YOU .
ONE .
MORE CHANCE .
THEY PROBABLY GIVE YOU .
A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN YOURSELF .
UHHUH .
AND THEN MAYBE GIVE YOU .
ANOTHER CHANCE TO GO THROUGH IT .
BUT UH YOU KNOW ONCE AGAIN THOSE THINGS ARE NOT THAT ACCURATE SO THERE S UNDOUBTEDLY A PROPORTION OF PEOPLE .
WHO DO FAIL YOU KNOW .
BUT UH WHA ARE YOU WORKING RIGHT NOW ANYWHERE OR .
UH NO .
OKAY .
I M JUST ABOUT TO FINISH MY MASTER S IN MAY AND UH .

OH .
AND UH THEY BASICALLY UH DID THE SAME EXACT THING .
UH WE .
BOTH GOT OUR INTERNSHIPS AT THE SAME TIME AND WE .
BOTH HAD TO GO THROUGH DRUG TESTING AT THE SAME TIME .
SO ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE WE WENT THROUGH A KIND OF AN IDENTICAL PROCESS .
BUT UH .
DID DO THEY TEST YOU AT RIGHT NOW AT WORK TOO .
NO NO .
THAT S .
OKAY .
ONE THING .
THEY DO NT DO IS IS DRUG TESTING WHILE YOU RE ON THE JOB .
UH I THINK I THINK THE UNWRITTEN RULE IS YEAH EXPECT IT BUT THEY DO NT DO IT .
OH .
YOU KNOW SO .
THAT S GOOD I GUESS .
I DO NT KNOW .
I MEAN I UH I HAVE GONE TO A COUPLE OF PARTIES SINCE SINCE THAT TIME AND WHILE I DO NT DO ANY DRUGS .
MYSELF I VE SEEN SOME PEOPLE .
WHO WORK THERE UH YOU KNOW SMOKING A JOINT OR WHATEVER .
UHHUH .
AND UH YOU KNOW THAT S THE KIND OF THING .

I VE I VE KNOWN HAS KIND OF GOTTEN INTO IT BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE MORE MOTORBOATERS YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
WHICH IS FINE .
WELL THAT S ABOUT ALL .
WE HAVE .
YEAH YEAH LOT OF PEOPLE DO NT DO NT SEE THE EXCITEMENT IN SAILING BUT THEN AGAIN THEY MAY NEV M THEY MAY NEVER HAVE TRIED ANYTHING LIKE UH CATAMARAN .
UHHUH .
AND UH THAT S WHEN YOU REALLY START GETTING INTO SPEED .
YOU KNOW YOU ACTUALLY SOME CATAMARANS YOU CAN ACTUALLY PULL PEOPLE BEHIND THE SKIERS THEY GET SO FAST YOU KNOW .
I DID NT KNOW THAT .
YEAH THEY GET PRETTY QUICK BUT .
THAT .
UH .
THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING .
YEAH YEAH I HAVE NT I HAVE NT PERSONALLY DONE THAT BUT UH THE RACES I I WORK WITH A GUY RIGHT NOW THAT UH RACES CATAMARANS IN THE SUMMERTIME .
UHHUH .
AND UH HE S PRETTY GASSED ABOUT IT .
HE .
S GOT A GOOD UH .
WHAT KIND OF WHAT LAKE DO YOU .
ALL USE .
WELL HE UH HE S FROM DETROIT .
UHHUH .
SO HE USUALLY GOES ON ONE OF THE GREAT LAKES I THINK AND DOES HIS SAILING .
UH FOR ME I I GO BACK TO ORLANDO UH IN ABOUT A MONTH AND SO DOWN THERE BASICALLY JUST GO TO THE COAST .
WE RE ABOUT THIRTY MILES FROM COCO BEACH AND THE EAST COAST AND THERE S A LOT OF PLACES THERE YOU CAN GO YOU KNOW .
SO UH SO THAT S A GOOD THING .
YEAH .
BUT YEAH SO WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A JOB .
UH I BUILD TRANSFORMERS .
OH REALLY .
YEAH .
OKAY IS THAT FOR T I OR .
NO IT S FOR COOPER INDUSTRIES .
OKAY .
ARE THEY PRIMARILY ELECTRONIC THEN .
YEAH .
OKAY .
WELL .
WELL THAT .
THEY HAVE A YOU KNOW WORLDWIDE BUT .
RIGHT .
W ALL .
WE DO HERE IS MAKE TRANSFORMERS .
OH OKAY .
ELECTRONICS AND STUFF LIKE THAT .
GREAT .
YEAH HOW DO YOU LIKE IT DOWN THERE IN TEXAS .
IT S REAL NICE .
YEAH .
BEEN HERE ALL MY LIFE .
OH NO DOUBT .
YEAH .
OKAY .
I VE NEVER BEEN TO TEXAS .
I VE BEEN TO OKLAHOMA BUT UH THAT S ABOUT AS FAR AS .
OH IT S N OKLAHOMA S .
NOTHING LIKE IT .
YEAH .
OKAY WELL THAT S GOOD BECAUSE I DID NT LIKE OKLAHOMA THAT WELL .
YOUR TURN .
OKAY .
UH I DO NT THINK THEY SHOULD ABOLISH IT .
I THINK I THINK IF THEY PUT IT INTO FORCE MORE OFTEN THEY WOULD NT HAVE AS MANY PROBLEMS AS THEY VE GOT .
BUT NOT FOR PETTY THEFT .
RIGHT .
NO NO .
FOR MAJOR THINGS LIKE PREMEDITATED MURDER .
MASS MURDERS .
UH YOU KNOW THAT TYPE OF THING .
I DO NT THINK IT SHOULD JUST BE USED LOOSELY .
WELL IT SHOULD BE USED AS A DETERRENT DO YOU THINK .
WELL .
OR SHOULD IT BE USED UH A TO PREVENT FURTHER UH CRIME .
YES YES .
TO PREVENT THESE PEOPLE FROM EVER GETTING OUT ON THE STREET .
HUH .
BY YOU KNOW SOME TECHNICALITY .
AND THEY GO DOWN THE LINE TEN YEARS AND THEN ON SOME LITTLE TECHNICALITY .
THEY GET OUT AND ON THE STREETS AGAIN DOING THE SAME THEY DID BEFORE .
UHHUH .
AND YOU KNOW THAT S ABOUT THE ONLY THING .
LIKE FOR PETTY FOR THEFT AND AND STUFF LIKE THAT OR MANSLAUGHTER YOU KNOW I DO NT THINK THEY SHOULD DO THAT .
WELL YOU KNOW THERE S THIS OLD UH JEWISH IS IT SAYING ABOUT AN EYE FOR AN EYE AND A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH .
OH WELL I GUESS .
IF I IF IT WAS SOMEONE IN MY FAMILY I D PROBABLY FEEL THAT WAY .
YOU KNOW I VE NEVER HAD ANYBODY IN MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY UH MURDERED AND SO I REALLY WOULD NT KNOW .
BUT BUT I FEEL LIKE IF I DID I PROBABLY WOULD FEEL THAT WAY .
WELL ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS THINKING ABOUT IS UH YOU KNOW FROM SOCIETY S POINT OF VIEW IF YOU PUT A VALUE ON EACH PERSON WHAT .
YOU WANT TO DO IS TO MAXIMIZE THE END GAME VALUE .
SO IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE THAT THAT DESTROYS THAT VALUE .
UHHUH .
UH THEN WHAT .
YOU WANT TO TAKE STEPS TO UH MINIMIZE THE LOSS .
OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO ALSO PUT VALUE ON THE CRIMINAL .
RIGHT .
SO IF YOU TERMINATE HIM THAT S A LOSS OF VALUE .
WELL THAT S TRUE .
SO YOU KNOW IF YOU WEIGHT EVERYONE EQUALLY THEN YOU HAVE TO SAY WELL THE LIKELIHOOD OF NOT TERMINATING HIM IF YOU DO NT TERMINATE HIM THE LIKELIHOOD IS EXPECTED VALUE OF LOSS OF LIFE IS GREATER THAN ONE PERSON .
IN OTHER WORDS YOU D HAVE TO YOU D HAVE TO MURDER MORE THAN ONE OTHER PERSON .
BESIDES HIM .
UH IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY TAKING HIS LIFE .
OKAY .
ANOTHER WAY .
YOU COULD DO IT IS WEIGHT .
THIS VALUE BY UH THE VALUE TO SOCIETY OF THE PEOPLE .
UH WHICH IS PRETTY DELICATE THING TO DO .
BUT ONE WAY OF DOING IT IS UH BY INCOME .
SO IF THIS GUY DOES NT MAKE A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY .
WHICH IS OFTEN TIMES .
THE CASE THEN .
HIS LIFE IS NT WORTH VERY MUCH THEN .
THEN HE S OBVIOUSLY NOT WORTH VERY MUCH AND SO UH THE LIKELIHOOD THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE EXPECTED EXPECTED MURDERS BY HIM IS IS UH INTEGRATED OVER THE INCOME OF THE PEOPLE UH THAT HE MURDERS IS MAYBE YOU KNOW A LOSS OF WHO KNOWS EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS .
UH BUT IF HE ONLY UH INTEGRATED YOU KNOW INTEGRATED INCOME OVER THE EXPECTED REMAINDER OF HIS LIFE OF IS UH SMALL LESS THAN EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THEN YOU TERMINATE HIM .
OF COURSE ONE OF THE THINGS .
THAT HAPPENS IF YOU USE THAT ALGORITHM IS YOU FIND THAT IT S MORE EASY IT S EASIER TO UH TO UH TERMINATE OLDER PEOPLE THAN YOUNGER PEOPLE SINCE THE INTEGRATION OF THEIR INCOME OVER THE REST OF THEIR LIVES IS GOING TO BE LESS .
RIGHT .
WHICH MEANS WELL I SUPPOSE YOU COULD SAY WELL THAT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH POTENTIAL FOR REHABILITATION .
POTENTIAL .
I MEAN THAT S THAT S THE KEY RIGHT THERE .
POTENTIAL .
UHHUH .
NOW ARE THEY ARE THEY REHABILITATIVE OR OR NOT .
NOW THAT S ALL FINE AND WELL AND AND UH GOOD PHILOSOPHICAL .
BUT IF YOU RE INVOLVED YOURSELF PERSONALLY .
UHHUH .
UH I KNOW I HAVE A FRIEND .
WHOSE UH SON WAS MURDERED UH ON THE NIGHT BEFORE HIS SIXTEENTH BIRTHDAY .
AND LET ME TELL YOU UH I I KNEW THEM PERSONALLY UH NOT INTIMATELY BUT QUITE WELL AND UH YOU RE TALKING ABOUT REAL TRAUMA .
I MEAN TRAUMA .
THAT EXTENDS BEYOND THE COUNTING OF BODIES .
I CAN IMAGINE .
THE FATHER YOU KNOW OF COURSE A PARENT LOSING A TEENAGE CHILD IS ABOUT AS BAD AS IT COULD POSSIBLY GET I THINK IN TERMS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT .
YES .
UH AND .
WAS HE MURDERED .
DID THEY FIND WHO KILLED HIM .
OH YES .
THEY FOUND HIM AND HE IS ON TRIAL FOR CAPITAL MURDER .
SO IT HAS NT BEEN A LONG TIME AGO .
JUST RECENTLY .
UH WELL ACTUALLY HE HAS I I M SORRY .
HE WAS CONVICTED UH AND OF COURSE NOW YOU KNOW AND YOU GO THROUGH TWO OR THREE HUNDRED YEARS OF APPEALS PROCESS BUT .
YEAH YEAH .
THAT APPEALS PROCESS I MEAN IT S WHAT YOU KNOW REALLY YOU KNOW JUST DRAGS OUT AND OUT AND OUT .
MY BROTHERINLAW HERE IN TEXAS HIS BY MARRIAGE MY SISTER S UH HUSBAND HIS SISTER WAS MURDERED DOWN HERE BY A GUY IN IN WELL ACTUALLY IN HOUSTON AND UH HE .
WHAT DO YOU THINK .
WELL UH I CA NT BE TERRIBLY AUTHORITATIVE ON WHAT LIFE WAS LIKE THIRTY YEARS AGO UH BECAUSE I M NOT THAT OLD YET .
UHHUH .
UM .
I CAN BE BUT GO AHEAD .
UH I KNOW THAT UH I MEAN OBVIOUSLY YOU LOOK AT AT TECHNOLOGIC THE TECHNOLOGICAL ASPECT OF OF SOCIAL CHANGE .
I MEAN YOU DID NT HAVE UH YOU DID NT HAVE VIDEO GAMES .
YOU DID NT HAVE HOME COMPUTERS .
YOU DID NT HAVE XEROX MACHINES .
RIGHT .
I MEAN UH YOU YOU TRY TO YOU GO INTO A A BUSINESS TODAY AND YOU YOU TRY TO IMAGINE THE WHOLE THING EXCEPT RUNNING OFF OF CARBON PAPER AND IT S ALMOST INCONCEIVABLE NOW BECAUSE THE XEROX MACHINES AND AND EVERYTHING HAVE BECOME SUCH YOU KNOW SU SUCH A A PAR A PART OF THE WAY .
WE LIVE .
RIGHT .
WE FAX .
AND MUMBLEX .
EVERYTHING .
YEAH .
WE DO NT EVEN WAIT FOR THE MAIL ANYMORE .
UHHUH .
RIGHT .
YEAH UH A BUSINESS ASSOCIATE OF MINE WAS WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW IT USED TO BE WHERE YOU WOULD SEND THINGS THROUGH THE MAIL AND YOU HAD TO DO SOMETHING THIS WAS CONCERNING THE S E C AND SO IF THEY HAD BUSINESS TO DO THEY HAD TO FINISH IT YOU KNOW THREE DAYS IN ADVANCE SO THEY COULD GET IT THROUGH THE MAIL .
RIGHT .
AND NOW IT S THE KIND OF THING WHERE YOU CAN WORK UP UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE YOU CAN GET IT THERE YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
IN IN A MATTER OF MINUTES .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW THROUGH A FAX MACHINE AND BECAUSE OF THAT THESE QUOTE UNQUOTE CONVENIENCE TYPE ITEMS HAVE MADE WORK THAT MUCH MORE INTENSE AND THAT MUCH HARDER .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE YOU RE EXPECTED TO WORK ON STUFF UP UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE .
YOU RE EXPECTED TO EXACTLY .
AND I RECENTLY READ AN ARTICLE ON JUST THIS THAT SAID STRESS TODAY IS SO MUCH WORSE .
IT SHOULD BE LESS BECAUSE WE HAVE A MICROWAVE AND OUR GRANDMOTHERS HAD TO BAKE BROWNIES AND WE CAN THROW THEM IN A MICROWAVE FOR TWO MINUTES BUT THE MORE CONVENIENCES WE HAVE THE MORE .
THAT S EXPECTED OF US .
UHHUH .
AND WE HAVE NO DOWN TIME .
LIKE WE DO NT STOP AND WAIT FOR THINGS TO HAPPEN BECAUSE WE DO NT HAVE TO .
YEAH .
SO WE KEEP MOVING .
WE DO NT STOP AND WAIT FOR THE THINGS TO BAKE AND THIS TO HAPPEN AND THAT TO HAPPEN .
WE JUST HIT BUTTONS AND KEEP GOING TO THE NEXT THING .
SO WE HAVE NO RELAXATION TIME IN BETWEEN .
UHHUH .
SO THEY SAY THAT S REALLY A BAD THING .
THAT YOU NEED TO LEARN A LOT OF WAYS TO TO DEAL WITH THAT AND GET YOUR YOUR TIME IN BETWEEN THINGS .
UHHUH .
SO THAT S GOOD .
THAT S AN INTERESTING POINT .
BUT I JUST THINK OUR OUR FAMILY LIVES HAVE CHANGED DRASTICALLY .
AND I THINK THAT S JU OF COURSE .
A PART OF IT IS TECHNOLOGY .
I MEAN OUR KIDS WHERE WOULD THEY BE WITHOUT NINTENDO AND YOU KNOW THEIR T V SHOWS AND NO SOME OF THAT IS REALLY BAD I THINK .
BUT WE HAVE ALL SINGLE FAMILIES .
SO MANY SINGLE FAMILIES NOW .
UH A LOT OF WORKING BOTH .
PARENTS ARE WORKING .
SO THERE S A WHOLE BIG EFFECT ON OUR KIDS AND NOT VERY MANY OF MY DAUGHTER S FRIENDS REALLY ARE ON THEIR ORIGINAL MOTHER AND FATHER .
YOU KNOW I M WONDERING WHAT .
THIS IS GOING TO DO IN TEN AND TWENTY YEARS .
WELL THERE S THAT AND THERE S THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW NOWADAYS FEWER AND FEWER COUPLES ARE DECIDING TO HAVE KIDS .
WHICH GENERALLY TENDS TO HAPPEN .
I MEAN THE U S WOULD BE ACTUALLY DECLINING IN POPULATION SLIGHTLY IF IT WERE NT FOR THE FACT THAT WE .
HAVE CONTINUATION LARGE SCALE IMMIGRATION INTO THE COUNTRY .
YOU RE PROBABLY RIGHT .
AND I M AN O B NURSE AND THAT S NEVER REALLY OCCURRED TO ME BUT THAT S THAT S INTERESTING .
I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT .
THAT WAY .
YEAH YEAH .
I SAW THAT THE NUMBERS ON THAT AWHILE BACK AND I WAS LIKE UHHUH SO .
YEAH YEAH .
THAT S TRUE .
WHEN IS THIS GOOD OR NOT GOOD .
WELL UH .
WE DO NT KNOW THAT YET .
IN TERMS OF THE LONG TERM EFFECT EFFECT ON ON AMERICA IN TERMS OF THE CULTURE AND EVERYTHING I DO NT KNOW .
UH .
YEAH .
I DO NT KNOW EITHER .
MOST OF THE OF THE NEXT GENERATION IS GOING TO BE IN OR OR AN EX .
EX EXTREMELY LARGE PAR PART OF THE NEXT GENERATION IS GOING TO BE YOU KNOW SECOND GENERATION F UH FROM IMMIGRANT PARENTS .
THAT S TRUE .
AND THEY RE GOING TO BE REALLY STRUGGLING AND I DO NT THINK THAT AMERICA IS CURRENTLY THE TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT WHERE STRUGGLING UP FROM THE BOTTOM IS NECESSARILY CONSIDERED TO BE GOOD .
RIGHT RIGHT .
I MEAN IT S NO LONGER THE THE UH THE ACCOMPLISHMENT THAT IT THAT IT ONCE WAS AND NOT THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE REALLY TRYING I DO NT THINK .
YEAH .
YEAH .
THAT S KIND OF SCARY .
HUH .
WELL THAT S TRUE .
BUT I IT S JUST VERY VERY DIFFERENT AND I GUESS EVERY TEN YEARS .
IT S JUST BEEN VERY DIFFERENT .
YEAH .
SO .
AND I DO NT KNOW WHAT S GOING TO HAPPEN .
UH I KNOW WHAT .
I M SEEING HERE AT M MY JOB IS THAT PEOPLE ARE HAVING THEIR CHILDREN MUCH LATER IN LIFE .
YEAH THA .
SO THAT THEY RE ESTABLISHING CAREERS AND THEY VE GOT THEIR HOMES AND THEY VE GOT .
ALL RIGHTIE .
OKAY DO YOU HAVE A BUDGET THAT YOU GO ON .

UHHUH UHHUH .
THAT WAY I KNOW HOW MUCH POCKET CHANGE I M GOING TO HAVE LEFT AT THE END OF THE MONTH .
UHHUH UHHUH .
OR AT THE END OF THE PAYCHECK ANYWAY .

SO THAT WORKS OKAY FOR ME .
UHHUH WELL MY BILLS I USUALLY KNOW APPROXIMATELY HOW MUCH THEY RE GOING TO BE .

UHHUH SAME HERE .
UH VERY SELDOM ARE THEY ANY DIFFERENT AND THEN UH LIKE FOR GROCERIES AND EVERYTHING WE TRY TO PUT LIKE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS IN A LITTLE CAN IN THE KITCHEN .

UHHUH .
AND UH BUT I DO NT HAVE ANY YOU KNOW SMALL CHILDREN TO HAVE ANYTHING EXTRA COME UP YOU KNOW LIKE UH RUNNING TO THE DOCTOR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WITH THEM .
RIGHT LUCKILY I DO NT EITHER I MEAN YOU KNOW .
MAYBE MY CAT WOULD GET SICK BUT I MEAN USUALLY THAT S NOT SO MUCH THAT IT WOULD THROW ME OFF .

UHHUH .
BUT I DO TRY TO BUILD IN A LITTLE EXTRA MONEY EACH MONTH TO TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT TYPE OF THING SO .

UHHUH .
THERE S ALWAYS ONE OR TWO STRAGGLERS THAT USUALLY THEY WERE FOR ME IT WORKED OUT THAT THEY WERE THE SMALLER ONES .
UHHUH UHHUH .
BUT I WOULD PAY ALL OF THEM AT ONE SITTING AND I WOULD KNOW OKAY YOU CAN GO SPEND THIS MUCH ON GROCERIES NOW AND YOU GET THIS MUCH A WEEK AND THAT IS IT .
YEAH RIGHT .
AND AND IT WORKED OKAY FOR ME .
UHHUH .
I DO NT KNOW .
AND .
RIGHT NOW I I M IN THE MODE OF TRYING TO DIG OUT OF DEBT I THINK AS EVERYBODY IS AND SO .
OH YEAH RIGHT NOW IT S TERRIBLE IS NT IT .
IT S YEAH IT S REALLY BAD .

BUT UH IT S GOING PRETTY WELL AND I VE GOT A REAL GOOD PLAN MAPPED OUT HERE SO .

MY UH ROOMMATE DOES SEW SOME AND AND UH I SHE HAS NT SEWED ANYTHING IN A LONG TIME BUT I I M SURE THAT SHE COULD PICK IT UP AGAIN .
MY MOTHER ALWAYS SEWED SHE TRIED TO TEACH ME WHEN I WAS YOUNG BUT .
UHHUH .

I HAVE SOME SISTERS I HAVE THREE SISTERS AND NONE OF THOSE ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN SEWING .
YEAH BUT THAT S A REAL GOOD WAY TO SAVE MONEY .
THOUGH BY DOING THAT .
YEAH AND THEN I CAN ALSO YOU KNOW DO SOME CRAFTS AND SELL THOSE AT GARAGE SALES .
UHHUH UHHUH .
SO WHICH I VE BEEN DOING .
WELL THAT S A GOOD WAY TO TO MAKE A LITTLE EXTRA MONEY .
UHHUH .
WELL THIS IS ANOTHER WAY THAT I M MAKING A LITTLE EXTRA MONEY SO THAT WAS YOU KNOW NICE THAT I TRIPPED OVER THIS OPPORTUNITY AND YOU RE ACTUALLY MY FIRST CALL .
OH REALLY .
YEAH .
OH .
I HAD NOT UH DONE I I GUESS TODAY .
WELL HAVE YOU CALLED .
TODAY S MY FIRST DAY THAT I COULD .
OH .
EVEN DO IT .
OH IT IS .
YEAH YOU BEAT ME TO THE PUNCH HERE .
OH WELL THAT THAT S NICE YOU KNOW .
I I WAS ABOUT TO CALL TO GET TO SEE IF I COULD GET ON WITH SOMEBODY SO .
UHHUH .
SO THAT WAS GREAT .
YEAH WELL I GUESS THAT S ABOUT ALL I CAN TALK TO ABOUT BUDGETS WHEN I WAS WORKING I UH BOUGHT A BOND A MONTH OUT OF MY YOU KNOW THEY AUTOMATICALLY TOOK IT OUT OF MY .
YEAH .
OUT OF MY PAYROLL .
YEAH I TAKE HAVE SOME MONEY TAKEN IT AND PUT IN A FOUR OH ONE K .
OKAY GO AHEAD .
WELL UH A FRIEND OF MINE ACTUALLY WORKS FOR MCDONALD DOUGLAS IN THE UH IN THE SPACE STATION PROGRAM SO .
OH .
I GET TO FIND OUT A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT S GOING ON THERE AND .
SURE .
IT SURE SOUNDS LIKE THAT S GOING TO BE A REALLY VIABLE PROGRAM IF IT CONTINUES TO BE FUNDED AT CURRENT LEVELS .
UHHUH .
UH THEY RE THEY RE GOING TO BE DOING A LOT OF INTERESTING THINGS UH I THINK ONE OF THE BIG THINGS HE S INVOLVED WITH IS THE MICRO GRAVITY PAYLOADS AND THAT HAS A DIRECT IMPACT ON A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE REALLY CA NT DO DOWN HERE ON EARTH INCLUDING UH SOME NEW PHARMACEUTICAL TECHNIQUES .
OH YOU RE KIDDING YEAH .
SO YOU KNOW THERE S .
HUH .
THERE S A BIG OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO EXPLORE UH WHAT SORTS OF THINGS YOU CAN DO IN A ZERO GRAVITY ENVIRONMENT .
UHHUH SURE .
SO I SUSPECT THAT WE LL SEE A LOT OF GAINS FROM THAT .
OH THAT S GOOD BECAUSE SOMETIMES I WONDER YOU KNOW BEING A UH LAY PERSON OUT THERE OF NOT UH KNOWING E EXACTLY WHAT S GOING ON IN SPACE WHETHER YOU KNOW THEY RE GOING AHEAD AND DOING THINGS AND WHETHER OR NOT WE RE SPENDING TOO MUCH MONEY ON THE PROGRAMS AND NOT SPENDING ENOUGH MONEY ON THE EARTH THAT WE HAVE HERE BEING YOU KNOW TO ME ALL THIS UH SPACE EXPLORATION THAT WE VE DONE THUS FAR HAS TOLD US THAT THERE S NO OTHER PLACE LIKE EARTH THAT UH WE CA NT LIVE ON MARS WE CA NT LIVE HERE WE CA NT LIVE THERE I MEAN THIS IS THE THE PLACE THAT WE HAVE TO LIVE I MEAN THERE S UH NO OTHER RESOURCE FOR US TO TO LOOK AT OTHER THAN HERE SO IT S KIND OF LIKE TO ME I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A LOT MORE MONEY BEING PUT TOWARD TAKING CARE OF THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE HAVE HERE AND NOT SO MUCH EMPHASIS PUT ON WHAT S GOING OUT IN SPACE AND WHAT YOU KNOW NOT THAT I WANT EVERYTHING TO HALT AND LET S FORGET ABOUT THE SPACE PROGRAM OR WHATEVER BECAUSE WE RE ALWAYS CURIOUS AND WE ALWAYS NEED TO KNOW MORE THINGS BUT UH TO ME IT S KIND OF LIKE LET S TRY AND CLEAN UP THE AIR THAT WE HAVE HERE LET S TRY TO TAKE CARE OF THE LAKES THAT ARE GETTING POLLUTED AND THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON HERE MAINLY BECAUSE UH THE SPACE PROGRAM HAS TAUGHT US THAT THERE IS NO OTHER PLACE FOR US I MEAN THIS IS IT I MEAN IF WE WOULD HAVE UH IF WE WOULD HAVE WENT INTO SPACE AND FOUND MARS A LIVABLE UH PLANET WE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE INHABITED IT AND UH YOU KNOW WHO WOULD HAVE CARED ABOUT EARTH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ANOTHER PLANET TO KIND OF TAKE OVER AND UH CONTINUE ON SO YOU KNOW AND THAT WHEN I LOOK AT THE SPACE PROGRAM ITSELF I THINK OF IT YOU KNOW AS BEING IN TERMS OF IT S IT S INTERESTING TO LEARN BUT IT S ALSO IT S IT BRINGS DOWN THE FACT THAT THIS EARTH IS IT IT S IT FOR US YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN .
RIGHT .
UH UNLESS TECHNOLOGY MAKES THE DECISION THAT WE ARE ALL GOING TO LIVE IN SPACE OR WHATEVER BUT I WOULD LOVE TO UH GO INTO THE SPACE SHUTTLE SOME DAY AND UH JUST SEE UH YOU KNOW THE EARTH AND THE DIFFERENT PLANETS AND THINGS LIKE THAT I I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY INTERESTING TO DO BUT WHETHER IT WOULD BE FEASIBLE TO DO I DO NT KNOW .
WELL UH AS FAR AS THE PRACTICAL ASPECTS GO I SUSPECT THAT THE SPACE STATION MAY ACTUALLY BE A GOOD COMPROMISE .
UHHUH .
BETWEEN YOU KNOW DEEP SPACE I M SORRY DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION .
UHHUH .
AND UH AND NOT DOING ANYTHING .
SURE .
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO OFF LOAD SOME THINGS TO THE SPACE STATION .
EXACTLY UHHUH .
AND UH YOU KNOW PERHAPS WE CAN FIND BETTER TECHNIQUES FOR DOING THINGS THAT UH WE D NORMALLY DO DOWN HERE .
UHHUH .
THAT ARE DAMAGING TO THE ENVIRONMENT .
EXACTLY YEAH THAT S TRUE YOU KNOW AND I I THINK OF UH I M SURE YOU PROBABLY HAVE HEARD OF THE GENESIS PROGRAM THAT S GOING ON CURRENTLY OUT IN THE ARIZONA DESERT .
UHHUH .
UH THERE S UH YOU KNOW THEY RE TRYING TO LOOK AT HOW THINGS EFFECT EVERYTHING IN TRYING TO CREATE YOU KNOW AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY HAVE AN OCEAN AND THEY HAVE THE LAKES AND THEN THEY HAVE THE DESERT PART OF IT AND THEN THEY HAVE AN AREA THAT S MORE UH YOU KNOW FULL OF UH VEGETATION TROPICALS THAT KIND OF THING TO KIND OF LOOK AT THINGS AND SAY YOU KNOW THE ENVIRONMENT WISE THIS IS WHERE WE RE LIVING BUT WHAT WHAT EFFECTS IT AND HOW CAN WE IMPROVE IT AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND I I THINK IN SPACE UH I DO NT KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE COULD LIVE UP IN SPACE UH FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME I MEAN JUST THE WAY THAT WE RE AFFECTED BY WHEN IT S CLOUDY OUT AND IT S CLOUDY FOR DAYS AND WE DO NT SEE THE SUN AND THE PEOPLE THEIR MOODS ARE EXTREME YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
IT S LIKE GOD IF I DO NT GET TO SEE THE SUN I M GOING TO BE IN THIS BAD MOOD ALL THIS ENTIRE TIME AND THIS IS HOW I SEE PEOPLE REACTING YOU KNOW WHEN IS THE SUN GOING TO COME OUT SO I WONDER HOW YOU KNOW SOMEBODY LIVING UP IN SPACE IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO TOLERATE NEVER SEEING THE SUN YOU KNOW IN THE ASPECT THAT WE SEE IT .
RIGHT .
UH AND NEVER SEEING UH YOU KNOW LIGHT BRIGHT DAYS YOU KNOW AND .
DO YOU KNOW ANYONE .
THAT UH IS IS IN A NURSING HOME OR HAS EVER BEEN IN ONE .
NO .
BUT I MY GRANDPARENTS WERE LOOKING INTO IT BEFORE SO I KNOW WHAT .
THEY VE SAID .
UHHUH .
UHHUH .
WELL I M TRYING TO THINK .
MY UH UH WIFE S GRANDMOTHER HAD ALZHEIMER S AND THEY WERE GOING TO PUT HER INTO A A NURSING HOME AND UH THEY WHEN THEY PUT HER IN SHE HAD ALL KINDS OF TROUBLE AND THE NURSING HOME MADE THEM COME AND TAKE HER BACK BECAUSE SHE WAS BEING A A YOU KNOW A A NUISANCE .
OR WORSE THAN A NUISANCE I MEAN .
OH THEY THOUGHT IT WAS TOO MUCH OF A BOTHER .
SHE SORT OF WENT YOU KNOW BANANAS AND THEY COULD NT COULD NT DEAL WITH HER .
SO I GUESS YOU NEED TO UH KNOW WHETHER IT S A YOU KNOW A NO DEPOSIT NO RETURN KIND OF THING WHETHER .
RIGHT .
IF THEY RE EQUIPPED TOO TO HANDLE THE KIND OF PATIENTS YOU RE GOING TO HAVE .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW PUT IN THERE TOO .
BECAUSE I KNOW MY GRANDPARENTS WANTED TO HAVE SOME INDEPENDENCE STILL .
RIGHT .
THEY WANTED SOME PLACE .
THEY CAN GO AND HAVE THEIR MEALS AND A NURSE ON STAFF JUST IN CASE .
THEY NEEDED HER BUT THEY WANTED TO BE INDEPENDENT AS WELL .
RIGHT .
HAVE THEIR OWN ROOM .
MY GRANDMOTHER ACTUALLY WAS IN A A NURSING HOME THAT UH THERE WAS A RETIREMENT HOTEL AND THEN A UH THERE WAS SOME SORT OF FULLTIME CARE PLACE .
THAT WAS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH IT SO FOR UH THE FIRST FEW YEARS .
SHE HAD HER OWN APARTMENT AND YOU KNOW MADE HER OWN MEALS SOMETIMES .
BUT COULD COULD ALSO GO AND EAT SOMEPLACE ELSE .
UHHUH .
AND THEN UH AS SHE BECAME LESS ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF HERSELF THEN SHE MOVED INTO THIS OTHER PART .
THAT WAS ABLE TO UH PROVIDE FULLTIME CARE AND UH SHE DID NT HAVE TO DO ANYTHING ANYMORE .
BUT MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT MOST PEOPLE .
THAT MOVE INTO NURSING HOMES DIE VERY QUICKLY .
AND THAT S SOM I DO NT KNOW WHETHER THAT S BECAUSE THEY YOU KNOW SORT OF GIVE UP HOPE ONCE THEY GET IN THERE OR WHAT .
THE THE REASON IS .
BUT I THINK THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF TIME THAT SOMEBODY LIVES IN A NURSING HOME IS ONLY LIKE SIX MONTHS OR SOMETHING .
WELL A LOT OF IT S PROBABLY TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT PEOPLE GO TO IT BECAUSE THEY NEED HELP .
YEAH .
THEY NEED HEALTH CARE SO THEY RE ALREADY ILL BEFORE THEY GO .
RIGHT .
THAT S PROBABLY A LARGE FACTOR .
YEAH .
IF IF YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF AT ALL OR HAVE SOMEONE .
THAT CAN TAKE CARE OF YOU THEN YOU STAY WHERE YOU ARE .
THEN YOU ONLY GO THERE AS A LAST RESORT .
UHHUH .
OR PEOPLE SEND YOU THERE AS A LAST RESORT .
RIGHT RIGHT .
THAT S WHAT .
MY GRANDPARENTS IT WAS JUST SO THAT THE REST OF THE RELATIVES WOULD HAVE PEACE OF MIND KNOWING THAT IF ANYTHING HAPPENED THERE WAS SOMEBODY THERE FOR THEM .
UHHUH .
SO THAT WAS THEIR THINKING .
SOMEBODY .
WHO WOULD KNOW WHAT TO DO IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY .
RIGHT .
AND ALSO SO THEY COULD FIND SOMEPLACE THAT THEY ENJOYED WHILE THEY STILL HAD CHOICES TO MAKE .
RIGHT .
SO THEY WOULD NT BE STUCK GOING INTO JUST WHATEVER .
NURSING HOME WAS AVAILABLE AT THE TIME .
I GUESS THAT S A PROBLEM TOO FOR PEOPLE .
WAIT LISTS AND ALL .
YEAH I GUESS .
THAT UH YOU CA NT ALWAYS GET IN WHEN YOU WANT TOO AND OF COURSE YOU CA NT JUST SIT AROUND AND WAIT .
RIGHT .
WHEN YOU NEED IT YOU NEED IT .
YEAH .
I GUESS .
AND THE MONEY IS ALSO ANOTHER ISSUE .
HOW YOU RE GOING TO PAY FOR IT .
RIGHT .
AT THAT STAGE OF LIFE .
YOU ONLY HAVE SO MUCH MONEY LEFT AND I GUESS IT S NOT EXACTLY FAIR FOR THE YOUNGER FAMILY MEMBERS TO HAVE TO PUT IT IN THEIR SAVINGS .
YEAH .
I MEAN IT IS KIND OF FAIR BUT IT S ALSO NOT FAIR BECAUSE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN CHILDREN TO RAISE .
SURE .
SO IT S ANOTHER PROBLEM .
AND YOU PROBABLY IF IT WERE YOU YOU PROBABLY WOULD NT WANT SOMEONE CHOOSING A PLACE FOR YOU TO LIVE BASED ON LOWEST PRICE .
RIGHT RIGHT .
SO IT IT S JUST SO COMPLICATED ANYMORE I THINK .
PEOPLE OUTLIVE THEIR SAVINGS .
AND WITH MEDICINE BEING THE WAY .
IT IS YOU RE EXTENDING LIFE WHERE SOMETIMES THE QUALITY OF LIVING HAS GONE DOWN AND THEY RE NOT NECESSARILY ENJOYING LIFE ANYMORE .
YEAH .
WELL MAYBE THAT S THE PURPOSE OF THE NURSING HOME IS TO HAVE THEM GO SOMEPLACE WHERE THEY CAN SEE THAT IT S NOT WORTH CONTINUING .
IT S JUST A SHAME .
THAT S THE WAY .
IT HAS TO BE .
I THINK .
YEAH .
THE RETIREMENT HOME IDEA S A NICE IDEA .
TO GO AND FIND OLDER PEOPLE AND WITH SIMILAR INTERESTS AND SOMEPLACE TO STAY AND CAUSE LIKE IF YOUR SPOUSE DIED MUMBLEX ALL ALONE IT D BE NICE TO GO SOMEPLACE WITH PEOPLE SIMILAR TO YOU .
RIGHT .
TO HAVE FRIENDS .
YEAH I VE KNOWN QUITE A FEW PEOPLE .
THAT HAVE UH GONE TO RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES .
I DO NT KNOW IF THEY HAVE THEM BACK THERE BUT HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND IN ARI .
GO AHEAD .
OH OKAY .
YEAH THE UH SUBJECT IS CHILD CARE AND HOW TO DETERMINE CHILD CARE AND THAT S UH AN INTERESTING ONE FOR ME TO TALK ABOUT SINCE I HAVE NO CHILDREN BUT I DID RUN A CHILD CARE FACILITY FOR A WHILE .
UM .
AND UH HAVE SOME .
WELL YOU SHOULD YOU SHOULD HAVE SOME OPINIONS ON THAT THEN .
I DO HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ON THAT YEAH .
UH IT S UH AN INTERESTING EXPERIENCE TO BE A SURROGATE PARENT FOR OR PARENT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE .
THERE AND UH IT S ALSO VERY INTERESTING IN TERMS OF HOW PEOPLE CHOOSE THE CHILD CARE FACILITIES .
WELL I GUESS IF I WERE GOING TO CHOOSE I MEAN MY FIRST CONSIDERATION WOULD BE SAFETY .
RIGHT .
MY SECOND CONSIDERATION WOULD BE UH UH HEALTH .
RIGHT .
AND UH I GUESS MY THIRD CONSIDERATION WOULD BE UH .
WARM .
ENVIRONMENT WARM PERSONAL ENVIRONMENT .
WELL RIGHT .
UH IN TEXAS WE HAVE TO MEET CERTAIN STATE STANDARDS IN ORDER TO OPERATE ON A AT AN INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL AND AT A LIKE A SMALL HOME LEVEL SO YOU MEET THE STANDARDS BUT THEN AFTER THAT THERE S THERE S A LOT MORE .
I THINK IT S IMPORTANT AS THE SAFETY AND HEALTH AND THAT KIND OF STUFF IS QUALIFICATION OF PEOPLE .
WHO WORK THERE AND IN HIRING PEOPLE .
WHO WOULD WORK AT THE UH DAY CARE THE CHILD CARE FACILITY WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND QUALIFIED PEOPLE UH IN TERMS OF NOT JUST JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY HAS A CHILD OR UH LIKES CHILDREN DOES NT REALLY MEAN THAT THEY RE QUALIFIED TO GIVE THE CHILD .
THE KIND OF SUPERVISION AND TRAINING THAT .
OH ABSOLUTELY .
THAT UH .
AS A MATTER OF FACT I BELIEVE THAT THE SAFETY AND AND HEALTH UH ISSUES UH DEPEND IN A VERY DIRECT WAY ON THE PEOPLE .
WHO ARE WORKING WITH THE CHILDREN .
EXACTLY .
AND THAT WAS THE MOST DIFFICULT THING OF ALL TO FIND THE THE RIGHT PEOPLE THE QUALIFIED PEOPLE .
AND IT S THE MOST DIFFICULT OF ALL FOR A PARENT JUDGE UH .
OH .
BECAUSE A PERSON CAN BE VERY NICE AND WARM AND LOVING BUT IF HE S A SPACE CADET AND DOES NT WATCH THE CHILDREN AND BE AWARE OF WHAT .
THE SAFETY HAZARDS ARE .
OH EXACTLY .
AND THE OTHER THING .
THAT S DIFFICULT IN UH IT S A TOO SMALL SETTING LIKE A DAY CARE CENTER IS TO FIND THE RIGHT PROGRAM OF ENRICHMENT FOR THE CHILD BECAUSE YOU DO NT WANT TO JUST WAREHOUSE THE CHILD AND I DID NT WANT TO RUN AN INSTITUTION WHERE THAT WAS THE CASE WHERE ALL .
WE WERE DOING WERE WAREHOUSING BECAUSE THE FIRST FOUR FIVE YEARS OR SO IMPORTANT AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE RIGHT KIND OF ENRICHMENT AND THAT THAT INCLUDES UH AN ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH .
THE CHILD IS SAFE AND AND HE S WATCHED AND HIS PHYSICAL NEEDS ARE CARED FOR BUT ALSO HIS UH DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS ARE CARED FOR TOO .
MAYBE THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS TO UH WHEN A COUPLE HAS A CHILD THEN THEY SHOULD BOTH TAKE YOU SAY THE FIRST FOUR OR FIVE YEARS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT AND I THINK I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT THEY .
BOTH TAKE FOUR OR FIVE YEARS OFF AND DEVOTE TO PARENTING .
THAT WOULD BE LOVELY .
GET RID OF ALL THESE CHILD CARE CENTERS AT LEAST FOR YOUNG KIDS BELOW THE AGE OF SIX .
UHHUH .
AND THEN UH AND THEN OF COURSE TO MAKE UP FOR THAT UH THE UH PARENTS WOULD HAVE TO WORK IN THEIR LATER YEARS LONGER YOU KNOW IN OTHER WORDS THEY PROBABLY WOULD NOT WORK MAY NOT EN MAY END UP NOT WORKING AT ALL D IN THE TWENTIES .
UH .
WELL THAT S AN INTERESTING THOUGHT BECAUSE .
BUT THEN THEY HAVE TO WORK FROM AGE THIRTY OR OR FORTY TO AGE SEVENTY OR EIGHTY OR NINETY .
THAT WOULD BE OKAY .
THAT WOULD THAT WOULD HELP ON THE OTHER END TOO IN IN TERMS OF NOT WAREHOUSING PEOPLE AND LETTING PEOPLE BE PRODUCTIVE FOR AS LONG AS THEY CAN BE .
RIGHT WELL YOU KNOW THE UH UH THE WORLD IS CHANGING F UH FROM INSTIT FROM UH INDUSTRIAL UH BASE TO UH INFORMATION BASE AND SO .
UHHUH .
WHAT .
THAT MEANS IS YOU DO NT HAVE TO BE PHYSICALLY POWERFUL TO WORK .
THAT S EXACTLY RIGHT .
ALL .
YOU HAVE TO DO IS HAVE A SHARP MIND AND I BELIEVE THAT UH MENTAL ACUITY IS EASY TO SUSTAIN MAINTAIN IF YOU JUST SIMPLY CONTINUE TO EXERCISE YOUR MIND .
OH .
SO I THINK A PERSON COULD WORK UH INTO THE SEVENTIES EIGHTIES EVEN NINETIES FOR THAT MATTER IF THEY DID NT HAVE TO DO A LOT OF PHYSICAL UH LABOR THEY COULD MAIN MAINTAIN UH .
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT GUN CONTROL .
WELL UH I MEAN I DO NT THINK THAT GUNS SHOULD BE OUTLAWED .
UM .
BUT IT S GOING TO A LOT OF THE STUFF THAT I MEAN ALL .
YOU DO IS TO GET GUNS .
UHHUH .
AND THEN LIKE WITH THE STUFF OF THAT MASSACRE IN KILLEEN TEXAS NOT TOO LONG AGO .
UHHUH .
BUT I DO NT REALLY KNOW I MEAN UNLESS THEY DO UH JUST OUTLAW THEM HOW YOU CAN UH PREVENT THAT .
WELL DO NT YOU THINK THAT YOU KNOW JUST HAVING YOU KNOW SOME YOU KNOW ALMOST LIKE A DRIVER S LICENSE BE REQUIRED YOU KNOW WITH STIFF PENALTIES IF YOU ARE FOUND WITH WITH YOU KNOW A GUN .
THAT IS NOT REGISTERED OR YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE NOT LICENSED TO CARRY .
I MEAN .
YEAH THAT WELL DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT .
THE PROCEDURES ARE NOW .
IT VARIES FROM STATE TO STATE .
UM .
THERE IS NO NATIONAL .
BUT IT S KIND OF LIKE IF YOU WANT A GUN .
YOU CAN GET A GUN ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY FOR IT .
UH IN MOST STATES AS LONG AS YOU ARE NT A CONVICTED FELON .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW OR ON PROBATION OR UH YOU KNOW OTHER OBVIOUS THINGS LIKE THAT .
UH AND I KNOW I KNOW THAT LIKE IN A LOT OF STATES YOU COULD YOU COULD BE JUST LIKE RELEASED FROM A MENTAL HOSPITAL .
THE DAY BEFORE .
YOU KNOW BE BE OBVIOUSLY INSANE AND THEN YOU YOU KNOW BUT HAVE YOUR LEGAL RIGHT TO GET A GUN .
HUH .
I DID NT KNOW THAT .
WELL THAT S PRETTY SCARY .
SO DOES NOW DO THEY WANT US TO SAY WHERE WE FEEL ABOUT IT LIKE IN RATING IT .
ONE TO TEN .
UH YEAH I D PROBABLY I D PROBABLY SAY ABOUT A FIVE .
THAT S WHERE I WOULD PROBABLY BE .
SEEMS LIKE IT S A GOOD SAFE NUMBER TO PICK YOU KNOW .
WELL I MEAN I MEAN I DO NT REALLY KNOW WHAT .
THEY CAN HOW THEY CAN REALLY ENFORCE THE LAWS ANY BETTER .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE I MEAN I DO THINK THAT SOME PEOPLE NEED THEM AND LIKE FOR PROTECTION AND STUFF .
UHHUH .
AND I CAN UNDERSTAND THEM WANTING TO HAVE THEM BUT THEN AGAIN IT S JUST LIKE ALL THOSE NUTS OUT THERE .
WELL YOU KNOW UH UH NO IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT LIKE YOU KNOW COUNTRY THAT UH WHERE THEY DO HAVE A LOT MORE GUN CONTROL LIKE ENGLAND AND PLACES LIKE THAT YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT OF VIOLENT CRIME HAS DECREASED BY SO MUCH .
IT HAS .
BECAUSE THEN .
WELL I MEAN YEAH .
THE UH THE IN COMPARING PER CAPITA MURDERS ARE INCREDIBLY LOWER THAN THE UNITED STATES .
UM .
UH YOU KNOW I MEAN THE PROBLEM THOUGH YOU KNOW THEY IF THE SINCE THE UNITED STATES HAD THIS YOU KNOW PRETTY MUCH UNRESTRICTED FLOW OF GUNS GOING FOR SO LONG THAT I THINK YOU KNOW IF YOU WERE INTRODUCED YOU KNOW ANY CONTROLS IT WOULD PROBABLY TAKE A LONG WHILE FOR THEM TO TAKE EFFECT JUST BECAUSE THERE IS A GLUT OF GUNS OUT THERE ALREADY .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW SO IT S IT S REALLY KIND OF A COMPLEX PROBLEM .
WELL IS THE CRIME THAT BAD THERE IN ATLANTA .
UH I M NOT REALLY SURE HOW BAD .
IT IS .
I VE I VE NOT REALLY HAD THAT MANY PROBLEMS WITH IT BUT I MEAN APPARENTLY WE WE WERE RANKED PRETTY HIGH UP .
YEAH I KNOW DALLAS IS .
UH .
I MEAN I THINK YOU KNOW IN THE TE I MEAN I THINK WE HAVE BEEN LIKE RANKED IN ONE OF THE TOP THREE FOR MURDERS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS .
I DO NT KNOW IF DALLAS IS IN THE TOP THREE .
UHHUH .
BUT .
DO YOU OWN A GUN .
NO .
I VE THOUGHT ABOUT GETTING ONE .
IF I GET ONE I THINK I WILL PROBABLY YOU KNOW GET SOMETHING .
I PROBABLY WOULD NT GET A HAND GUN .
I WOULD PROBABLY GET LIKE A SHOTGUN .
JUST FOR PROTECTING MYSELF .
YOU KNOW FROM .
UHHUH .
BURGLAR TYPE THING .
I DO KIND OF LIVE IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW AND SHOTGUNS ARE REALLY GOOD BECAUSE THEY RE I MEAN SOMEBODY IS NOT GOING TO BREAK IN STEAL IT AND YOU KNOW USE IT TO MUG SOMEONE YOU KNOW .
THAT S TRUE .
UH AND YOU KNOW YOU YEAH I JUST DO NT UNDERSTAND THESE PEOPLE YOU KNOW LIKE WHEN THEY THEY DECIDE THEY RE GOING TO BUY A GUN TO PROTECT THEMSELVES .
THEY GO OUT AND BUY A THREE FIFTY SEVEN MAGNUM .
WHICH IS GOING TO SHOOT THROUGH YOU KNOW THEY ARE PROBABLY GOING TO MISS THE PERSON AND AND THEY RE GOING TO SHOOT THROUGH FIVE WALL .
AND HIT SOMEONE YOU KNOW .
I MEAN A SHOTGUN JUST REALLY STRUCK ME AS BEING YOU KNOW A REAL GOOD DEFENSIVE WEAPON .
YOU CAN SORT OF POINT IT SOMEWHERE IN THE DIRECTION OF .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW WHOEVER .
WELL .
YOU PRETTY MUCH STOP THEM .
AND YOU DO NT THEN THE ACTUAL SHOT DOES NT GO THAT FAR YOU KNOW A WALL WILL STOP IT PRETTY MUCH .
WELL NOW WHEN I FIRST MOVED TO DALLAS I MOVED UP HERE BY MYSELF AND UH MY DAD GAVE ME .
A GUN .
UHHUH .
BUT I NEVER DID GO OUT AND PRACTICE WITH IT ENOUGH TO FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH IT .
UHHUH .
SO I FINALLY ENDED UP GIVING IT BACK TO HIM .
I SAID I DO NT WANT IT .
I DO NT WANT TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT BECAUSE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW IF YOU RE NOT GOING TO TEACH ME HOW TO DO IT .
UHHUH .
AND IF I AM NOT GOING TO YOU KNOW .
BE RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH TO GO OUT AND LEARN I DO NT NEED IT .

UH I PERSONALLY HAD A LITTLE EXPERIENCE .
THE OTHER DAY .
UH SOMEBODY BROKE MY PASSENGER WINDOW AND STOLE A UNIFORM OUT OF MY TRUCK .
OH REALLY .
BUT ACTUALLY YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT AT MINNEAPOLIS AS COMPARED TO WHERE I USED TO LIVE IT S REALLY QUITE A BIT BETTER .

THAT S REALLY A SHAME WHEN IT HAS TO CONSTRAIN YOUR ACTIVITIES LIKE .

WE HAVE A NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH PROGRAM IN THE HOUSE UH THE DEVELOPMENT THAT WE LIVE IN WHICH .
I THINK IS A GREAT WAY TO REDUCE UH HOME THEFT BURGLARY AND THINGS .
SURE .
OF THAT SORT .
DO YOU HAVE THAT WHERE YOU LIVE OR .
WELL UH INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH RIGHT BEFORE I MOVED UP HERE I M AN INTERN AND THEN I GO .
UHHUH .

UH WE VE BEEN BROKEN INTO IN MY APARTMENT ABOUT FOUR TIMES .
OH NO .
IN LIKE TWO AND A HALF WEEKS .
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I I HELPED ORGANIZE WAS A NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH TYPE SITUATION .
UHHUH .
DOWN THERE .
UH BECAUSE THEY WERE JUST IT S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE THE NEW THING IS THAT THEY OPERATE IN THE DAYLIGHT BECAUSE .
UHHUH .
EVERYBODY WENT TO WORK YOU KNOW AND THEN THE HOUSES WERE LEFT UNGUARDED UH BUT YEAH I THINK GIVEN THAT PEOPLE ARE PRETTY CONSCIENTIOUS ABOUT IT THAT S A GOOD WAY TO TO WORK IT WITH A NEIGHBORHOOD .
YEAH .
WATCH .
WELL YOU KNOW UH ALSO I VE HEARD THAT UH THE NEWEST THING IS A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SPECIALIZING IN ROBBING PEOPLE DURING THE TIME .
THEY RE HOME .
OH IS THAT RIGHT .
LIKE ON THE WEEKENDS .
A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF UH FREE TIME I THINK IT .
S LIKE FIFTY PERCENT OF MOST PEOPLE S FREE TIME IS UH SPENT DOING YARD WORK .
OH .
OUTDOORS .
SO THEY WAIT WHILE YOU RE OUT OUTDOORS .
THEY KNOW THE HOUSE IS UNLOCKED AND THEN THEY JUST SLIP IN .
THAT S AMAZING .
SLIP IN SLIP OUT YOU KNOW .
THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT .
THEY RE GOING FOR .
YEAH .
SO I VE HEARD THAT S REALLY ON THE RISE AS FAR AS .
UH .
UH YOU KNOW A NEW TYPE OF CRIME .
YEAH IT ALMOST SEEMS LIKE THEY RE GETTING QUITE A BIT SMARTER .
YEAH .
REALLY YOU KNOW .
UNFORTUNATELY YES .
YEAH UNFORTUNATELY IT S STARTING TO REALLY YOU KNOW LOOK AT PEOPLE S HABITS AND .
UHHUH .
WHERE THEY ARE AT PARTICULAR POINTS OF THE DAY .
YEAH .
LIKE ONE OF THE GUYS I WORK WITH REALLY LAUGHS WHEN HE LOOKS AT MINNEAPOLIS BECAUSE HE S FROM DETROIT .
UHHUH .
AND UH THE THE CRIME LEVEL THERE OF COURSE IS QUITE A BIT QUITE A BIT UH MORE PRONOUNCED UH .
UHHUH .
BUT UH YEAH .
I GUESS .
I MEAN .
I THINK WE VE GOT A NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH PROGRAM HERE IN MINNEAPOLIS I M NOT REAL SURE .
UH .
YEAH IT HELPS TO KNOW YOUR NEIGHBORS YOU KNOW .
THEY GIVE YOU YOU RE SUPPOSED TO MAKE LISTS OF UH CARS .
LIKE I KNOW A LOT OF MY NEIGHBORS RIGHT AROUND MY DEVELOPMENT .
IF I SEE A CAR .
THAT S UNFAMILIAR WE WE HAVE A LIST IS THAT WHAT .
YOU YOU DID IN YOUR PROGRAM .
WHERE YOU HAVE A LIST OF LICENSE PLATES .
PRETTY MUCH .
YEAH .
YEAH .
I WAS I WAS BASICALLY INVOLVED IN THAT IN THE ORGANIZATION OF IT .
UHHUH .
AND THEN I LEFT RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT .
I M NOT SURE .
OH UHHUH .
WHERE WE WENT FROM THERE BUT .
YEAH .
WELL .
YEAH THAT THAT WHOLE THING OF BEING ALERT AND KIND OF NOTICING YOUR SURROUNDINGS NOTICING PEOPLE .
WHO LOOK SUSPICIOUS .
UHHUH .
UH ACTIVITIES LIKE THAT SURE .
I MEAN YOU YOU HATE TO BE PARANOID BUT THERE ARE REALLY ONLY SO MANY THINGS YOU CAN DO .
YOU CAN HAVE THE HOUSE ALARM UH .
YEAH .
NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH PROGRAM YOU KNOW UH AS A WOMAN NOT GO OUT AT NIGHT .
YEAH .
UH YOU CAN DO THAT WHICH IS WHAT .
I CHOOSE TO DO .
YEAH .
ONE OF THE FRUSTRATING THINGS ABOUT THAT IS THAT YOU REALLY ARE LIMITED .
YEAH .
EVEN EVEN IF YOU KNOW THAT THE THREAT IS THERE .
UHHUH .
IT S AGAINST THE LAW TO SET TRAPS IT S AGAINST THE LAW TO DO A LOT OF THINGS YOU KNOW .
THEY COULD BASICALLY UH WHEN I WAS GETTING ROBBED DOWN IN FLORIDA I WAS REALLY CONSIDERING ELECTRIFYING DOORS .
UHHUH .
THAT S .
UM THINGS LIKE THAT LIKE .
UHHUH .
THEY DID IN MIAMI .
THAT TIME .
BUT IT S NOT UH IF YOU KILL SOMEONE IN YOUR HOME AS LONG AS THEY ARE IN YOUR HOME IT S CONSIDERED SELFDEFENSE THOUGH .
THAT S NOT ALWAYS TRUE .
IT IS NT .
NO .
THERE WAS A THERE WAS A CASE ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO .
UHHUH .
WHERE A GUY KNEW HE WAS GOING TO GET ROBBED AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT .
HE HAD DONE IS SET A A ELEC A ELECTROCUTION TRAP .
UHHUH .
FOR THE BURGLAR IN HIS OWN HOME .
HUH .
THE GUY CAME IN WHILE HE WAS HOME AND SURE ENOUGH HE FELL INTO THE TRAP AND WAS SEVERELY BURNED .
HE DID NT DIE BUT HE WAS SEVERELY BURNED AND HE TOOK THE GUY TO COURT AND WON A SETTLEMENT .
REALLY .
YEAH .
SO THAT REALLY THAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
IT .
S LIKE YOUR HANDS ARE RE VERY MUCH TIED .
YEAH .
WELL I THINK IF IF YOU HAD HA A HANDGUN THOUGH IN OTHER WORDS .
IT .
WAS NT PREMEDITATED YOU HAD A HANDGUN IT S THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT SOMEONE S DOWN .
OKAY UH LET ME SEE I VE BEEN SITTING HERE AWHILE I ALMOST FORGOT THE TOPIC BUT UH IT SEEMS LIKE I GET MOST OF MY NEWS FROM TELEVISION I M WE ONLY GET THE PAPER ON THE WEEKENDS AND SO I M NOT MUCH OF A OF A PAPER READER OR BUT I I AND I M DO NT RARELY LISTEN TO THE UH RADIO SO I GET MOST OF MY NEWS LIKE FROM DOCUMENTARIES LIKE FORTYEIGHT HOURS TWENTY TWENTY YOU KNOW THE NEWS AT NIGHT .
UHHUH .
NEWS IN THE AFTERNOON THAT KIND OF THING .
UHHUH WELL I GET A .
WEEKEND PAPER AS WELL AND UH IN ADDITION TO THAT I GET A LOCAL WEEKLY I I LIVE IN SUBURB OF MILWAUKEE .
UHHUH .
AND THEY GET THEY HAVE COMMUNITY NEWSPAPERS AROUND HERE SO THE LOCAL THEIR EXTREMELY LOCAL STUFF .
UHHUH .
UH IS IN THE LOCAL PAPER THAT COMES OUT ONCE A WEEK AND THEN I GET THE SUNDAY UH MILWAUKEE JOURNAL BECAUSE I DO NT HAVE TIME TO READ A PAPER UH MOSTLY .
RIGHT .
THAT S MY DIFFICULTY I UH I GET MY NEWS PRETTY MUCH FROM THE SAME SOURCES AS YOU DO ALTHOUGH I DO LISTEN TO N P R WHICH HAS VERY GOOD AND THAT S NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO WHICH .
UHHUH .
HAS VERY GOOD UH COVERAGE OF THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL NEWS I FEEL .
UHHUH .
AND DOES A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF ANALYSIS AS WELL .
ARE YOU IN THE CAR QUITE A BIT OR .
NO I M NOT ACTUALLY UH BUT I CAN RUN MY RADIO IN MY OFFICE I I .
OH .
TEACH AT THE UNIVERSITY AND WHEN I M NOT .
OH .
TEACHING IF I CHOOSE TO HAVE THE RADIO ON I CAN LISTEN TO THAT STATION SO .
UHHUH OH I SEE UH .
HOW ARE YOU ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY AND FORTYEIGHT HOURS AND THE THINGS THAT YOU DO WATCH .
YEAH I I I PRETTY MUCH AM AND I WATCH THE NEWS AT LEAST TWICE A DAY .
UHHUH .
SO UH IF I VE MISSED SOMETHING AND AND I VE JUST RECENTLY DECIDED TO STAY HOME WITH MY CHILDREN AND SO IT SEEMS AS IF I CATCH THE NEWS RIS RIGHT AS IT HAPPENS YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
THERE WAS THE EXPLOSIONS AND THAT KIND OF THING MY HUSBAND WILL SAY HOW DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT YES IT HAPPENED AT SUCH AND SUCH TIME AND THAT S SO THAT THAT S DIFFERENT FOR ME SO I USUALLY FIND OUT EXACTLY WHEN IT HAPPENS AND THAT KIND OF THING .
IS THAT THE ASPECT OF THE NEWS THAT YOU RE MOST INTERESTED IN IS IS THE TIMELY YO NOTING OF THE EVENTS AS THEY HAPPEN IS THAT WHAT YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT IN THE NEWS COVERAGE .
UH NO IT JUST SEEMS LIKE SINCE I VE RECENTLY STAYED HOME THAT IS WHAT S HAPPENED YOU KNOW IT S JUST THAT UH NOW THAT I VE STAYED HOME I M I M USUALLY AWARE OF WHEN THESE THINGS OCCURRED .
UHHUH .
AND IT HAPPENED AND .
WELL I MYSELF UH TH THE REASON WHY I LISTEN TO N P R AND THE REASON WHY I WATCH MACNEIL LEHRER .
RATHER THAN THE THAN THE NETWORK NEWS SHOWS AT NIGHT ALTHOUGH I DO O WATCH A LOCAL TEN OCLOCK IN THE EVENING NEWS WHICH CARRIES OVER A LOT OF THE NATIONAL NEWS STORIES .
RIGHT RIGHT .
UH IS THAT QUITE OFTEN IT SEEMS TO ME THE NATIONAL DOES NT DO A VERY GOOD JOB OF ANALYSIS .
THE LOCAL DOES NT EITHER BUT I FEEL THAT MACNEIL LEHRER GET A LITTLE MORE DEEPLY INTO SOME SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE REALLY CURRENT .
UHHUH .
AND PERHAPS NEWSPAPERS DO THAT BUT AS I SAID I DO NT HAVE TIME TO SIT DOWN AND READ A NEWSPAPER AND FRANKLY WHEN I HAVE READ A NEWSPAPER .
UHHUH .
I HAVE NT NOTICED THAT KIND OF ANALYSIS EITHER .
HUH .
SO UH THERE S THERE IS SOME DANGER TO THAT OF COURSE TOO BECAUSE IF THE ANALYSIS IS INACCURATE OR BIASED OR WHATEVER THEN YOU KNOW HOW GOOD IS IT BUT UH I LIKE A LITTLE MORE INDEPTH COVERAGE AND I THINK THAT S WHAT YOU RE MAYBE APPEALING TO YOU TOO ON SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY TWENTY OR .
RIGHT .
FORTYEIGHT HOURS .
RIGHT IT KIND OF GIVES YOU THE WHOLE STORY OR MORE OF THE STORY .
UHHUH .
THAT KIND OF THING .
YEAH .
SO UH .
I M MORE INTERESTED IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT S GOING ON IN THE WORLD .
YEAH .
RATHER THAN SIMPLY BEING AWARE THAT YOU KNOW THERE THAT AN EVENT HAS OCCURRED .
YEAH .
I I LIKE TO STAND BACK AND GET A SLIGHTLY BIGGER PICTURE MAYBE BECAUSE I M EASILY CONFUSED BY DETAIL I DO NT KNOW .
UHHUH YEAH I KNOW WHAT YOU RE SAYING YEAH .
SO .
BUT I TRY AND CATCH MOST OF THOSE PROGRAMS ON WEDNESDAY S AND FRIDAY S AND IF I MISS THEM I TRY YOU KNOW I TRY AND AND TAPE THEM IF I M OUT MUMBLEX THAT KIND OF THING I TRY AND TAPE THEM AND SO I CAN SIT BACK AND WATCH THEM AND IT S PRETTY INTERESTING .
WHEN YOU HAVE YOUNG CHILDREN RIGHT .
UHHUH .
SO THOSE EVENING SHOWS ARE PROBABLY ALSO AT A TIME WHEN YOU RE AT LIBERTY TO TAKE SOME TIME OFF AND BE IN FRONT OF THE T V SET FOR AWHILE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION .
WELL YEAH PLUS I FIND THAT I HAVE TO VIDEO TAPE QUITE A BIT OF THINGS .
OH YOU DO UHHUH .
IF I DO NT WANT ANY INTERRUPTIONS YOU KNOW .

WOW .
HOW LUCKY .
I I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND HERE SOMETIMES HAVE LIKE MOTHERS OR GRANDMOTHERS .

WHO BABYSIT IN THEIR HOMES THAT YOU KNOW YOU EITHER KNOW THEM OR KNOW SOMEBODY .

UHHUH .
WELL WHEN YOU HAVE KIDS WILL YOU WORK .

ALL THE TIME .
UHHUH .
IS THAT WHAT .
YOU DO .
UH YEAH .
ACTUALLY I TEACH MY KIDS AT HOME SO I M HERE ALL THE TIME .
OH SO THEY DO NT GO TO SCHOOL .
IS IT LIKE UH OH WHAT S THAT CALLED IT S UH CORRESPONDENCE SCHOOL THEY DO IT .
UHHUH .
AT HOME .
YEAH YEAH .
THAT S INTERESTING .
SO .
DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE ANY SPECIAL TRAINING .
NOT IT DEPENDS ON THE STATE .
YOU LIVE ACTUALLY .
SOME LAWS ABSOLUTELY PROHIBIT IT .
SOME STATES UH SAY THAT YOU HAVE TO BE A CERTIFIED TEACHER IN ORDER TO DO THAT .
OUR STATE DOES NT YET SAY THAT AND I M NOT A CERTIFIED TEACHER .
I WENT TO COLLEGE BUT I YOU KNOW BUT MY KIDS ARE ONLY ELEMENTARY GRADES LEVELS RIGHT NOW AND SO .
SO THEY HAVE NT BEEN TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS AT ALL .
ONE OF THEM WAS FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS AND SO YOU KNOW MY OLDEST HE WAS AND THEN MY YOUNGEST TWO HAVE NEVER BEEN .
UM .
SO ANYWAY BUT WE DO NT .
SO YOU VE NEVER HAD .
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT .
WELL I M KIND OF IN FAVOR OF IT FOR CERTAIN CRIMES .
YEAH .
WHICH CRIMES DO YOU FEEL THAT .
WELL I THINK FIRST DEGREE MURDER UH PROBABLY WARRANTS IT .
YEAH .
BECAUSE OF SO MANY TIMES .
IT S SO BRUTAL AND JUST RECURRENT .
RIGHT .
SELLING I THINK SHOULD ALSO .
EXACTLY .
RECURRENT CRIMES LIKE SERIAL RAPISTS OR SERIAL MURDERERS OR .
YEAH .
WHATEVER .
I COME FROM A STATE .
THAT HAS WELL I ORIGINALLY COME FROM THE STATE .
THAT HAS UH THE DEATH PENALTY .
I COME FROM FLORIDA .
UHHUH .
AND UH THEY RE PRETTY LIBERAL ON IT .
THEY TEND TO LIKE FRY PEOPLE LEFT AND RIGHT .
YEAH THAT S .
WHICH GO AHEAD .
GO AHEAD .
TEXAS IS TOO .
TEXAS I SAW ON T V .
THE OTHER NIGHT IS THE HAS HAD FORTYSIX IN LIKE THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS .
YEAH .
SO THEY RE PRETTY HIP ON IT TOO I GUESS .
THEY DO IT BY LETHAL INJECTION AT HUNTSVILLE .
YEAH OKAY .
I THINK FLORIDA STILL USES ELECTRIC CHAIR .
YEAH .
UH I DO NT I DO NT KNOW .
IN SOME WAYS I DO NT LIKE IT BECAUSE IT S LIKE THEY RE PLAYING GOD .
YEAH .
AND THAT S NOT I DO NT THINK THAT S RIGHT .
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THERE S A LOT OF ADVANTAGES TO IT .
YEAH .
I THINK CRIME RATES DETERRED A LITTLE BIT BY USING IT AND OF COURSE YOU HAVE SOME SAVINGS IN TERMS OF TAXPAYER MONEY KEEPING PEOPLE IN JAIL OR NOT .
UM .
YEAH .
WITH FLORIDA .
THAT S A BIG PROBLEM BECAUSE THERE S SO MANY PEOPLE IN JAIL THAT THEY HAVE TO LET THEM OUT EVERY YEAR .
THEY .
YEAH .
THAT S WHAT S HAPPENING HERE .
THERE IS LIKE UH THAT S IN FACT A BIG GUBERNATORIAL ISSUE IS THE .
UHHUH .
THE TURNOVER RATES OF UH R UH REPEAT OFFENDERS BEING LET OUT AND DOING IT AGAIN .
SURE .
AND IT S LIKE YOU KNOW THAT S A BIG PROBLEM BUT THERE S NOT A WHOLE LOT .
YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT BECAUSE THERE S ONLY SO MANY JAILS YOU CAN BUILD .
UHHUH .
AND IT S REALLY YOU KNOW IT S IT GETS TO BE A R A BIG PROBLEM .
YEAH .
UH GO AHEAD .
I WISH IF THEY WERE GOING TO DO IT THEY WOULD BE A LITTLE MORE CONSISTENT IN DEALING WITH WHO GETS LETHAL INJECTION AND WHO DOES NT .
RIGHT .
BE A LITTLE MORE YOU KNOW NOT BEING ABLE TO PUT IT OFF FOR FIFTEEN YEARS .
UHHUH .
YEAH .
BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE GUYS YOU KNOW THEY GET IN AND THEY THEY GET OFF FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR AND I DO NT KNOW UP IN MINNESOTA WHERE I AM NOW THEY DO NT HAVE THE DEATH PENALTY .
AND YOU CAN ALMOST SENSE THAT PEOPLE ARE JUST LAUGHING AT THE SYSTEM YOU KNOW .
BECAUSE THEY FIGURE WELL YOU KNOW SURE I I GET THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS FOR MAYBE RAPE OR SOMETHING .
UH BUT THEN FOR IF I IF I ELICIT GOOD BEHAVIOR .
I M OUT IN MAYBE FIVE OR TEN .
OH REALLY .
OH SURE YOU KNOW .
GOODNESS .
I MEAN JUST BECAUSE LIKE WE SAID BEFORE THEY DO NT HAVE ENOUGH ROOM IN THE JAILS .
UHHUH .
UH YOU KNOW THERE S A LOT OF INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO BE LET OUT EARLY .
YEAH .
BUT IF YOU VE GOT THE DEATH PENALTY HANGING OVER YOUR HEAD UH I DO NT KNOW I THINK THAT MAY SOLVE A LOT OF THAT .
YEAH .
MAYBE NOT SOLVE IT BUT I DO NT KNOW MAYBE MUMBLEX .
I YEAH I TEND TO THINK THE REPEAL SYSTEM FOR THE DEATH PENALTY IS A LITTLE LITTLE TOO LENIENT .
YEAH .
UH KIND OF TAKES AWAY FROM THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DEATH PENALTY .
UHHUH .
WHAT DO YOU DO GEORGEANNE .
I M A GRADUATE STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS IN DALLAS .
OH OKAY .
GREAT .
WHAT PROGRAM .

I CA NT I YOU KNOW I CA NT GIVE YOU FIGURES BUT UH .
YEAH .
I JUST THIS WAS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE GUY .

THEY GAVE A RUN DOWN THAT TEXAS .
OKAY .
TEXAS TENDS TO BE A LITTLE MORE ROBUST AND DISCIPLINED AREA THEN .
YEAH I I .
KIND OF YEAH I VE HEARD THINGS ABOUT THAT .
I VE HEARD THAT THEY DO NT MESS AROUND VERY MUCH .
YEAH .
MUMBLEX .
UH THEY THEY DO NT GET REPEALED AS EASILY AS THEY DO .
UHHUH .
LIKE THE GUY IN CALIFORNIA GOT THIR YOU KNOW TWICE BEFORE HE WENT TO THE GAS CHAMBER AND THEN THEY SAID OKAY NO YOU DO NT HAVE TO GO .
AND THEN THEY TOOK HIM BACK .
I MEAN IT JUST SEEMS .
JEEZ THAT S A LOT OF REPEALS .
YEAH IT JUST SEEMED A LITTLE INCONSISTENT .
AND THEN YOU HAVE LIKE TWO YOU HAVE THESE PEOPLE .
WHO ARE SERIAL KILLERS .
THAT DID NT EVEN GET THE DEATH SENTENCE BACK WHEN .
UHHUH .

A LIFE SENTENCE .
NO I DO NT I DO NT THINK UH THE MILITARY DOES NT EXECUTE ANYMORE SO .

UHHUH .

I REALLY APPRECIATED THE THE WHOLE UH ENGLISH CLASS WHERE THE UH THE UH FELLOW JUST WOULD NT DO IT YOU KNOW THE GUY S GOUGING GOUGING YOUR EYES OUT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW WHAT FOR HIM TO FINISH ME OFF .
AND UH IT IT WAS UH GOOD TO REMEMBER THE UH THAT THAT KIND OF ASIAN PHILOSOPHY .
UHHUH .
WELL WERE .
THAT UH .
YOU EVER IN VIET NAM OR .
NO NO I WAS KIND OF AN INBETWEEN UH FINALLY DREW A HIGH DRAFT NUMBER AND YOU .
UM I WAS MUCH TOO YOUNG I WAS BORN IN SIXTYSEVEN SO .
OH .
UM YOU KNOW BOTH MY WELL BOTH MY BROTHERS WERE UM DRAFT AGE BUT NEITHER OF THEM WOUND UP GOING OVER WHICH I THINK THEY WERE VERY HAPPY FOR .
WELL I PERSONALLY UH YOU KNOW UH I JUST WENT IN LIMBO .
I HAD A PASSPORT AND WAS READY TO GO .
UHHUH .
OR UM OUT OF THE COUNTRY OR .
YEAH .
JOIN SPECIAL FORCES EITHER ONE .
UHHUH .
I MEAN I JUST DID NT KNOW .
SO UH .
WELL UM SO WELL DO YOU DO YOU FEEL THAT IT WAS WORTH WHAT .
WE DID OVER THERE .
UM YEAH JUST A SECOND .
OKAY .
OKAY .
SURE NOW .
WELL MARK UM WHAT WAS THAT AGAIN .
UM DO YOU THINK I MEAN DO YOU THINK OUR INVEST THE INVESTMENT IN LIVES AND MONEY WAS WORTH IT .
NO NOT NOT REALLY .
I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THAT .
UM .
UM .
WHAT WHAT EFFECTS DO YOU THINK IT S HAD ON OUR COUNTRY .
DOWNSIDE .
UM UH WELL THE MUMBLEX SAYS WE SHOULD UH GO INTO THE GRIEF THAT THAT S THERE AND YOU KNOW MUMBLEX PRESIDENTS HAVE ALWAYS AVOIDED THAT .
UHHUH .
AS A COUNTRY .
SO IT S PRETTY SERIOUS REALLY YOU KNOW LOT OF THINGS .
THAT ARE NT BEING ADDRESSED .
UHHUH .
I THINK MUMBLEX .
YOU KNOW THAT S PRETTY TYPICAL THAT OF THE ENTIRE ENTIRE INVOLVEMENT OVER THAT YOU KNOW THAT NOTHING WAS REALLY ADDRESSED IT .
WAS IT .
WAS NT YOU KNOW IT WAS NEVER WE WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE WERE GOING TO WAR IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL AND SUBTLE YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
THI UM YOU KNOW INCREASEMENT OF OF FORCE .
THAT .
GULF OF TONKIN UH RESOLUTION AND WAS IT .
A DOLPHIN OR A TORPEDO .
YOU REMEMBER THAT .
I VAGUELY REMEMBER WE UM WE HAD A WE HAD A UM SPY SHIP TORPEDOED OR SOMETHING .
YEAH YEAH ONLY ONLY IT WAS FOGGY AND FINALLY PRESIDENT JOHNSON SAID WELL THEY RE WERE NT REALLY SURE WHETHER IT WAS A DOLPHIN OR A TORPEDO .
OH .
IS NT THAT .
SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
UM SO UM DO DO DO YOU THINK THAT LIKE UH UM FOR EXAMPLE LIKE IN IN THIS PAST WAR IN THE PERSIAN GULF WAR .
UHHUH .
THAT UH THAT YOU SEE IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THAT BUSH WAS GOING GOING TO EXTRAORDINARY LENGTHS TO UM YOU KNOW PREPARE THE COUNTRY FOR WAR .
HEY MARK .
YEAH .
I VE GOT TO GO UM .
OKAY .
WE LL SEE YOU .
I GUESS OUR FIVE MINUTES ARE UP ACCORDING TO ME .
ARE THEY TO YOU .
UH I WAS NT REALLY KEEPING COUNT .
BUT I GUESS GOODBYE .
YEAH OKAY BYEBYE .
BYE .
OKAY LOOKS LIKE WE RE READY TO GO .
CAPITAL PUNISHMENT UH THE PROBLEM .
I HAVE WITH CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS THAT UH UH IT S SUPPOSED TO BE A DETERRENT TO CRIME BUT I DO NT THINK THAT IT REALLY ACTUALLY DOES THAT .
I DO NT THINK IT DETERS ANYBODY BECAUSE MOST OF THE TIME CRIMES ARE UH ARE COMMITTED WITH A WITHOUT ANY THOUGHT TO THE CONSEQUENCES AND THEY DO NT THINK THAT UH STOP AND THINK AND SAY WELL MAYBE I SHOULD NT DO THIS UH BECAUSE UH I MIGHT GET THE GAS CHAMBER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
THEY WORRY ABOUT IT AFTERWARDS AND THEN THEY TRY AND GET OUT OF IT .
AND UH HOW ABOUT YOU .
WELL I THINK THAT IN SOME CASES IT IS WARRANTED .
UHHUH I DO TOO YEP .
AND I DO NT I THINK IN SOME CASES .
IT DOES NT MATTER IF IT S A DETERRENT OR NOT .
UHHUH YEAH YOU STILL HAVE TO DO IT .
I .
I MEAN .
I .
I MEAN I M THINKING OF AN EXTREME CASE LIKE A SERIAL MURDERER .
UHHUH .
OR .
SO YOU RE IN YOU RE IN FAVOR OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT THEN .
WELL FOR SOME THINGS .
RIGHT .
I THINK FOR SERIAL MURDER .
UHHUH .
IT IS WARRANTED BECAUSE IF A PERSON .
WHO WOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN COLD .
UHHUH .
BLOOD .
NEEDS TO BE PUNISHED OR UH ELIMINATED FROM SOCIETY .
I MEAN .
YOU CA NT GUARANTEE THAT THEY WOULD NT ESCAPE .
RIGHT .
FROM PRISON .
AND THEN DO IT .
ALL OVER AGAIN .
AND DO IT AGAIN .
UHHUH .
AND I DO NT THINK THAT THAT REHABILITATION IS EFFECTIVE .
RIGHT .
HAVE TO AGREE WITH YOU AND I M KIND OF I IN FAVOR OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT ALSO .
I JUST DO NT THINK THAT IT ACTS MUCH AS A DETERRENT TO THESE PEOPLE BECAUSE UH YOU STILL SEE THEM COMMITTING THE SAME CRIMES BUT I TEND TO AGREE WITH YOU THAT UH WE SHOULD HAVE IT .
I JUST I DO NT KNOW THAT IT S ALWAYS EFFECTIVE BUT I GUESS WE UH WE RE KIND OF STUCK WITH IT .
IT S IT S A DIFFICULT UH PROBLEM IS NT IT TO DETERMINE HOW YOU RE GOING TO PUNISH SOMEBODY FOR A PARTICULAR CRIME UH .
BUT THEN YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THAT SOME MURDERERS DO NT REALLY WARRANT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW .
JUST LIKE FOR EXAMPLE UH YOU KNOW YOU HEAR ABOUT CASES WHERE WOMEN HAVE KILLED THEIR HUSBANDS .
UHHUH .
WHO ABUSED THEM .
RIGHT UHHUH .
AND I DO NT THINK .
THAT WOULD REALLY WARRANT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT .
UHHUH HUH .
DO YOU THINK THEY SHOULD BE PUNISHED AT ALL OR UH LIKE GO TO PRISON UH BECAUSE THEY RE NOT REALLY A DANGER TO SOCIETY .
IT WAS ALMOST REALLY SELF DEFENSE IS NT IT IN A CASE LIKE THAT .
UH IT IS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT .
UHHUH .
BUT I THINK I DO NT KNOW BECAUSE .
I KNOW THEY PUT UH PUT THEM IN JAIL SOMETIMES I GUESS .
UH .
I THINK IN S AND IT .
JUST WOULD DEPEND UPON THE CIRCUMSTANCES .
UHHUH .
AND AND THE EXTENT OF THE ABUSE .
UHHUH .
AND AND IF ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE WAS .
UM .
AVAILABLE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW NOW I WONDER WHAT .
YOU THINK ABOUT THIS AND UH UNFORTUNATELY WE WE DO NT GET TO DO IT BUT UH IT USED TO BE A LONG TIME AGO I GUESS IN BIBLICAL TIMES WHEN THEY HAD PUNISHMENT IF SOMEBODY DID SOMETHING FOR EXAMPLE TO YOUR FAMILY THEN YOU HAD THE RIGHT TO ADMINISTER THE PUNISHMENT .
SO IF SOMEBODY KILLED SOMEBODY IN YOUR FAMILY THEN YOU HAD THE RIGHT TO UH IF THAT PERSON WAS CAUGHT AND FOUND GUILTY YOU HAD THE RIGHT TO UH EXECUTE THAT PERSON .
AND I KNOW THAT UH IF SOMEBODY HAD DONE SOMETHING TO MY FAMILY I WOULD FEEL THAT I HAD THE RIGHT TO TO GET REVENGE ON THEM AND UH BUT I I DO NT THINK THAT S DONE MUCH ANYWHERE .
THAT S KIND OF DRASTIC PUNISHMENT .
WELL I THINK THAT WOULD BE KIND OF DRASTIC PUNISHMENT .
RIGHT .
AND .
MIGHT MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER BUT .
BUT ONE THING I THINK THAT IF THERE IS A CHANCE FOR REHABILITATION .
UHHUH .
THEN THAT CHANCE SH SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED .
RIGHT .
BUT LIKE I SAID IF IF SOMEONE IS IS JUST PATHOLOGICALLY .
UHHUH .
GOING TO MURDER PEOPLE .
NO MATTER .
WHAT .
RIGHT .
THEN I THINK THEY SHOULD BE ELIMINATED FROM .
UHHUH .
SOCIETY .
RIGHT BECAUSE THEY RE A DANGER TO EVERYBODY ELSE .
HUH THAT S INTERESTING .
I HAVE TO UH .
BUT .
AGREE WITH THAT .
THERE S A LOT OF FOLKS PROBABLY THAT ARE IN PRISON THAT UH THAT ARE NT REALLY A DANGER TO SOCIETY HUH AND UH .
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE .
THAT ARE A DANGER .
RIGHT .
TO SOCIETY .
THAT ARE NT IN PRISON .
RIGHT PROBABLY MORE OF THEM THEN THE OTHER WAY AROUND .
INTERESTING .
I DO NT I DO NT NOT SURE I I M IN WASHINGTON D C OR AT LEAST VERY CLOSE TO IT .
I M NOT SURE WHAT KIND OF UH CAPITAL PUNISHMENT .
WE HAVE HERE .
WELL I KNOW IN NORTH CAROLINA WE DO HAVE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT .
UHHUH .
AND I M IN I M FROM SOUTH CAROLINA .
OKAY SO WHAT KIND OF LUCK .
YOU BEEN HAVING WITH BUYING AND RETURNING PRODUCTS .
UH NOT TOO BAD REALLY .
UH I HAD A RAZOR THAT I GOT FROM CHRISTMAS THAT I JUST I REALLY DID NT WANT IT BUT I GOT IT ANYWAY AND UH IT WAS A BRAUN AND THEY WERE REAL GOOD ABOUT TAKING IT BACK .
IT .
WAS NT .
A PROBLEM AT ALL SO UH I WAS ABLE TO GET THAT BACK PRETTY EASILY .
UHHUH .
BUT UH I DO NT KNOW I REALLY HAVE NT RETURNED A WHOLE LOT LATELY .
HAVE YOU .
I HAVE NT HAD TO .
IT .
S UH THE EVERY SO OFTEN I MEAN I I I M ALMOST PUSHING IT .
MYSELF .
MAYBE I LL BUY A SHIRT FROM G I JOE S AND IT SHRINKS TOO MUCH AND SAY WELL I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER I MEAN I BOUGHT IT FROM G I JOE S .
UM .
AND IT WAS PROBABLY MADE IN CHINA BY SLAVES .
RIGHT .
BUT UH THEY UH MOST OF THE TIME MUMBLEX .
PRETTY CAREFUL SHOPPING ANYWAY I GET PRETTY GOOD STUFF .
YEAH .
I THINK THAT UH ASIDE FROM THE FACT .
ALL MARKETS BEING INTERNATIONALIZED .
RIGHT LIKE .
AND IF YOU WANT TO BUY AMERICAN IT TAKES REAL EXTRA WORK TO FIND .
EXACTLY .
IT S PROBABLY .
I WAS READING .
A JAPANESE OR A BURMESE COMPANY OWNING AND HIRING PEOPLE IN THE U S .
RIGHT I WAS READING SOMETHING IN UH CONSUMER REPORTS TONIGHT ABOUT THAT AS A MATTER OF FACT .
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT CARS UH THE CAR ISSUE JUST CAME OUT .
UHHUH .
AND ABOUT HOW YEAH YOU D LIKE TO BUY AN AMERICAN CAR MAYBE BUT UH YOU KNOW THE TRANSMISSION MAY BE MADE IN JAPAN OR WHATEVER .
YEAH .
UH LIKE I VE GOT AN EIGHTYSIX FORD RANGER AND AND I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THE TRANSMISSION IS MADE BY MITSUBISHI .
HUH .
YOU KNOW SO IT S LIKE WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO YOU KNOW .
YEAH REALLY .
BUT UH THAT S THE WAY .
IT IS .
I DO NT KNOW I I PERSONALLY FEEL THAT UH UH IF THE JAPANESE CARS ARE BETTER AND AMERICANS BUY THEM YOU KNOW THAT S THE WAY .
IT GOES AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE MAN MORE THAN MANUFACTURERS SHOULD GET A CLUE AND YOU KNOW THEY SHOULD START MAKING QUALITY PRODUCTS .
YEAH I THINK THEY RE BEGINNING TO .
THE THE DAYS OF DO NT BUY A CAR MADE ON A MONDAY OR A FRIDAY ARE PRETTY MUCH GOING AWAY AND .
THAT S WHAT .
I THOUGHT TOO UNTIL I SAW THE CONSUMER REPORTS ISSUE .
UHHUH .
UH THEY VE GOT ALL THE AMERICAN WELL ALL THE ALL THE CARS RATED YOU KNOW AND UH ESSENTIALLY I H I DO NT SEE MUCH OF A TREND .
I MEAN JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER TIME THAT YOU LOOK AT IT THE HONDA ACCORDS AND THE CIVICS ARE RIGHT UP THERE .
THERE S NOTHING WRONG WITH THEM .
UH AND THE SAME THING WITH MOST OF THE OTHER JAPANESE CARS .
BUT THEN AGAIN YOU LOOK AT A FORD OR ESPECIALLY A CHEVY AND THEY RE PIECES OF JUNK .
I KNOW .
STILL AT IT HEY .
YEAH THAT S NINETY THAT S EIGHTYSIX THROUGH NINETYONE .
WOW .
BUT UH I DO NT KNOW MAY MAYBE THEY RE GETTING BETTER MAYBE THEY RE STARTING TO GET A CLUE .
UH .
WELL THEY GOT A THREE YEAR LEAD TIME .
IT PROBABLY WO NT START REALLY SHOWING UP UNTIL NINETYFOUR OR SO .
YEAH THAT S JUST IT .
TECHNOLOGY .
THAT COMES IN RIGHT NOW IS IS PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE IMPLE IMPLEMENTED UNTIL YOU KNOW QUITE A FEW YEARS DOWN THE ROAD .
BUT UH .
THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY S WHERE IT S REALLY DYNAMIC ESPECIALLY FOR THE CONSUMER .
OH YEAH .
YEAH BECAUSE TECHNOLOGY IS SO UH YOU KNOW VOLATILE AND CHANGING ALL THE TIME .
AND CAN YOU .
UH .
THINK OF ANY OTHER INDUSTRY WHERE IN SOFTWARE .
THEY IF THE PRODUCT IS UPGRADED AND A BETTER VERSION IS PUT OUT YOU LL GET A FREE VERSION IN THE MAIL S MUMBLEX .
YEAH .
OR UH MAYBE I SAY WELL YOU KNOW YOU PAID FIVE HUNDRED BUCKS FOR THIS PROGRAM SO SEND US .
TWENTY AND WE LL GIVE YOU .
A REALLY GREAT UPGRADE .
YEAH .
IT UH TH THEY KEEP UP C WITH IT PRETTY QUICKLY AND THAT S THAT S A REAL GOOD THING I GUESS .
YEAH .
UH I DO NT KNOW .
AND THE HARDWARE WELL I MEAN ALL THE CHIPS .
THAT MAKE UP THE HARDWARE ARE A COMMODITY AND THE MACINTOSH IS ABOUT THE ONLY ONE .
THAT S GOING RIGHT .
YEAH .
FORCING I B M AND THE REST OF THE D O S WORLD TO FOLLOW ALONG .
RIGHT THEY RE KIND OF THE LEADERS RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW .
I USED TO SEE ALL THOSE COMMERCIALS FOR WINDOWS YOU KNOW AND YOU RE LIKE .
OH GEE THEY RE RESELLING A MACINTOSH UNDER A DIFFERENT NAME .
REALLY WHY DO NT THEY JUST SAY ALMOST A MAC FOR HALF THE PRICE .
YEAH YOU KNOW .
THEY D SELL MORE IF THEY WERE HONEST .
EXACTLY ALMOST IS THE KEY WORD THERE TOO YOU KNOW BECAUSE I I REALLY I VE USED BOTH AND I REALLY DO NT SEE AN ADVANTAGE OF WINDOWS AT ALL .
YEAH IT .
UH .
IT S ONLY AN ADVANTAGE FOR PEOPLE .
WHO HAD TO USE PURE D O S .
YEAH YEAH THAT S TRUE TOO .
MUMBLEX BASE .
BUT UH I DO NT KNOW I M REALLY I VE GOTTEN A LITTLE BIT OUT OF THE THE PERSONAL COMPUTER BUSINESS JUST BECAUSE I DO NT HAVE ONE AT HOME .
I I DO USE A MAC AT WORK BUT UH .
UHHUH .
UH I REALLY DO NT DO NT DO MUCH WITH IT AT HOME BUT UH .
APPLE S SORT OF MAKING A S AND THEY RE ONES WERE GROWLING CONSUMER UH NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THE MAC .
THEY RE GETTING LIKE IF YOU BOUGHT A POWER BOOK STRAIGHT OFF A LOT OF THEM HAD TO GO BACK .

YEAH I HAVE ONE I DO DESKTOP PUBLISHING AT WORK AND I HAVE A MACHINE AT HOME AND I BELONG TO THE USER S GROUP AND I I VE BEEN A MAC FANATIC SINCE THEY CAME OUT .
YEAH .
ALL RIGHT .
BUT UH TECHNICALLY I M NOT ACTUALLY IN THE INDUSTRY .
I DO NT WORK A COMPUTER COMPANY .
NO .
I M AN ABUSER .
WELL THAT S THAT S ALL RIGHT .
BUT IT S SORT OF LIKE SURFING ON THE WAVE OF FUTURE SHOCK TO .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
YOU KNOW KEEP UP WITH THE CHANGES AS THEY HAPPEN .
SOMETHING THAT I FIND UNCOMFORTABLE IS YOU KNOW YOU YOU WANT TO BUY SOMETHING SAY YOU WANT TO BUY A PERSONAL COMPUTER AND YOU GOT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT KIND OF MEMORY .
YOU WANT TO GET AND WHAT KIND OF TECHNOLOGY THAT YOU WANT TO GO FOR YOU KNOW LET LET S TAKE THE EXAMPLE THE MODEM FOR YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
OKAY W W WHAT BAUD RATE DO YOU GET .
WELL YOU KNOW IT USED TO BE THAT YOU GET A TWELVE HUNDRED BA .
BEFORE THE ONE WILL TAKE UH OKAY LET S SEE I GUESS UH I CAN START .
I M ACTUALLY WE RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO FIND ONE NOW BECAUSE .
ARE YOU REALLY .
OUR FAMILY S GROWING .
YEAH .
UH SO I M LOOKING AT UH SOMETHING LARGER THAN WHAT .
WE HAVE .
WE VE GOT LIKE AN EIGHTYFOUR CHARGER .
THAT S ABOUT GONE AND A UH AN EIGHTYNINE HORIZON .
SO I M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING UH LITTLER .
UHHUH WHICH ARE BOTH KIND OF SMALL .

UHHUH .
AS WELL .
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR AN AMERICAN CAR OR YOU OPEN TO BUYING FOREIGN CARS .
UH I DO NT REALLY HAVE A PREFERENCE EITHER WAY .
I GUESS .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW IT S YOU KNOW IT I GUESS THE AMERICAN CARS HAD A BAD REPUTATION BUT .
UHHUH .
I HAVE NT HAD ANY REAL SUBSTANTIAL PROBLEMS WITH THE .
RIGHT .
ONES I VE HAD .
PERSONALLY I HAVE A JAPANESE CAR RIGHT NOW AND I REALLY LIKE IT .
A LOT .
UH I THINK THE JAPANESE REALLY BUILD GOOD CARS .
UHHUH .
AND I KNOW THAT KIND OF RUBS AGAINST THE GRAIN RIGHT NOW IN THE WHOLE UH YOU KNOW BUY AMERICAN KEEP AMERICAN AUTO WORKERS WORKING RIGHT NOW BUT I FEEL THAT THE JAPANESE HAVE REALLY PRODUCED A MUCH HIGHER QUALITY PRODUCT THAN OUR UH CAR MANUFACTURERS HAVE FOR A WHILE .
YEAH .
IF I WERE TO BUY ANOTHER CAR I WOULD BE UH I WOULD BE PARTIAL TO BUYING ANOTHER JAPANESE CAR BUT I WOULD ALSO LOOK AT AMERICAN CARS BUT WHEN I BOUGHT THE CAR THAT I BOUGHT NOW I DID THAT ALSO AND I JUST FELT THAT THE JAPANESE CAR WAS A MUCH BETTER PRODUCT .
YEAH I MEAN E .
SO IF I WERE .
EVEN IF IT S JUST DETAILS IT SEEMS LIKE UH .
RIGHT .
THEY YOU KNOW I J THERE S A DOOR SEAL THAT S DOES NT QUITE SEAL AND YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT BACK EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE .
IT S CLEARLY JUST A A DESIGN PROBLEM THERE .
RIGHT IT IS .
UH I M KIND OF RIGHT NOW THE NEXT CAR .
I BUY IS GOING TO BE SORT OF A SPORTS CAR .
I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO HAVE A SPORTS CAR .
UH I DO NT REALLY I DO NT HAVE A FAMILY SO I DO NT NEED A A MINI VAN OR SUCH TO UH HAUL PEOPLE AROUND IN .
UHHUH .
SO I M LOOKING FOR MORE A A TWO PASSENGER CAR .
THAT UH .
OH LIKE A MIATA OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
WELL I LIKE THE MIATA BUT I DO NT LIKE IT ENOUGH TO BUY IT .
I WOULD BUY SOMETHING ACTUALLY THE THE CAR THAT I REALLY LIKE RIGHT NOW IS AN EAGLE TALON WHICH IS AN AMERICAN CAR .
UM .
BUT UH SOMETHING ALONG THAT LINES .
INTERESTING .
UH BECAUSE I HAVE A AN ECONOMY CAR RIGHT NOW WHICH IS OKAY BUT .
YEAH .
UH I THINK I I D LIKE TO MOVE ON TO SOMETHING A LITTLE BETTER .
THAT S INTERESTING .
YEAH I GUESS PROBABLY THE FACTORS WE D USE TO COMPARE ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT BECAUSE I LOOK FOR YOU KNOW SIZE AND .
RIGHT .
SAFETY AND THEN MILEAGE .
PROBABLY .
RIGHT .
UH .
THAT S WHEN I BOUGHT THE CAR THAT I BOUGHT I WAS LOOKING FOR MILEAGE AND I WAS LOOKING FOR UH DEPENDABILITY AND SOMETHING .
THAT WAS GOING TO LAST A LONG TIME .
I WAS G THAT I WOULD GET A FOR THE MONEY THAT I WAS GOING TO SPEND THAT I WOULD GET A RETURN .
THAT WAS THAT WAS WORTH THAT MONEY .
YEAH .
SO .
YEAH I C I THINK IN TERMS OF COMPUTER TERMINOLOGY I LOOK AT YOU KNOW PRICE PERFORMANCE AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
RIGHT EXACTLY .
AND THEN A LITTLE BIT AT LIFE EXPECTANCY I GUESS BUT IT YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
DEPENDS ON WHAT .
YOU WHAT .
YOU PAY INITIALLY .
BUT YOU KNOW .
THAT S RIGHT .
I VE GOT A HUNDRED AND TWENTYFIVE THOUSAND MILES ON THE CHARGER .
ACTUALLY .
UHHUH .
IT WAS MY WIFE S CAR THAT SHE BROUGHT INTO THE MARRIAGE AND SHE GOT JUST A COMMUTE BETWEEN CINCINNATI AND DAYTON .
UHHUH .
IT S YOU KNOW WE WE HAD TO REPLACE THE FRICTION PLATE AND THE TRANSMISSION AT THIRTY THOUSAND MILES BUT .
UHHUH .
UH THE OTHER NINETY FOUR THOUSAND HAVE BEEN JUST FINE .
WITH IT SO .
OKAY .
BUT UH .
UH I VE HAD UH I VE HAD ONE OR TWO AMERICAN CARS I THINK AND AND THEY WERE OKAY .
I HAD A PONTIAC ONCE AND AND I NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH IT BUT UH MY MOTHER HAD A DODGE AT ONE POINT AND I I HAD DRIVEN IT .
A FEW TIMES AND I REALLY DID NOT FEEL THAT IT THAT I WOULD BUY A DODGE .
UM .
J JUST FROM WELL ACTUALLY I HAD A UH A DODGE OMNI AT ONE POINT .
UHHUH .
AND THAT WAS I THINK WHAT REALLY PREJUDICED ME AGAINST AMERICAN CARS WAS BECAUSE I DID NOT FEEL THAT IT WAS A VERY QUALITY UH CAR .
YEAH .
SO I GUESS YOU D HAVE TO SAY IF I WAS LOOKING I WOULD DEFINITELY BE LOOKING FOR A FOREIGN CAR .
THAT S INTERESTING .
BUT YEAH IT IT S HARD TO BEAT SOME OF THE UH LIKE I GUESS IN PARTICULAR WE RE LOOKING AT A LIKE A NINETYONE CORSICA UH BUY BACK AT A THEY SAY G M SPONSORED AUCTION BUT I THINK THEY RE OBLIGED TO HAVE THESE THINGS BECAUSE HERTZ AND AVIS AND THOSE FOLKS HAVE IT IN THEIR CONTRACT THAT .
UHHUH .
THEY CAN SELL IT BACK TO G M AFTER YOU KNOW IT S AFTER THEY VE USED IT FOR SIX MONTHS AND PUT .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW TWELVE OR FIFTEEN THOUSAND MILES .
ON IT AND YOU CAN GET THOSE FOR LIKE EIGHT THOUSAND BUCKS IF YOU .
WHICH IS A GOOD DEAL .
YEAH BECAUSE I GUESS UH I MEAN WELL NINETYTWO S GRANTED BUT THE NEW ONES YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
FOURTEEN TO SIXTEEN IS WHAT .
THEY GO FOR .
RIGHT .
ON THE LOT SO ALL THE DEPRECIATION HAS BEEN TAKEN OFF AND S THE DEALER COMES OUT OKAY .
YEAH THAT .
YOU KNOW I DO NT KNOW WHAT KIND OF I DO NT KNOW WHAT .
G M CORPORATE KIND OF HIT .
THE I DO NT KNOW WHAT KIND OF HIT .
THEY TAKE ON IT BUT SOUNDS LIKE EVERYBODY S HAD THEIR CHANCE TO MAKE THEIR MONEY OFF IT AND .
YEAH I M SURE THEY DID .
SO BUT UH I DO NT KNOW WE KEEP LOOKING AT THAT MINI VAN .
IT S JUST YOU KNOW WE CAN GET A LIKE A CARAVAN .
UHHUH .
FOR AT TWELVE FIVE .
RIGHT .
BUT THAT S A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN WE WANT TO SPEND RIGHT NOW .
BUT UH UH IT S INTERESTING BUT UH I DO NT KNOW IF IF UH IT SEEMS TO BE .
UH TAXES DO YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD .
SURE WE PAY FAR TOO MUCH IN TAXES WELL FAR TOO MUCH FOR WHAT WE GET I MEAN .
UHHUH .
IT S JUST .
I AGREE .
I DO NT KNOW IT JU JUST SEEMS TOO MUCH OF THE MONEY IS JUST LOST .
UHHUH WELL I THINK UH YOU KNOW WHEN I LOOK AT UH ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE COMING OUT NOW ABOUT OVER SPENDING AND SPENDING MONEY THAT S NOT THERE AND BUYING THINGS THAT ARE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE WHERE THEY COULD BUY IT AT A AT A BETTER DISCOUNT UH WHEN YOU WHEN .
UM YOU MEAN LIKE THOSE YOU KNOW TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLAR TOILETS .
EXACTLY EXACTLY THAT S EXACTLY UH THE WHOLE THING WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT ALL THOSE ISSUES OF WHERE OUR MONEY IS GOING AND IT S JUST AS LONG AS THE PERSON THAT S SPENDING THE MONEY UH DOES NT THINK ABOUT OH I CAN GO OUT AND SPEND ANYTHING THAT I WANT TO IT S JUST UNLIMITED .
SURE IT S REAL EASY TO SPEND OTHER PEOPLE S MONEY RIGHT .
RIGHT AN UNLIMITED SOURCE SO THEY THEY THINK WELL I LL GO OUT AND BUY A FOUR HUNDRED TOILET SEAT AND I COULD HAVE WENT TO KMART AND BOUGHT IT FOR YOU KNOW TEN OR FIFTEEN I MEAN THAT KIND OF THING AND UH .
RIGHT E I DO NT MIND THEM GETTING WHAT THEY NEED IT S JUST WHEN THEY PAY SO MUCH FOR IT .
EXACTLY .
IT TAKES YOU KNOW VERY LITTLE TO JUST SHOP AROUND AND .
EXACTLY AND I KNOW A LOT OF UH CORPORATIONS NOW ARE LOOKING AT THEIR AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT S BEING SPENT AND THEY RE LOOKING .
THAT S TRUE .
AT WHAT S THE BEST BUY IT USED TO BE YOU COULD GO IF YOU HAD A COMPANY YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH CERTAIN PEOPLE AND YOU DID NT CARE WHAT YOU PAID .
YEP .
I MEAN YOU JUST GOT IT DONE NOW PEOPLE ARE PUTTING IN BIDS FOR THINGS AND ARE LOOKING AT THINGS GOING TO ACTUALLY SHOP AT BEST BUY FOR BEST BUY IS ONE OF OUR ELECTRONIC STORES .
RIGHT .
FOR FAX MACHINES THINGS LIKE THAT INSTEAD OF GOING THROUGH THESE OFFICE SUPPLY COMPANIES THAT MARK UP THEIR AMOUNTS AND SAY YOU KNOW I LL GIVE YOU A LEGAL PAD FOR FIVE BUCKS .
AND YOU CAN GO TO ANOTHER SHOP AND GET IT FOR MAYBE SIXTY CENTS OR NIN OR NINETY CENTS .
YEAH .
THAT KIND OF THING SO .
I M ALSO WONDERING WHY OUR TAXES ARE STILL SO HIGH CONSIDERING LIKE THE WORLD S PROBABLY IN BETTER SHAPE NOW THAN IT HAS BEEN IN THE LAST FIFTY YEARS .
EXCEPT FOR EVERYTHING KEEPS GOING UP YOU KNOW .
AND I KNOW AS A MIDDLE CLASS UH YOU KNOW AND ALSO I HAVE ONE DEPENDENT HAS .
UHHUH .
MY DAUGHTER AND I KEEP LOOKING AT WELL WHERE S THE TAX SOCALLED TAX UH RELIEF .
YEAH I KNOW .
FOR HAVING CHILDREN I MEAN THERE IS NONE I MEAN I THINK I PAID JUST AS MUCH AS WHEN .
OH I KNOW I MEAN I DO NT EVEN .
I DID NT HAVE HER SO .
YOU KNOW I DO NT EVEN GET TO SEE HALF MY PAYCHECK .
UHHUH .
BETWEEN FOUR OH ONE K AND AND THE THIRTYFOUR PERCENT THEY RE TAKING OUT FOR TAXES .
SURE EXACTLY .
LET ALONE WHAT I END UP HAVING TO PAY .
UHHUH EXACTLY YEAH THAT S THE WHOLE THING NOW THEY HAVE GOTTEN THIS WONDERFUL IDEA OF NOT TAKING OUT AS MUCH TAXES .
BUT YOU RE STILL GOING TO OWE THE GOVERNMENT AS MUCH MONEY .
SURE .
SO BY THE END OF THIS COMING YEAR WHAT S GOING TO HAPPEN IS ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO FIND OUT THAT THEY OWE THE GOVERNMENT AND IT CERTAINLY IS NT GOING TO BE IN THEIR SAVINGS UH ACCOUNT .
NOPE THEY WO NT BE ABLE TO PAY .
THEY WO NT BE ABLE TO PAY IT AND THERE LL BE A LOT OF PROBLEMS BECAUSE OF THAT YOU KNOW PUT PEOPLE INTO YOU KNOW JANUARY OR FEBRUARY WHICH IS ALWAYS SUPPOSE TO BE THE MONTH AFTER CHRISTMAS IS SUPPOSED TO BE HIGH SPENDING BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS ON SALE .
NOBODY S GOING TO HAVE THE MONEY TO SPEND .
SURE NONE .
THEY RE GOING TO BE PAYING ON THEIR TAXES SO THEY RE GOING TO HAVE TO JUST CUT BACK SO I DO NT KNOW WHERE THE ANSWER IS AND .
I DO NT IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU KNOW THERE S ALSO LIKE TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION WELL I DO NT FEEL REPRESENTED ANYMORE IN OUR GOVERNMENT I MEAN IT .
YEAH YEAH .
IT S CERTAINLY NOT A GOVERNMENT FOR ME IT DOES NT TAKE CARE OF MY NEEDS .
NO NO WELL THAT S THE WHOLE THING I THINK PEOPLE ARE GETTING SO FED UP WITH IT NOW WE GO THROUGH ANOTHER ELECTION AND LISTEN TO ALL THESE LIES ABOUT THE .
AN AND PEOPLE DO NT CARE ANYMORE EITHER .
NO NO .
PEOPLE DO NT WANT TO GO OUT TO VOTE .
WELL I DO NT THINK PEOPLE THINK THEY CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND WHEN YOU VE GOT CANDIDATES AS YOU DO IT S CANDIDATES THAT HAVE MONEY .
YEP .
AND IT S BACKED BY BIG BUSINESS AND BIG BUSINESS SAYS WELL WE DO NT CARE ABOUT THE LITTLE PERSON AND UH YOU KNOW YOU RE NOT GOING TO GET ANYMORE ABE LINCOLNS .
NO BUT .
AROUND .
BUT THAT THAT S GOING TO BACKFIRE BECAUSE .
UHHUH WELL WHO KNOWS UH YEAH .
LITTLE PEOPLE WHO BUY EVERYTHING SO .
GENERATIONS FROM NOW WE MIGHT UH SET BACK IN OUR LITTLE UH ROCKING CHAIRS AND WATCH OUR GRANDCHILDREN GO THROUGH AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SYSTEM OF THINGS AND SAY YOU KNOW THIS GOVERNMENT ITSELF IS NT WORKING JUST LIKE THE COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT OF UH THE OLD U S S R .
YEAH .
AND MAYBE THAT S GOING TO HAPPEN TO AMERICA WHERE THEY LL SAY HEY WE RE FED UP .
YEAH I WONDER THOUGH .
MAYBE IT LL HAVE TO BE JUST INDIVIDUAL STATE TAX .
AND EACH STATE TAKE CARE OF ITSELF AND NO GOVERNMENT TYPE OF UH YOU KNOW WHERE YOU HAVE TO PAY OUT TO FEDERAL OR WHATEVER I DO NT KNOW WHO KNOWS BUT .
YEAH I M NOT I DO NT KNOW I CA NT THINK OF ANY EASY ANSWERS TO IT BUT SOMETHING HAS TO HAPPEN I MEAN .

REGARDING UH TAXES .
I YOU KNOW TAXES ARE REALLY A NECESSARY EVIL AND IN A CIVILIZED SOCIETY .
BUT REALLY PEOPLE GET UPSET AT TAXES BECAUSE YOU IT S MORE EFFICIENT TO DO THINGS .

AND UH AND SO AS AS A RESULT UH YOU KNOW IT S IT S A TRADEOFF YOU KNOW FOR THE COMMON GOOD YOU KNOW .
FOR FOR THE BENEFIT OF OTHERS YOU KNOW .
HOW MUCH OF YOUR RESOURCE SHOULD YOU DEDICATE TO UH MAKING THINGS WORK FOR OTHERS .
HAVE YOU UH YOU KNOW EVER THOUGHT YOU KNOW JUST HOW MUCH OF THAT MONEY SHOULD SHOULD GO TO OTHER PEOPLE .
THAT REALLY DO NT DESERVE IT .
UH WELL YEAH .
I KNOW IT S IT S A LOT YOU KNOW THAT UH THAT I FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW JUST LIKE YOU SAID THAT THERE S JUST SO MUCH THAT YOU CAN DO YOURSELF .
THAT YOU TAKE CARE OF YOUR OWN SELF THAT YOU DO NT NEED THE MONEY FOR BUT THEY RE GIVING IT TO OTHER PEOPLE .

IF I WANTED TO JUST UH YOU KNOW PERMANENTLY BECOME A BOOK READER I GUESS I COULD JUST UH YOU KNOW UH GO ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE UH YOU KNOW .
LIKE SO MANY PEOPLE DO .
LO LO LOOK FOR UH LOOK FOR PEOPLE TO UH TAKE CARE OF ME .

BUT UH UH THE UH THE LOCAL TAXES HERE I I I IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA UH YOU KNOW I VE UH I THINK I PAY ABOUT UH OH THIRTYFIVE HUNDRED FOR FOR TAXES ON MY FOUR BEDROOM HOUSE YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
AND WHICH IS A LOT OF MONEY .
AN AND UH AND SO AS AS PEOPLE GET OLDER AND OLDER UH YOU KNOW THEY THINK ABOUT RETIREMENT AND THAT SORT OF THING .
UHHUH .
AND AND THEY THEY RE BUILDING OLD PEOPLE S HOMES UH YOU KNOW AT TAX EXPENSE .
WELL I THINK YOU KNOW THE OLD PEOPLE OUGHT TO JUST BAIL OUT OF HERE AND GO WHERE IT S CHEAPER .
AT THIRTYTHREE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR THIRTYFIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS I M PAYING IN TAXES WHY I I COULD GO DOWN TO BULVERDE AND PROBABLY RENT A RENT A HOUSE FOR THAT RIGHT .
YEAH THAT S RIGHT .
YOU KNOW .
IN IN INSTEAD IT S IT S THE TAXES HERE SO .
YEAH .
COURSE I DO NT KNOW WHETHER I WANT TO GO TO BULVERDE OR NOT YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
OR SEGUIN OR SOMEPLACE LIKE THAT .
YEAH .
BUT UH THERE S CERTAINLY LOTS OF INEXPENSIVE PLACES WHERE THE SERVICES ARE POORER .
AND AND I THINK REALLY THE ONLY PLACE .
YOU CAN REALLY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TAXES YOU PAY IS TO MOVE TO AN AREA WHERE THE SERVICES ARE POORER .
IF YOU RE NOT GOING TO USE THEM THEN YOU WANT TO BE IN IN ENVIRONMENT .
THAT S A STRATEGY .
I THINK THA THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE TO HAVE TO TAKE .
IS IS HOW TO BE ABLE TO TO LESSEN THEIR COST OF LIVING .
YOU KNOW I M I M FIVE OR SIX MUMBLEX YEARS BEFORE I M ELIGIBLE TO RETIRE AND AND I M SAYING WELL YOU KNOW I REALLY CA NT STAY HERE UH AS A RETIREE .
AFTER YOU RETIRE YEAH .
IT S TOO EXPENSIVE .
YEAH .
I M GOING TO HAVE GO OUT AND YOU KNOW IN YOU KNOW EAST FORK SOMEPLACE .
RIGHT .
AND AND DO MY THING YOU KNOW .
MY PARENTS ARE IN THE SAME SITUATION YOU KNOW .
THEY THEIR HOME IS PAID FOR BUT STILL THEIR TAXES ARE SO HIGH THAT YOU KNOW MY FATHER DOES NT FEEL LIKE HE CAN RETIRE BECAUSE THEY COULD NT PAY THEIR TAXES .
AND THEY HAVE NO CHILDREN IN SCHOOL OR YOU KNOW ANYTHING NOW .
THEY DO NT USE ANY OF THOSE SERVICES THAT A LOT OF THE TAXES GO TOWARDS .
RIGHT .
THEY THEY REDECORATED IN NINETEEN SEVENTYFIVE YOU KNOW .
UH YEAH .
AND THEY RE NOT DOING IT .
A AGAIN YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
SO .
WELL IT S CERTAINLY UH UH YOU MUST BE A T I .
EMPLOYEE .
YOU MUST BE WHAT .
YOU MUST BE A T I .
EMPLOYEE .
NO I M NOT .
YOU RE NOT A T I WHO DO YOU WORK FOR .
I I DO NT WORK .
I M A STUDENT .
I GO TO SCHOOL .
I M IN NURSING SCHOOL .
YOU YOU RE .
RECENTLY GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL .
MEANING LIKE UH YOU KNOW THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO .
I M A SENIOR IN IN UH COLLEGE NOW .
UHHUH .
AND UH I CA NT REALLY TALK TOO MUCH ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WITH UH PUBLIC EDUCATION IN DETAIL BECAUSE THE SCHOOL SYSTEM .
I WENT TO WAS UH REALLY SUPERB EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A PUBLIC SCHOOL .
REALLY .
SYSTEM .
YEAH .
I FEEL THAT MY UH I M A JUNIOR IN COLLEGE NOW .
AND .
OH .
OKAY .
I GO TO TECH GEORGIA TECH .
YEAH .
AND I .
I GOT A FRIEND .
WHO GOES THERE BY THE WAY .
I WANT TO AS TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT AFTERWARD OKAY .
OKAY .
UH I VE THE HIGH SCHOOL .
I WENT TO WAS UH WAS A GOOD ONE ALSO .
AND I WELL I GUESS YOU COULD SAY ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM IS THE DISPARITY BETWEEN DIFFERENT SCHOOLS .
BECAUSE THE ONE .
I WENT TO WAS YOU KNOW I M SURE A A LOT NICER THAN YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE INNER CITY SCHOOLS AND .
YEAH .
THE THINGS AROUND ATLANTA .
YEAH .
IT WAS A A IT S A MORE OR LESS A SUBURBAN SCHOOL SYSTEM .
YEAH .
YES .
THAT THAT WAS TRUE FOR MINE TOO .
UH ALTHOUGH I .
I M SURE TO SOME EXTENT THAT MONEY IS PART OF THE PROBLEM IN THE DISPARITY .
BUT I DO NT THINK I HONESTLY DO NT THINK THAT S THE BIGGEST PART OF IT .
YOU KNOW I .
WHAT .
D .
THINK THAT UH I MEAN I KNOW THAT IN MY TOWN YOU KNOW MOST OF THE MOST OF THE PARENTS THEY RE VALUED EDUCATION .
AND UH .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
YOU KNOW AND SO THE STUDENTS WERE YOU KNOW TO SOME EXTENT MOTIVATED TO LEARN .
I MEAN .
YEAH .
AND I M ALSO .
YOU KNOW .
I MEAN IN THE IN THOSE PLACES WHERE UH LIKE THE ECONOMY IS REALLY BAD THEY MIGHT YOU KNOW BE MORE TEMPTED TO TO QUIT SCHOOL AND GET JOBS AND THAT KIND OF THING BECAUSE THEY NEED THE YOU KNOW MONEY TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE AND STUFF LIKE THAT .
MORE THAN THEY WOULD YOU KNOW IN AREAS WHERE THEY YEAH .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
BUT BUT UH I THINK I MEAN EVEN MORE THAN THAT EVEN I MEAN IF YOU DROP OUT IN HIGH SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
YOU SHOULD STILL BE ABLE TO READ YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
THAT S TRUE .
WHICH .
IT .
MUMBLEX I MEAN IT SOUNDS LIKE UH NOW I THINK MAYBE IT .
S STARTED CHANGING IN THE PAST FEW YEARS BECAUSE UH THEY HAVE OF THESE UH SORT OF MANDATORY TORY TESTS IF YOU HAVE TO TAKE BEFORE YOU GET .
RIGHT .
A DIPLOMA .
BUT UH .
BUT UH CERTAINLY BEFORE THAT THERE WERE PEOPLE .
THAT YOU KNOW WOULD GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND COULD BARELY READ .
UH AND THAT S JUST SORT OF INEXCUSABLE AND YOU CA NT REALLY I I I MEAN I JUST CA NT EVEN PICTURE HOW THAT COULD HAPPEN .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW EXCEPT MAYBE TO SOMEONE .
WHOSE YOU KNOW REALLY BADLY LEARNING UH DISABLED OR SOMETHING .
BUT THESE PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY WERE NT .
THAT S HARD FOR ME TO SAY SINCE I DID NT .
I DID NT REALLY GROW WELL WHEN I WENT TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL .
IT IT .
WAS NT IN A GREAT AREA BUT I STILL I MEAN I LEARNED TO READ STARTED LEARNING TO READ WHEN I WAS IN KINDERGARTEN YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
SO I GUESS I CA NT REALLY .
YEAH .
I CA NT SAY WHAT .
IT WOULD BE LIKE TO UH GROW UP IN A REALLY OPPRESSED REGION .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW I GUESS THE WHOLE THE WHOLE ENVIRONMENT AND ATTITUDE TOWARDS SCHOOL AND LEARNING IS DIFFERENT FOR THE MUMBLEX PEOPLE .
YEAH .
AND I THINK THAT S ALMOST A BIGGER FACTOR .
THAN ANYTHING ELSE PROBABLY .
I MEAN I DO NT I THINK YOU KNOW PEOPLE JUST .
SO I GUESS THE PROBLEM IS THE THE THING TO DO IS TO TRY TO UH TO GET SOME KIND OF MOTIVATION TO LEARN AND .
YEAH .
AND AGAIN I DO NT I MEAN THEY GOT TO KNOW THE YOU KNOW HOW QUALIFIED I MEAN MUMBLEX I THINK IT D BE INTERESTING .
UHHUH .
TO YOU KNOW TO SPEND A COUPLE OF DAYS JUST LOOKING AROUND AN INNER CITY SCHOOL .
UH YOU KNOW SORT SORT OF MAYBE FROM ELEMENTARY THROUGH UH HIGH SCHOOL .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW JUST SORT OF TO GET A FEEL FOR WHAT .
IT S LIKE .
UHHUH .
I THINK THAT D BE AN INTERESTING EXPERIENCE .
BUT UH I HAVE NT DONE THAT .
NO I I CA NT SAY THAT I HAVE EITHER .
BUT UH .
BUT I DO I DO THINK THAT UH I MEAN PUBLIC EDUCATION IN GENERAL I THINK CAN WORK .
AND I THINK IT S A GOOD THING .
YEAH .
I VE I VE HEARD SOME I MEAN I VE HEARD STA STA STATISTICS AND THINGS .
THAT THAT COMPARE A PUBLIC EDUCATION TO A PRIVATE EDUCATION .
I MEAN WITHIN LIKE WITHIN THE SAME UH INCOME GROUPS .
YEAH .
IF YOU COMPARE THE LIKE THE PEOPLE .
THAT COULD HAVE THAT COULD HAVE SENT THEIR KIDS TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND THE PEOPLE .
THAT YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE .
THAT UH DID SEND THEIR KIDS TO PRIVATE .
YES .
SCHOOLS .
I THINK THEY COMPARE FAIR YOU KNOW FAIRLY WELL .
YEAH .
YEAH .
I MEAN I DO NT I HONESTLY DO NT REALLY THINK I COULD HAVE YOU KNOW DONE MUCH BETTER THAN I DID IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM .
I WAS IN .
YEAH .
I MEAN .
I I I MY SCHOOLS I MEAN THERE I HAVE A LOT OF ONCE ONCE IT SEEMED I GOT INTO HIGH SCHOOL THEY HAD A LOT OF UH MUMBLEX ACCELERATED PROGRAMS AND ALL KINDS OF .
YEAH .
STUFF LIKE THAT .
THAT I MEAN THAT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE CAUSE .
I WONDERED WHEN THEY RE TAKING CLASSES WITH UH WITH PEOPLE .
THAT ARE REALLY ARE INTERESTED IN THE THE SUBJECT AND STUFF LIKE THAT .
YEAH .
I MEAN AND AND IN THE .
ONCE YOU BOOK JUNIOR HIGH UH START JUNIOR HIGH STARTING IN EIGHTH GRADE .
ALL THE WAY THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL THERE WERE FOUR LEVELS .
WELL NO I GUESS IT .
WA IN JUNIOR HIGH IT WAS STILL THREE .
THEN IN HIGH SCHOOL .
IT CHANGED INTO FOUR LEVELS OF UH OF INSTRUCTION IN THE MAJOR SUBJECTS .
UHHUH .
UH WHICH I MEAN ACTUALLY I THINK THAT WORKS PRETTY WELL .
MUMBLEX AND THAT THAT MAKES .
WELL UH DOES THE COMPANY .
YOU WORK FOR TEST FOR DRUGS .
ACTUALLY UH THEY JUST RECENTLY STARTED A POLICY OF TESTING DRUGS WHICH WAS KIND OF INTERESTING BECAUSE W WHEN I WENT TO WORK FOR THEM UH THEY DID NT DO THAT BUT UH SINCE THEN THEY VE THEY VE STARTED A DRUG TESTING POLICY NOT BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN UH CONVICTIONS BUT BECAUSE THE CLIENTS OF OUR COMPANY ARE REQUESTS THAT WE DO THAT .
HUH .
HOW ABOUT YOU .
UH NO WE RE NOT BEING TESTED FOR DRUGS AT ALL UH OUR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES MANUAL UH THE FURTHEST .
IT GOES ABOUT DRUGS IS IN THE KIND OF THE MISCELLANEOUS SECTION OR .
UHHUH .
IT S REASONS FOR IMMEDIATE DISMISSAL IT SAYS USE OF NARCOTICS ON COMPANY PREMISES .
UM .
SO THAT S PRETTY GENERAL BUT UH I WORK FOR AN ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT FIRM .
OKAY .
AND I M AN ENGINEER THERE BUT I DO GO ON A LOT OF HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES BUT I DO NT OPERATE ANY MACHINERY .
YEAH .
NOW PEOPLE FOR OUR COMPANY .
THAT DO OPERATE MACHINERY LIKE DRILL RIGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
ARE UNDER A A MEDICAL MONITORING PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY RE AT A HIGHER RISK OF EXPOSURE AND BLOOD SCREENING IS PART OF THAT AND I I THINK THAT DRUGS THEY DO TEST FOR DRUGS IN THAT CAPACITY BUT IT S NOT THEIR EXCLUSIVE IT S JUST PART IT S JUST SOMETHING .
THAT TURNS UP IN THE OTHER PARAMETERS THAT THEY TEST FOR .
YEAH .
BUT I THINK IT S GOT A LITTLE MORE RELEVANCE SINCE THEY ARE AROUND DANGEROUS EQUIPMENT AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND DO HAVE TO EXERCISE SOME QUICK JUDGMENT IN THE FIELD .
WHAT IS THE NATURE OF YOUR COMPANY S BUSINESS .
WELL IT S ACTUALLY UH WE DO OIL WELL SERVICES .
SO A LOT OF OUR CLIENTS ARE OIL COMPANIES BIG OIL COMPANIES AND THEY GO OUT TO WE HAVE ENGINEERS .
WHO UH GO OUT TO THE OIL WELL TO THE TO THE CLIENT S OIL WELL AND AND WORK WITH A LOT OF HEAVY EQUIPMENT AND PUT TOOLS DOWN THE OIL WELL AND STUFF SO THE CLIENTS ARE VERY CONCERNED THAT YOU KNOW THE ENGINEERS .
WHO GO OUT THERE ARE ADHERING TO THEIR DRUG POLICY BECAUSE THEY RE ON THEIR THEIR YOU KNOW TERRITORY AND EVERYTHING BUT .
UM .
THE THING .
THAT S INTERESTING IS THAT I W I M AN ENGINEER AND A SOFTWARE ENGINEER AND I WORK IN THE SOFTWARE UH HOUSE AND EVERYBODY THERE YOU KNOW ARE ALL SOFTWARE ENGINEERS .
THEY VE NEVER YOU KNOW THEY NEVER GO OUT TO THE THE OIL RIGS OR ANYTHING AND YET WE RE GETTING WE RE SUBJECTED TO THIS POLICY YOU KNOW THE SAME ONE THAT UH TH ALL THE ENGINEERS HAVE TO TO WELL A LITTLE DIFFERENT ACTUALLY BUT UH YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE SAME THING AND IT S BUT IT S UH IT S A LITTLE DIFFERENT I GUESS THAN THAN A LOT OF DRUG POLICIES .
IN OUR CASE IT S LIKE WHEN YOU HIRE ON THEY LL TEST YOU AND THEN IF YOU GET INJURED ON THE JOB IF YOU LIKE TRIP AND FALL OR SOMETHING UH THEY GIVE YOU .
A DRUG TEST RIGHT AWAY .
OH REALLY .
OTHER THAN THAT THEY DO NT HAVE RANDOM TESTING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE REALLY UPSET WITH THE POLICY AT FIRST .
PARTICULARLY LIKE UH WE HAVE A LOT OF PARTIES AND STUFF WHERE THEY SERVE ALCOHOL AND THA THEY DID NT FIND ANY PROBLEM WITH THAT YOU KNOW BUT .
RIGHT .
UH .
WE THAT S BEEN AN A AN ISSUE UH IN OUR COMPANY EVEN THOUGH WE DO NT HAVE THE RANDOM OR EVEN REGULAR DRUG SCREENING .
IN FACT THEY LL HAVE THESE LITTLE PARTIES AND PEOPLE WILL JUST GET I MEAN I VE MY BROTHER LIVES WHERE I WORK AND I HAVE MANY A TIME CALLED HIM TO COME GET ME YOU KNOW .
AND UH UH BUT Y YOU KNOW THEY DO NT THINK TWICE ABOUT SERVING BEER BY THE KEG .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW BUT UH I THINK DRUG TESTING AND I I DO NT KNOW I GUESS I K I THINK IT S GOT SOME RELEVANCE BUT I THINK ITS RELEVANCE IS PRETTY LIMITED .
I MEAN I THINK YOU KNOW IN YOUR CASE I DO NT THINK THAT YOU SHOULD NECESSARILY BE SUBJECTED TO DRUG TESTING .
YEAH .
I THINK THAT S AN INTERESTING POLICY YOUR COMPANY HAS ABOUT TESTING IMMEDIATELY AFTER AN ON THE JOB ACCIDENT .
YEAH IT S REALLY IT S REALLY BIZARRE .
UH PARTICULARLY LIKE WHERE WE ARE YOU KNOW .
I I THERE WAS A STORY OF A WOMAN LAST YEAR .
WHO WHO ACTUALLY DID SLIP ON THE ICE AND AND LIKE SPRAINED HER ANKLE AND SHE SHE WAS A PERSONNEL SECRETARY AND SHE HAD TO GET TESTED AND I DO NT KNOW I M AMBIVALENT ABOUT THE WHOLE THING .
I YOU KNOW I HAVE A LOT OF MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT ON THE ONE HAND IT S LIKE IF YOU KNOW THEY RE THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE IT AS A CONTINUE OF EMPLOYMENT IN SOME SENSE AND YOU KNOW IT S LIKE YOU RE I MEAN EMPLOYMENTS ARE CONTRACTUAL BY NATURE ANYWAY .
UHHUH .
BUT UH I HAD AN EXPERIENCE WHEN I WAS INTERVIEWING FOR A JOB THAT WHERE I HAD TO UH UH DO A DRUG TEST AND AND IT S IT WAS KIND OF A LONG STORY BUT IT WAS IT WAS JUST AN INCREDIBLY HUMILIATING EXPERIENCE .
WHAT .
I WENT THROUGH AND IT AMOUNTED TO UH GOING IN UH BEFORE ANY OF THESE INTERVIEWS I M NOT EVEN WORKING FOR THIS COMPANY I M GOING IN FOR LIKE INTERVIEWS AND THEY FLEW ME OUT TO CHICAGO AND AND UH BEFORE I WENT INTO ANY OF THE INTERVIEWS UH THEY TOOK ME TO THE DOCTOR TO GIVE ME .
A PHYSICAL .
THEY SAID IT WAS GOING TO BE A PHYSICAL YOU KNOW AND UH ACTUALLY BEC BEFOREHAND THEY TOLD ME .
THEY WERE GOING TO UH DO DRUG SCREENING BUT I HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT AND SO BASICALLY I D ALREADY PEED OFF IN THAT MORNING AND AND WHEN I GOT IN THERE I DID NT I WAS NT LIKE ABLE TO GIVE A FULL SAMPLE AND SO .
OH .
THEY MADE ME SIT AND WAIT FOR FORTYFIVE MINUTES DRINK A WHOLE TON OF WATER .
RIGHT .
BEFORE I WENT TO ANY OF THE INTERVIEWS AND GO IN THERE AGAIN AND THE AND THE THE PROCEDURE IS UTTERLY HUMILIATING .
YOU GO IN THERE WITH THE DOCTOR HE MAKES YOU TAKE OFF ALL YOUR CLOTHES AND THEN HE EXAMINES YOU .
WELL TH THE QUESTION WAS TALKING ABOUT THE JURIES AND UH ONE OF THE THINGS I THOUGHT ABOUT WAS A LOT OF THE DRUNK CASES THAT THEY WERE HAVING THAT ESPECIALLY FOR REPEAT OFFENDERS .
THAT UH MAYBE THERE SHOULD BE STIFFER PENALTIES FOR THOSE PEOPLE .
WHO COME BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN .
UH SO THAT UH A JUDGE I THINK WOULD BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE PERSON TO UH TO BE ABLE TO SENTENCE SOMEBODY SINCE THEY DO IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN EVERY DAY .
RIGHT .
I I .
KIND OF AGREE WITH THAT .
BECAUSE I THINK IN SOME CASES UH THE JURY MAY NOT EVEN HAVE .
THE INFORMATION ABOUT OTHER CRIMES .
THE PERSON HAS COMMITTED .
RIGHT .
UH I I THINK THAT IN SOME CASES .
THAT S CONSIDERED TO PREJUDICE THE CURRENT CASE .
RIGHT .
SO A JUDGE YOU RE RIGHT SHOULD HAVE THE WHOLE DOSSIER OF THE CRIMINAL .
UHHUH .
THERE AND IF THEY RE JUDGED GUILTY WOULD PROBABLY BE IN A BETTER PRI POSITION TO GIVE AN APPROPRIATE UH SENTENCING .
YEAH .
SEE I AGREE WITH YOU .
UH ONE THING .
I HEARD WAS THIS WHERE THEY HAVE INSTEAD OF GOING TO THE REGULAR COURT THEY HAVE A A MOCK COURT .
I MEAN IT S SUPPOSED TO BE ALL LEGAL AND EVERYTHING .
UH YOU GO AND YOU PRESENT YOUR CASE THE OTHER SIDE PRESENTS THEIR CASE AND YOU RE DONE WITH IT .
IT S ALMOST LIKE THE NIGHT COURT WE SEE ON T V .
UHHUH .
UH AND UH BUT IT S NOT THAT WE HAVE UH SUCH IT DID NT BACKLOG OR ALL OF THE UH THE CASES .
THAT ARE UH ALL READY PENDING .
UH SO I THAT WAS ONE THING .
I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT WOULD BE REALLY NEAT IF WE COULD DO IT .
THAT WAY .
IN OTHER WORDS NOT .
NOT THERE WOULD BE SOME TYPES OF CRIMES FOR WHICH .
YOU RE NOT GUARANTEED A JURY TRIAL .
YES .
YES .
NOW .
I I I DO NT TH THERE S A POINT ON WHICH .
WE DO NT AGREE .
UHHUH .
I WOULD TEND MYSELF TO SAY THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO GUARANTEE A JURY TRIAL FOR CRIMINAL CASES ANYTIME A ANYTIME A ONE OF THE PARTIES WANTS ONE .
UHHUH .
AND I USUALLY IT IS THE DEFENDANT I GUESS THAT WANTS TO HAVE THE JURY HEAR THE CASE .
SURE .
SO I M NOT OUT FOR STREAMLINING THINGS TO THE POINT WHERE WE UH .
TAKE THAT YOU KNOW THAT WOULD REQUIRE A CHANGE IN THE BILL OF RIGHTS I BELIEVE AND SO .
OH YES AND AND I WAS NT I DID NT MEAN THAT .
OH OH OKAY .
I I DID NT MEAN THAT NO .
BECAUSE I MEAN GEE WHIZ IF I WAS UH UH DID NT HAVE THAT RIGHT YOU KNOW NOT TO HAVE A JURY THAT OH YES I WOULD FEEL UH YOU RE RIGHT THAT MY CIVIL RIGHTS HAD BEEN VIOLATED .
BUT I MEANT FOR SOME WHEN BOTH .
PARTIES AGREED THAT YES WE RE GOING TO HAVE A JUDGE HERE .
WE RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A JURY YOU KNOW LET S GET IT OVER WITH .
SORT OF LIKE CAR ACCIDENTS YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
WELL I THINK THAT S ALL READY POSSIBLE .
YEAH .
I THINK .
THAT YOU CAN WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A .
JURY TRIAL UH YEAH .
RIGHT RIGHT .
SO .
I AGREE THAT THAT SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED .
UHHUH .
PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW THAT THAT S AN OPTION JUST IN CASE .
THEY FEEL THEY HAVE TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL .
BUT I THINK MOST LAWYERS DO A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF MAKING THAT EVIDENT TO TO CLIENTS UNLESS THEY FEEL THEY CAN YOU KNOW TWEAK A JURY INTO .
RIGHT .
GIVING A DIFFERENT SENTENCE .
PER GIVING A DIFFERENT SENTENCE OR POSSIBLY IF IT S A CIVIL CASE GIVING HIGHER UH YOU KNOW AWARDS OF MONEY OR SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
SINCE USUALLY THE LAWYERS GET A PERCENTAGE OF THE THE AWARD .
THE TAKE .
RIGHT .
YEAH .
AND I SUSPECT IT IN CASES LIKE I GUESS WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING CRIMINALS THOUGH RATHER THAN CIVIL .
IS THAT RIGHT .
WELL I I I WE RE AT LIBERTY TO TO TALK AND AND MEANDER AS LONG AS IT S ALL ON THE SAME THEME .
YEAH .
UHHUH .
WELL UH IN THE CASE OF .
CIVIL UH THINGS I THINK MAYBE THE THE USE OF THE JURY IS VERY .
OFTEN TO THE LAWYER S ADVANTAGE AND I THINK THAT MAY BE WHERE JURY USE IS OVERDONE .
I MEAN THERE ARE CASES WHERE THEY COULD BE SETTLED .
MAYBE .
RIGHT .
OUT OF COURT .
A LITTLE MORE EFFICIENTLY .
RIGHT .
BUT THE LAWYERS ARE REALLY UH IT S TO THEIR ADVANTAGE TO PLAY TO AS BIG AN AUDIENCE .
AS POSSIBLE .
UHHUH .
SO .
UH I WAS WONDERING TOO IF THEY WERE THINKING OF ABOUT THE JUDGE MAKING AWARDS IN CIVIL CASES .
UHHUH .
NOT JUST SENTENCING IN IN A CRIMINAL CASES .
UHHUH .
UH I M NOT SO SURE I M IN FAVOR OF THAT .
BUT I AM IN FAVOR OF IT FOR CRIMINAL CASES SO THERE S A DIFFERENCE OF MY VIEW THERE FOR THOSE TWO .
RIGHT .
RIGHT .
YEAH BU WELL YOU CAN TELL I HAVE NT BEEN IN TOO MANY JURIES JUDGES CHAMBERS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT .
HAVE YOU EVER HAD TO SERVE JURY DUTY .
N WELL I WAS CALLED ONCE WHEN I WAS NINETEEN .
UHHUH .
AND UH BUT I WAS DOING SO MANY OTHER THINGS THAT THEY TOOK PITY ON ME AND I WAS DOING SCHOOL AND THINGS LIKE THEY THEY LET ME OUT .
UHHUH .
AN I VE NEVER HAD TO IT SINCE AND THAT WAS ALMOST TWENTY YEARS AGO .
UHHUH .
IT IS NT SORT OF AMAZED ME .
THEY FIRST CAUGHT UP WITH ME FOR THE FIRST TIME .
IN UH THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT UH TWENTY YEARS TOO .
UHHUH .
UH UH JUST LAST YEAR AND UH THE CASE .
I HEARD WAS A CRIMINAL CASE AND IT SEEMED IT REALLY .
TRIVIAL .
IT INVOLVED TWO BICYCLES .
UHHUH .
WE DID NT DO THE SENTENCING .
THE JUDGE DID .
HUH .
SO .
HOW INTERESTING .
WE WE A RENDERED A VERDICT AND THEN THE JUDGE WAS THE ONE TO DO THE SENTENCING .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND THAT WAS HERE IN WISCONSIN .
SO I I DO NT KNOW IF THAT VARIES FROM STATE TO STATE OR IF IT .
UH IN TEXAS THEY DO HAVE THE UH CAPITAL PUNISHMENT AND UH I I JU I I M PROBABLY ONE THAT HAS TO AGREE WITH IT TOO UH THERE A SOME THINGS THAT GO ON THAT I JUST FEEL THAT I I JUST FEEL THAT THAT THAT IS A NEED I DO NT KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE DO NT FEEL THAT WAY EITHER BUT I JUST FEEL THAT .
WELL I DO NT KNOW HOW MUCH PUBLICITY IT S GOTTEN OUTSIDE OF THE STATE BUT CALIFORNIA WE JUST PUT SOMEBODY TO DEATH .
UHHUH .
UH FOR I THINK IT WAS A DOUBLE MURDER UH TO BE HONEST I DID NT PAY THAT MUCH ATTENTION UH TO THE DETAILS OF IT UH BUT IT HAD A LOT OF CONTROVERSY OUT HERE UH BASICALLY BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA PEOPLE LIKE TO PROTEST ABOUT EVERYTHING .
UH BUT I AGREE I BELIEVE THAT THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CRIMES THAT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS THE BEST WAY TO GO .
UHHUH .
UH THE BIG DISAGREEMENT I HAVE IS THAT IN CALIFORNIA THE APPEALS PROCESS UH IS SO EXTENSIVE AND TAKES SO LONG THAT YOU END UP SPENDING A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY IN LIKE TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS BEFORE YOU CAN ACTUALLY YOU KNOW PUT SOMEBODY TO DEATH FOR FOR A CRIME .
YEAH YEAH THAT IS A CONSEQUENCE YEAH .
AND I MEAN THAT S THAT S RIDICULOUS I MEAN IF YOU CAN YOU KNOW Y Y THE TRIAL IS SUPPOSED TO PROVE YOU KNOW WITHIN A REASONABLE DOUBT THAT THE PERSON IS GUILTY .
AND THEN THEY HAVE APPEALS WELL THAT S FINE BUT IT SHOULD NT TAKE MORE .
THAN A FEW YEARS I MEAN I SHOULD THINK .
RIGHT .
TWO OR THREE YEARS MAXIMUM YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO KNOW AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO EITHER PUT THE GUY TO DEATH OR HE S INNOCENT I MEAN .
RIGHT .
IT S IF HE S GUILTY FOR FOR YOU KNOW MULTIPLE MURDERS OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW .
WELL MAYBE THAT S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE WORKED ON .
YEAH .
BUT I I JUST FEEL THAT THAT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT NEEDS TO STAY WITHIN THE SYSTEM NOT ALL STATES HAVE THEM BUT I YOU KNOW WAS THAT WAS THAT THE I M NOT SURE IF THAT WAS IN WAS THAT THE MAN THAT THAT CLAIMED HE WAS ABUSED OR .
YEAH HE WAS LIKE UH THE .
AND THAT HE HAD .
THE .
HE .
DEFENSE THE DEFENSE THEY RE WERE GIVING GIVEN WAS THAT UH LIKE HIS MOTHER HAD HAD BEEN AN ALCOHOLIC WHEN WHEN SHE WAS .
OH YEAH .
PREGNANT WITH HIM AND SO HE HE WAS NT YOU KNOW MENTALLY COMPETENT OR ANYTHING ELSE .
YEAH .
WHICH IS RIDICULOUS .
AND AND THE COURT FOUND HIM COMPETENT UH AND HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING AND EVERYTHING ELSE I MEAN .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW IT WAS IT WAS THE BEST DEFENSE THEY COULD COME UP WITH .
AND HOW LONG HAD HE BEEN A APPEALING HOW LONG WAS THAT .
I FORGET I THINK IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE TWELVE YEARS OR SOMETHING .
GOSH BOY .
IT WAS IT WAS SOMETHING REALLY OUTRAGEOUS .
YEAH BOY WELL I MEAN AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT IT RARELY DOES HAPPEN YOU KNOW IT S NOT IT S NOT USED THAT OFTEN .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW AT LEAST HERE IN TEXAS BUT I THINK IT S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO STAY I REALLY DO .
I THINK IN GENERAL UH PUNISHMENT IN THE UNITED STATES IS A LOT WEAKER THAN IT SHOULD BE I MEAN IT NEEDS TO BE YOU KNOW IT S KIND OF LIKE THE THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES IS KIND OF LIKE THE DOG POOPS ON THE CARPET AND YOU WAIT THREE MONTHS AND THEN YOU PUT HIS NOSE IN IT AND SPANK HIM FOR IT .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW I MEAN THERE THERE S NO CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TWO .
RIGHT RIGHT YEAH .
I MEAN YOU TAKE THESE YOU KNOW MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMMITTING VIOLENT CRIMES MOST OF THEM NOT ALL BY ANY MEANS BUT YOU KNOW A LARGE PERCENTAGE ARE THE KIND OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING VERY MUCH DAY TO DAY IN THE FIRST PLACE .
UHHUH .
UH THEY DO NT REALLY SEE PAST NEXT WEEK MUCH LESS NEXT YEAR .
UHHUH .
AND TO SAY YOU KNOW WELL IF I KILL SOMEBODY THEN A DECADE FROM NOW I MIGHT FACE THE PUNISHMENT .
YEAH .
THAT S NOT REAL IT DOES NT HAVE ANY REAL IMPACT ON THEM .
MY SISTER AND I WERE WONDERING ABOUT THIS RECENTLY BECAUSE A AN OLD FRIEND OF OURS IN CALIFORNIA .
THIS HAPPENED ABOUT A WEEK AGO .
UHHUH .
UH HER HUSBAND JUST KILLED HER AND WE RE WONDERING IF THAT HAS AN EFFECT IF THAT IF SOMETHING DOES CAPITAL PUNISHMENT YOU KNOW DOES IT HAPPEN WITH THAT WITHIN THAT UH I DO NT KNOW .
UH YOU MEAN WOULD HE BE PUT TO DEATH FOR THAT .
RIGHT .
UH LARGELY DEPENDS ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND GENERALLY YOU KNOW FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND IT S IT S ONLY THE MOST BRUTAL TYPES OF THINGS USUALLY WHERE IT S MULTIPLE YOU KNOW .
I THINK YOU RE RIGHT .
IF IF THEY CAN SAY THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW WELL HE WAS JUST YOU KNOW TEMPORARILY INSANE BECAUSE OF .
SOME DOMESTIC SQUABBLE THEN .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THEY LL THEY LL GIVE HIM YOU KNOW TWENTY YEARS WITH WITH PAROLE IN IN TWELVE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
YEAH YEAH AND UH I HAVE AN UNCLE THAT IS AN ATTORNEY THAT DEFENDS PEOPLE .
SO DO YOU YOUR PRIVACY BEING INVADED AT ANY TIME .
WELL UH ONE OF THE THINGS .
THAT UH THAT I FOUND TO BE UH AN INVASION IS WHEN I PAY FOR SOMETHING WITH A CREDIT CARD AND THEY ASK ME TO PUT MY TELEPHONE NUMBER ON THE ON THE UH CREDIT CARD BILL .
THAT .
WELL YO .
IS SOMETHING .
THAT IS NOT REQUIRED .
RIGHT .
AND IN FACT UH IT IS ACTUALLY PROHIBITED BUT IT DOES NT STOP MANY PEOPLE MANY PEOPLE FROM UH FROM DOING IT .
AND IT S N O ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IT S USED FOR PRIMARILY IS FOR DEMOGRAPHIC UH RESEARCH .
AND TO GET TH YOUR YOUR PHONE NUMBER ON UH UH LISTS FOR PHONE SOLICITATIONS .
YEAH .
YEAH .
NOW TH THAT Y S YOU CAN STILL YEAH I VE ALWAYS DONE THAT .
I STARTED ONCE I FOUND OUT THAT THAT S REALLY NOT NECESSARY OR LEGAL THEN I JUST REFUSE AND I SAY WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO .
YOU GOING TO SAY YOU DO NT WANT TO SELL ME .
THIS PRODUCT THEN .
UHHUH .
THAT S FINE .
I LL JUST BUY IT SOMEWHERE ELSE OR NOT BUY IT AT ALL .
AND THEN ULTIMATELY THEY SAY NO YOU DO NT HAVE TO PUT IT DOWN .
BUT UH REALLY IT S PART OF THIS COMPLIANCE THING .
UHHUH .
UH THE THING .
I DO NT LIKE I KNOW THAT CERTAIN STATES ACTUALLY SELL THEIR UH THEIR LISTS LIKE UH MOTOR VEHICLES .
UHHUH .
THAT REALLY BURNS ME BECAUSE HEY YOU RE REQUIRED .
YOU HAVE TO DO THAT .
RIGHT .
AND NOWHERE DOES IT SAY YOU .
H ASKS YOU WHETHER YOU HAVE PERMISSION OR NOT TO SELL YOUR NAME OR INFORMATION REGARDING THAT TO ANYONE .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK THAT IT IT .
S ONE THING F TO UH VOLUNTARILY GIVE IT BECAUSE SOMEONE ASKS .
YOU CAN ALWAYS REFUSE BUT IT S ANOTHER THING WHERE IT S REQUIRED BY LAW AND THEN THEY GO AHEAD AND TAKE THAT INFORMATION AND SELL IT TO SOMEBODY .
RIGHT .
UH THAT .
YOU KNOW I DO NT THINK I DO NT THINK THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO THAT .
I AGREE WITH YOU THERE .
THAT S SOMETHING .
THAT UH PEOPLE HAVE SEEN .
OH HERE S AN EASY WAY TO MAKE SOME MONEY .
BUT UH I DO NT KNOW IF THAT S BEEN CHALLENGED IN THE COURTS OR NOT .
I I VE HEARD FAIRLY RECENTLY UH SOME TALK ABOUT THAT IN THIS IN IN MY STATE .
UH THE BUDGET PROBLEMS UP HERE ARE ARE PRETTY TENSE .
AND PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR ALTERNATE WAYS OF UH EN ENHANCING REVENUE IS THE UH PHRASE .
THEY USE .
AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SELLING THE D M V LISTS AND THERE WAS A LOT OF UH A LOT OF UH CONSTERNATION ABOUT THAT AND THE LAST I HEARD THEY D BACKED DOWN FROM THAT IDEA .
BUT IT REALLY MAKES YOU WONDER WHAT .
OTHER LISTS YOU RE OWN .
THAT HAVE BEEN MADE UH PUBLIC THAT YOU .
DO NT KNOW ABOUT .
WELL THAT S EASY .
WHENEVER YOU DONATE MONEY TO SOMEONE .
UHHUH .
THEY YOU BECOME PUT ON SOMETHING LIKE A SUCKER LIST AND YOU START GETTING MILLIONS OF CALLS OR .
RIGHT .
SOLICITATIONS .
AND THEN YOU S Y Y IT .
KIND OF MAKES YOU FEEL MUMBLEX FROM DOING IT AGAIN .
UHHUH .
LIKE UH NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO OR ANY OF THESE THE PUBLIC UH STATIONS YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
I I I I THINK I SENT IN IN MONEY FOR F ONCE TO UH TO PUBLIC UH T V .
UHHUH .
AND I STARTED GETTING CALLS FROM ALL SORTS OF DISEASES AND SYNDROMES AND .
HUH .
EVERYTHING .
YOU COULD IMAGINE .
I IT S LIKE AND IT JUST STARTED SOON AFTER I HAD DONE THAT ONE .
RIGHT .
AND I JUST SAID THIS IS THIS IS TERRIBLE .
UH AND THAT S ALSO HAPPENED TO ME WHERE I VE GIVEN MONEY TO MY OLD ALMA MATER IN COLLEGE .
UHHUH .
AND UH IT .
S ONE THING THEY DO NT SELL THE LIST .
BUT THE THING .
THAT MAKES ME MAD IS UH THEN THEY START GETTING UH OTHER PEOPLE TH THE PEOPLE DO THESE PHONATHONS .
RIGHT .
AND THEY CALL YOU UP AND THEY ACTUALLY HAPPEN TO BE PEOPLE .
WHO ARE GRADUATED IN YOUR CLASS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
AND AND THEY SAY OH WE WE KNOW YOU .
YOU UH HAD UH CONTRIBUTED X AMOUNT LAST YEAR .
CAN YOU DO BETTER THIS YEAR .
AND YOU KNOW LIKE HOLD ON HERE .
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT .
WHO HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT .
WHY WHY YOU EVEN TELLING ME .
THIS .
IS IT ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS .
I MEAN IT S ONE THING THAT I AND THE COLLEGE KNOWS THAT THAT S .
JUST OUR BUSINESS .
THERE S NO NEED FOR SOMEONE .
UHHUH .
WHO IS SOLICITING SHOULD KNOW AT ALL .
JUST UH AND THAT WAS VERY OFFENSIVE TOO .
I AND SO .
LAST YEAR THE UH LOTUS DEVELOPMENT COMPANY THE UH .
UHHUH .
COMPANY .
THAT PUTS OUT ONE TWO THREE .
RIGHT .
WAS PLANNING ON MARKETING A UH C D ROM WITH PEOPLE S NAMES SORTED BY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CRITERIA .
WELL HAVE YOU EVER SERVED ON A JURY .
NO I VE NOT .
I VE BEEN CALLED BUT I HAD TO BEG OFF FROM THE DUTY .
AND YOU .
WELL I WAS CALLED AND THEN I WAS NOT CHOSEN .
UM .
WELL I WAS I WAS UH ORIGINALLY CHOSEN PRIMARILY I THINK BECAUSE I WAS A YOUNG FELLOW AND THEY TEND TO VIEW THE YOUNGER FELLOWS AS MORE LIKELY TO HAND DOWN A GUILTY VERDICT .
I DO NT KNOW WHY .
SOMETHING I PICKED UP IN A PSYCHOLOGY CLASS .
SOME TIME AGO .
OH REALLY .
YEAH IT S THAT THE YOUNGER THEY ARE THEY TEND TO BE MORE CONSERVATIVE FOR SOME STATISTICAL ODDBALL REASON AND THEY .
KIND OF LIKED ME .
I LOOKED CONSER AND ALL THAT STUFF AND THEY I DO NT KNOW WHAT .
THEY SAW IN ME BUT THEY SAW IT .
BUT UH BACK TO THE ISSUE IS UH I DO NT KNOW AT TIMES I FEEL THAT A UNANIMOUS DECISION IS WARRANTED ESPECIALLY IN CASES IN WHICH THERE S NO SMOKING GUN .
BUT THERE TOO THERE ARE ALSO CASES IN WHICH .
I FEEL A MAJORITY RULE MIGHT BE ACCEPTABLE PARTICULARLY I THINK IN CIVIL CASES .
IN CRIMINAL CASES I D LIKE TO SEE THE UNANI UNANIMITY REMAIN BUT IN CIVIL CASES I THINK A MAJORITY RULE BY BY JURY WOULD BE SUFFICIENT .
WELL UH COULD YOU GIVE ME .
AN EXAMPLE OF A CASE WHERE YOU THINK THAT .
WELL IN A CRIMINAL CASE SAY ONE IN WHICH YOU KNOW THERE IS LIKE SAY ASSAULT OR SOME SUCH .
I THINK THERE OUGHT TO BE A UNANIMOUS UH VOTE BECAUSE BY LAW AND BY CONSTITUTION .
THERE MUST BE PROVEN BEYOND A SHADOW OF A REASONABLE DOUBT THAT THE PERSON IN QUESTION DID THIS .
AND IN CIVIL LAW THERE YOU KNOW IS SUCH A THING AS LIKE LET S SAY UH MISAPPROPRIATIONS OR MISUSE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
A MAJORITY RULE I THINK WOULD BE MORE IN LINE AS THERE IS NO REAL SMOKING GUN IN THE CIVIL CASES .
I DO NT KNOW IF I M MAKING ANY SENSE OR NOT .
WELL I MEAN I THINK ARE YOU JUST TRYING TO SAY THAT CRIMINAL CASES ARE MORE UH TANGIBLE OR .
YEAH OFTEN THERE S MORE INCRIMINATING EVIDENCE .
LIKE FOR INSTANCE SAY UH AND ALSO TOO I THINK I M I M TEMPERING THIS AND THE FACT THAT THE CONSEQUENCES ARE MUCH MORE UH SERIOUS IN A CRIMINAL CASE .
WELL DO YOU THINK THAT THAT IN A CIVIL CASE IF THERE WAS MAJORITY RULE THAT IT WOULD BE EASY FOR SOMEONE TO BE SET UP .
UM WELL I REALLY CA NT SAY FOR CERTAIN TRUTH BE KNOWN .
UH AS IT STANDS THERE S THERE .
S MANY WAYS AND MEANS BY WHICH .
A PERSON CAN BE SET UP BOTH UH IN A CIVIL UH CIVIL AND CRIMINAL CASE .
I MEAN THE UH DOCUMENTARY THE THIN BLUE LINE PRETTY MUCH DEMONSTRATED THAT .
YOU KNOW I DO NT KNOW FOR IF YOU RE FAMILIAR WITH THAT OR NOT .
NO I M NOT .
A UH FELLOW WHEN HE WAS MUCH YOUNGER UH WAS TRIED AND CONVICTED AND SENTENCED TO DEATH .
FORTUNATELY IN HIS CASE THE DEATH PENALTY WAS REVOKED AND UH SO HE SERVED OUT HIS HIS SENTENCE UNTIL IT WAS DISCOVERED BY A FELLOW .
WHO WAS MAKING A DOCUMENTARY CALLED THE THIN BLUE LINE THAT THIS GUY HAD BASICALLY GOTTEN RAILROADED THROUGH THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM .
THE CASE WAS REOPENED AND HE WAS EXONERATED .
WELL I MEAN I THINK THAT THERE ARE MANY CASES IN OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM WHERE JUSTICE IS NOT SERVED .
YEAH MANY LAWS BUT LITTLE JUSTICE .
SAY BUT UH AND I ALSO THINK JUST LIKE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE WHY YOU WERE CHOSEN TO BE ON A JURY THAT UH THE JUST THE PROCESS OF PICKING JURORS IS NOT ALWAYS OBJECTIVE .
OH CERTAINLY NOT CERTAINLY NOT .
AND YOU KNOW THEY LIKE TO THINK THAT THEY RE GETTING SOMEONE .
WHO S OBJECTIVE IN ALL THIS BUT THEY RE REALLY LOOKING FOR SOMEONE .
WHO WILL PRETTY MUCH FULFILL THE LAWYERS DESIRES .
YOU KNOW THE BECAUSE YOU GET UP AND AND THEY ASK YOU .
A FEW QUESTIONS BOTH .
SIDES DO AND THEN YOU YOU RE EITHER CHALLENGED WHICH IS YOU KNOW EACH ATTORNEY CAN USE THAT AS MUCH AS THEY LIKE OR I THINK IT S A LIMIT NOW THEY PROBABLY HAVE A LIMIT NOW BUT THEY PRETTY MUCH GO THROUGH THAT AND THEN YOU HAVE TO GIVE A REASON TO THE COURT WHY YOU CA NT SERVE .
FOR ME IT WAS FINANCIAL HARDSHIP SO .
BUT ONTO THE THING UH I WAS NEVER AWARE THAT JURIES HAD ANY SAY ON RECOMMENDING SENTENCING .
IT WAS ALWAYS MY IMPRESSION THAT THE JUSTICE .
HIMSELF OR HERSELF HAD THE FINAL SAY .
ACTUALLY TO TELL YOU .
THE TRUTH I THINK UH JURY SELECTION IS A UH PRIME UH DISCUSSION TOPIC IN TERMS OF POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS ON UH UH FINDING OF UH GUILT .
UH I CERTAINLY CA NT ARGUE WITH THAT .
DEFINITELY DOES NEED SOME IMPROVEMENTS .
UH .
AND THE LAWYERS CAN THROW PEOPLE OUT FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER JUST BECAUSE THEY WANT TO .
YEAH I THINK THERE S A LIMIT ON THAT .
THE UH THE UH .
I THINK IT S .
PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES ARE LIMITED TO I DO NT KNOW HOW MANY BUT YOU CAN .
FOUR OR FIVE I CA NT REMEMBER WHICH .
I WAS ON A JURY TRIAL LAST YEAR ONLY I GOT KICKED OUT AS UH THE LAST SELECTION THAT THE UH DEFENSE GOT .
UM .
YEAH IT SEEMS TO ME .
I M ALWAYS CHALLENGED PEREMPTORILY ALSO WHEN I GO TO THESE THINGS .
I THINK I HAVE A SEVERE DEMEANOR OR SOMETHING .
UM .
UH .
THAT UH .
BUT TYPICALLY YOU KNOW BASIC UH TYPICALLY UH EVERYONE GETS INVOLVED IN UH THE JURY PROCESS AND I SUPPOSE AN ELITIST MIGHT SAY WELL YOU REALLY WANT SOMEONE .
WHO IS WELL EDUCATED TO BE ABLE TO TO WINNOW THE FACTS FROM THE FROM THE PREJUDICE .
RIGHT BUT IT STILL HAS TO BE A GROUP OF YOUR PEERS .
RIGHT .
SEE .
SO .
SO IF IT .
S YOUR PEERS AND YOU RE NOT EDUCATED .
SO IF YOU RE A .
THEN .
NINCOMPOOP ON TRIAL YOU D YOU D HAVE TO HAVE .
YOU WANT .
NINCOMPOOPS TO UH .
YOU WANT A NINCOMPOOP JURY BECAUSE THEY LL SYMPATHIZE WITH YOU .
A BIT .
UM .
AS WELL AS HOPEFULLY BEING HONEST PEOPLE AND DO THEIR BEST TO COMPLY WITH THE FACTS AS THEY WERE PRESENTED TO THEM .
SO THAT S WHY THE DEFENSE IS THERE PICKING THROUGH THEM WHEREAS AT THE SAME TIME THE UH THE PROSECUTOR SITTING THERE PICKING THROUGH THEM BECAUSE HE WANTS SOMEBODY .
WHO WILL GIVE HIM UH A GUILTY VERDICT IF THE FACTS WARRANT .
UHHUH .
SO UH I THINK THE JURY SELECTION PROCESS IS PRETTY NEAT BUT I DO NT THINK THAT THE JURY OUGHT TO BE THE ONES PICKING THE PUNISHMENT .
UM .
AFTERWARDS .
I THINK THAT SHOULD BE LEFT UP TO PEOPLE .
WHO HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE IN THE SUBJECT AND MORE KNOWLEDGE THAN A JURY WOULD HAVE .
M YOU RE TALKING ABOUT THE PERSON S ALREADY BEEN FOUND GUILTY RIGHT .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND MANY TIMES I VE SEEN ON TRIALS THEY HAVE ON T V THE JURY WILL MAKE A RECOMMENDATION AS TO LENIENCY OR AS TO THE DEATH PENALTY OR WHATEVER BUT I THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE UP TO THE JUDGE AND THE UH LAWYERS TO MAKE THE DECISION AS TO WHAT .
THE ACTUAL PENALTY WILL BE .
UM .
MAYBE JUST THE JUDGE BECAUSE THEY RE THE PEOPLE .
WHO KNOW WHAT .
THE SYSTEM IS .
UHHUH .
AND WHAT .
IT S ALL ABOUT .
UHHUH .
AND BELIEVE IN THE SYSTEM .
UHHUH .
UH AND I THINK THAT WOULD PROVIDE A MORE FAIR SENTENCING PROCEDURE .
WELL I SUPPOSE YOU MAY BE RIGHT ON THAT .
AS OPPOSED TO AN EMOTIONAL SENTENCING PROCEDURE .
MATTER OF FACT I VE HEARD THAT .
ALSO MAY BE A MORE CONSISTENT SENTENCING PROCEDURE .
I VE HEARD THAT SOME OF THE INFORMATION UH IS PREVENTED FROM REACHING THE JURY LIKE UH MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES OR OR PRECEDING UH CRIMINAL RECORD OR THINGS OF THIS NATURE THAT .
WELL PRECEDING CRIMINAL RECORD ACCORDING TO THE JUDICIAL PROCESS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CURRENT CRIME .
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO UH SENTENCING FOR PUNISHMENT OF COURSE IF THE PERSON S NEVER DONE ANYTHING BAD BEFORE ACCORDING TO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM THEN THEY RE GOING TO LEAN TOWARDS A SLIGHTLY MORE LENIENT SIDE AND THE JURY S SUPPOSED TO BE NOTIFIED OF CRIMINAL RECORDS WHEN IT COMES TO SENTENCING BY JURY .
OH IS IT .
OH I DID NT REALIZE THAT .
OKAY .
AT LEAST IN CALIFORNIA THEY RE SUPPOSED TO BE .
NOT DURING THE TRIAL DURING THE TRIAL AS TO WHETHER THEY RE GUILTY OR NOT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THEIR BACKGROUND .
RIGHT .
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT KIND OF SENTENCE .
YOU RE GOING TO LAY DOWN I THINK THAT UH THAT THEY SHOULD .
UHHUH .
I DO NT I DO NT KNOW THAT THEY ALWAYS HAVE BECAUSE I NEVER SAT ALL THE WAY THROUGH A JURY TRIAL .
THEY GET TOO BORING .
UHHUH .
SO YOU WHAT .
YOU RE SAYING IS THIS IF THERE IS THE SECOND OFFENSE THEN YOU EXECUTE THEM .
WELL IF IT S A SECOND OFFENSE THE PUNISHMENT SHOULD CERTAINLY BE MORE SEVERE THAN A FIRST OFFENSE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE REHABILITATION PROCESS DID NOT WORK THE FIRST TIME .
UM .
SO YOU GOT TO GIVE THEM EITHER MORE TIME IN THE SYSTEM OR A DIFFERENT PROCESS .
THAT WILL HOPEFULLY WORK BETTER .
WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO THINGS LIKE ALTERNATIVE SENTENCING I M ALL FOR THAT FOR UH SMALL CRIMES INFRACTIONS AND MISDEMEANORS OR PARKING TICKETS OR TRAFFIC TICKETS .
THAT HAVE GONE TO WARRANT YOU GIVE THEM .
THE OPTION OF WORKING OFF THEIR TIME DOING CIVIL SERVICE SORT OF THINGS .
WHAT ABOUT UH WHITE COLLAR CRIMES LIKE UH THEFT OF TRADE SECRETS .
I THINK THOSE OUGHT TO BE PUNISHED A WHOLE LOT WORSE THAN THEY ARE .
OH REALLY .
YEAH .
LIKE WHAT .
WELL UH SAY EMBEZZLEMENT RIGHT .
RI .
YOU GET A GUY DOWN THE STREET .
WHO COMES UP UH CARRYING A KNI .
SO INTERESTING POLITICAL TRENDS OR EVENTS HUH .
UHHUH .
WELL I GUESS THE UH MOST INTERESTING ONE THAT S UH GOING ON RIGHT NOW FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS THIS UH PHENOMENA OF UH UH ROSS PEROT UH CAUGHT HIS INTERVIEW LAST NIGHT WITH DAVID FROST AND IT WAS .
UHHUH .
THE THE FIRST TIME I HAD YOU KNOW HEARD UH HIS VIEWS EXPRESSED BY HIMSELF I HAD HEARD OTHER PEOPLE TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY THOUGHT HE BELIEVED IN .
UHHUH .
BUT THE WHOLE PHENOMENA OF HIM COMING OUT OF UH LITERALLY NOWHERE AND NO PARTY UH AT LEAST NO APPARENT PARTY SUPPORT ON EITHER SIDE IS .
HUH .
PRETTY INTERESTING .
YEAH I HAVE NOT EVEN HEARD BELIEVE IT OR NOT OF THAT PERSON .
UHHUH .
I M NOT KIDDING WHEN YOU WHEN YOU SAID IT IT WAS KIND OF LIKE A SURPRISE .
LIKE OUT OF NOWHERE YEAH .
YEAH I THINK MAINLY BECAUSE I HAVE NT BEEN WATCHING WHAT S POLITICALLY GOING ON .
UHHUH .
UH IN THAT AT YOU KNOW IN THAT ASPECT I AS FAR AS LIKE NOW THE NEW HOUSE BILL THAT WENT TO MINNESOTA UH BEING THAT IT IS THEIR NEIGHBORING STATE AND THAT I LIVED IN MINNESOTA I M MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE POLITICS THAT INVOLVED WITH THAT AND THAT BEING PASSED .
UHHUH .
BUT UH AS FAR AS POLITICS IN THE GRANDER UH PART OF IT AS IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT UH ELECTION TYPE THINGS I M NOT QUITE SURE EVEN IF I M GOING TO VOTE UH .
UHHUH YEAH .
IT GETS HARDER AND HARDER EACH TIME AN ELECTION COMES UP LIKE THAT TO MAKE THE DECISION ON WHO WOULD BE THE BEST TO RUN UH .
UHHUH WELL IT SEEMS THAT THE DECISION SO FAR HAS BEEN FILTERED .
UHHUH .
BY UH YOU KNOW PARTY POLITICS SO MUCH THAT .
SURE .
WHEN THE CANDIDATES FINALLY GET PARTY APPROVAL PARTY SUPPORT AND THEREFORE GET PRESENTED TO THE PUBLIC THE THE .
EXACTLY .
CANDIDATES ARE ALREADY BEYOND WHAT UH MOST PUBLIC UH FEELS IS ACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THE ONE OF THE COMMON CRITICISMS OF CLINTON IS UH GEE HE LL SAY OR DO ANYTHING IN ORDER TO GET TO THE WHITE HOUSE .
SURE .
AND AND UP AND TO THE POINT OF UH PEROT BEING A SERIOUS CANDIDATE IT SEEMS LIKE THAT THAT WAS A REQUIREMENT OF BEING A A CONTENDER WITHIN THE PARTY IS TO HAVE DONE ALL THOSE THINGS .
UHHUH SURE .
I MEAN HERE S HERE S A GUY WHO FOR TWENTY YEARS HAS BEEN WORKING TOWARD YOU KNOW GETTING THE PARTY NOMINATION AND AND PREPARING HIMSELF FOR THE PRESIDENCY AND NOW IT SEEMS LIKE BOTH HE AND THE INCUMBENT PRESIDENT ARE YOU KNOW PRETTY SERIOUSLY THREATENED BY SOMEBODY WHO COMES OUT OF A WHOLE NONPOLITICAL ARENA .
HE MIGHT BE A A ONE OF THOSE SURE UH IT IT S KIND OF WHEN YOU THINK BACK OF THE OLD POLITICS WHERE A DIRT FARMER UH WHEN YOU THINK OF SOME OF THE BEST PRESIDENTS WE VE HAD IN THE PAST HAVE BEEN PEOPLE THAT HAVE STRUGGLED TO GET TO THE TOP I MEAN THEY WERE NOT RICH IN .
UHHUH .
IN ANY MEANS AND IT HAS BEEN KIND OF IN THE PAST UH I DO NT KNOW MAYBE FIFTY YEARS THAT IN ORDER FOR A PERSON TO GET INVOLVED WITH POLITICS THEY VE HAD TO HAVE MONEY .
UHHUH .
AND YOU HAD TO HAVE THE VIEWS OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE GOING TO BE PAYING YOUR WAY .
UHHUH .
UH SO IT MAKES THE COMMON PERSON UH NOT TO SAY THAT A COMMON PERSON COULD NT RUN FOR GOVERNMENT AND DO A FABULOUS JOB BECAUSE HE S GOT PEOPLE THAT ARE QUITE INTELLIGENT AND I DO NT KNOW IF WE LL EVER SEE THAT YOU KNOW WHERE A COMMON PERSON COULD EVER GET IN THERE THAT HAS GOOD MORAL STANDINGS AND UH HAS UH YOU KNOW YOU THINK OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND YOU KNOW JUST THE BACKGROUND OF .
UHHUH .
ABRAHAM LINCOLN YOU KNOW TEACHING HIMSELF TO READ HE DID NT GO TO COLLEGE HE DID NT YOU KNOW DO ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT UH YOU KNOW YOU WOULD THINK THAT WAS REAL POPULAR TO DO AND TO GET PO POLITICALLY INVOLVED IN AND HAVE MONEY HE DID NT COME .
UHHUH YEAH .
FROM MONEY UH AND NOW IT S .
AND AND YET EVEN HE WAS A A CONSUMMATE POLITICIAN IN THE SENSE THAT UH NOT ONLY DID HE UH FAIL IN BUSINESS TWICE WITH BANKRUPTCY AND FAILURE .
UHHUH SURE .
BUT HE LOST SOME EIGHTEEN ELECTIONS BEFORE HE FINALLY WON ONE .
UHHUH .
AND THE FIRST D AND THE FIRST AND ONLY ELECTION HE WON WAS UH THE PRESIDENCY .
YEAH .
HE HE HAD LOST EVERY OTHER OFFICE THAT HE HAD YOU KNOW HE WAS APPOINTED A COUPLE OF TIMES TO LIKE UH UH STATE LEGISLATOR .
SO YOU REALLY KNOW A LOT OF HIS BACKGROUND .
YEAH THEN THEN WHEN HE FINALLY YOU KNOW DID WIN AN ELECTION UH YOU KNOW IT WAS THE PRESIDENCY YEAH .
IT WAS THE BIG ONE IT S THE ONE THAT EVERYBODY WANTS YEAH .
YEAH BUT .
WHETHER OR NOT I YOU KNOW YOU LOOK AT ALL THESE CANDIDATES THAT WANT TO BECOME PRESIDENT I REALLY HAVE TO ASK THEM WHY YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
UH IT S THE TOUGHEST JOB IN THE WORLD TO DO AND NOT ONLY THAT YOU DO NT HAVE THAT MUCH FREEDOM TO MAKE CHOICES I MEAN YOU .
UHHUH .
HAVE TO GO THROUGH SO MANY DIFFERENT YOU HAVE TO GO THE HOUSE THE CONGRESS AND ALL OF THE O OTHER THINGS .
UHHUH .
TO GET A BILL PASSED AND SURE YOU CAN VETO VETO IT AT THE LAST MINUTE BUT THEN IT S NOT LIKE YOU HAVE ALL THAT POWER AND I THINK LONG TIME AGO PRESIDENTS DID HAVE A LOT OF POWER .
UHHUH .
OKAY .
ALL RIGHT .
WHAT S YOUR VIEW .
HUH .
WHAT S YOUR VIEW .
WELL I HAVE A HARD TIME THINKING THAT THEY CAN CONTROL GUNS .
YEAH .
PERSONALLY .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
I MEAN .
YOU KNOW EVEN IF THEY GIVE IT A SHOT IT S STILL GOING TO BE BLACK MARKET ALL OVER THE PLACE YOU KNOW .
THAT S RIGHT THAT S RIGHT .
I DO NT KNOW COMING FROM TEXAS YOU RE PROBABLY I DO NT KNOW I SHOULD NT MAKE STEREO TYPES BUT GUN CONTROL IS PROBABLY FROWNED ON QUITE A BIT DOWN THERE I WOULD THINK .

YEAH ALL RIGHT YEAH MY BROTHER WAS UH A GUIDE FOR BEAR AND ELK HUNTS OUT IN IDAHO FOR A WHILE AND UH REALLY ENJOYED IT QUITE A BIT BUT I DO NT KNOW I GUESS THAT WHAT THE SCALE NOW IS IT S ZERO FOR UH FOR A COMPLETE .

THAT S RIGHT .
AND UH .
I GUESS I AM ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE .
YEAH I I AGREE WITH YOU THERE .
YEAH NO DOUBT ABOUT IT BUT UH .
I MEAN IF THEY CAN ANYWAY GET IT KEEP CRIMINALS FROM HAVING GUNS WHICH THEY CA NT .
YEAH .
I YOU KNOW I M NOT .
YEAH IF THERE S .
FOR IT .
IF THERE S A WAY YOU KNOW TO LIMITED IT TO PEOPLE THAT I DO NT KNOW THAT THEY I GUESS THEY PASSED A COUPLE OF UH UH LAWS A HERE WHILE BACK IN SOME STATES IN TERMS OF A WAITING PERIOD .
UHHUH .
WHERE YOU KNOW YOU GO TO BUY A HAND GUN AND THEN THEY ACTUALLY UH I KNOW IT S THIS WAY IN FLORIDA THEY HAVE A WAITING PERIOD WHERE YOU BUY ONE AND THAT S A WEEK .
UHHUH .
AND THEN THEY CHECK YOU OUT AND MAKE SURE YOU DO NT HAVE A RECORD YOU KNOW AND THINGS LIKE THAT I THINK THAT S A PRETTY GOOD IDEA UH AND THAT S I DO NT KNOW THAT S NOT A BAD IDEA BUT THEN AGAIN YOU CAN ALWAYS GET AROUND THAT YOU COULD GO THROUGH THE BLACK MARKET LIKE YOU SAY YOU KNOW YOU ALWAYS BE ABLE TO GET AROUND BUT UH .
SURE .
YEAH IT S ONE OF THINGS BUT UH I DO NT KNOW I GUESS I GUESS SOME FORMS OF GUNS SHOULD PROBABLY BE CONTROLLED JUST LIKE I M NOT REAL SURE WHY ANYBODY WOULD NEED A FULL AUTOMATIC WEAPON .
YEAH I DO NT EITHER .
YEAH I M JUST NOT I THINK THOSE HAVE BEEN PRETTY MUCH YOU KNOW BANNED ALTOGETHER ANYWAY .
YEAH I .
THERE .
FULLY AUTO BUT EVEN WELL I MEAN A SEMIAUTOMATIC I GUESS THAT S .
IT KIND OF TAKES THE SPORT OUT OF HUNTING .
YEAH RIGHT .
YOU KNOW IT S LIKE WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH THAT THAT YOU CA NT DO IN A SELF PROTECTION SITUATION WITH LIKE A SEVEN OR A TWENTY SHOT TWELVE .
SURE .
YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT DO THE SAME THING .
RIGHT .
AND SO IT S LIKE I DO NT KNOW IT DOES IT TAKES THE SPORT OUT OF IT FOR ME I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE A BOW ANYTIME .
OH REALLY .
I I LIKE BOWS YOU KNOW I HAVE DONE SOME BOW HUNTING AND I UH I GET INTO IT AND I THINK IT S MORE OF A CHALLENGE YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
BUT UH I DO NT KNOW I GUESS IT KEEPS THE SHELL MAKERS IN BUSINESS .
SURE .
BUT UH I DO NT KNOW ANYWAY THAT S ABOUT WHERE I STAND .
ME TOO .
YOU UH .
YEAH I AM ABOUT THE SAME WAY .
AND YOU UH HAVE YOU EATEN YET OR WHATEVER .
YEAH .
IS IT SEVEN OCLOCK THERE .
UH YEAH IT S ABOUT SEVEN FIFTEEN .
YOU GUYS CENTRAL .
HOW IS THE WEATHER UP THERE .
OH IT S NOT TOO GOOD IT S KIND OF RAINY ACTUALLY .
IS IT .
AROUND THIS TIME OF YEAR YOU EXPECT IT UP HERE TO GET DOWN TO ABOUT UH I DO NT KNOW TEN OR TWENTY DEGREES .
RIGHT .
AND IT S BEEN UP AROUND FORTY SO PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE ARE WHINING ABOUT THE RAIN AND STUFF BUT NOT TOO BAD ABOUT THE TEMPERATURE ICE IS STARTING TO MELT AND STUFF LIKE THAT SO .
YEAH .
I AM JUST UP HERE FOR THE YEAR AND IT S KIND OF SHOCKING .
OKAY YOU WANT TO START .
YEAH I MIGHT AS WELL .
UH ONE OF THE THINGS I M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE AIR POLLUTION IS THE UH THIS THIS THE OZONE LAYER UH UH ISSUE .
UH I USED TO OWN A HEATING AND AIR CONDITIONING BUSINESS AND HANDLED LOTS OF FRE DIFFERENT TYPES OF FREONS AND THAT UH RATHER BOTHERS ME THAT UH I WAS IN IN EFFECT UH CONTRIBUTING TO THE DELINQUENCY OF THE THE ENVIRONMENT SO TO SPEAK .
UHHUH .
YEAH THAT S STUFF .
WE NEVER EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO .
RIGHT RIGHT AND ONE OF THE REASONS THEY FIXED UP THE FREONS ELEVEN TWELVE AND THIRTEEN IN IN IN THAT AREA WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE INEXPENSIVE UH THEY COULD BE MADE UH YOU KNOW INEXPENSIVE AND LOTS OF IT UH AND IN THAT AND ITS PROPERTIES WERE GREAT UH WITH UH THE MACHINERY DID NT HAVE TO HAVE LOTS OF EXPENSIVE MACHINERY TO UH GET YOUR HEATING AND COOLING CYCLES TO WORK .
UM .
SO .
HAVE THEY STOPPED THAT PRACTICE NOW .
WELL COURSE .
THERE S A A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF REFRIGERATORS AND FRE EXCUSE ME REFRIGERATORS AND FREEZERS BOTH COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL UH UTILIZING FREON TWELVE AND OF COURSE THE NEW CARS I GUESS STARTING WITH NI NINETEEN NINETYTHREE WILL NOT HAVE FREON TWELVE IN THEIR SYSTEMS .
BUT UH THERE S YOU KNOW THE TON OF AFTER MARKET MACHINES AND ET CETERA ET CETERA .
YEAH .
AND THAT S GOT ME VERY YOU KNOW HIGHLY CONCERNED THAT UH THAT S GOING TO BE QUITE A WHILE BEFORE WE CAN UH .
UNDO THIS .
NOW THAT COULD SPAWN SEVERAL GOOD INDUSTRIES AND HELP .
PULL US OUT OF THIS RECESSION BUT YOU GOT TO HAVE PEOPLE .
THAT CAN MAKE YOU KNOW EARN A SALARY TO PAY FOR THIS CONVERSION .
SO SO I SEE US IN A KIND SOMEWHAT OF A CATCH TWENTYTWO UNLESS WE UNLESS THE BANKS OR INDUSTRY AND OR THE GOVERNMENT GO TOGETHER AND AND COME UP WITH A WAY TO UH HAVE US AS A PART OF THE UNEMPLOYED SOCIETY BE ABLE TO BE GAINFULLY EMPLOYED AGAIN CONVERTING ALL THIS FREON TWELVE STUFF INTO THE NEW NONPOLLUTING UH COMPOUND .
OH YEAH .
BECAUSE AS I SAY THERE S A THERE S A TREMEN WELL HOW MANY UH UH FAMILIES OWN A REFRIGERATOR AND THEN DO YOU KNOW THAT NUMBER AND THEN HOW MANY A A FREEZER SEPARATE FROM .
UHHUH .
AND HOW MANY PEOPLE ESPECIALLY HERE IN TEXAS OWN CARS AND TRUCKS WITH AIR CONDITIONING .
YEAH YEAH .
I MEAN THIS IS THERE THERE ARE PEOPLE .
THAT THAT MAKE IT HAVE A THRIVING BUSINESS UH THAT DO NOTHING BUT HEATING AND AIR CONDITIONING ON ON AUTOMOBILES AND TRUCKS AND UH THE ONLY REASON .
I DID NT UH GET INTO THAT MORE WHEN I WAS HAD MY LITTLE BUSINESS WAS BECAUSE UH MOST OF YOUR UH AIR CONDITIONING IN IN ON VEHICLES TEND TO BE GREASY AND DIRTY TO THE NTH DEGREE .
UHHUH .
AND I MEAN .
SO UH THAT S WHY I STAYED IN STAYED MORE TOWAR TOWARDS UH UH AND THAT S A POLLUT POLLUTING TYPE DEAL TOO IS THE EXCESSIVE UM YOU KNOW UH PETROLEUM PRODUCTS IN YOUR ENGINE BAY AND SO FORTH AND THE DIRT AND GRIT AND THOSE TWO MIXED TOGETHER WITH WITH WATER AND UH REALLY MAKE UH MAKE A MESS .
UM YEAH YEAH I HATE TO SEE A CAR GOING DOWN THE STREET OR EVEN A TRUCK OR BUS FOR THAT MATTER THAT S PUTTING OUT A LOT OF DARK .
UHHUH .
SMOKE AND I KNOW THERE S A LOT OF POLLUTANTS WE CA NT EVEN SEE COMING OUT OF .
RIGHT .
CARS BUT THAT THAT PARTICULAR BOTHERS ME .
WELL MOST MOST MOST OF THE TIME WHEN YOU SEE BUS UH YOU KNOW THE BUSSES WITH THE DIESEL .
UHHUH .
THAT S UH THOSE ARE CARBON PARTICLES AND CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER VAPOR UH BECAUSE WHEN YOU WHEN DIESEL IS BURNED IT S IT YOU KNOW DIESEL FUEL IS BURNED IN A IN THE DIESEL ENGINE .
IT S BURNED SO COMPLETELY THAT YOU DO NT HAVE ANY UH NITROUS OXIDES UH OR OXIDES OF NITROGEN UH TO UH FORM .
OH .
BECAUSE OF BY VIRTUE OF THE VERY COMBUSTION PROCESS OF THE DIESEL ENGINE BECAUSE DIESEL OIL IS UH IS NOT VERY VOLATILE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW WHERE GASOLINE IF YOU LEAVE A LITTLE PAIL OF GASOLINE OUT BEFORE LONG IT S GONE .
YEAH .
DIESEL IS GOING TO BE AROUND BECAUSE IT DOES NT EVAPORATE EASILY AND IT S GOT WELL YOU KNOW IT S LATENT HEAT IS HIGH BUT IT S SLOW BURNING AT AT UH NORMAL PRESSURES .
THAT S WHY YOUR DIESEL ENGINES HAVE SUCH HIGH COMPRESSION RATIOS .
OH I SEE .
AS THE AS THE AIR IS HEATED YOU KNOW BY VIRTUE OF THE COMPRESSION PROCESS TO LIKE ONE TO NINETEEN OR NINETEEN TO ONE .
UHHUH .
RATIO .
UHHUH .
AND SO IF THE CAR SUCKS IN UH FIFTY DEGREES .
TYPE OF MUSIC IS HOT DOWN IN TEXAS .
UH WELL I DO NT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT S HOT DOWN IN TEXAS .
I KNOW WHAT S HOT DOWN HERE WITH ME SO THAT S ABOUT ALL .
I CAN FEEL APT TO DISCUSS WITH YOU SINCE I JUST KNOW I DO NT EVER LISTEN TO THE RADIO AND THAT S USUALLY WHAT S HOT AROUND HERE SO .
OH OKAY .

CONCERT TOURS FOR COUNTRY AND WESTERN SINGS IS IT S IT S QUITE QUITE ODD BUT UH I DO NT KNOW IT S MUSIC IS KIND OF GOING AN ODD DIRECTION NOWADAYS I THINK .
IT S BECOMING NOT NECESSARILY GOOD MUSIC JUST POPULAR MUSIC YOU KNOW .
HEY I I I THINK MOST ARTISTS ARE IN TO MAKE A FEW BUCKS .
YEAH AND THAT S ALL .
IT .
BUT THEY RE NOT IN IT TO SAY ANYTHING OR GIVE A MESSAGE .
YEAH .
WHICH IS WHAT .
THEY WERE DO LATE LATE SIXTIES EARLY SEVENTIES THEY WERE .
THAT S WHAT .
IT .
THEY WERE DEFINITELY PUSHING A MESSAGE .
YEAH THAT S WHAT WHAT .
YOU SAY AND AND THEN MUSIC IS WRAPPED AROUND NOW .
NOW IT S THE OTHER WAY AROUND .
YEAH I I DO NT I DO NT THINK GUN AT LEAST TO MY MIND GUNS AND ROSES DOES NT HAVE TOO MUCH OF A MESSAGE TOO MUCH TO SAY .
NO NO THEY DO NT HAVE ANYTHING REALLY IMPORTANT YOU WANT TO HEAR .
BUT YOU KNOW IT S KIND OF ODD IT S LIKE IT DOES NT HAVE TO BE GOOD IT S JUST WHO DOES IT YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
YOU HEAR A YOU HEAR A PAULA ABDUL SONG AND YOU AND I THINK IF SOMEBODY ELSE WERE TO PLAY THAT YOU KNOW THEY WOULD NT THEY NOBODY EVERYBODY WOULD THINK THAT S LOUSY BUT BECAUSE SHE DID IT IT S SUPPOSED TO BE GOOD YOU KNOW IT COMES TO THE POINT WHERE IT S YOUR NAME NOT WHAT .
YOU DO .
RIGHT .
MORE THAN ANYTHING .
MADONNA CAN DO ANYTHING AND IT WOULD BE CONSIDERED GOOD BECAUSE IT S MADONNA YOU KNOW .

MADONNA COULD START PLAYING FOLK MUSIC AND FOLK MUSIC WOULD BE HUGE JUST BECAUSE MADONNA DOES IT SO .
UHHUH .
IT S IT S IT S REALLY BACKWARDS HOW THINGS ARE WORKING NOW BUT .
YEAH I I IT S THE ARTIST NOT THE MERIT .
YEAH EXACTLY .
SO I DO NT KNOW I I DO NT KNOW THAT THAT S I DO NT THINK THAT S A GOOD THING AT ALL BUT THAT S THAT S WHAT .
THE POINT WE VE REACHED SO I DO NT KNOW HOW .
YEAH .
HOW MUCH FARTHER WE CAN DIGRESS BEFORE WE HAVE TO TURN IT AROUND AND GO THE OTHER WAY AT LEAST .
WELL I DO NT KNOW I KNOW FOR MYSELF .
THAT UH FOR THE MOST PART I DO NT KNOW WHICH ARTIST IS WHICH SO I LISTEN TO A SONG I EITHER LIKE THE SONG OR I DO NT LIKE IT .
YEAH .
AND THEN IF I REALLY LIKE THE SONG EVENTUALLY I LL FIGURE OUT WHO .

I DO NT YOU KNOW YOU DO NT I DO NT KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT IT BECAUSE I JUST LISTEN UH EVERYTHING .
I LISTEN TO IS WHAT .
I BUY NOT WHATEVER .

WELL YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO BUY OR DO YOU JUST BUY ALONG THE SAME ARTIST .
UH I YEAH I JUST MOSTLY BUY ALONG THE SAME LINES ALL THE TIME .
I DO NT REALLY SWITCH AROUND TO NEW THINGS VERY OFTEN .
YEAH .
IT S JUST IT S YOU KNOW IT S WAY TO HECTIC AND TOO CONFUSING .
YEAH SO YOU KEEP BUYING THE SAME ARTISTS UNTIL YOU DO NT LIKE AN ALBUM THEN YOU STOP .
UH YEAH GENERALLY OR ABOUT THE ONLY NEW MUSIC .
I HEAR IS SOMEBODY ELSE THAT I KNOW .
YEAH .
WILL BUY SOMETHING NEW THAT I HAVE NT HEARD AND I LISTEN TO IT THAT WAY BUT AS FAR AS YEAH I DO NT GO OUT ON A LIMB AND BUY SOMETHING NEW VERY OFTEN UNLESS I VE HEARD IT .

YOU KNOW IT YOU YOU YOU DO NT ALWAYS QUITE GET IT RIGHT .
UH I M OF THE AGE .
THAT COULD HAVE GONE ALTHOUGH I DID NT AND UH I GUESS UH LOOKING BACK ON IT I TEND TO THINK IT WAS PRETTY UH MOSTLY A MISTAKE .
UHHUH .
ON THE OTHER HAND UH THE MORE .
I LEARN ABOUT THE HISTORY THE MORE .
I SEE IT WAS INCREMENTAL UH DECISIONS .
ANY .
ONE OF WHICH WAS SORT OF UNDERSTANDABLE AT THE TIME .
UHHUH .

I THINK IT UH PROBABLY WAS THE WRONG THING TO DO .
HOW ABOUT YOU .

YOU KNOW WE UH THOSE PEOPLE THAT I KNOW I WORK WITH SEVERAL THAT WERE OVER THERE AND FOR SOME OF THEM .
IT WAS JUST KIND OF I DO NT KNOW NOT SO MUCH A HOLIDAY I GUESS THAT S HOW THEY TEND TO TALK ABOUT IT .
BUT THAT THEY JUST KIND OF LIVED OUT IN THE WOODS AND EVER NOW AND THEN THEY D GO AND SHOOT THEIR RIFLES AND THEN THEY D .
COME BACK AND YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
BUT THAT THEY WERE NT REALLY ALLOWED TO DO ANYTHING .
I UH TO ME .
IT SEEMS LIKE WE ONLY WENT HALFWAY .
IF EVEN HALFWAY .
YEAH IT S FUNNY .
TONIGHT I WAS UH .
HELPING MY KID WITH AN ESSAY ON UH STALIN .
UHHUH .
AND I WAS THINKING IN THE COURSE OF TALKING TO HIM ABOUT IT HOW UH IN WORLD WAR TWO THE PERSONALTIES OF STALIN HITLER AND CHURCHILL MORE OR LESS DEFINED THE WAR AND ACTUALLY WHEN YOU THINK BACK ON THE BIG EVENTS OF THE WAR IT WAS UH IT WAS ALMOST A PERSONAL STRUGGLE AMONG THESE THREE UH I GUESS YOU D HAVE TO CALL THEM GREAT MEN IN SOME SENSE .
UHHUH .
UH THEY RE CERTAINLY ALL LEADERS AND UH AND UH WITH THEIR NATIONS PRETTY PRETTY SOLIDLY BEHIND EACH ONE OF THEM .
YEAH .
AND I GOT A FEELING THAT SOME OF THAT WAS INVOLVED IN THE UH EARLY DECISIONS OF THE VIETNAM WAR .
THAT THE UH PEOPLE SAW THE COLD WAR AS UH YOU HAD TO DRAW A LINE AND AND DEFEND IT .
OTHERWISE THERE D BE THEY D GET YOU SOMEPLACE ELSE .
UHHUH .
LOOKING BACK IT SEEMS LIKE THAT WAS ONLY PARTLY TRUE .
THAT UH THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BETTER PLACE TO DRAW THE LINE .
UH I GUESS YOU CAN I GUESS YOU CAN SAY THAT A A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF RESOLVE AND WILLINGNESS TO FIGHT UH BROUGHT THE COLD WAR TO AN END .
BUT I DO NT THINK YOU CAN JUST FIGHT ANYWHERE JUST JUST IN ORDER TO UH CALL THE BULLY OUT AND BEAT HIM .
AND I HAVE A FEELING THAT THAT S PART OF WHAT WAS INVOLVED IN THE VIETNAMESE WAR .
THEY FELT LIKE THIS WAS A PLACE WHERE WE COULD DRAW A LINE .
BEAT THEM AND THEY WOULD NT COME FORWARD .
AND UH .
UHHUH .
WE WERE WRONG .
BUT I UH YOU KNOW THE LIKE I SAID THE MORE .
I HEAR ABOUT IT THE MORE .
I CAN SEE EACH DECISION .
THAT WAS MADE AS BEING UNDERSTANDABLE .
BUT THE ACCUMULATIVE EFFECT WAS TO REALLY GET INTO A A HOPELESS SITUATION WHERE AND AS YOU SAY UH GOING HALFWAY WAS PROBABLY WORSE THAN UH COMMITTING UH COMMITTING TO A COMPLETELY AND UH WINNING IT WHATEVER .
THAT WOULD MEAN .
YEAH .
WELL I I I THINK WE DID I THINK WE DID LEARN SOME LESSONS THAT WE WERE NT UH WE WERE NT PREPARED FOR I GUESS THE BEST WORD WOULD BE THE ATROCITIES OF WAR .
YEAH .
UH I MEAN THE OTHER WARS SEEMED LIKE A VALIANT WAR .
I MEAN .
YEAH .
THEY SEEMED LIKE A VALIANT THING .
YOU KNEW YOU KNEW WHO WAS GOOD .
YOU KNEW WHO WAS BAD .
YEAH .
AND IT WAS A IT WAS A TRADITIONAL M THE TRADITIONAL BATTLE OF KIND OF GOOD VERSUS EVIL IF YOU YOU KNOW .
WELL YOU RE NOT .
WHICHEVER WAY .
IT IS .
BUT IN IN THE VIETNAM WAR .
IT SEEMS LIKE IT WAS A A THE SIDES AND THE LINES .
THAT WERE DRAWN ARE ALL CONFUSED AS TO WHOSE GOOD AND WHOSE BAD AND .
IT S AMBIVALENT YEAH .
AND UH YOU KNOW THE EVEN IT SEEMS LIKE EVEN THE PEOPLE YOU KNOW HAD THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE THE NORTH VIETNAMESE AND OF COURSE THE LAOTIANS AND THE CAMBODIANS WERE NT EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE INVOLVED .
BUT .
WHAT WHAT ABOUT THE DOMESTIC EFFECTS LIKE I WAS THINKING THAT MAYBE THE MOST IMPORTANT EFFECT .
IT HAD WAS TO MAKE IT UH POSSIBLE AND EVEN POPULAR TO UH CRITICIZE THE GOVERNMENT .
AND THEY THAT PENDULUM STARTED TO SWING UH MA MAYBE EVEN TOO FAR .
TO THE POINT WHERE UH UH SUPPORTING A GOVERNMENT DECISION IN FOREIGN POLICY WAS SORT OF OPTIONAL .
YEAH .
FROM THE VIETNAM WAR ON .
YEAH .
AND THAT TRADITION IS STILL I MEAN IT S DYING NOW BUT IT S STILL ALIVE AS OPPOSED TO THIS DESERT STORM STUFF MAY HAVE UH .
YEAH .
KILLED IT .
BUT I THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST THAT YOU KNOW THE UH TH THE DOMESTIC UNREST .
WHA WHAT SORT OF COMPANY DO YOU WORK FOR .
DO YOU WORK FOR A BIG OR A LITTLE PLACE .
UH I WORK FOR GEORGIA TECH .
YES SIR .
I WORK FOR THE RESEARCH FACILITY .
UH AND IT S IT S KIND OF SMALL IN A SENSE BUT IT IT DOES HAVE ABOUT UH I GUESS TWO THOUSAND CIVIL EMPLOYEES .
UHHUH .
AND ON A A SCALE I GUESS IT S STILL CONSIDERED SMALL .
IT JUST HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT LABORATORIES .
UHHUH .
THE AREA .
I WORK IN IT IT PRIMARILY HAVE MAYBE A HUNDRED PEOPLE OR SO .
UHHUH .
SO THAT S MAKE UP MOST OF THE LABORATORY SO FROM FROM THAT STANDPOINT IT S PRETTY SMALL .
UHHUH .
IT S PRETTY SMALL .
WHAT ABOUT YOURSELF .
HUH .
WELL I I WORK FOR UH ACTUALLY PROBABLY SIMILAR KIND OF PLACE .
I WORK FOR UH LINCOLN LABORATORY .
OH OKAY .
UH YEAH .
WE ACTUALLY DO SOME WORK WITH SOME PEOPLE DOWN AT GEORGIA TECH .
OH OKAY .
I SEE .
UH AND UH SO WE RE WE RE PART WE RE ACTUALLY PART OF M I T .
SO IT S VERY MUCH THE SAME KIND OF PLACE AND UH .
OH OKAY .
THE TECHNICAL INSTITUTION .
RIGHT .
UH .
UH WHILE I WAS SITTING HERE WAITING WHILE THEY TRIED TO FIND SOMEBODY FOR ME TO TALK TO TRYING TO THINK OF WHAT UH UH WHAT THINGS WERE IMPORTANT UH BESIDES SALARY AND A AND A JOB .
I GUESS UH MUMBLEX LIST .
I HAD SCRIBBLED DOWN WAS THE PEOPLE YOU WORKED WITH AND MAYBE THE UH THE CHALLENGE OF THE WORK AND UH .
UHHUH .
THE WORKING CONDITIONS THINGS LIKE THAT .
RIGHT .
I DO NT KNOW .
WHAT ARE YOUR UH WHAT SORTS OF THINGS WOULD YOU CONSIDER IMPORTANT .
WELL THOSE AND PROBABLY THE SECURITY ASPECT OF IT .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE A LOT OF TIME NOWADAYS EVEN THOUGH YOU RE WORKING UH YOU RE TREATED AND IT MAY NOT BE TRUE IN EVERY PLACE .
IN A LOT OF CASES I THINK YOU RE TREATED MORE LIKE A NUMBER INSTEAD OF A A PERSON .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE WHEN IT COME DOWN TO LAYOFF THEY DO NT REALLY CONSIDER PEOPLE AND AND YOU KNOW THEIR WELL BEING AS FAR AS YOU KNOW HOW THEY GOING THEIR NEXT DOLLAR GOING TO COME IN .
HOW THEY GOING TO PAY THEIR BILLS .
THEY JUST LAY THEM OFF .
YEAH .
AND I WAS READING THIS BOOK ONE TIME ABOUT THIS GUY .
THAT HAD UH I THINK THE COMPANY STILL EXISTS .
WHAT .
THEY USE TO DO IS THEY USED TO CUT THE NUMBER OF HOURS FOR EVERYBODY AS OPPOSED TO JUST LAYING PEOPLE OFF .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW .
THAT WAY THAT YOU KNOW ONE PERSON WOULD NT GET ONE BIG BLUNT BLOW AT ONE TIME .
UHHUH .
AND UH YOU KNOW I THINK IF THEY HAD PROGRAMS .
THAT SET UP TO SUBSIDIZE PEOPLE .
THAT DO GET LAID OFF A LITTLE BIT BETTER YOU KNOW OTHER THAN S YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE UNEMPLOYMENT IS GOOD BUT I MEAN THE COMPANY AS A WHOLE BECAUSE YOU AS AN EMPLOYEE EVEN THE COMPANY IS MAKING MONEY THEY PAYING YOU .
A SALARY BUT YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT COMPANY GROWTH .
YOU RE RESPONSIBLE ALSO FOR HELPING THAT COMPANY GET TO THE PAR POINT THAT IT S AT AT MAKING PROFITS .
SO THERE SHOULD BE SOMETHING IN THERE OR SOME KIND OF CLAUSE .
THAT WILL SUBSIDIZE PEOPLE IF THEY DID LOSE THEIR JOB OTHER THAN YOU KNOW UH NEGLECT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW .
BECAUSE IT S NOT A PERSON S FAULT THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE NOT BUYING OR BUSINESSES ARE ARE NOT ON THE UP AND UP ALL THE TIME YOU KNOW .
I DO NT SEE HOW ONE OR TWO PEOPLE MAYBE MORE ONE OR TWO BUT YOU KNOW A NUMBER OF PEOPLE CAN CAN BE THE DOWNFALL OF COM A COMPANY SITUATION .
NOW HOW DO YOU MEAN THAT .
I KNOW IT .
WELL IN A SENSE .
THAT SAY HOW DO YOU MAKE A A CONCLUSION THAT YOU RE GOING TO LAY OFF THESE TEN PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
UH FOR THE BAD TIMES OF THE COMPANY .
WHAT ABOUT THE THE WORK EFFORT THOSE TEN PEOPLE DID WHEN THE COMPANY WAS DOING WELL .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW .
IN THAT STANDPOINT .
WELL YOU YOU THINK IT S BETTER THAN TO TO TRY TO SPREAD THE THE EFFORT EQUALLY AMONG ALL THE EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY OR .
YE YES I DO .
UHHUH .
I REALLY DO .
I THINK IT D BE BETTER THAT WAY AND EVEN AT THAT IT WOULD AT LEAST GIVE THE PERSON TIME TO LOOK FOR ANOTHER JOB BECAUSE .
UHHUH .
THEY KNOW THAT MUMBLEX THAT THERE ARE PROBLEMS AND YOU KNOW THERE ARE REASON TO LOOK FOR ANOTHER JOB .
YEAH .
INSTEAD OF JUST DUMPING IT ON THEM .
ALL AT ONE TIME .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW .
THAT S JUST THAT S MY VIEWS YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
I VE HEARD OF A COUPLE OF COMPANIES .
THAT HAVE DONE THAT .
I THINK UH BACK ABOUT A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN THINGS WERE TOUGH HEWLETTPACKARD DID THAT FOR AWHILE .
THEY WENT TO A UH A A FOUR AND A HALF DAY WORK WEEK RATHER .
RIGHT .
THAN CUT YEAH JUST CUT EVERYBODY BACK TEN PERCENT .
RIGHT .
AND UH HAVE TO GIVE EVERYBODY A HALF DAY .
A WEEK OFF .
RIGHT .
AND I THINK YOU CAN DO THAT FOR A LITTLE WHILE BUT I M .
WELL AT LEAST .
THAT WOULD GIVE A PERSON .
A CHANCE TO LOOK .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
BECAUSE THE WAY .
IT IS A PERSON REALLY DO NT HAVE A CHANCE .
BUDGETING ACTIVITY IN OUR HOUSEHOLD .
I HAS IS UH UH KIND OF AN INFORMAL KIND OF SITUATION .
WE WE YOU KNOW PUT ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS UH IS MY CHECK GETS AUTOMATICALLY DEPOSITED .
I DO NT EVEN HAVE THE GLORIES OF BRINGING HOME MY CHECK ANYMORE .
IT JUST GETS DEPOSITED .
AND .
AND AND MY MY WIFE YOU KNOW YOU KNOW LOOKS AT ALL THOSE BILLS .
THAT COME IN AND YOU KNOW AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE ARE COUNTING ON ME TO HAVE MY WIFE PAY THEM .
YOU SEE AND SO OUR OUR BUDGETING W WE REALLY DO NT HAVE A FORMAL BUDGETING SITUATION .
EVERY TIME .
I VE EVER TRIED ONE IT S UH I VE JUST GOT WRAPPED IN MY INERTIA .
AND UH I VE JUST DECIDED NOT TO PURSUE IT .
UH WHAT WHAT S YOUR BUDGET SITUATION .
WELL ACTUALLY UH I VE I VE HAD A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT SITUATIONS .
MY CURRENT .
ONE HAS BEEN THE MOST SUCCESSFUL .
UH AT A CERTAIN POINT IN LIFE AN MY HUSBAND MY EXHUSBAND WAS AN ALCOHOLIC .
AND WE GOT DIVORCED BACK IN THE MIDSEVENTIES AND THAT LEFT ME WITH THREE TEENAGERS .
YOU KNOW WELL A A ACTUALLY THAT KIND OF SITUATION IS JUST WONDERFUL FOR BUDGETS .
IT CERTAINLY IS .
IS NT IT .
BUT AT ANY RATE WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT I I JUST ABSOLUTELY PUT AWAY ALL THE CREDIT CARDS .
I DID NT RIP THEM UP .
I DID NT SEND THEM BACK .
NOTHING .
I JUST PUT THEM AWAY .
BECAUSE THERE WAS ONE THAT IT WAS REALLY HANDY TO HAVE .
IF I ABSOLUTELY HAD TO HAVE SOMETHING I COULD GO USE IT .
UHHUH .
BUT UH MOSTLY WE JUST SPENT CASH .
WHATEVER .
WE HAD .
AND IF WE DID NT HAVE IT WE ABSOLUTELY DID NT SPEND IT .
BUT THEN AS THINGS IMPROVED YOU KNOW .
ONCE ONCE I GOT THEM .
ALL THROUGH COLLEGE UH IT CAME TO THE POINT WHERE UH MY PARENTS CAME THROUGH THE DEPRESSION .
I M NOT SURE HOW OLD YOU ARE .
WELL MY YOU KNOW MY MY PARENTS TOO .
YOU YOU .
BUT MY .
YOU WERE BORN IN IN THE IN THE LATE THIRTIES OR EARLY FORTIES .
LATE THIRTIES YEAH .
UHHUH .
YEAH .
AND UH MY MOTHER HARDLY EVER SPENT ANYTHING ON HERSELF OR ON THE HOUSE .
AND THAT S KIND OF THE WAY .
I WAS RAISED .
AND SO I M NOT A VERY DEMANDING PERSON IN IN THAT ASPECT .
SO FOR QUITE A PERIOD OF TIME I JUST FLAT DID NT SPEND ANY MONEY .
UM .
NOW MEANWHILE I GOT HAD A A BUILDING BANK BALANCE .
AND MY INTENT WAS THAT WHENEVER SOMETHING WENT ON SALE THAT I REALLY HAD TO HAVE I WOULD HAVE THE CASH TO BUY IT RIGHT THEN AND THERE .
UHHUH .
AND NOT EVER HAVE TO SPEND ANY MONEY ON INTEREST .
WELL THAT THAT S GOOD .
AND THAT THAT S THE WAY .
I VE OPERATED EVER SINCE THEN .
IT AND YOU KNOW IF IF SOMETHING GOES ON SALE AND I DO NT HAVE THE MONEY I STILL DO NT BUY IT .
WELL WE WE BUY WHAT WELL WE JUST GOT THROUGH BUYING A TWENTYFIVE FOOT REFRIGERATOR A NEW CERAMIC TOP STOVE AND A NEW DISHWASHER .
OH MY .
AND AND WE PUT TWENTYEIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS ON THE CHARGE .
ALONG WITH MY TRIP TO JAPAN .
OH MY .
WHICH WAS WAS FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS AND YOU KNOW .
OH MY .
RIGHT .
I MEAN WE JUST WE GOT A MONSTER YOU KNOW BILL COMING IN .
BUT BUT WE ALSO HAVE ZERO IN INTEREST BEING PAID .
AND WE PAY IT OFF AS AS IT GOES .
UHHUH .
AND THAT S THE WAY .
I DO MY CREDIT CARDS NOW .
YEAH .
SO WE NEVER REALLY GET THAT MUCH OVER UH OVER EXTENDED .
YEAH .
I DO ALMOST ALL MY PURCHASING ON CREDIT CARDS .
HUH .
BUT IT S THE FACT THAT I HAVE ENOUGH OF A OF A CUSHION IN THE BANK SO THAT WHEN THEY COME I CAN PAY THEM IN FULL .
YEAH .
WE RE WE RE DOING THAT .
WE HAVE YOU KNOW UH TH THIS IS OUR OUR OUR BIG UH WE DID REDECORATING .
TWO YOU KNOW TWO NEW PIECES IN THE REF IN THE FAMILY ROOM AND NEW CARPET .
I MEAN WE JUST .
OH MY .
UH WE VE JUST BEEN SPENDING SPENDING SPENDING .
I M ENVIOUS .
WELL I .
BU BUT WE HAVE NT REALLY DONE ANYTHING FOR A LONG TIME BECAUSE WE VE WE VE HAD TWO KIDS IN COLLEGE THAT .
UHHUH .
JUST HAVE GRADUATED IN THE PAST YEAR .
SO WE RE YOU KNOW WE DO NT HAVE THAT .
IT .
S TIME FOR YOU TO DO THESE THINGS THEN .
RIGHT .
YEAH IT S UH IT S ABOUT TIME THAT WE DID THAT .
BUT TH THE THE TERRIBLE PART ABOUT IT .
I VE LOOKED AT IT .
ALL AND IT .
ALL LOOKS STILL PRETTY GOOD TO ME .
WHY WHY WE NEED TO REPLACE IT .
BUT BUT UN UNFORTUNATELY MY MY MY WIFE REALLY FEELS AS THOUGH IT S IT S JUST BEEN AN INAPPROPRIATE UH THING TO TO I MEAN THAT RUG IS THIRTEEN YEARS OLD WHY NOT REPLACE IT .
I MEAN UH I SAY IT MIGHT GO FOR ANOTHER THIRTEEN BUT UH TOO LATE WE LL NEVER FIND THAT OUT .
THIS IS SO FUNNY .
THAT S WONDERFUL .
BUT .
AND .
YOU RE LUCKY TO HAVE HER BECAUSE IF YOU RE LIKE ME AND YOU HAVE DIFFICULTY SPENDING MONEY YOU NEED SOMEBODY TO HELP YOU SPEND IT .
I MEAN CERTAIN THINGS REALLY DO NEED TO BE DONE WHETHER OR NOT YOU THINK THEY SHOULD .
BE OR NOT .
YOU KNOW I I I DO NT SPEND THAT MUCH MONEY .
I JUST UH WE JUST SORT OF HAVE HAD UH YOU KNOW TOO MANY OBLIGATIONS TO YOU KNOW WE SORT OF TAKE CARE OF THE KIDS WHEN THEY WERE SCHOOL AND THEY THEY GOT THROUGH SCHOOL .
AND THAT WAS THE MAJOR YOU KNOW DECADE OF EXPENSES YOU KNOW .
SO WE WE FEEL AS UH BUT AS FAR AS ANY FORMAL BUDGETING UH YOU KNOW I I WE JUST APPARENTLY HAVE BEEN VERY FORTUNATE .
WHEN WE WENT WANT TO GO OUT TO EAT WE GO OUT TO EAT .
WE NEVER REALLY YOU KNOW HAVE TO PROGRAM MONEY FOR THAT OR MAKE CHOICES YOU KNOW .
BUT UH WE DO NT HAVE THAT UPROARIOUS A A LIFESTYLE .
AFTER ALL WE RE .
MUMBLEX CAPITAL PUNISHMENT UH I GUESS OUT IN CALIFORNIA IS HAS HAD A LOT OF UH A LOT OF YOU KNOW DISCOURSE IN THE PAPER .
UH APPARENTLY YOU KNOW THERE S THEY HAVE NT UH EXECUTED ANYBODY SINCE NINETEEN SIXTYSEVEN I BELIEVE .
UH YEAH .
THAT S THAT S AS FAR BACK AS I CAN REMEMBER .
WELL THAT S BEFORE .
YEAH THEY .
MY TIME ACTUALLY .
WELL I WE WERE WE UH WE JUST STARTED WE LIVED IN REDWOOD CITY WHEN WE WERE OUT THERE .
UHHUH .
AND UH AND WE FOUND THAT UH YOU KNOW IT WAS A VERY LIBERAL KIND OF COMMUNITY .
BUT THE UH I I REALLY FEEL THAT THAT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY UH YOU KNOW PUTS THESE PEOPLE BEHIND BARS AND THEN THEY THEY UH UH YOU KNOW LAWYERS THESE LAWYER GROUPS GET TOGETHER AND THEY UH THEY I THINK EXTEND BEYOND THE NORMAL UH APPEAL PROCESS .
UH YOU KNOW AND JUST DRAG THESE THIS GUY UH HIS HIS UH ULTIMATE UH DEMISE OUT FOR TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS .
UH AND I I THINK THAT UH THAT THERE S SOMETHING .
THAT HAS TO BE CHANGED IN THE SYSTEM TO TO DO THAT .
I THINK CAPITAL PUNISHMENT UH UH WAS OR PROBABLY STRINGENT ENOUGH BUT I THINK THE APPEAL PROCESS IS REALLY GETTING IN THE WAY .
UHHUH .
DO DO YOU FEEL AS THOUGH THERE SHOULD BE UH MORE UH WAS OR OR MORE UH YOU MIGHT SAY TRANSGRESSIONS .
THAT WOULD BE ENFORCEABLE BY UH BY UH UH CAPITAL PUNISHMENT .
WELL I THINK THAT CURRENTLY THE WAY .
THE LAW STANDS IS NT SO MUCH THAT THE LAWS ARE ENFORCEABLE OR NOT IT S MORE THEY RE NOT ENFORCING THE DEATH PENALTY .
ITSELF .
IT S AT THAT POINT WHERE THEY RE SAYING LIKE HERE YOU RE YOU RE GOING ON DEATH ROW BUT YOU LL STAY THERE FOR TWENTY YEARS .
UHHUH .
AND NOTHING IS BEING DONE ABOUT IT .
UH THE LAWS EXIST AND MUMBLEX ARE FREQUENTLY UPHELD IN IN UH IN APPEALS COURT JUST BECAUSE OF TECHNICALITIES AND BECAUSE OF MAYBE SMALL LITTLE HOLES THAT THEIR DEFENDING ATTORNEY CAN FIND .
AND IT S IT S REALLY GETTING OUT OF HAND MUMBLEX IN MANY STATES .
WELL THE TERM TECHNICALITY MUMBLEX .
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY .
UH UH YOU KNOW HAS TO HAS TO SEPARATE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOMEBODY .
WHO IS BEING SET UP IN WHICH UH GRIEVOUS ACTS ARE DONE TO UH TO YOU KNOW TO GET SOMEBODY INTO A A SITUATION WHERE THEY RE GOING TO BE GUILTY OF OF A CRIME .
OR WHETHER UH AN AND WHETHER THE RIGHTS OF THAT INDIVIDUAL ARE BEEN HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW IMPUNED .
UH BUT OR WHETHER THERE S JUST YOU KNOW A POLICEMAN HAS JUST MADE A UH A YOU KNOW A NON A NONCRITICAL ERROR THOUGH BE IT NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT BUT BUT YOU KNOW THE THE MERITS OF THE CASE IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW .
THE GUY WAS A LAW BREAKER AS BEING SUPPORTIVE .
NOW I I M A A AT THIS JUNCTURE .
I YOU KNOW I M I M NOT SURE YOU KNOW WHAT CONSTITUTES A A TECHNICALITY .
YOU KNOW THAT THAT S .
WHAT ALL C THESE THESE HEARINGS ARE ABOUT AND THAT S WHAT ALL THESE YOU KNOW COURT CASES ARE ABOUT .
I MEAN OUR UH OUR OUR GLORIOUS UH YOU KNOW MAYOR HERE IN WASHINGTON IS SIX DAYS AWAY FROM GETTING OUT OF OUT OF THE CAN AND UH YOU KNOW HE HE TRIED TO APPEAL HIS CONVICTION .
UH AND YOU KNOW IT DID NT WORK .
BUT BE THAT AS IT MAY EVERYBODY .
WHO GOT ENOUGH MONEY WILL PUMP THE APPEAL PROCESS DRY .
UH IN IN THE OLD DAYS YOU KNOW AND SAY ROUND ABOUT TIMES OF BATTLE OF HASTINGS YOU KNOW AND THE VILLAGES IF YOU WERE A TRANSGRESSOR THEY THEY .
EITHER YOU KNOW DROVE YOU OUT IN THE WOODS OR YOU BECAME A WARD OF SOMEBODY AND HE YOU WERE HIS SLAVE .
AND IF HE DID NT LIKE WHAT .
YOU DID HE KILLED YOU .
AND THAT HAS THAT S PRETTY EFFECTIVE .
UH YOU KNOW IT S NOT GOOD FOR CIVIL RIGHTS I GUESS BUT IT S PRETTY EFFECTIVE IN THAT YOU KNOW YOU VE GOT TO GET ALONG IN THE COMMUNITY AND IF YOU DO NT YOU LL PERISH .
EITHER BY THE HAND OF YOUR YOUR YOUR MASTER OR BY BEING PUSHED OUT IN THE WOODS .
SO I I I MEAN AS AS MAN HAS GOTTEN MORE COMPLICATED SO ALL OF THE UH IMAGINATIONS TO UH YOU KNOW PROTECT HIM FROM FROM BEING UH DUMPED ON BY UH CIVILIAN AUTHORITY IN IN SO IN CRIMINAL ACTIONS ESPECIALLY YOU KNOW MURDER CASES AND THAT SORT OF THING .
WELL IT SEEMS LIKE WELL IT IT SEEMS AS IF IN THE PAST TYPICALLY THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF CASES OF PEOPLE BEING WRONGLY TRIED OR WRONGLY PUNISHED AND THE WHOLE IDEA BEHIND THE CURRENT CRIMINAL PROCESS SYSTEM IS TO PROTECT THOSE .
WHO ACTUALLY DID NT THE CRIMES ALBEIT IT SEEMS THAT WE ARE FAILING IN THAT IN THAT ULTIMATE GOAL BECAUSE THERE ARE TIMES WHEN PEOPLE .
WHO ARE GUILTY ARE GETTING OFF .
UM FOR INSTANCE UM THERE S A CASE .
A FEW YEARS BACK WHERE UH SOMEONE UH SOMEONE .
WHO S BEING CONVICTED FOR WAS UNDER A TRI WAS GOING TO TRIAL FOR MURDER WAS LET OFF BECAUSE OF A TECHNICALITY IN THAT .
THE OF THE ARRESTING OFFICER UH DID NOT READ THE DEFENDANT THEIR RIGHTS .
UHHUH .
AND WHERE HIS .
OLD EVIDENCE WAS THERE THE WITNESSES WERE THERE THE EVERYTHING WAS CONCLUSIVELY POINTING TO THIS INDIVIDUAL YET .
SO HOW YOU LIKE NEW JERSEY .
UH IT S PRETTY GOOD YOU KNOW .
YOU GET UH CLOSER TO THE UH COAST HERE AND YOU DO GET A GOOD BIT OF UH SMOG AND STUFF ESPECIALLY FROM ALL THE UH FUEL CRACKING TOWERS AND CHEMICAL PLANTS .
RIGHT I GUESS UH I DO NT KNOW WHAT PART OF NEW JERSEY YOU RE IN BUT I GUESS IT S UH FAIRLY INDUSTRIAL .
YEAH IT S WHEN YOU GET FURTHER EAST TOWARDS NEW YORK CITY .
IT GETS VERY INDUSTRIAL .
RIGHT UHHUH .
BUT I M I M ABOUT UH THIRTY MILES WEST OF THERE SO YOU HAVE UH ACTUALLY GREEN TREES AND SUCH THAT YOU .
YEAH .
DO NT NOTICE THAT THAT OTHER PART OF .
YEAH .
NEW JERSEY EXISTS .
RIGHT .
ACTUALLY VERY .
Y YOU KNOW YOU GO EVEN A FEW WI MILES OUT AND YOU GOT UH FARMS AND EVERYTHING SO YOU RELATIVELY CLEAR AIR .
RIGHT .
BUT UH .
WELL I DO NT KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I VE ALWAYS CONSIDERED AUTOMOBILES TO BE PROBABLY THE THE PRIME CONTRIBUTOR .
I MEAN THERE S A LOT OF CONTRIBUTORS BUT IT SEEMS THAT AUTOMOBILES WOULD PROBABLY DO MORE THAN THEIR FAIR SHARE OF THAT .
OH D DEFINITELY .
IT .
S .
YEAH .
UH YOU KNOW THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF THEM ON THE ROAD .
THEY RE ALL YOU KNOW GOING AND A LOT OF THEM ARE IN RELATIVELY POOR REPAIR .
THAT S YEAH THAT S THAT S A BIG ISSUE IS YOU KNOW A LOT OF STATES DO NT HAVE A UH INSPECTION LAW SO YOU GET YOU GET A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WITHOUT E T R EMISSION CONTROL SYSTEMS ON THEIR CARS AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
OH E EVEN WHERE YOU DO HAVE THE INSPECTIONS YOU KNOW THE INSPECTION IS ONCE A YEAR .
YEAH AND IT S LIKE .
YOU GET THE CAR .
THAT S IN THE ACCIDENT AND MUFFLER FALLS OFF OR SOMETHING .
SURE .
AND GUY KEEPS DRIVING ALONG FOR LONG PERIOD OF TIME AFTER THAT .
RIGHT .
I GUESS FROM WHAT .
I HEAR THOUGH UH NEXT YEAR FORD IS COMING OUT WITH THEIR ELECTRIC CARS .
THEY RE ACTUALLY COMING OUT WITH THE FIRST PROTOTYPES IN CALIFORNIA .
YEAH THAT AND I THINK ALSO SOME OF THE UH CAR COMPANIES ARE COMING OUT WITH UH GAS POWERED FLEETS .
YEAH .
SO YOU NATURAL GAS POWERED RATHER THAN UH GASOLINE .
RIGHT .
I HOPE I I M HOPING THAT COMES ALONG QUICK .
UH I WAS READING A AN ARTICLE IN TIME .
THE OTHER DAY ABOUT THE OZONE LAYER AND HOW FAST THAT S GOING AND I GUESS IT S IT S REALLY DISAPPEARING A LOT QUICKER THAN PEOPLE REALIZE AND I KNOW THAT S NOT DUE TO UH IT S NOT DUE TO TO GASOLINE OR TO YOU KNOW CARBON MONOXIDE SO MUCH AS THE C F C S BUT .
IT IT IS COMING FROM CARS THOUGH .
UH YEAH I THINK THAT S A THAT S A CONTRIBUTOR DEFINITELY .
I MEAN THE UH CAR AIR CONDITIONERS IS .
RIGHT .
ONE OF THE MAJOR LEAKING SOURCES OF UH THE UH FREON .
RIGHT .
WHICH IS ONE OF THE MAJOR FLOR CHLOROFAR FLUOROCARBONS .
YEAH I GUESS RIGHT NOW WHAT .
THEY RE WHAT .
THEY RE PRIMARILY WORRIED ABOUT IS THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES BECAUSE I GUESS UNITED STATES AND AND RUSSIA HAVE KIND OF TAKEN THE LEAD IN TERMS OF ELIMINATING C F C PRODUCTION BUT .
WELL IT IT .
IT GO AHEAD .
NO IT S IT S THE TYPE OF THING THERE THAT UH YOU KNOW THE THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES ARE LESS INDUSTRIAL AND THEY WANT TO BECOME INDUSTRIAL .
UHHUH .
SO THEY RE ON THE DIFFERENT PART OF THE CYCLE OF THE U S .
THE U S USED YOU KNOW ALL THE AIR POLLUTION STUFF AND AIR POLLUTING TECHNOLOGIES TO GET WHERE IT IS TODAY .
RIGHT .
AND THAT S ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT THE THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN USING IS THAT BASICALLY THEY DO NT WANT TO HAVE TO PAY FOR OUR MISTAKES IF IF THAT MAKES ANY SENSE .
UH IN TERMS OF .
OR OR THEY WANT THE RIGHT TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES THEMSELVES TO BOOTSTRAP .
THEM UP TO THE WAY WHERE WE .
EXACTLY .
GOT TO .
EXACTLY .
UH THOSE OF KIND OF YEAH THOSE ARE JOINING ARGUMENTS BUT UH I DO NT KNOW THAT S THAT S KIND OF AN INTERESTING SITUATION THERE .
UH WHAT .
THEY DO NT REALIZE THOSE THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES WHAT .
THEY DO NT REALIZE IS HOW QUICKLY THE OZONE IS DEPLETING .
I GUESS THE LATEST FIGURES ARE UP TO FIFTY PERCENT AT THE POLES AND IT S IT S INCREASING EVEN AS FAR NEAR THE EQUATOR AS LIKE FLORIDA AND CUBA AND THOSE PLACES .
YEAH .
SO IT S KIND OF AN INTERESTING SITUATION .
IT S NOT NOT A REAL GOOD ONE ACTUALLY .
NO .
BUT .
WELL YOU ALSO HAVE THE VERY CLOSE RELATED THING OF THE UH RAIN FOREST DESTRUCTION .
YEAH .
WHICH IS THE MAIN SOURCE OF WHAT S CLEARING OUT THE ATMOSPHERE AND .
UHHUH YEAH .
REPLACING SOME OF THE POLLUTANTS .
YEAH YOU DO NT GET THAT THAT SOURCE OF CLEANSING ANYMORE .
ARE HAVE YOU BEEN IN BIG CITIES .
A LONG TIME .
MOSTLY I VE MOSTLY BEEN IN THE EAST COAST SO THAT S GOING BETWEEN ATLANTA WASHING D C AREA .
OKAY SO YOU VE GOT .
A .
YEAH THOSE ARE ACTUALLY AREAS .
THAT ARE HIT PRETTY HARD I WOULD THINK .
WELL NOT NOT AS HARD AS SOME PLACES OUT WEST BECAUSE YOU DO NT GET THE UH MAJOR POLLUTION SOURCES AS YOU DO OUT IN DENVER WITH THE .
YEAH DENVER S DEFINITELY .
INVERSION .
YEAH THAT S ONE OF THE WORST .
AND LOS ANGELES AND A REST OF CALIFORNIA .
WHICH IS JUST TERRIBLE IT SOUNDS .
SURE .
YEAH DENVER S THAT THAT REAL GOOD E THAT REAL GOOD UH EXAMPLE OF SITTING IN A VALLEY KIND OF LIKE MEXICO CITY DOES I GUESS .
UHHUH .
MEXICO CITY IS HISTORICALLY BEEN ONE OF THE WORST .
YEAH .
IN THE IN THE WORLD FOR THAT .
BUT I VE BEEN PRETTY LUCKY I VE LIVED IN CITIES .
THAT REALLY HAVE NT HAD THAT MUCH OF A PROBLEM ALTHOUGH UH I M REALLY KIND OF BASED IN ORLANDO FLORIDA AND THERE YOU CAN TELL THAT IT S GETTING WORSE .
I MEAN IT IT DEFINITELY IT S NOT AT A LEVEL COMPARABLE TO LOS ANGELES OR DENVER BUT YOU CAN .
YEAH THERE IT S ALMOST ALL AUTOMOBILES BECAUSE THERE S NOT THAT MUCH IN THE WAY OF .
EXACTLY .
HEAVY INDUSTRY YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE CAUSING IT .
YEAH .
AND THERE S NOT THAT MUCH IN TERMS OF OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION DOWN THERE .
UHHUH .
THERE IS BUT IT S KIND OF IT S .
SO UH DO YOU HAPPEN TO BE WORKING FOR A LARGE FIRM .
WELL IT S ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PEOPLE .
I GUESS THAT S NOT LARGE COMPARED TO SOME BUT IT S BIG ENOUGH .
UHHUH .
AND THEY HAVE A THEY DO NT HAVE ANY KIND OF PENSION PLAN WHERE THEY CONTRIBUTE ANYTHING AND I WISH THEY DID .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW THEY HAVE A FOUR O ONE K BUT I PUT ALL THE MONEY INTO IT .
UHHUH .
THEY DO NT ADD ANYTHING .
WHAT ABOUT YOU .
UH I WORK FOR A FAIRLY LARGE COMPANY .
IT .
S GOT EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
AND UH WE DO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE .
WE DO NT HAVE FOUR O K ONE K PLAN STUFF LIKE THAT BUT WE DO HAVE LIKE RETIREMENT .
THEY .
KIND OF MATCH UP TO YOU IF YOU PUT SIX PERCENT THEY MATCH UP TO SIX PERCENT AND THEN THE REST IS WHATEVER .
YOU WANT TO PUT IN .
IF YOU PUT MORE THAN THAT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
OH THAT S A PRETTY GOOD DEAL .
IT S NOT BAD .
NOW HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION TO VEST .
GOD I DO NT KNOW .
IT S PROBABLY A LONG TIME .
I M SURE IT S NOT TILL LIKE TWENTYFIVE YEARS THIRTY YEARS .
YEAH THE PLACE .
I WORK AT S HEALTH INSURANCE IS KIND OF EXPENSIVE .
IT .
S LIKE HUNDRED BUCKS .
A A MONTH OR SOMETHING .
YEAH .
FOR A FAMILY .
HUH WELL I GUESS WHAT .
WE HAVE IS LIKE A F WHAT .
THEY CALL A FLEX BENEFITS PLAN WHERE YOU YOU GET LIKE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DOLLARS AND THEN YOU SPEND IT ON A CAFETERIA OF WHATEVER .
YOU WANT OR NEED .
OTHERWISE YOU CAN UH GUESS YOU CAN PUT ALSO PUT MONEY HOLD MONEY BACK AND THEN EITHER USE OR LOSE IT AND THAT DOES NT GET TAXED OR CAN JUST HAVE THAT MONEY YOU KNOW PUT IN YOUR PAYCHECK .
YEAH WE HAVE ONE OF THOSE USE IT OR LOSE IT PLANS TOO WHERE UH THEY LL BASICALLY PAY FOR UH YOU KNOW CHILD CARE TYPE UH EXPENSES .
I CAN SEND IN A UH CAN SEND IN A REQUEST FOR PAYMENT AND THEY LL UH AND THEY LL SEND ME YOU KNOW A CHECK FOR THE AMOUNT .
THEY WITHHELD .
THAT S PRETTY GOOD YOU KNOW .
IT .
S UH IT SAVES A THIRD OFF ON TAXES OR SOMETHING .
YEAH WELL IT DEPENDS ON WHICH COMPANY .
YOU WORK FOR .
I KNOW THAT LIKE THE THE THE ONE PLAN THAT EVERYONE SEEMS TO BE IN IN MY PLACE IS UH YOU KNOW YOU UH THINK YOU CALL IT PLAN D .
DEDUCTIBLES ARE REALLY HIGH IT .
S LIKE FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS BUT IF YOU GO FOR THE OTHER ONES YOU RE PAYING TOO MUCH MONEY FOR THEM BECAUSE IT S UNLIKELY IF YOU RE F RELATIVELY UH HEALTHY THEN IT S REALLY UNLIKELY THAT YOU D USE THAT MUCH AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU KNOW .
SO THE IT YOU KNOW SOMEONE DID START A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS AND ENDS UP THE BEST IS TO TAKE A HIGH DEDUCTIBLE AND AND TAKE A LOSS WHAT WHATEVER .
IT HAPPENS TO BE IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE A HEALTHY INDIVIDUAL .
YEAH I GUESS UH ON THE OTHER HAND YOU KNOW I I HAD A SIMILAR HAD A SIMILAR HEALTH PLAN AND UH ONE OF MY KIDS WAS IN A CAR ACCIDENT AND UH .
UM .
I HAD WOUND UP HAVING TO PAY FOR YOU KNOW A BUNCH OF DOCTOR VISITS AND STUFF OUT OF MY POCKET BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW NO NO INSURANCE POLICY HAPPENED TO COVER IT WHICH IS .
REALLY .
YOU MEAN NOT EVEN YOUR YOUR YOUR CAR INSURANCE .
WELL IT IT GOT ALL SCREWED UP BECAUSE I HAD A HIGH DEDUCTIBLE ON THE HEALTH INSURANCE NO FAULT HERE AND AND I HAD A HIGH DEDUCTIBLE ON THE ON THE UH ON THE C CAR INSURANCE AND THEN S YOU KNOW WE JUST GOOFED UP THE MEDICAL INSURANCE AND THE CAR INSURANCE AND STUFF AND BLEW IT .
OH THAT S TOO BAD .
OH WELL .
YEAH UH WELL I DO NT KNOW I THINK OTHER THAN HEALTH INSURANCE I THINK UH YOU KNOW AN EXTRA WEEK OF UH TIME OFF WOULD BE NICE .
I ONLY GET TWO WEEKS .
YEAH YEAH MY PLACE .
YOU GET TWO WEEKS WHEN YOU START AND THEN EVERY EVERY YEAR .
THEY GIVE YOU .
AN EXTRA DAY UNTIL YOU VE GOT FOUR WEEKS .
OH THAT S NICE .
WE DO NT GET THEM TILL TILL YOUR SEVENTH YEAR OF SERVICE TILL .
AYE .
YOU GET AN EXTRA WEEK .
THAT S A LONG TIME .
YEAH IT S UH .
YEAH ESPECIALLY IN THE KIND OF ENGINEERING JOB .
I M IN YOU KNOW COMPANIES DO NT STAY AFLOAT THAT LONG AND AND THEY .
UH WITH THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS TYPE OF COMPANY SUPPOSEDLY YOU USED TO BE MUCH MORE STABLE .
IT S A LOT LESS STABLE THAN IT USED TO BE .
THEY USED TO HAVE JOB SECURITY CRAP BUT NOW THEY DO NT .
SO YOU WORK FOR BELL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
YEAH IT S THE BELL CORPS WHICH IS UH .
RIGHT .
YEAH .
RIGHT .
SO I DO NT KNOW IT S IT S UH NO LONGER .
SO THAT S WHAT I THINK IT S STILL BASED ON THE OLD MODEL OF AND AND NOW THEY DO NT UH .
A LIFELONG JOB SECURITY TELEPHONE .
YEAH .
PIONEERS OF AMERICA ALL THAT STUFF HUH .
YEAH BUT THEY NO NO LONGER .
I DO NT THINK SO .
RIGHT .
UH HEARING A LO THERE S ALWAYS THEY RE ALWAYS LAYING PEOPLE OFF WHICH IS ANOTHER BENEFIT THAT YOU CAN HAVE OTHER THAN SALARY IS TRADE THAT OFF FOR SECURITY .
IS IT I MEAN DOES IT THEY MUST HAVE PRETTY GOOD SEVERANCE THOUGH HUH .
OH I DO NT KNOW WE DO NT WE HAVE NT BEEN DOING LAYOFFS .
WE VE BEEN DOING UH DOWN SIZING WITH UH GETTING RID OF EXTRA LAYERS OF MANAGEMENT .
AND UH I DO NT KNOW WHAT .
THEY DO FOR THOSE PEOPLE .
MEAN THE THE THE MANAGEMENT .
THEY GET RID OF .
SOME OF IT YEAH .
UM .
THERE S TOO MANY MANAGE TOO MANY CHIEFS AND NOT ENOUGH INDIANS BUT .
OH THEY THEY PUT .
HAVE YOU HAD THAT EXPERIENCE RECENTLY .
RECENTLY I CA NT REALLY SAY RECENTLY .
BUT I THINK ABOUT UH ABOUT A YEAR AGO UH I BOUGHT A PRODUCT FROM SOME COMPANY DOWN AT UH IN ATLANTA GEORGIA .
I BELIEVE IT WAS ONE OF THESE UH ONE OF THESE UH MIXERS .
THESE LIKE THESE JUICE MACHINES AND UH .
OH YEAH .
THE UH THE BLADE .
THEY SENT ME AT FIRST .
THAT WENT INTO THE MACHINE IT LOOKED YOU KNOW PERFECTLY OKAY BUT I FOUND THAT UH IT WAS MADE OF SOME MATERIAL .
WHICH ACTUALLY ENDED UP RUSTING .
OH .
UH AFTER EVEN DESPITE YOU KNOW DILIGENT WASHING IT IT GOT RUSTY AFTER ABOUT UH THREE WEEKS OF USE .
AND I DO NT THINK IT WAS MY FAULT BECAUSE I I YOU KNOW I HAD MADE A POINT OF LIKE DRYING IT OFF AND CLEANING IT BUT UH IT WAS REALLY UH IT WAS I HAD TO SEND IT BACK AFTER LIKE YOU KNOW THE THIRD WEEK BECAUSE I REALIZED IT WAS LIKE IT WAS NOT SOMETHING WAS VERY VERY WRONG WITH THE BLADE .
UH WHAT ABOUT YOU .
WELL I DO NT HAVE SO MUCH TROUBLE WITH PRODUCTS AS SERVICE .
UHHUH .
I DO NT FEEL LIKE THAT S AS BIG A PROBLEM .
I VE HAD A FEW ANSWERING MACHINES OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS JUST BECAUSE I VE HAD A LOT OF TROUBLE WITH THEM WORKING CORRECTLY .
UHHUH .
AND I M NOT CONVINCED THAT ANY OF THEM WORK A HUNDRED PERCENT .
UHHUH .
UH THE ONE .
I HAVE NOW IS OKAY MOST OF THE TIME .
UHHUH .
BUT THAT S IT .
BUT THAT S THAT S PROBABLY THE WORST .
MY DAUGHTER HAS A CHARM BRACELET .
I BOUGHT HER THAT S GUARANTEED .
UH JAMES AVERY .
I DO NT KNOW IF YOU HAVE THAT UP THERE BUT IT IT S A VERY GOOD COMPANY .
THAT .
UHHUH .
SELLS STERLING SILVER THINGS AND .
UHHUH .
UH SHE HAS A CHARM BRACELET WITH LOTS OF CHARMS ON IT A LOT OF MONEY INTO IT BY NOW .
UHHUH .
AND THE CATCH BROKE AND SHE WAS SITTING IN SCHOOL ON A CARPET AND WHEN SHE STOOD UP IT CAUGHT AND BROKE AND WE TOOK IT BACK AND THEY SAID OH THIS WAS JUST OBVIOUSLY YANKED .
UHHUH .
THIS WAS YANKED .
I MEAN THEY WERE SO RUDE ABOUT IT .
RIGHT .
AND SO WE WANTED A DIFFERENT KIND OF CATCH AND SHE SAID WELL IT S NOT GUARANTEED .
AND I SAID WELL PUT IT ON BECAUSE APPARENTLY NOTHING S GUARANTEED SO DO IT ANYWAY .
UHHUH .
SO WE GOT THE KIND .
WE WANTED AND I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THAT .
I FELT THAT THIS WAS A COMPANY .
THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE RELIABLE .
UHHUH .
AND I HAPPENED TO NEED A BIRTHDAY PRESENT FOR ONE OF HER FRIENDS AND I CALLED THERE TO SEE IF THEY HAD IT AND THE LADY WAS VERY NICE .
AND I SAID MY GOODNESS I SAID YOU VE BEEN VERY NICE WHAT S YOUR NAME .
AND SHE TOLD ME AND I SAID WELL I REALLY APPRECIATE IT .
I SAID THERE SEEMS TO BE A BIG ATTITUDE PROBLEM IN THAT .
STORE AND IT TURNED OUT SHE WAS THE ASSISTANT MANAGER SO .
WELL AT LEAST YOUR TALKING TO SOMEBODY .
WHO COUNTS .
RIGHT .
SO I FELT KIND OF GOOD ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW .
I DID NT .
UHHUH .
EVEN KNOW THE PERSON S NAME .
THAT HAD GIVEN ME .
THE HARD TIME OR ANYTHING .
RIGHT .
BUT I JUST FELT LIKE WELL AT LEAST I DID SOMETHING .
MAYBE THEY LL FIX IT .
THEY MIGHT WORK ON THAT YOU KNOW .
RIGHT RIGHT .
BUT I FIND ATTITUDES ARE MORE OF A PROBLEM .
SERVICE IS MORE OF A PROBLEM .
I FIND UP HERE IN THE NORTHEAST WE HAVE UH WELL W WE HAVE THESE MAIL ORDER COMPANIES LIKE L L BEAN AND UH THEY ARE FAMOUS FOR I GUESS HAVING REALLY TOPNOTCH SERVICE .
THEY VE GOT UH .
REALLY .
I MEAN I VE I VE I I HAVE FRIENDS AND FAMILY .
WHO ORDER FROM THEM BECAUSE YOU CAN YOU CAN LITERALLY I VE HEARD STORIES WHERE YOU CAN LITERALLY BUY SOMETHING FROM THEM .
ONE YEAR WEAR IT FOR A YEAR AND A HALF AND EVEN AFTER LIKE EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF YOU KNOW REASONABLY SATISFACTORY USE THEY WILL ACCEPT IT IN ANY CONDITION AND THEY WILL GLADLY NO QUESTIONS ASKED TAKE IT BACK IF FOR SOME BIZARRE REASON .
YOU DECIDE YOU DO NT WANT IT ANYMORE .
UH THEY LL THEY LL ACTUALLY DO THINGS LIKE THIS .
I MEAN THEY RE REALLY THEY THEY GO BEND OVER BACKWARDS SERVICE WISE FOR YOU .
I VE UH .
THAT S REALLY GREAT .
I VE FOUND ALSO A LOT OF COMPANIES NOWADAYS HAVE THEY HAVE EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBERS YOU CAN CALL .
I GUESS IF IF YOU CALL THE E ANY EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER UH IF YOU YOU CAN CALL UP E ANY EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE AND YOU CAN GET UH THE EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER OF THE CUSTOMER SERVICE SUPPORT LINE FOR A NUMBER OF COMPANIES .
AND UM ACTUALLY I VE TRIED THAT WITH A FEW COMPANIES LATELY .
AND THEY VE MOST OF THEM HAVE BEEN PRETTY GOOD BUT I I WAS ONE REASON WHY I LIKE I BUY A LOT OF CLOTHING THROUGH MAIL ORDER IS THAT UH IF YOU BUY THROUGH BEAN OR THOUGH UH I GUESS BEAN S ONE OF BEAN S BIG COMPETITORS IS LAND S END OUT IN UH I GUESS IT .
S WISCONSIN SOMEWHERE .
THEY THEY ARE UH THEY RE VERY GOOD ABOUT .
HUH .
UH INSUR LIKE THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT AND YOU KNOW NO MATTER HOW CRABBY YOU MIGHT BE OVER THE PHONE THEY ARE VERY UNDERSTANDING AND UH THEY USUALLY GET YOU KNOW THEY THEY MAKE THINGS ARE THEY MA MAKE SURE THINGS ARE SET PROPERLY IF YOU RE ANY WAY DISSATISFIED WITH THEIR MERCHANDISE .
THAT S REALLY GOOD .
IT USE TO BE LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
BUT .
I DO NT THINK MOST PLACES ARE LIKE THAT ANYMORE .

UHHUH .
THAT I THINK UM I DO NT KNOW .
IT S AN INTERESTING PROBLEM .
I HAPPEN TO UM I M A PEDIATRICIAN .
OH .
MY HUSBAND IS A PHYSICIAN SO UH I I MUMBLEX I TALK TO PARENTS ABOUT THIS A LOT .
BUT CHILDREN I I THINK WORKING MOTHERS OR MOTHERS .
WHO CHOOSE TO WORK OUTSIDE THE HOME UM NEED VERY EARLY TO COME TO GRIPS WITH ANY GUILT .
YEAH .
THAT THEY FEEL AND DECIDE WHAT S BEST FOR THEM AND THEIR FAMILY .
UHHUH .
AND I FEEL WHEN MY CHILDREN WERE VERY YOUNG I HAD JOBS .
THAT HELPED ME BE FLEXIBLE WITH MY SCHEDULE AND SPEND TIME WITH THEM AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING .
AND I LONG AGO DECIDED I M A BETTER MOTHER BECAUSE I WORK OUTSIDE THE HOME .
UHHUH .
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT .
AND IT HAS UM HELPED US TO AFFORD SOME THINGS FOR OUR CHILDREN THAT WE COULD NT OTHERWISE THAT I THINK ARE WONDERFUL PARTICULARLY AT THIS AGE AND I THINK OUR KIDS ARE REAL SECURE .
UHHUH .
AND HAVE A REAL SENSE OF PRIORITIES AND THAT THEY CAN DO ANYTHING AND BE ANYTHING .
BOTH MALE AND FEMALE .

UHHUH .
UM AND I THINK WE CHOOSE VERY VERY CAREFULLY THE UM ALTERNATIVE SITUATIONS THAT WE HAD THEM IN .
UHHUH .
SOME BABYSITTING GROUPS AGAIN I KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE A RATIONALIZATION BUT I REALLY DO THINK SOMETIMES THEY VERY EARLY ON ARE AROUND LOTS OF OTHER CHILDREN AND THEY THEY LEARN TO SHARE .
THEY LEARN NOT NECESSARILY TO BE THE CENTER OF ATTENTION BUT THAT AT THE SAME TIME .
WE HAVE TO BE SURE THEY ARE SECURE .
UHHUH .
I THINK THAT HELPS .

ALL THIS PLANNING AND AND GETTING TOGETHER AND SUCH .
UM OH LET S SEE WHAT ELSE .
USUALLY WHEN WE HAVE KIND OF OUR FAMILY REUNION .
IT .
S MY GRANDMOTHER S BIRTHDAY AND .
UHHUH .
AND IT S ALL OF LIKE SHE SHE COMES FROM A BIG FAMILY .
SHE HAS LIKE SEVEN SISTERS I THINK .
OH BOY .
THEY SHOW UP AND ALL THEIR KIDS .
AND THEN ALL SHE HAS UH I HAVE LIKE UH LET S SEE SHE HAS FOUR SONS AND TWO DAUGHTERS AND .
UHHUH .
THEY SHOW UP AND ALL THEIR KIDS SO IT S A PRETTY BIG REUNION IT S ABOUT TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE MAYBE .
OH MY WORD .
WELL WHAT DID YOU FIND WAS MOST HELPFUL IN PLANNING THE BIRTHDAY GET TOGETHER .
UM THE PROBABLY THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE WAS GETTING A PLACE WHERE EVERYONE YOU KNOW COULD EAT COMFORTABLY AND AND EVERYTHING UH .
UHHUH .
I GUESS PROBABLY THE MOST HELPFUL THING WAS THAT UM FOR THE RENT WE RENTED LIKE A A RESCUE SQUAD BUILDING OR SOMETHING .
OH .
LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
AND UH EACH ONE OF THE EVERYBODY .
THAT SHOWED UP DONATED SOME MONEY FOR THE RENT AND FOR FOR LIKE SOFT DRINKS AND .
OH .
AND SO NOBODY LIKE REALLY GOT STUCK WITH THE BILL .
OH THAT S GOOD .
AND EACH PERSON IN THE FAMILY YOU KNOW BROUGHT A DISH OR SOMETHING .
UHHUH AND THEN DID YOU HAVE A MAIN MEAL OR DID EVERYONE JUST BRING IT WAS JUST POT LUCK .
IT WAS KIND OF POT LUCK .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW EVERYBODY BROUGHT THEIR SPECIALTIES I GUESS YOU WOULD SAY .
YEAH YEAH SHOW OFF A LITTLE BIT .
YEAH .
AND OF COURSE MY GRANDMOTHER S FOOD WAS AS ALWAYS GONE FIRST .
OH .
BECAUSE SHE S SUCH A GREAT COOK .
OH .
NOW HOW OLD IS SHE .
UH SHE S EIGHTYSIX .
OH GOODNESS .
IS SHE PRETTY SPRY IS SHE YOU KNOW PRETTY .
NOW SHE DOES SHE LOOKS PROBABLY LIKE SHE S IN HER EARLY SIXTIES .
OH WOW .
AND IF SHE DID NT HAVE ARTHRITIS SHE D GET AROUND BETTER .
UHHUH .
THAN ME AS A MATTER OF FACT .
OH .
OH THAT S NEAT THAT SHE S IN GOOD HEALTH AND THAT AT THAT AGE .
YEAH .
OH YEAH .
MY NICKNAME FOR HER IS HONEY WOMAN .
THAT S WHAT .
I CALL HER .
REALLY .
WELL THAT SOUNDS FUN .
WELL I .
I HAD A REAL CHALLENGE OF PLANNING A FAMILY REUNION .
A FEW YEARS AGO AND THERE WERE WE SENT OUT FIVE HUNDRED UH ANNOUNCEMENTS BECAUSE OUR FAMILY IS QUITE LARGE LIKE YOUR YOUR FAMILY THERE .
AND SO THAT WAS A REAL CHALLENGE AND I WAS PRESIDENT OF OUR FAMILY REUNION FOR TWO YEARS AND I WAS NT VERY MUMBLEX AT THAT DUTY FOR TWO YEARS IN A ROW BUT I FOUND THAT ADVANCE PLANNING WAS THE KEY TO SUCCESS .
UH ALSO ONE THING .
THAT S HELPFUL AND I DO NT KNOW IF YOUR FAMILY S SPREAD OUT OR WHATEVER .
UHHUH .
BUT MOST OF ALL MY FAMILY LIVES LIKE IN THE SAME COUNTY SO .
OH THAT S WONDERFUL THOUGH .
BUT IT S JUST KIND OF LIKE GET ON THE TELEPHONE AND .
IT S SO AND SUCH DAYS FROM SUCH AND SUCH DATE .
OH .
AND EVERYBODY JUST SHOWS UP .
OH WELL THAT IS THAT IS HELPFUL .
YEAH OUR FAMILY RANGES FROM OH GOODNESS WELL AUSTRALIA I HAVE A BROTHER LIVES IN AUSTRALIA TO UH BOISE IDAHO AND AND UH ALL KINDS OF PLACES .
I WOULD SAY YOU RE SPREAD OUT THEN .
WE ARE .
UH MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY YOU KNOW MY MY PARENTS AND MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS I GUESS WE RE THE ONES .
THAT HAVE THE GYPSY BLOOD OR WHATEVER BECAUSE MY DAD WAS IN THE ARMY AND WE RE .
OH .
WE RE PRETTY STRUNG OUT ALL OVER .
BUT SINCE THEY VE MOVED BACK TO CAROLINA S WE STILL ARE THE ONLY ONES DO NOT LIVE IN .
IN .
IN YANTSEN COUNTY .
OH .
I LIVE IN RALEIGH AND THEN MY MY PARENTS LIVE IN GREENVILLE AND I HAVE ONE BROTHER AND HIS WIFE .
UHHUH .
LIVE IN GREENVILLE AND UH ANOTHER BROTHER .
THAT LIVES IN OUTSIDE OF FAYETTEVILLE .
SO I MEAN WE RE WE RE SPREAD OUT BUT .
BOY .
EVERYBODY ELSE IS CENTRALIZED IN IN MY HOME TOWN WAYNESBORO SO .
OH MY GOSH .
NOBODY MOVES AWAY EXCEPT US .
THEY MUST REALLY LIKE IT THERE .
YEAH I GOT OUT AS SOON AS I GRADUATED .
YEAH .
OH .
JUST LIKE THIS TOWN IS TOO SMALL FOR ME GOODBYE .
OH YOU RE READY TO MOVE ON TO BI .
SO UH YOU KNOW MY FEELING IS THAT UH IT S REALLY BEING USED TODAY IT IT YOU KNOW IT IT REALLY IS NT DOING ANY REAL GOOD PURPOSE FOR ANYTHING BECAUSE IT S NOT COST EFFECTIVE BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF TIME .
THE PEOPLE END UP WAITING ON APPEAL .
RIGHT I THINK I VE SEEN SOME STATISTICS .
THAT SAY THAT UH IT S MORE EXPENSIVE TO KILL SOMEBODY THAN TO KEEP THEM IN PRISON FOR LIFE .
RIGHT BECAUSE Y YOU YOU VE GOT ALL ALL THE PRISON EXPENSES PLUS ALL THE LEGAL EXPENSES .
RIGHT .
UH AND YOU KNOW IT CERTAINLY DOES NT SEEM TO BE A DETERRENT .
UH FOR ONE THING BECAUSE IT S USED SO INFREQUENTLY AND FOR ANOTHER THING BECAUSE I HONESTLY DO NT THINK THE PEOPLE .
THAT ARE COMMITTING THE C CRIMES .
THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE YOU KNOW REALLY CARE .
WELL THAT S COMMITTING THEM MOSTLY IS YOU KNOW EITHER CRIMES OF PASSION OR AT THE MOMENT OR THEY THINK THEY RE NOT GOING TO GET CAUGHT OR .
RIGHT I MEAN IT S KIND OF LIKE THE AIDS PHENOMENON YOU KNOW I M INVULNERABLE I DO NT NEED TO CARE ABOUT THIS .
YOU KNOW I I I M .
YEAH B .
NEVER GOING TO GET CAUGHT .
YEAH BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO THINK WHETHER IT S WORTHWHILE ON THE INDIVIDUAL BASIS FOR EXAMPLE SOMEONE LIKE UH JEFFREY DAHLMER DO YOU WANT BY PUTTING HIM IN PRISON FOR LIFE THERE IS STILL A POSSIBILITY THAT HE WILL GET OUT AGAIN .
YEAH ONE ONE .
WHEREAS .
WAY OR ANOTHER .
IF YOU KILL HIM THERE IS NOT THAT POSSIBILITY .
YEAH BUT BUT THE OTHER SIDE TO THAT IS IF YOU PUT HIM IN PRISON FOR LIFE THERE S A CHANCE THAT HE MIGHT DO THINGS IN PRISON OR YOU KNOW AND SOMEHOW REDEEM HIMSELF .
YEAH I DO NT THINK HE COULD EVER REDEEM HIMSELF BUT .
WELL .
IN SOME CASES YES .
YOU KNOW SO THAT YOU KNOW THE THE QUESTION IS YOU KNOW THE OTHER QU PROBLEM WITH CAPITAL PUNISHMENT .
YOU RUN INTO IS WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT PEOPLE .
WHO ARE LATER TO HAVE BEEN FOUND INNOCENT YOU KNOW .
THERE ARE CASES WHERE YOU KNOW TWENTY THIRTY YEARS AFTER THE FACT OF GETTING EVIDENCE ESPECIALLY AS NEW TECHNOLOGY COMES ALONG THAT MIGHT PROVE THEIR INNOCENCE THEN OOPS I M SORRY GUESS WE KILLED THE WRONG GUY .
YEAH IT S IT S YEAH ONCE YOU VE MADE A DECISION .
THAT WAY IT S A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO GO BACK ON IT .
RIGHT YOU YOU CAN APOLOGIZE NICELY BUT YOU KNOW YOU KNOW I THINK YOU KNOW THE THE PRICE YOU KNOW IT I VE HEARD QUOTES YOU KNOW IT S BETTER THAT A THOUSAND PEOPLE GO FREE THAN ONE PERSON BE UNJUSTLY IMPRISONED .
I THINK I IS REALLY THE THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE WAY OUR LEGAL SYSTEM WORKS .
OH YEAH YEAH IT S A THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT TO THE LAST IOTA IS UH BASED ON THE UH PERSON .
WHO IS ACCUSED .
YEAH AND YOU KNOW THE I I THINK THAT YOU KNOW AND THE WAY .
IT S BEING USED NOW IT S LIKE YOU LISTEN TO BUSH IS YOU KNOW WELL WHERE ARE WE GOING TO IMPOSE D YOU KNOW IT S LIKE FOR DRUG DEALERS IS THE NEW BIG THING LIKE IN TSONGAS IS ALSO SAYING YOU KNOW CAPITAL MAKE IT .
A CAPITAL CRIME TO BE A MAJOR DRUG DEALER .
RIGHT .
AND AGAIN I DO NT THING THESE PEOPLE CARE .
THEY RISK THEIR LIVES .
EVERY DAY .
YEAH AND THERE THERE THEY SEEM THAT THE PROFIT MARG UH DRUG DEALERS THE PROFIT MARGIN S SO HIGH THAT YEAH .
YEAH .
THE THE RISK IS ALMOST NOT THERE .
YEAH AND AND YOU KNOW UH ESPECIALLY NOW I LIVE IN IN MASSACHUSETTS YOU KNOW W W WE RE GOING TO GET CAPITAL PUNISHMENT HERE PROBABLY AFTER THE SECOND COMING OR SOMETHING .
YEAH .
SO YOU KNOW BUT YOU LOOK AT OUR OUR CRIME RATES AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND YOU COMPARE THEM TO TO LIKE TEXAS OR SOMEPLACE .
THAT DOES YOU KNOW IT IT IT S IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE A CASE THAT IT S IT S AFFECTING IT IN ANY WAY .
YEAH .
I THINK IT S MAINLY PEOPLE LIKE THEY GET THE VENGEANCE OF IT .
YEAH WELL .
BECAUSE YOU KNOW .
IT S ALSO I USED TO LIVE IN GEORGIA AND YOU KNOW THE THE BIG THING DOWN THERE WAS ALL RIGHT WE HAVE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT BUT IF YOU LOOK AT WHO GETS ACCUSED AND WHO ARE THE ONES .
WHO ACTUALLY GET EXECUTED IT S VERY RACIALLY RELATED .
OH YEAH .
AND ETHNICALLY RELATED .
IT S MAINL LOT OF BLACKS .
ALSO A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE .
YOU KNOW A A A SIXTYTWO YEAR OLD GUY IS LESS LIKELY TO BE PUT ON DEATH ROW FROM WHAT .
I VE SEEN .
RIGHT .
AND YOU KNOW I I THINK WHEN YOU LISTEN TO LIKE THE UH THE THE VICTIMS FAMILIES AND THINGS THEY RE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW UH FEELING JUSTIFIED OR FEELING YOU KNOW LIKE THEY VE GOTTEN SOMETHING OUT OF IT I MEAN MY THOUGHT HAS BEEN ONCE THE GUY HAS BEEN IMPRISONED IF HE GOES TO JAIL FOREVER OR WHATEVER IF HE GETS KILLED IT SHOULD NT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THE UH THE VICTIM S FAMILY .
THE ONLY THING .
THAT SHOULD REALLY I MEAN OBVIOUSLY IF SOMEONE OF MINE .
WHO HAS CLOSE DIED I D PROBABLY FEEL DIFFERENTLY BUT .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW TH YOU KNOW WHAT THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT THEY BE CAUGHT AND NOT BE A DANGER TO SOCIETY .
RIGHT AND THAT AND YOU KNOW ALSO BY KEEPING THEM IN PRISON YOU DO HAVE THE POSSIBILITY THOUGH WE DO NT CURRENTLY DO THIS OF MAKING RESTITUTION .
RIGHT I MEAN THE .
YOU YOU WILL WORK YOUR PRISON JOB AND ANY MONEY .
YOU EARN WILL GO TO THE VICTIM S FAMILY .
RIGHT AND THE THE OTHER THING IS THAT YOU KNOW I WAS READING THROUGH A BOOK ON UH GENEO HUMAN GENEO RESEARCH .
UHHUH .
AND THERE MORE AND MORE THINGS LIKE SCHIZOPHRENIA AND WHY DOES IT JUST TURN OUT TO BE GENETIC OR BIOCHEMICAL IN ORIGIN .
RIGHT .
SO IF SOMEDAY WE CAN GO TO JEFF DAHLMER AND SAY WELL THE PROBLEM IS YOU YOU VE GOT AN ENDORPHIN IMBALANCE AND YOU KNOW IF YOU TAKE THIS REGULARLY YOU LL BE A SANE AND PRODUCTIVE MEMBER OF SOCIETY .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW YOU REALLY GET BACK TO THE QUESTION OF YOU KNOW IS SOMEONE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS .
YEAH WELL I I THINK ON SOME OF IT YOU HAVE TO SAY SOMEONE S RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS ACTIONS .
I NEVER LIKE THE UH .
SOCIETY MADE ME DO IT .
THE DEFENSE .
YEAH .
WELL I NEVER LIKED THE UH INSANITY DEFENSE .
GO AHEAD .
UH HAVE YOU .
EVERY BEEN TESTED FOR A NEW JOB OR ANYTHING .
UH NO I HAVE NT .
BUT IN MY JOB I M A NURSE AND WE ARE ALLOWED TO BE .
I MEAN YOU KNOW THIS IS THE RULES THAT THEY CAN DO THIS ANYTIME .
UH I DO NT KNOW OF ANYONE .
WHO EVER HAS BEEN PICKED OUT AND BEEN TESTED .
SO IT S JUST SORT OF UH THEY CAN IF THEY .
THEY CAN IF THEY CHOOSE TO .
OH OKAY .
RIGHT .
HAVE YOU WELL WAI HAVE YOU HAD ANY EXPERIENCE WITH IT AT ALL .
UH NOT REALLY BUT I VE ALWAYS WORKED ON A UNIVERSITY LEVEL BUT A LOT OF MY FRIENDS HAD TO BE TESTED BEFORE THEY GOT SUMMER JOBS AND STUFF .
UHHUH .
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT .
UH I DO NT I DO NT THINK THEY RE VERY ACCURATE BECAUSE I MEAN I KNOW THEIR LIFESTYLES CHANGED P PRIOR TO THE DRUG TEST AND I KNOW THEY CHANGED AFTERWARDS .
RIGHT RIGHT .
SEE I KNOW OF THAT TOO .
AND I ALSO KNOW THAT THINGS LIKE ANTIHISTAMINES SUDAFEDS THINGS LIKE THAT CAN REALLY THROW IT OFF .
AND YOU CAN NOT GET A JOB BECAUSE OF IT AND THEY MAY NOT TELL YOU .
THE REASON WHY .
YEAH I I HAD A FRIEND IT DID NT CAUSE HER .
ANY PROBLEMS WITH HER JOB BUT IT CAME BACK THAT SHE TESTED POSITIVE FOR USING A HALLUCINOGEN .
UHHUH .
BUT WHAT .
IT WAS WAS SHE HAD BEEN U SHE HAD BEEN UH IN THE JUNGLE AND IT WAS SOME MALARIA MEDICATION AND SHE TESTED POSITIVE FOR THAT .
SEE AND SO IT REALLY IS A DANGEROUS THING .
THAT WAY BECAUSE I KNOW OF SOMEBODY .
THAT TESTED FOR AN AIRLINE AND DID NT GET THE JOB AND THEY WERE NT TOLD WHY .
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THE REASON WHY AFTER YOU TAKE A PHYSICAL WILL BE BECAUSE OF THE DRUG TESTING OR THEY WOULD TELL YOU .
OR THIS PERSON NEVER USE ANY DRUGS .
SEE I ALWAYS I THOUGHT THEY GOT YOU GOT CALLED BACK IF YOU TESTED POSITIVE FOR MORE TESTS .
UH YOU SHOULD .
BECAUSE YOU SHOULD BE GIVEN ANOTHER CHANCE OR AT LEAST BE ABLE TO JUSTIFY IT OR SOMETHING .
I HAVE REAL MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT IT .
I DO NT KNOW .
HOW DO YOU KNOW HOW WRONG THEY ARE .
ARE THEY I MEAN IS THERE A MARGIN OF ERROR .
THE ACCURACY .
I DO NT KNOW .
I DO NT KNOW .
BUT I KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS .
THAT CAN INFLUENCE THEM AND I THINK THAT A PERSON DESERVES A SECOND CHANCE WITH IT OR SOMETHING BECAUSE MOST THINGS WILL STAY IN YOUR SYSTEM FOR A LONG TIME .
YEAH .
AND IF YOU COULD SHOW THAT I I INTERVIEWED FOR A JOB RECENTLY AND I WAS TAKING ENTEX .
UHHUH .
AND MY DOCTOR GAVE ME .
A PRESCRIPTION FOR IT .
AND HE SAID THIS WAY IF IT WERE TO MAKE THE DRUG TEST POSITIVE YOU HAVE PROOF THAT YOUR DOCTOR ORDERED THIS FOR YOU YOU KNOW .
AND IT DID NT COME UP THAT I NEEDED TO DO IT BUT THIS COULD HAPPEN TO ANYBODY AND IF THEY WOULD JUST SAY OH THIS PERSON S DRUG TEST IS POSITIVE WE WO NT HIRE THEM .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
THEN YOU COULD LOSE OUT ON A JOB WHEN REALLY YOU DID NT DO ANYTHING .
YEAH .
SO I DO NT KNOW .
AND I I M NOT SO SURE THEY ARE THAT NEEDED .
YEAH I M NOT .
I MEAN .
SURE EITHER .
THE ONLY WAY .
I CAN SEE IT IS THAT IF THEY REALLY SUSPECT A PERSON OF USING IT THEN THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO GO AHEAD AND PROVE IT BECAUSE THEY SAY THEY CAN SPOT CHECK .
YE IF YOU RE USING IT WHILE AT A JOB I CAN SEE A PROBLEM .
YEAH .
BUT THE OCCASIONAL PERSON THEN IT S ALMOST LIKE IT S ALMOST AN INFRINGEMENT OF YOUR PRIVACY .
WELL IT .
SORT OF IS .
AND THIS IS IT THIS I M NOT REAL SURE HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT BECAUSE I CAN SEE IT FROM TWO WAYS .
YOU KNOW AS A HEALTH PROFESSIONAL I WOULD NT WANT SOMEBODY TO TAKE CARE OF ME .
THAT WAS USING DRUGS .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW SO AS A PATIENT I FEEL WELL YEAH WE PROBABLY SHOULD BE PROTECTED .
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THERE S A LOT OF THINGS I SHOULD BE PROTECTED FROM THAT THEY DO NT TEST MY PATIENTS FOR TOO .
SO .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW I GUESS YOU SORT OF YOU HAVE TO HAVE TRUST SOME PLACE ALONG THE WAY .
YOU CA NT GO AROUND TESTING EVERYBODY FOR EVERYTHING .
YEAH .
SO I DO NT KNOW .
AND I I THINK IT COULD BE USED TO HASSLE SOMEBODY .
IF SOMEONE WAS OUT TO GET YOU I THINK THAT A COMPANY OR A BOSS COULD USE THIS .
YOU KNOW THEY COULD KEEP ON DOING THIS TO YOU OR SOMETHING I GUESS .
I CAN SEE WHERE IT COULD BECOME A PROBLEM .
AND IT IT S LIKE IT SEEMS LIKE NOW THEY HAVE TESTS I GUESS THEY CAN TEST YOUR HAIR AND THEY CAN FIND OUT IF YOU USE DRUGS .
REALLY .
UP TO SEVERAL YEARS AGO .
OH WOW .
BUT .
SO .
MAYBE YOU SHOULD NT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR SOMETHING .
YOU DID SEVERAL YEARS AGO .
I KNOW .
THAT S THE OTHER THING .
I MEAN A LOT OF A LOT OF PEOPLE AS KIDS OR YOU KNOW YOUNG PEOPLE GET INTO SOME THINGS THAT THEY GET OUT OF LATER ON AND I DO NT THINK THEY SHOULD REALLY HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT FOREVER .
YEAH .
THERE S A LOT OF THINGS YOU DO AS A KID THAT .
YEAH .
YOU WOULD NT DO AS AN ADULT BUT .
I THINK THAT S TRUE .
YOU CA NT SAY IT WAS WRONG AT THE TIME .
YEAH YEAH .
SO THAT PROBABLY WOULD NT BE TOO GOOD EITHER .
HOW MANY CHILDREN DO YOU HAVE NOW .
WELL I HAVE FIVE .
YOU HAVE FIVE .
RIGHT .
WELL YOU DO HAVE A HARD TIME FINDING TIME THEN DO NT YOU .
WELL FIVE ARE I MEAN FOUR OF THEM ARE GROWN THEY RE IN COLLEGE OR JUST OUT OF COLLEGE SO I REALLY HAVE JUST A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD AT HOME .
UHHUH .
YOU SOUND SO YOUNG .
WELL I WORK AT IT .
ALL RIGHT .
TO HAVE THEM UH .
I TRY TO FOOL EVERYBODY .
I THINK YOU RE DOING A GOOD JOB .
I JUST HAVE ONE CHILD .
UHHUH .
AND UH I DO NT THINK UH WELL THERE S NOT MUCH I CAN DO ABOUT IT .
MY MY WIFE AND I ARE U IN OUR FORTIES YOU KNOW SO UH .
UHHUH .
BUT IT S HARD TO RAISE ONE CHILD WITHOUT THEM THINKING THEY RE THE THEY RE THE PIVOT POINT OF THE UNIVERSE .
I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT BECAUSE I WAS AN ONLY CHILD TOO .
AND THAT S ONE REASON .
I HAVE SO MANY BECAUSE I REALLY I ENJOY THE BIG FAMILY .
YEAH .
AND MY THIRTEEN YEAR OLD IS PRETTY SEPARATE FROM HER BROTHER AND SISTERS AND SO SHE IS SORT OF LIKE AN ONLY CHILD AND IT S THE SAME TYPE OF THING UH .
UHHUH .
I HAVE A YOUNGER BROTHER LIKE THAT .
I M IN MY FORTIES LIKE I SAY AND I HAVE A BROTHER IN HIS TWENTIES .
UHHUH .
AND I WAS I WAS THE YOUNGEST .
YEAH .
SO I UNDERSTAND HOW THAT WORKED .
AND HE WAS TREATED LIKE HE HAD FIVE FATHERS OR SOMETHING .
RIGHT .
THAT S EXACTLY HOW IT IS YOU KNOW .
SHE .
S GOT ALL THESE SISTERS AND HER BROTHER TO TAKE CARE OF HER .
WHEN THINGS DO NT GO RIGHT SHE JUST CALLS ONE OF THEM YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
BUT UH YEAH IT IT S A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT THOUGH .
I THINK IT WAS EASIER WHEN THEY .
ALL HAD EACH OTHER AND COULD ENTERTAIN EACH OTHER AND I WAS HOME MORE .
AND .
DID YOU .
ALL DO A LOT OF ORGANIZED THINGS LIKE UH LITTLE LEAGUE UH SOCCER .
WE WE REALLY DID NOT .
MY NEXT OLDEST DAUGHTER .
THAT S IN COLLEGE IN CALIFORNIA IS A WORLD TWIRLING CHAMPION .
SHE TWIRLS A BATON AND WE DID A LOT OF THINGS TOGETHER .
UHHUH .
SHE AND I DID A LOT OF THINGS TOGETHER AND FLEW WE HAVE FLOWN ALL OVER THE WORLD FOR HER TO COMPETE AND TO PERFORM .
UHHUH .
AND THAT WAS A LOT OF FUN .
BUT THAT THAT I GUESS YOU COULD CONSIDER THAT ORGANIZED .
I MEAN THERE IS A COMPETITION .
ALL THE TIME .
YEAH .
WE WERE VERY HEAVY INTO THAT .
OTHER THAN THAT THEY WERE PRETTY MUCH AND MAYBE DANCING SCHOOL FOR A WHILE OR MAINLY SCHOOL SPORTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
YOU KNOW I THINK THAT S PROBABLY TRUE .
THE IF YOU HAVE ONE CHILD OR FEWER YOU GET INVOLVED IN ORGANIZED EVENTS OR .
UHHUH .
ACTIVITIES AND IF YOU HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF CHILDREN OR THEN YOU DO NT .
WELL YOU CA NT AFFORD TO .
NO YOU .
CA AND THERE S NOT ENOUGH TIME UH .
RIGHT .
LIKE MY SON IS IN UH LITTLE LEAGUE .
THIS YEAR .
HE S TEN .
AND THEY PRACTICE THREE TIMES .
A WEEK AND THEY HAVE A GAME AND IT S JUST UH IF THERE WERE MORE THAN ONE CHILD I DO NT KNOW THE THERE WOULD BE NO WAY TO DO IT .
RIGHT .
THAT S RIGHT .
YOU KNOW ONE PARENT GO ONE DIRECTION AND I D HAVE TO GO IN THE OTHER AND .
UHHUH .
WE COULD ONLY COVER TWO AT THAT .
YEAH .
WELL I KNOW I SPENT HOURS IN THE GYM .
EVERY DAY WITH MY DAUGHTER AND MY LITTLE .
ONE ALSO COMPETED BECAUSE REALLY SHE HAD NO CHOICE .
SHE HAD TO GO WITH ME .
UHHUH .
SO THE THREE OF US JUST SPENT A LOT OF TIME TRAVELING AND AND COMPETING AND OF COURSE THE COMPETING ITSELF REALLY DID NT MATTER .
WHAT .
IT WAS IT WAS MAKING THE FRIENDS AND GOING ALL THE PLACES AND IT WAS A REALLY NEAT EXPERIENCE BUT IT TOOK OUR TOTAL TIME .
I DID NOT WORK UH WHEN I DID THIS .
NOW I DO WORK FULLTIME .
UHHUH .
AND IT S JUST .
MY THIRTEEN YEAR OLD AND MYSELF AND SO WE REALLY HAVE TO KEEP IT TOGETHER TO GET JUST HER ACTIVITIES IN AND STILL HAVE TIME TO SPEND WITH EACH OTHER .
SO .
I DO NT THINK ALTHOUGH I I I THINK A A MORE THAN ONE CHILD PROBABLY THREE CHILDREN IS PROBABLY THE IDEAL TO ME BUT I M NOT SURE I COULD AFFORD THREE .
I MOST CERTAINLY COULD NT EDUCATE THREE .
I DO NT KNOW HOW MY MY PARENTS DID IT .
YEAH .
I MEAN THERE WERE FIVE OF US AND I DO NT RECALL YOU KNOW WANTING ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR .
UH BUT I DO NT KNOW HOW MY FATHER DID IT .
HE WORKED AT A TRUCK LINE AND HE JUST DID NT MAKE THAT KIND OF MONEY WITH FIVE CHILDREN .
BUT WE DID OKAY .
WE HAD A HOUSE AND A HOME AND BUT NOW MY WIFE AND I .
BOTH WORK AND WE DO NT I DO NT BELIEVE WE HAVE AS MUCH AS MY PARENTS DID AND WE ONLY HAVE ONE CHILD .
REALLY .
UHHUH .
WELL THINGS COST A LOT MORE .
I DO NT KNOW HOW IT IS IN GEORGIA .
HUH .
AND I DO NT THINK OUR PART OF THE COUNTRY IS PARTICULARLY BAD COMPARED TO SOME .
ATLANTA IS HORRIBLE .
IS IT .
YES .
HA WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE MOVING HERE FROM BOSTON AND AND DIFFERENT AREAS AND FROM TALKING TO THEM THEY RE SHOCKED .
REALLY .
WHA AND THEY YOU KNOW THE HOUSING IS SO CHEAP .
RIGHT .
IN COMPARISON TO BOSTON .
THAT S WHAT .
I VE HEARD .
THAT THEY JUMP ON IT .
THEY SELL THEIR HOUSE THEY STASH AWAY A GOOD BIT OF MONEY AND COME DOWN HERE AND I WORK WITH A LOT OF THEM THEY THEY THINK THEY THEY HAVE REALLY DONE SOMETHING .
THEN WHEN THEY GET DOWN HERE THEY REALIZE THE COST OF LIVING IS OUTRAGEOUS .
HUH .
COMPARED TO TO WHERE THEY CAME FROM .
YEAH .
THE HOUSING IS CHEAPER BUT THAT S ABOUT IT .
I M SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT .
I VE HEARD VERY POSITIVE THINGS ABOUT ATLANTA .
KATHY .
UHHUH .
DO YOU .
SO WHAT IS YOUR UH FAMILY WHAT DO YOU USUALLY DO AS FAR AS BUDGETING .
WE HAVE A VERY DETAILED BUDGET .
BECAUSE MY HUSBAND IS A FINANCE MAJOR .
UHHUH .
AND WE HAVE YOU KNOW WE HAVE MONEY THAT WE TAKE OUT EACH MONTH THAT WE UH YOU KNOW FOR FOOD AND AND FOR FOR GAS AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
AND THEN WE PUT ASIDE SO MUCH MONEY .
EACH MONTH FOR BIRTHDAYS AND FOR CHRISTMAS AND FOR UH OTHER THINGS .
UHHUH .
THEN WE TAKE OUR MAJOR PURCHASES WE WANT TO MAKE DURING THAT YEAR AND WE BUDGET THEM INTO WHAT .
WE CALL OUR OUR NEEDS AND WANTS LIST .
UHHUH .
AND SO UH THE THINGS .
THAT LIKE A VACATION .
WE HAVE A VACATION FUND .
WE HAVE A FUND FOR THE THINGS WE NEED .
AND THEN A FOR THE THINGS THAT WE WANT .
UHHUH .
AND UH AND WE RE CONTINUALLY PUTTING INTO THOSE YOU KNOW EACH MONTH HOW MUCH WE RE GOING TO NEED AND THEN WE KNOW THE MONTH THAT WE RE GOING TO HAVE ENOUGH TO GET THAT PARTICULAR ITEM .
UHHUH .
SO WE VERY RARELY BUY ANYTHING ON CREDIT .
EVERYTHING .
WE BUY IS PAID FOR .
YEAH .
MY HUSBAND IS A FINANCE MAJOR ALSO .
AND UH WE .
KIND OF HAVE THE SAME PLAN .
UH WE HAVE ONE CREDIT CARD AND EVERY MONTH .
WE PUT UH YOU KNOW THE SAME AMOUNT IN FOR RETIREMENT .
UH AND WE BUDGET WE RE OUR OUR NEW THING TO OUR BUDGET IS WE JUST HAD A BABY .
SO WE RE .
BUDGETING UH EACH MONTH UH AN ALLOWANCE FOR HIS EDUCATION .
RIGHT .
STARTING NOW .
RIGHT .
SO THAT S IN OUR BUDGET .
EVERY MONTH NOW .
THAT S THE NEWEST ADDITION .
BUT WE TOO DO THE SAME THING AS FAR AS UH WE HAVE A SET AMOUNT .
WE TAKE OH ONE .
BIG VACATION .
A YEAR AND THEN MAYBE YOU KNOW THREE SMALL VACATIONS .
SO WE YOU KNOW AN .
EXACT AMOUNT THAT WE SPEND ON THAT EACH YEAR .
RIGHT .
AND .
UH WE HAVE FOUND THAT WE SPEND LESS MONEY IF WE PULL OUT THE MONEY .
UH .
UHHUH .
INSTEAD OF JUST WRITING CHECKS FOR THINGS .
UHHUH .
IF WE ACTUALLY PULL IT OUT AND KEEP IT IN A SAFE HERE .
I SEE .
AND WE ACTUALLY PULL OUT THE MONEY .
EACH MONTH THAT WE WANT TO PUT IN FOR BIRTHDAYS THAT WE WANT TO PUT IN FOR UH THE VACATION .
THAT WE PUT IN FOR CHRISTMAS .
LIKE YOU HAVE A SEPARATE ACCOUNT FOR THAT THEN .
WELL A LOT OF THAT UH I DO NT KNOW HOW SAFE .
IT IS .
I GUESS UH WE KEEP IT .
ALL IN A SAFE HERE AT THE HOUSE .
OH I SEE .
UHHUH .
AND SO IT S ACTUALLY PULLED OUT .
THEN WE KEEP OUR .
OH I SEE .
WE HAVE A SAVINGS ACCOUNT FOR THE KIDS EDUCATION .
THAT MONEY GOES INTO THERE .
UHHUH .
EACH OF OUR WE HAVE THREE CHILDREN .
SO THEY .
EACH HAVE THEIR OWN ACCOUNT .
I SEE .
THAT MONEY IS PUT INTO EACH MONTH .
UHHUH .
DOES YOUR HUSBAND DEAL IN UH STOCKS AND BONDS AND MUTUAL FUNDS AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF .
TH DOES HE INVEST IN THAT AND .
HE DOES SOMEWHAT .
FOR LONGTERM .
YEAH .
HE DOES SOMEWHAT .
UHHUH .
UH WE HAVE AN INVESTMENT PLAN .
YEAH .
I GUESS HE DOES .
UHHUH .
BUT UH WE HAVE REALLY FOUND THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR .
WE VE DONE IT .
THIS WAY .
AND WE ARE REALLY SAVING A LOT OF MONEY .
REALLY .
BECAUSE YOU RE YOU VE YOU VE SAT DOWN WITH A PIECE OF PAPER AND SAID WELL LET S SEE WHAT ARE WE GOING TO SO WHAT GOES INTO THAT THAT PARTICULAR THING .
IT .
S VACATIONS CHRISTMAS .
CHRISTMAS BIRTHDAYS UH CAR MAINTENANCE DENTAL MEDICAL WE JUST AVERAGED OUT HOW MUCH LAST YEAR .
WE USED PER MONTH ON MEDICAL AND HOW MUCH .
UHHUH .
WE USED ON DENTAL AND UH AND SO NOW WHEN WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH THAT DEDUCTIBLE THAT OUR INSURANCE DOES NT COVER .
RIGHT .
RATHER THAN WONDERING WHERE IT S GOING TO COME FROM WE HAVE IT YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
AND WHEN WHEN WE SEE SOMETHING ON SALE UH INSTEAD OF JUST LOOKING IN OUR CHECKING ACCOUNT AND SAYING WELL WE VE GOT ENOUGH AND GETTING IT AND THEN WHEN SOMETHING COMES UP YOU KNOW KIND OF SCRIMPING TO PAY FOR A MEDICAL BILL .
UHHUH .
EVERYTHING .
S TAKEN CARE OF .
AND WE RE FINDING THAT WE EVEN HAVE MORE MONEY THAN WE THOUGHT .
REALLY .
YEAH .
WELL YOU KNOW UH WHAT DO YOU DO AS FAR AS I I TAKE IT DO YOU UH RUN THE FAMILY BUDGET AS FAR AS UH GROCERIES AND THAT SORT OF THING .
I DO .
UHHUH .
ALL THE MONEY .
UHHUH .
AND HOW WHAT S THAT .
ALL THE MONEY IS TURNED OVER TO ME .
UHHUH .
DO YOU HAVE A SET AMOUNT THAT THAT YOU SPEND EACH MONTH OR .
YES .
OR HOW DO YOU WORK THAT .
I HAVE A SET AMOUNT .
IT S VERY GENEROUS AND I USUALLY HAVE EXTRA .
UHHUH .
AND SO THEN THAT CAN GO UH YOU KNOW EITHER BACK INTO OUR CHECKING ACCOUNT OR I CAN JUST CARRY IT OVER .
UHHUH .
UH YOU KNOW THERE ARE CERTAIN MONTHS OF THE YEAR THAT YOU LL SPEND MORE ON FOOD THAN OTHER MONTHS .
AND .
UHHUH .
CERTAIN TIMES WHEN THAT WILL BE LEFT OVER .
BUT THAT S COMPLETELY UP TO ME HOW I DO THAT .
AND .
UHHUH .
THEN UH BECAUSE I DO NT WORK .
I STAY HOME .
I DO TOO .
I STAY HOME ALSO .
AND SO IT S KIND OF MY MONEY AND I ALSO GET MY OWN MONEY TO DO WHAT .
I WANT TO .
GO TO LUNCHES YOU KNOW AND DO THAT KIND OF THING .
UHHUH .
WE HAVE A CLOTHING UH ENVELOPE FOR EACH OF THE KIDS AND FOR MYSELF AND MY HUSBAND THAT WE PUT HOW MUCH WE FIGURE WE NEED EACH MONTH ON CLOTHING .
UHHUH .
IT REALLY WORKS OUT GREAT .
WE RE FINDING THAT WE HAVE A LOT MORE MONEY TO SPEND ON THINGS LIKE THAT .
AND WE RE .
YEAH .
WHAT WHAT AS FAR AS LIKE BIG THINGS LIKE SOMETHING COMES UP AND YOU HAVE TO BUY A T V OR A BIG ITEM LIKE FOR THE HOUSE .
HOW DO YOU HAVE LIKE A HOUSEHOLD .
YES .
WE HAVE A HOUSEHOLD BUDGET .
LIKE WE RE GOING TO NEED TO BUY A BED FOR MY DAUGHTER .
THAT S COMING OUT OF HER CRIB .
THIS YEAR .
UHHUH .
AND ALSO WE NEED A NEW BED .
AND SO WE VE GOT BOTH OF THOSE BUDGETED AND WE PUT A CERTAIN AMOUNT IN EACH MONTH AND WE KNOW WHICH MONTH .
WE LL ENOUGH SAVED TO GO BUY THOSE .
UHHUH .
AND IF WE FIND ONE ON SALE BEFORE THEN THEN WE CAN JUST TAKE THAT AND PUT IT TOWARDS .
SO WHAT KIND OF MUSIC .
YOU INTO .
WELL I HAVE A UH PRETTY WIDE TASTE UH IN MUSIC RANGING FROM PROGRESSIVE ROCK TO JAZZ TO UH LOT OF DIFFERENT FORMS OF UH MUSIC .
IN FACT IT S EASIER FOR ME TO SAY UH THE TYPES OF MUSIC THAT I DO NT LIKE ARE OPERA AND UH SCREAMING HEAVY METAL .
THE OPERA YEAH IT S RIGHT ON TRACK .
I LIKE CLASSICAL BUT I CA NT DEAL WITH OPERA AT ALL .
AND HEAVY METAL UH IT S NOISY .
I M INTO UH SOME INDUSTRIAL MUSIC .
THAT S A A BIT EVEN HARDER THAN THAT .
UHHUH .
BUT IT S IT S GOT TO HAVE A POINT TO IT .
OH I DO NT MIND MUSIC .
THAT S DIFFICULT TO LISTEN TO .
BUT UH THE THE UH BASIC POINT OF HEAVY METAL W WHICH SEEMS TO BE MUSIC TO ANNOY YOU .
IS UH GETS A LITTLE ANNOYING .
YEAH .
WHAT KIND OF PROGRESSIVE STUFF .
UH LOT OF STUFF .
THAT ACTUALLY HAS UH ENDED UP BECOMING POPULAR LIKE UH NIRVANA AND UH OH YOU KNOW I M THIRTY SO LOT OF THE STUFF .
I WAS LISTENING TO IN MY TEENS LIKE THE CLASH AND AND THE SEX PISTOLS AND .
UH .
R E M THAT SORT OF STUFF .
UH R E M MAKES ME LAUGH BECAUSE THEY VE GONE FROM A COLLEGE RADIO PROGRESSIVE GROUP TO BEING UH YOU KNOW ULTRA MAINSTREAM AT THIS POINT AND IT S NOT REALLY THAT THEY VE CHANGED THEIR MUSICAL STYLE SO MUCH AS THE STREAM CHANGED .
OH YEAH .
YEAH IT S A LOT OF PEOPLE L LIKE SAYING THAT YOU KNOW BANDS IN THAT POSITION YOU KNOW SOLD OUT .
UHHUH .
I THINK THAT S PRETTY MUCH YOU KNOW BULL .
BECAUSE R E M REALLY HAS NT CHANGED .
IF IT S IT S INTERESTING .
THEY RE PRODUCING UH SIMILAR MUSIC AND IT S GOOD MUSIC .
UHHUH .
BUT YOU KNOW PEOPLE HAVE PICKED UP ON IT .
THAT S GOOD .
I THINK IT IS .
I M IMPRESSED .
UH FOR A WHILE THERE MUSIC SEEMED TO REALLY HA POPULAR MUSIC SEEMED TO HAVE UH NOT A LOT OF POINT TO IT .
I WAS REALLY TIRED OF UH THE MICHAEL BOLTON .
MI MICHAEL BOLTON REALLY GOT ON MY NERVES BECAUSE HE .
HE WAS MAKING ALL THIS MONEY DOING MEDIOCRE COVER TUNES .
OH YEAH .
AND I COULD UH GO DOWN TO A BAR .
THAT S ABOUT THREE MINUTES FROM MY HOUSE AND HEAR PEOPLE DOING COVERS BETTER THAN HIM NOT MAKING NEARLY AS MUCH MONEY .
UH BUT HE PICKED THE RIGHT SONGS AND .
I GUESS .
AND THAT THAT S ABOUT ALL HE HAD GOING FOR HIM .
OR STILL HAS FOR THAT MATTER .
THAT AND A MARVELOUS HAIRDO .
OH YEAH .
YEAH I M SURE THAT THAT SO THAT SOLD A LOT FOR HIM .
THAT S ALL .
YOU REALLY NEED FOR A LOT OF LOT OF POP .
I M KI I VE KIND OF LIKE DEVELOPED A A SHORT HATRED FOR FOR POP .
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THERE S NO NO REAL POINT .
YOU HEAR THE SAME SAME TUNE OVER AND OVER AGAIN .
UHHUH .
IN A THOUSAND GUISES AND .
WELL I IT S INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU WERE YOU WERE SAYING THAT YOU LIKED CLASSICAL MUSIC .
UHHUH .
AND I LIKE A LOT OF CLASSICAL MUSIC BUT I ALSO DISLIKE UH SOME CLASSICAL MUSIC AND WHAT GETS ME EVEN MORE IS THE ATTITUDE OF PEOPLE .
WHO ARE REALLY INTO CLASSICAL MUSIC .
AND FEEL THAT IF IF IT S NOT SEVENTY FIVE YEARS OLD IT .
HAS NT STOOD THE TEST OF TIME .
YEAH I CAN I CAN BELIEVE THAT .
WHAT KIND OF THINGS ARE YOU DO YOU LIKE IN CLASSICAL .
WHAT S THE .
UH .
STANDARD .
STUFF THAT I LIKE UH I LIKE BACH .
I TOLERATE VIVALDI .
I CA NT .
STAND UH UH DEBUSSY OR DEBUSSY .
UH UH I LIKE TCHAIKOVSKY .
HE CAN MAKE A LOT OF NOISE WHEN HE S UH SO INCLINED .
OH YES .
UH AND SOME OF SOME STUFF THAT I LIKE UH FOR INSTANCE FRANK ZAPPA HAS DONE A FAIR AMOUNT OF ORCHESTRAL COMPOSITION .
UHHUH .
AND THAT S INTERESTING MUSIC .
BUT IT WOULD NOT GET PERFORMED BY ANY UH MUNICIPALLY FUNDED UH PHILHARMONIC .
UH JUST BECAUSE NUMBER ONE IT S FRANK ZAPPA AND HE S WEIRD NUMBER TWO IS NT HE STILL ALIVE .
YOU KNOW WE RE WE RE .
MUCH BETTER OFF PLAYING UH BEETHOVEN S NINTH THAT S RIGHT YOU KNOW W WE LL DO WE LL DO THE NINTH AND EVERYONE WILL KNOW IT AND .
IT S SAFE .
AND HUM IT AND I IT IT JUST IS NT CHANCE TAKING ENOUGH FOR ME .
UH I FEEL THAT UH THAT THAT MUSIC SHOULD TAKE CHANCES IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AND THAT UH YOU KNOW IF YOU VE HEARD A PIECE OH A HUNDRED A HUNDRED TIMES .
WELL WE IN IN IN OUR FAMILY HAVE BEEN PRETTY REMISS IN TRYING TO UH YOU KNOW KEEP TRACK OF UH DAILY FINANCES .
UH THE UH WAY BACK WHAT TWELVE YEARS AGO OR SOMETHING WHEN I GOT MY FIRST COMPUTER I DID WHAT .
EVERYBODY ELSE DOES WHICH IS TO PUT THE WHOLE FAMILY BUDGET ON THE MACHINE AND PUT CHECKS AND YOU KNOW CHECKBOOKS AND ALL THIS KIND OF THING AND WE KEPT THAT GOING FOR ABOUT A MONTH AND IT BECAME SO ONEROUS THAT WE GAVE UP ON IT .
UHHUH .
THAT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT .
YOU KNOW SO UH THE ONLY THING .
WE RE YOU KNOW THAT WE DO NOW IS UH I KEEP A A LITTLE SPREAD SHEET OF UH WHAT .
I CALL THE NET WORTH CALCULATION .
WHICH IS JUST THE THE PRESENT VALUE OF VARIOUS KINDS OF INVESTMENTS AND SO WORTH .
UH AND I ONLY UPDATE THAT OH I DO NT KNOW MAYBE ONCE EVERY QUARTER OR SO .
EVERY THREE MONTHS .
JUST BASICALLY WHEN THE STATEMENTS COME IN .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW .
JUST TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT WE RE FALLING YOU KNOW GETTING AHEAD FALLING BEHIND OR STAYING EVEN OR WHAT .
RIGHT .
UH THAT S REALLY ABOUT YOU KNOW THE EXTENT OF UH OF THE KIND OF UH FINANCIAL SCORE KEEPING THAT WE RE DOING .
UH .
WELL IT S KIND OF DIFFICULT FOR ME .
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW UH LIKE MOST TEACHERS I M LAID OFF AND .
HUH .

SO UM I SPEND MOST YOU KNOW I SUBSTITUTE A LOT .
UHHUH .
SO IT S A LOT IT S VERY HARD ON A NONFIXED INCOME BECAUSE I DO NT KNOW HOW MANY DAYS I M GOING TO BE CALLED IN AND WHETHER I AM OR NOT TO TRY TO KEEP TRACK OF FINANCES .
UHHUH .
AND BUT I KNOW HOW MUCH I HAVE TO BRING IN A MONTH .
AND THAT S ABOUT IT .
THAT S ABOUT AS FAR AS WE GO .

BUT I STILL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT .
IF I WORK TOO MANY DAYS THEN I LOSE ALL MY STATE AID AND IF I DO NT WORK ENOUGH DAYS THEN I DO NT GET ENOUGH TO MEET THE BILLS AND IT S LIKE A JUGGLING ACT .
EVERY SINGLE MONTH .
UHHUH .
LIKE THIS WEEK .

HERE IN INDIANA WE PAY UH WE PAY COUNTY INCOME TAX STATE INCOME TAX WE PAY FIVE PERCENT SALES TAX UH YOU NAME IT THEY TAX IT .
OH SO Y Y YOU GET THE WHOLE SMORGASBORD .
THAT S RIGHT WE .
WELL I I ACTUALLY LIVE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE .
UHHUH .
TAX FREE OR DIE .
RIGHT .
UHHUH .
WHICH IS PROBABLY PRETTY NICE BUT I LL BET THAT MEANS YOUR STATE SALES TAX IS PRETTY HIGH .
NO ACTUALLY THERE S NO SALES TAX IN NEW HAMPSHIRE EITHER .
THERE S NO SALES TAX EITHER .
NO WHAT THERE IS IS VERY HIGH PROPERTY TAXES BECAUSE THAT S HOW THEY FUND SCHOOLS AND EVERYTHING .
UHHUH .
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS I WORK IN MASSACHUSETTS SO THEY .
RIGHT .
THEY HIT ME UP FOR THE FIVE PERCENT THERE .
TAXACHUSETTS .
YEP BUT IT WELL YOU KNOW WE IT S ONLY A STATE TAX HERE NO LOCAL .
UHHUH .
WE VE GOT A FIVE PERCENT SALES TAX .
RIGHT .
BUT UH THE PROBLEM IS THAT SO I M PAYING STATE TAX EVEN IF I DO NT LIVE HERE .
RIGHT .
BUT AT LEAST ON THINGS LIKE STOCK OPTIONS AND THINGS LIKE THAT THEY DO NT TAX ME .
UHHUH .
SO THAT S NOT TOO BAD .
NO I UH I REALLY THINK THAT HERE IN INDIANA AT LEAST WE PAY A A WHOLE UH JUST TOO MUCH TAX .
I WORKED IN A FACTORY UH LAST SUMMER AND ON THE AVERAGE I WAS LOSING TWENTY PERCENT OF EVERY PAYCHECK TO TAXES AND I DO NT FEEL THAT I REALLY GET A WHOLE LOT OF RETURN FROM THAT .
I MEAN I DO NT UTILIZE ALL YOU KNOW IT REALLY ANY GOVERNMENT WELFARE SERVICES .
OF COURSE I DRIVE ON THE ROADS AND I YOU KNOW WENT TO THE SCHOOLS AND STUFF BUT I REALLY FEEL THAT THAT I M JUST GETTING OVERTAXED .
OH I I MEAN I I D CONSIDER TWENTY PERCENT LUCKY BECAUSE JUST ON I MEAN YOU KNOW WHEN YOU FIGURE OUT JUST ON FEDS YOU KNOW I ACTUALLY HIT THE THIRTYONE BRACKET .
UHHUH .
THIS YEAR WHICH WAS NO FUN .
NO THAT S .
THAT S NOT ANY FUN .

A .
UHHUH .
WHICH IS TAXES .
RIGHT .
WHERE YOU MOST PEOPLE FORGET ABOUT THEM BECAUSE YOU VE G YOU KNOW YOU CA NT ALWAYS GET YOUR F I C .
A BACK AT THE END OF THE YEAR .
RIGHT .
BUT SO YOU KNOW AND THEN YOU KNOW LIKE A FIVE PERCENT SURTAX I M PAYING FORTY PERCENT TAX .
YEAH WHICH IS JUST OUTRAGEOUS AND A LOT OF IT AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE WAY .
THE GOVERNMENT IS RUN THESE DAYS IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF IT S GOING TO WASTE .
YEAH WELL I I MEAN I THINK THERE S SOME PEOPLE THERE Y CERTAINLY ARE SOME THINGS WHERE YOU NEED INFRASTRUCTURE AND YOU NEED .
RIGHT .
YOU .
N YOU KNOW THERE ARE THINGS GOVERNMENT DOES BETTER YOU KNOW I THINK GOVERNMENT DOES A BETTER SPACE PROGRAM .
RIGHT .
THAN YOU RE GOING TO GET OUT OF PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS BUT YOU KNOW I THINK YOU KNOW YOU LOOK AT THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW TAX SUBSIDIES TO TOBACCO FARMERS .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE JESSE HELMS WANTS IT THAT WAY OR .
THAT S RIGHT GOT TO KEEP THOSE FARMERS HAPPY .
YOU KNOW AND AND JUST TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF YOU KNOW SO MUCH OF IT IS NOW JUST GOING TO SERVICE DEBT OR .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW IS GOING IN INTO INTO PROGRAMS .
THAT YOU KNOW YEAH THEY ARE THEY ARE A FAT .
YOU KNOW I THINK THE MILITARY IS REALLY FAT .
I THINK THAT A LOT OF THE THE H E W SERVICES ALTHOUGH THEY RE PROVIDING NECESSARY SERVICES HAVE TOO MUCH FAT IN THEM .
RIGHT .
THE THERE IS JUST WAY TOO MUCH BUREAUCRACY AND SO MUCH OF THAT TAX MONEY IS GOING JUST TO KEEP THAT BUREAUCRACY RUNNING KEEP THE PAPER SHUFFLING AROUND .
YOU KNOW LIKE WE .
INSTEAD OF REAL YOU KNOW GOOD PROGRAMS .
YEAH I MEAN WE WE SPEND A FORTUNE FOR THINGS LIKE V .
A HOSPITALS AND YOU KNOW THEN YOU LOOK AT HOW WELL THEY RE MANAGED YOU KNOW I DO NT THINK WE RE GETTING OUR MONEY S WORK OUT WORTH OUT OF THERE .
I THINK IT S ALL GOING INTO INTO BUREAUCRATS .
RIGHT AND A LOT OF IT S FEEDING THAT .
JUST I JUST I REALLY ESPECIALLY IN THE ELECTION YEAR I MEAN I M REALLY THINKING A LOT ABOUT THIS THE ECONOMY AND QUESTIONS LIKE THAT AND AND JUST THE WHOLE IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYTHING IS REALLY SCREWY RIGHT NOW AS FAR AS THE ECONOMY UH THE GOVERNMENT GOES AND OUR OUR WHOLE ECONOMY IN GENERAL AND OUR TAXES JUST ARE GOING TO KEEP RISING NO MATTER .
WHAT HAPPENS AND ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU VE GOT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION .
WHO HAS INCREASED GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES UH BEYOND WHAT ANY OTHER PRESIDENT SINCE WORLD WAR TWO HAS DONE AND YET .
WELL BE .
HE SUPPOSEDLY .
BETWEEN HIM AND REAGAN YEAH .
RIGHT RIGHT YEAH .
THE GREAT COMMUNICATOR .
I MEAN I JUST READ SOMETHING .
THAT TWO THIRDS OR THREE QUARTERS I M NOT EXACTLY SURE OF OUR NATIONAL DEBT ARE WAS CREATED DURING THE REAGAN BUSH ERA .
OH OH YEAH THEY THINK .
WHO ARE SUPPO SUPPOSEDLY FISCALLY CONSERVATIVE .
OH YEAH AND THEN THEY GO AND SAY I M NOT C CONGRESS THEY RE THE FAULT FOR IT .
RIGHT .
BUT YOU KNOW THE OTHER THING IS IT S TRICKY THOUGH BECAUSE LIKE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE THEY SAY OH ALL RIGHT LET S CUT THE MILITARY BUDGET .
RIGHT .
WELL YEAH THEN YOU LOSE HALF YOUR JOBS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE .
UHHUH .
YOU LOSE GROTTEN CONNECTICUT GOES SO YOU KNOW IT S LIKE YOU KNOW IT S VERY TRICKY TO BALANCE THAT STUFF OFF BECAUSE THEN YOU HURT YOU KNOW IF THE IF THE IF PEOPLE LOSE THEIR JOBS THEN THEY BECOME A LOAD AND THEY RE NOT CONTRIBUTING TAXES .
THAT S RIGHT .
SO YOU KNOW IT S IT S VERY HARD TO SAY YOU KNOW THIS IS WHAT .
WE SHOULD CUT .
YEAH IT S REALLY THAT IS THE ESPECIALLY THAT DEFENSE CUTS IN THE DEFENSE IS REALLY A CATCH TWENTYTWO .
MUMBLEX .
DOUBLE WHAMMY BECAUSE LIKE YOU SAY IF YOU CUT DEFENSE WELL THAT S GREAT THAT S GOING TO LOWER OUR NATIONAL EXPENDITURES BUT THEN YOU RE GOING TO HAVE PEOPLE ON WELFARE AND THEY RE NOT .
WHO ARE NT CONTRIBUTING .
PUTTING TAXES IN .
RIGHT YEAH .
SO THAT S THAT S REALLY IT S .
AND UH IN OUR .
I M GLAD I M NOT THE ONE .
WHO HAS TO COME UP WITH THESE POLICIES .
RIGHT .
BUT WHAT S VERY FUNNY IS IN OUR TOWN MEETING THEY WERE V TH THIS THIS GUY HAD BOTH FOR OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT MEETING AND OUR TOWN MEETING HAD THIS PROPOSAL .
WHICH UNFORTUNATELY VIOLATES NEW HAMPSHIRE CONSTITUTION .
UHHUH .
D FOR OUR LOCAL TOWN TO DO IT TO UH HAVE YOU HAVE PEOPLE LINE ITEM THEIR TAXES .
RIGHT .
THEY SAY I WANT TO PAY FOR THIS AND THIS AND THIS AND THIS AND THIS .
COURSE THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THEN NOBODY PAYING FOR THE NECESSARY SERVICES THEY DO NT USE .
THAT S RIGHT .
YEAH .
MUMBLEX HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT CRIME IN THE CITY .
YOU SAY YOU RE FROM ATLANTA .
RIGHT I I I ACTUALLY I LIVE IN THE CITY .
UHHUH .
AND UH I GUESS IT IS A CONCERN OF MINE UH YOU KNOW FOR MY OWN SAFETY .
UHHUH .
I MEAN DO YOU DO YOU FIND CRIME IN ATLANTA REALLY MUMBLEX I LIVE IN ATLANTA ALSO .
WELL THAT S RIGHT .
UH .
UH .
UH I THINK IT IS BAD IN CERTAIN AREAS HOWEVER I THINK THE AREA THAT I LIVE IN IT S NOT UH THE CRIME LEVEL IS NOT AS HIGH AS IT IS IN OTHER AREAS OF THE OF THE CITY .
UHHUH .
I THINK IT SEEMS THAT THERE .
S CERTAIN AREAS WHERE UH THE CRIME IS FOCUSED .
UHHUH .
UH .
WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK CAN BE DONE ABOUT THE CRIME IN THE CITY .
WELL I THINK IT S WHAT S BEEN HAPPENING OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS .
IT SEEMS THEY VE BEEN BEEFING UP THE POLICE PATROLS TRYING TO PUT PUT MORE GUYS MORE COPS HIGHER VISIBILITY AND UH .
UHHUH .
THEY VE HAD SOME IMPACT BUT NOT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT AND PROBABLY UM THEY NEED TO TRY TO INCREASE COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT THAT SORT OF THING I THINK MUMBLEX .
I PROBABLY AGREE WITH THAT .
YEAH .
UH .
YOU KNOW PARTICULARLY IN SOME OF THE HOUSING PROJECTS UH YOU KNOW THAT S THAT TENDS TO BE WHERE A LOT OF THAT CRIME IS FOCUSED .
UHHUH .
AND THEY VE GOT TO DO MORE THAN JUST HAVING HAVING COPS THERE .
THEY VE GOT TO KIND OF CHANGE .
THE WAY PEOPLE THINK ABOUT IT .
YEAH THAT S PROBABLY TRUE .
UM SO UM WELL DO YOU THINK ATLANTA S AS BAD AS MOST OTHER CITIES .
UM WELL I VE BEEN TO I D SAY IT S IT S PROBABLY IN THE TOP TOP TEN IN TERMS OF CRIME .
UM IT S NOWHERE NEAR AS BAD AS NEW YORK CITY .
UHHUH .
FOR EXAMPLE .
PROBABLY NOT NOT AS BAD AS DETROIT .
UHHUH .
I DO NT THINK IT S AS BAD AS L .
A .
EITHER .
NO .
WE I DO NT THINK WE HAVE AS MUCH OF THE GANG PROBLEM AS A LOT OF THE OTHER CITIES HAVE .
YEAH THAT SEEMS TO BE TRUE .
UM YEAH IF YOU VE EVER BEEN TO LIKE NEW YORK CITY AND .
UHHUH .
YOU CAN JUST YOU CAN JUST AS YOU WALK THROUGH THE STREET ON A GIVEN EVENING YOU CAN SEE CRIMES BEING COMMITTED .
UHHUH .
IT .
S THAT OBVIOUS .
YEAH I DO NT KNOW I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION ALSO THAT YOU KNOW JUST IF YOU ARE WALKING IN A DOWNTOWN AREA YOU KNOW WHERE THERE S A LOT OF CRIME A LOT OF THAT S GOING TO JUST JUST KEEPING YOUR SENSES ABOUT YOU AND AND TRYING NOT TO LOOK LIKE A VICTIM YOU KNOW .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
YOU KNOW WALK BI YOU KNOW WALK WITH YOU KNOW WITH .
WITH A BIG STICK OR .
MUMBLEX JUST WALK IN A CONFIDENTLY AND YOU KNOW DO NT DO NT BE .

YEAH .
MUMBLEX HAVE YOU HAVE YOU EVER HAVE YOU EVER BEEN MUGGED IN ATLANTA .

THE ONLY THING .
I VE EVER HAD WAS I VE HAD MY WALLET LIFTED .
UHHUH .
BUT THAT WAS IN A MORE OF A A SETTING WHERE THERE WAS A NUMBER OF PEOPLE AROUND AND I .
KIND OF GOT I WAS MUCH YOUNGER AT THE TIME .
UHHUH .
AND KIND OF A COUPLE OF PEOPLE THEY JUST TOOK IT FROM ME WITHOUT ME KNOWING REALLY .
UHHUH .
AND KIND OF PASSED IT OFF SO I DID NT KNOW WHO HAD IT .
UHHUH .
I VE HAD THAT HAPPEN BUT THAT S THAT S ABOUT IT .
YEAH I VE BEEN PRETTY LUCKY ABOUT GETTING MUGGED .
UM .
OH YEAH .
YEAH I THINK I VE ONLY ACTUALLY SEEN LIKE ONE YOU KNOW ONE .
ACTUAL ROBBERY WITH A GUN .
UM .
AND THAT S BEEN ABOUT THE ONLY YOU KNOW REAL VIOLENT CRIME WHERE YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY VIOLENT CRIME THAT I VE SEEN IN ATLANTA .
REALLY WELL I VE HAD MY .
AND THAT WAS JUST A GUY RUNNING OUT OF A STORE THAT HE JUST ROBBED .
UHHUH .
I VE HAD MY CAR STOLEN SO MAYBE THAT COUNTS .
OH REALLY .

OH WHERE WAS WHERE WHERE WAS THAT .
WAS THAT DOWNTOWN OR .

YEAH I VE ACTUALLY I VE KNOWN KNOWN SOME PEOPLE .
THAT HAVE HAD THEIR CARS STOLEN .
UH AND UH AND YOU KNOW ABOUT HALF THE TIME .
THEY SEEM TO THE .
A P D SEEMS TO RECOVER THEM YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
IN VARIOUS STATES OF DISREPAIR .

UP ON BLOCKS .
MY FRIEND HAD A V W RABBIT AND WHEN HE WHEN HE GOT IT BACK HIS UM DASHBOARD WAS SITTING IN THE FRONT SEAT .
YEAH MINE WAS JUST IT HAD BEEN WRECKED AND SOME SUPERFICIAL TYPE DAMAGE BUT THEY DID NT THEY DID NT STRIP IT .

UHHUH .
UM SO LIKE DOES INSURANCE PAY FOR THE BODY DAMAGE OR .
RIGHT .
WAS THAT ALL .
THERE WAS BODY .
IT WAS ABOUT THREE GRAND TO PUT EVERYTHING TOGETHER .
THEY CRACKED THE STEERING COLUMN OF COURSE TO STEAL THE CAR .
YEAH YOU GOT TO YOU CRACK THE STEERING COLUMN AND YOU PULL THE THERE S A PIN IN THERE THAT YOU CAN PULL ON THESE G M CARS .
UHHUH .
AND YOU CAN START IT UP BASICALLY PRETTY EASILY .
UHHUH .
SO HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS MUCH ABOUT UM STEALING CARS .
WELL AFTER I FOUND MINE .
I HAD TO I HAD THIS .
I UH GET A LOT OF MY NEWS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK LISTENING TO ALL THINGS CONSIDERED ON NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO .
UH THAT IS ONE OF MY BIG SOURCES FOR CURRENT EVENTS INFORMATION .
UH I REALLY LIKE THAT COVERAGE .
MY WIFE UH ON THE OTHER HAND IS HOME MOST OF THE DAY AND SHE WATCHES A LOT OF THE CABLE NEWS NETWORK .
HAVE YOU SEEN UH H HAVE YOU UH EVER HEARD OF ALL THINGS CONSIDERED .
NO WE DO NT HAVE THE UH NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO IN IN MY AREA .
UHHUH .
I CAN HEAR IT AT THE UH UH OH THE COLLEGE TOWN NEARBY WHEN I M IN STILLWATER WHICH IS ABOUT AN HOUR AWAY BUT THE F M SIGNAL DOES NT REACH THIS FAR .
UHHUH .
UH I LL LISTEN TO SHORTWAVE QUITE A BIT .
IT GIVES YOU .
A WHOLE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON THE NEWS UH WHEN YOU HEAR IT FROM SAY A EUROPEAN .
UHHUH .
POINT OF VIEW OR FROM THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN .
UH I AGREE WITH YOU TOO ON THE UH UH THE CABLE CHANNEL C N N AND HEADLINE NEWS .
UH I M NOT TOO SATISFIED WITH OUR LOCAL NEWSPAPER .
UHHUH .
UH WHICH IS WHY I RELY ON SHORTWAVE AND AND THEN THE CABLE .
CABLE C N N .
I M UH INTERESTED IN THE IN THE SHORTWAVE ASPECT OF IT .
UH HOW DO YOU FIND THAT THE THE COVERAGE FROM OTHER PLACES IN THE WORLD UH COMPARES WITH THE AMERICAN COVERAGE OF HOW DO YOU THINK THAT UH THE VIEWPOINTS DIFFER .
I THINK A LOT OF IT IS JUST UH THE FACT THAT IN THE U S YOU RE SO FAR REMOVED UH IN A LOT OF CASES FROM SAY CONFLICTS OR OR IT S NOT HAPPENING IN YOUR BACKYARD .
UHHUH .
SO IT S IT S MORE OF A IT S NOT AS A PERSONAL UH THE NEWS IS NT AS PERSONAL IN WHAT .
WE RECEIVE DOMESTICALLY THAN THAN WHAT S ON SHORTWAVE .
IT .
S B B C IS UH OH I DO NT KNOW THE RIGHT WORD IS IS ALMOST UH THEY ALMOST TAKE ALL EMOTIONS OUT OF IT WHEN THEY .
UHHUH .
REPORT IT AND IT JUST THEY SEEM TO GIVE MORE OF JUST THE FACTS THAN OPINIONS .
DO YOU THINK THEN THAT UH THE AMERICAN MEDIA IS PRESENTING AN OPINION ALONG WITH THEIR FACTS .
UH VERY MUCH SO VERY MUCH SO AND I I THINK A LOT OF IT IS UH ESPECIALLY T V NEWS THEY DO NT REALLY HAVE THE TIME AND A LOT OF THEM DO NT HAVE THE EDUCATION AND THE BACKGROUND TO .
UH OH TO REALLY DECIPHER THE NEWS AND TO REALLY EXPLAIN IT .
I MEAN I YOU KNOW I THINK IT S IMPORTANT TO INTERPRET IT BUT A LOT OF TIMES .
THE PERSON DOES NT HAVE THE EXPERIENCE TO TO DO THE INTERPRETING .
UHHUH .
WHICH UH WHICH APPROACH DO YOU FIND TO BE UH MORE USEFUL THE THE INTERPRETIVE APPROACH OR THE STRAIGHT REPORTING .
OH I LIKE THE STRAIGHT REPORTING .
UH AND THEN I I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO FORM MY OWN OPINION OF IT .
IT S IT S NICE TO HEAR SOMEONE .
S INTERPRETATION OF IT .
UHHUH .
UH I ALWAYS THINK IT S HUMOROUS WHEN WHEN THE PRESIDENT GIVES THE STATE OF THE UNION AND UH FOR THIRTY MINUTES AND THEN FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF .
YOU HEAR DIFFERENT COMMENTATORS EXPLAINING WHAT .
YOU JUST HEARD .
AND A LOT OF TIME .
I DO NT HEAR EXACTLY WHAT .
THEY WHAT .
THEY WRITE INTO IT .
UHHUH .
SO I OVERALL I THINK I WOULD RATHER HEAR JUST STRAIGHT REPORTING .
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I FOUND INTERESTING LAST YEAR DURING THE UH THE GULF CONFLICT WAS A SENTIMENT AGAINST UH PETER ARNETT WHO HAD STAYED IN IRAQ AND WAS PRESENTING UH SOME OF THE THINGS .
THAT WERE AVAILABLE .
UH THERE WAS A THERE WAS UH A PIECE WHERE HE WAS SHOWING A BOMBED OUT BUILDING WHERE THERE WAS OBVIOUSLY A CRUDELY UH UH HASTILY ERECTED SIGN SAYING BABY MILK FACTORY AND WHILE HE WAS BEING SEVERELY UH CENSORED AND COULD NOT MAKE ANY JUDGMENT CALL ON THIS IT WAS FAIRLY OBVIOUS THAT IT WAS A PIECE OF PROPAGANDA BUT PEOPLE WERE REALLY DOWN ON HIM FOR REPORTING THE FACT THAT TH YOU KNOW THIS IS NT A BABY MILK FACTORY HOW COULD HE SAY IT WAS UH I I THINK THAT .
THAT TO ME SHOWED THAT THE AMERICANS WERE REALLY GETTING USED TO HAVING THE NOT JUST THE FACTS BUT ALSO THE CONCLUSIONS AND OPINIONS SPOON FED TO THEM .
YEAH I I THINK PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE HAVE THAT OPINION .
THEY THEY WANT TO SIT DOWN IN FRONT OF THE TV AND UH OR AT A READ A MAGAZINE OR U S .
A TODAY AND READ IN FOUR PARAGRAPHS UH AND AND FIND OUT EVERY .
OKAY HOW DO YOU GET YOUR NEWS MOSTLY .
GENERALLY I GET MOST OF MY NEWS FROM UH THE RADIO AND THEN SOMETIMES UH IF I VE GOT TIME I LL BE READING THE FRONT PAGE OF THE NEWSPAPER .

KNO THERE YOU KNOW I YOU KNOW BASICALLY SINCE THE END OF WORLD WAR TWO THERE WAS ALWAYS YOU KNOW THAT LITTLE PROXY WAR GOING ON .

OR SUPPLIED WITH ARMS .
THE SAME WAY .
UHHUH .
YEAH BUT ON THE SAME TOKEN YOU KNOW ISRAEL HAS LOST A LOT OF THEIR YOU KNOW VALUE TO THE U S IN BEING YOU KNOW THE FOOTHOLD OF CAPITALISM .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW IN IN THE MIDEAST .
WELL I WE TEND TO BE PRETTY STRONG SUPPORTERS OF ISRAEL .
OURSELVES .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW WE S KIND OF CRINGE WHEN THEY MAKE MISTAKES BUT YET .
UHHUH .
OVERALL TEND TO SUPPORT THEM .
BUT I THINK ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING THINGS TO ME RECENTLY WAS YOU KNOW DURING THE WAR .
UHHUH .
UH IN UH KUWAIT WAS UH THE FACT THAT THEY DID NOT RETALIATE .
UHHUH .
FOR THE UH SCUD MISSILES .
THAT WERE UH LAUNCHED THERE .
THAT JUST SEEMED TO ME TO BE A UH A PHENOMENAL UH DEMONSTRATION OF RESTRAINT AND IT MUST HAVE REFLECTED UH UH SOME .
AWFUL GOOD UH DIPLOMACY ON THE PART OF THE U S .
UHHUH .
YEAH BUT ON THE OTHER HAND YOU KNOW IF THEY WOULD HAVE HAD A HARD TIME RETALIATING BECAUSE THE YOU KNOW THEY THEY WOULD NT HAVE BEEN GIVEN ACCESS TO THE FRIEND OR FOE CODES .
I SEE .
THEY BASICALLY WOULD HAVE YOU KNOW HAD A HAD A F THEY HAD THEY WOULD HAVE HAD HAD TO FLY THROUGH YOU KNOW TWO ENEMIES .
OH YOU DO NT THINK THEY GOT THE CODES FROM THE U S ALREADY .
THE U S WOULD CLAIM THAT THEY WOULD HAVE NOT GIVEN THEM TO THEM .
I SEE .
I MEAN OF COURSE YOU KNOW PUBLIC STATEMENTS CAN BE TAKEN FOR .
THAT S TRUE .
THEY CAN YET THEY .
UHHUH .
YEAH .
D .
WELL WHAT DO Y WHAT ABOUT THIS SITUATION WITH THE YOU KNOW THE UH CONTINUAL UH HARASSMENT BY IRAQ RIGHT NOW AND UH APPARENTLY FAILING TO LET THE UH ARMS INSPECTORS HAVE FREE ACCESS .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW WELL TO BEGIN WITH YOU KNOW I PRETTY MUCH QUESTION OR WHAT WHAT .
THE U S S MOTIVES WERE IN UH IN IN ACTUALLY THE ORIGINAL INVOLVEMENT .
UHHUH .
UH I THE CYNICAL SIDE OF ME SAYS THAT YOU KNOW IT WAS MORE FOR UH THE THE DOMESTIC POLITICAL SITUATION THAN FOR ANYTHING ELSE .
HUH YEAH OKAY .
YOU KNOW AND THAT YOU KNOW AND FOR PORTRAYING BUSH IS A STRONG PRESIDENT .
SURE .
UH I MEAN I REALLY I REALLY THINK THAT THAT MY GUT FEELING IS THAT THAT YOU KNOW HE PRETTY MUCH PICKED PICKED THE FIGHT WITH UH WITH UM HUSSEIN .
UHHUH .
I MEAN I M NOT NOT SAYING AT ALL THAT HUSSEIN WAS NT QUITE WILLING TO GE ENTER THAT FIGHT .
RIGHT .
BUT YOU KNOW I THINK I THINK THAT THAT UM WE CHOSE TO HAVE OUR OFFICIAL FEELINGS HURT .
UHHUH .
WHERE A LOT W .
WELL DO YOU THINK THAT UH WE SHOULD IGNORE IT AND JUST ALLOWED HIM TO GO AHEAD AND UH .
YOU KNOW MOVE ON INTO KUWAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS .
I THINK I MEAN I THOUGHT I THINK THAT UM IN THE PAST .
WE VE ALLOWED LOTS OF THINGS LIKE THAT TO HAPPEN .
UHHUH .
AND I I REALLY DO NT I REALLY DO NT THINK THAT I THINK I THINK IT WAS IT WAS THERE WERE THERE WERE A LOT .
MORE DEMOGRAPHIC RELATED INTERESTS INVOLVED THAN TRUE FOREIGN POLICY INTERESTS .
RIGHT .
UM .
YEAH WELL MAY HAVE BEEN .
YOU KNOW I M NOT SAYING THAT THAT S NOT THE CASE .
UH .
YEAH .
AND I MEAN IN IN IN ALONG THIS LINE SINCE SINCE YOU KNOW IT IT REALLY IT REALLY DID NT ACCOMPLISH VERY MUCH EXCEPT WE RE GETTING GETTING UH THE IRAQIS OUT OF KUWAIT .
RIGHT .
I JUST DO NT I JUST DO NT I I I D I I I DO NT FORESEE BUSH MAKING THE DECISION TO INVEST A LOT OF MANPOWER AND MONEY AND YOU KNOW IN IN FIGHTING A SECOND BATTLE .
NO .
UM YOU KNOW OVER OVER THE UH OVER OVER WHAT WHAT PROBABLY WO NT ACCOMPLISH HIM ACCOMPLISH MUCH FOR HIM POLITICALLY .
NO IT DOES NT LOOK LIKE WE RE GETTING READY TO DO TO DO MUCH MORE IN THERE .
UHHUH .
EVEN AT THIS POINT .
UHHUH .
YEAH .
WELL WHAT ABOUT UH DO YOU HAVE ANY ANY VIEWS ON UH ISRAEL S RELATION TO THE U S .
DO YOU .
THINK WE OUGHT TO YOU KNOW .
BACK OFF ON OUR SUPPORT OF THE COUNTRY OR WHAT DO YO .
WELL I HAVE I HAVE VERY FIXED FEELINGS ABOUT ISRAEL .
UM I THINK THAT THAT FOR A LONG WHILE WE VE WE VE HAD ALMOST A YOU KNOW HA T .
WHAT KIND OF CRIME DO YOU THINK UH IS THE MOST PREVALENT IN OUR SOCIETY .
OH BOY PROBABLY UH ROBBERIES PEOPLE STEALING FROM EACH OTHER .
SUCH AS NEW YORK CITY .
IS THAT WHAT HAPPENS UP THERE A LOT .
UH TH THAT THAT S MOSTLY WHAT .
I HEAR THOUGH IS PEOPLE GETTING RIPPED OFF AND THINGS GETTING STOLEN .
THAT S THE MOST PREVALENT CRIME .
UH THE ONES THAT REALLY YOU KNOW THE ONES .
THAT REALLY ADD UP AFTER A WHILE I GUESS YOU KNOW FROM S FAR AS INSURANCE MONEY AND STUFF LIKE THAT INSURANCE COSTS .
YOU KNOW EVERYBODY HAS TO PAY FOR IT INDIRECTLY EVENTUALLY .
YEAH I I I WONDER IF UH IF DRUG USE IS A MORE PREVALENT CRIME THOUGH BECAUSE I MEAN SO MANY PEOPLE USE IT AND EVEN THOUGH JUST USING IS NOT REALLY I MEAN IT IS A CRIME .
OH WELL YEAH THAT THAT THAT IS A CRIME .
I GUESS UH WHEN YOU WHEN YOU COUNT ALL THE LITTLE THINGS THAT PEOPLE DO LIKE UH SPEEDING IS A CRIME .
WELL THAT S TRUE .
I BREAK THAT LAW .
EVERY DAY .
BUT I WAS I I WAS STAYING IN THE REALM OF OF FELONIES VERSUS MISDEMEANORS .
UHHUH .
AND UH DRUG USE WELL ACTUALLY DRUG USE IS PROBABLY A MISDEMEANOR BUT UH WHAT KIND WHAT KIND HAVE YOU BEEN UH HAVE YOU BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SUCH A CRIME SUCH AS STEALING OR ANYTHING .
WELL I VE UH I VE BEEN CAUGHT WITH MARIJUANA BEFORE SO I GUESS THAT WAS A CRIME .
I GOT A YEAR S PROBATION FOR THAT BUT UH .
THAT THAT S NOT THAT MUCH .
I MEAN .
NO IT .
WAS NT THAT .
YOU KNOW THOSE ARE NT .
BIG A DEAL .
I .
UH WHEN I THINK OF CRIME I THINK OF STUFF THAT THAT AFFECTS OTHER PEOPLE LIKE PEOPLE GETTING YOU KNOW KILLED OR RAPED .
I THINK RAPE IS ONE OF THE WORST CRIMES .
YEAH I THINK IT IS .
I IN SOME WAYS IT S ALMOST WORSE THAN MURDER .
YEAH IT S VERY DEGRADING .
UH .
AND .
MURDER MURDER IS IS HARD ON THE PEOPLE .
THAT WERE RELATED TO .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW I MEAN IT IS A RATHER FINAL SOLUTION THOUGH .
YEAH RIGHT ONCE ONCE A PERSON S YOU KNOW GONE THEN IT S BUT THE PERSON .
THAT S BEEN RAPED HAS TO LIVE WITH THAT THE REST OF THEIR LIFE YOU KNOW .
YES .
WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK IS UH IS AN APPROPRIATE UH PUNISHMENT FOR SOME OF THE VARIOUS YOU KNOW SUCH AS THINGS SUCH AS RAPE OR OR UH MURDER .
WELL .
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
FOR FOR A LOT OF THE KIND OF PREMEDITATED MURDERS I THINK THE DEATH PENALTY IS IT S A PRETTY GOOD THING .
I AGREE WITH THAT .
THEY THEY HAVE THAT DOWN HERE IN FLORIDA STILL .
THEY .
THE ELECTRIC CHAIR AND UH .
YEAH I THINK VIRGINIA DOES TOO UP HERE .
OH DO THEY .
YEAH I THINK I THINK THAT S STILL AN APPROPRIATE PENALTY TO PAY IF THEY ABSOLUTELY SURE THEY GOT THE RIGHT GUY AND I GUESS USUALLY THEY RE THEY RE ALWAYS SURE THEY GOT THE RIGHT GUY BUT UH .
YEAH I THINK THE APPEAL PROCESS TAKES TOO LONG .
YEAH SO DO I .
I THINK I I THINK IT SHOULD TAKE FROM CONVICTION TO EXECUTION SHOULD TAKE NO LONGER THAN A YEAR .
YEAH I IF THAT .
YOU KNOW THE SOONER A A A YEAR S PLENTY OF TIME .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW FOR SOMETHING TO COME OUT I GUESS .
THEN YOU KNOW THERE S BEEN GUYS IN JAIL FOR SIX YEARS AND THE OTHER GUY ADMITS THAT HE DID IT AND THEY IT S LIKE OOPS .
BUT .
WELL YEAH I MEAN THE SYSTEM IS NT PERFECT I MEAN IT S RUN BY A BUNCH OF IMPERFECT HUMANS .
UHHUH .
YOU DO THE BEST YOU CAN TO MAKE IT PERFECT YOU KNOW YOU YOU GO OUT OF YOUR WAY TO TRY REAL HARD TO MAKE IT PERFECT .
RIGHT .
BUT I THINK YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT SOME OF THE ERRORS .
I THINK THAT MURDER .
ITSELF WOULD DECREASE SIGNIFICANTLY IF IF THERE WAS A CREDIBLE PUNISHMENT UH FOR MURDERERS .
UM YEAH I DO NT KNOW IF IT WOULD OR NOT THOUGH .
I I DO NT THINK IT S A SO MUCH OF A DETERRENT AS AS IT IS A A GOOD UH A GOOD WAY FOR VENGEANCE YOU KNOW FOR THE RELATIVES AND AND FAMILY MEMBERS YOU KNOW WHAT .
I MEAN .
AND SOCIETY PROBABLY TOO .
YEAH .
I MEAN JUST GENERAL SOCIETY TO .
YEAH IT .
KIND OF GETS .
UH .
IT OFF THEIR CHEST .
YEAH IT DOES AND AND IT DECREASES THE PRISON POPULATION .
AND WHICH IS .
YEAH I KNOW THAT .
SIGNIFICANT .
A A LOT OF THE .
I MEAN .
LOT OF MURDERS THAT YOU HEAR ABOUT ARE PEOPLE .
THAT KNOW EACH OTHER .
AND THEY RE .
YEAH .
THE KIND OF LIKE CRIMES OF PASSION AND STUFF LIKE THAT .
I DO NT THINK YOU LL EVER STOP ALL THAT STUFF DEAD BUT I Y Y YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO UH STOP PEOPLE YOU KNOW THEY RE THINKING ABOUT IT THEY KNOW THEY RE GOING TO GET THE CHAIR IF THEY GET CAUGHT .
YEAH GENERALLY THE CRIMES OF PASSION AND THINGS LIKE THAT UH ARE NOT PREMEDITATED .
RIGHT .
I MEAN THEY CAN BE BUT USUALLY THEY ARE NT .
YEAH .
THEY RE SPUR OF THE MOMENT .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND UH THE PREMEDITATED MURDERS THE ONES WHERE THE PERSON PLOTS AND PLANS WHEN YOU CATCH THOSE THOSE INDIVIDUALS I THINK THAT YOU YOU END UP WITH A UH UH HOW DO I WANT TO YOU END UP WITH A S YOU END UP WITH SOMEONE .
WHO S MORE DANGEROUS TO SOCIETY .
YEAH .
BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY COULD HARBOR THESE THOUGHTS FOR A LONG TIME .
YEAH THEY COULD P PROBABLY DO IT AGAIN .
YES THEY THEY WOULD HAVE NO PROBLEMS DOING IT AGAIN .
THAT S RIGHT THEY DID NT HAVE ANY TIME DOING IT .
THE FIRST TIME .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK LOCKING THEM UP FOR YOU KNOW FIFTY YEARS DOES NT DO A ANY GOOD BECAUSE .
NO IT .
DO .
AS A AS A TAXPAYER I M GOING TO PAY YOU KNOW ONE AND A .
UH I BASICALLY UH LISTEN TO THE NEWS FROM THE T V THAT S PROBABLY THE ONLY TIME I GET A CHANCE TO UH UH TAKE A LOOK AT IT IS THE EVENING NEWS AND AND THEN IF I M LUCKY I MIGHT BE ABLE TO HEAR SOMETHING THROUGH NEWS WISE BUT UH OTHER THAN THAT THAT S PROBABLY HOW I GET MY SOURCE UNLESS SOMETHING REALLY TRAGIC HAPPENS AND SOMEBODY TELLS ME IT ABOUT THROUGH UH UH YOU KNOW UH THROUGH CONVERSATION OR WHATEVER BUT UH MOST OF THE TIME IT IS THROUGH THE NEWS IN THE EVENING SO THAT S ABOUT THE .
YOU DO NT GET ANY NEWSPAPERS .
NEWSPAPERS NO I M NOT TOO MUCH IN READING NEWSPAPERS UH NOT THAT I DO NT ENJOY NEWSPAPERS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT UH PART OF IT IS BECAUSE I JUST DO NT FEEL LIKE I NEED THE NEED TO HAVE THEM UH WITH WATCHING THE T V OR WHATEVER WE GET OUR WEEKLY NEWS AROUND THE AREA AND I MIGHT LOOK THROUGH IT REAL QUICK IF THERE S SOMETHING THAT CATCHES MY INTEREST UH IN REGARDS TO WHAT S GOING ON AROUND THE COUNTY OR LITTLE BIT OF THE STATE BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME NOW I DO NT GET A DAILY NEWSPAPER WHERE YOU KNOW I GET TONS OF UH NEWS COMING IN THAT KIND OF STUFF .
I M KIND OF THE OPPOSITE OF YOU I GET ALL MY NEWS FROM NEWSPAPERS .
OH YOU DO .
WE HAVE WE HAVE TWO NEWSPAPERS .
YOU READ IT IN THE MORNING THEN .
YEAH TWO NEWSPAPERS IN THE MORNING .
UHHUH .
AND UH .

RIGHT .
BUT UH OTHER THAN THAT NO IT S .
AND THAT S C N N HAD THE UH EVERYBODY WAS WATCHING C N N THAT SEEMED TO BE THE PLACE TO BE .
EXACTLY EXACTLY EXACTLY SURE .
TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON ON THAT .
YEAH YEAH .
AT THAT POINT I WAS WATCHING THE T V .
UHHUH YEAH .
ON SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
YEAH WELL IT BROUGHT KIND OF UH MORE OF A VIVID UH LOOK AT WHAT WAS GOING ON WHEN THEY WERE DROPPING THE BOMBS AND JUST A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS BUT UH YEAH THAT S TRUE YOU KNOW YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT READ THE NEWS TO NEWSPAPERS TO GET THE NEWS OF WHAT S GOING ON AND UH OTHER PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW DO IT DIFFERENTLY OR DO NT EVEN WATCH ANY NEWS AT ALL SO BUT .
WELL THE THING IS WITH WITH T V I I UH A LOT OF TIMES THE THE NEWS ON UH THE LOCAL T V IS SO BRIEF YOU REALLY DO NT GET THE FULL PICTURE OF WHAT UH WHAT S GOING ON .
EXACTLY HAPPENS SURE SURE THAT S .
AND UH THAT S THAT S A PROBLEM THAT I HAVE IS NOT GETTING JUST A LITTLE BRIEF UH IDEA OF WHAT S HAPPENING BUT .
OH SURE A CLIP YOU KNOW A SENTENCE OR TWO AND THAT S ABOUT IT OF WHAT WENT ON AND UH THEY HAVE SO MUCH OTHER INFORMATION TO COVER IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME SURE .
RIGHT BUT .
MAKES SENSE .
I LIKE THE WEATHER REPORT .
YEAH .
SO I WA I ALWAY ALWAYS I ALWAYS TURN THAT ON MUMBLEX .
YEAH YEAH .
THAT S ONE PART I WATCH BECAUSE OF UH I GO SURFING DOWN HERE AND I ALWAYS .
UHHUH .
WANT TO WATCH THE WEATHER FOR WHEN THE WAVES ARE GOING TO BE GOOD .
SO YOU RE RIGHT ON THE COAST LINE YOU RE NOT UH FURTHER UP YOU RE .
YEAH NO RIGHT ON THE SOUTH FLORIDA COAST .
UHHUH SURE .
WHERE THE WEATHER IS STILL WARM HERE .
SURE I SUPPOSE YOU WATCH FOR HURI HURRICANES COMING IN AND .
YEAH .
THINGS LIKE THAT SURE .
YEAH WEATHER CHANNEL S GOOD MUMBLEX .
YEAH THAT S ABOUT THE ONLY TIME IN THE IN THE SUMMER UH IF YOU RE WATCHING T V FOR THE WEATHER EVEN THOUGH IT S VERY HARD TO PREDICT WHAT S GOING ON THEY LL KIND OF SAY WELL THERE S A THUNDERSTORM WARNING OR WHATEVER THIS IS THE WHAT IS EXPECTED BUT A LOT OF TIMES THINGS HAPPEN AND CHANGE HERE SO DRASTICALLY UH SO FAST .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW WHERE MOVEMENT THAT WAS COMING IN HAS SHIFTED OR WHATEVER SO .
I MOSTLY LOOK FOR THE STORMS OUT IN THE OCEAN .
UHHUH .
UH HUNDREDS OF MILES OUT SO I CAN PREDICT MY MY WEEK AND .
UHHUH .
WHERE I M GOING TO BE .
SURE .
SO I CAN BE AT THE AT THE BEACH WHEN THE WAVES START COMING IN .
TO TAKE OFF SURE YEAH THAT S SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD SO ANYWAY I DO NT KNOW IF OUR TIME IS GETTING UP HERE OR IT S GOT TO BE FAIRLY CLOSE TO THAT .
OKAY .
SO WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON ON DRUG TESTING .
WELL I CAN SEE IT IN CERTAIN CASES WHERE IT MIGHT BE UH SOMEBODY S IN A POSITION THAT UH PERHAPS A LOT OF LIVES ARE INVOLVED LIKE MAYBE UH PILOTS THAT UH YOU KNOW FLY JETS AND UH MAYBE PEOPLE THAT HAVE A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY OVER A LARGE MASS OF PEOPLE I COULD CERTAINLY SEE IT BEING DONE BUT IN GENERAL UH YOU KNOW WHETHER COMPANIES WANT TO DO THIS AND I KNOW THAT COMPANIES DO LIKE FACTORY WORKERS THAT HAVE LOTS OF ACCIDENTS ARE NOW BEING DRUG TESTED I KNOW A COUPLE OF CORPORATIONS THAT ARE DOING THAT UH SO YOU KNOW THEY KIND OF HAVE GOTTEN INTO THE IDEA THAT LET S DRUG TEST THEM AND LET S PUT THEM THROUGH REHAB BUT THERE S GOT TO BE LIKE A LIMITATION DO WE DRUG TEST EVERYBODY THAT COMES IN AND OR DO WE KIND OF SAY WELL YOU CAN BE DRUG TESTED AND YOU LOOK OKAY BECAUSE YOU LOOK THIS WAY YOU RE YOU RE VERY CONSERVATIVE AND AND THERE S JUST NO WAY THAT WE WOULD THINK THAT YOU WOULD USE DRUGS BUT THE GUY THAT DOES NT FIT THE STEREOTYPE OF UH THE CONSERVATIVE OR WHATEVER COULD BE DRUG TESTED AND UH YOU KNOW WHETHER LEGAL RIGHTS AND OF THAT PERSON I DO NT KNOW THERE S CERTAINLY A LOT OF THINGS TO REALLY CONSIDER UH WHEN YOU GET INTO DRUG TESTING PEOPLE JUST AT THE WORK PLACE UNLESS OF COURSE LIKE I SAID THEY HAVE A LARGE RESPONSIBILITY OVER A MASS OF PEOPLE UH THAT S ABOUT IT .
WELL YEAH IT IT IT S JUST NOT THE COM YOU RE TALKING ABOUT COMPANY S LIABILITY .
UHHUH UHHUH .
IF IF UH IF THE COMPANY IS LIABLE FOR SOMETHING THAT THAT A EMPLOYEE DOES WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF OF A DRUG YOU KNOW THEN BY ALL MEANS THEY SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO TO TO TO .
SURE SURE AND I THINK THAT S WHAT COMPANIES ARE DOING UH MORE AND MORE BECAUSE THERE ARE PRODUCTS THAT ARE OUT THERE .
TO MINIMIZE THEIR LIABILITY AND THERE S ALSO THE CASE ABOUT JUST UH UH HEALTH HEALTH AND WELFARE OF THE UH EMPLOYEES .
UHHUH .
IF A COMPANY HAS A HEALTHY WORK FORCE THEIR .
EXACTLY .
INSURANCE RATES ARE LOW .
SURE SURE .
AND NOT ONLY A NOT ONLY LOW THERE S ALL SORTS OF A OF A BENEFITS UH FINANCIAL BENEFITS ASSOCIATED .
SURE .
WITH HAVING YOU KNOW HAVING PEOPLE FILE FEWER CLAIMS BEING SICK .
EXACTLY THE ONLY THING IS .
MUMBLEX THERE THERE S THE WHOLE QUESTION THAT THAT A THAT A WORK FORCE THAT IS KNOWN NOT TO BE ON DRUGS IS GOING TO BE MORE HEALTHY I DO NT THINK ANYBODY .
EXACTLY .
WOULD ARGUE WITH THAT .
EXACTLY THE ONLY THING IS UH THE ONE ISSUE THAT I WOULD TAKE STANDS WITH IS THE FACT THAT THE DRUG TESTING ITSELF CAN BE DONE ON A PERSON THAT IS ACTUALLY NOT ON DRUGS AND COME OUT POSITIVE .
RIGHT .
IF THEY HAVE HAD LIKE UH MEDICATIONS IN THE PAST LET S SAY ONCE A MONTH OR TWICE A MONTH OR THREE TIMES A MONTH OR MAYBE THAT WEEK THEY TAKE AN ADVIL AND THE ADVIL WILL APPARENTLY COME OUT POSITIVE AS IF THEY SMOKED MARIJUANA .
RIGHT .
UH AND THERE S POPPY SEED TYPE THINGS I THINK THAT EVERYBODY IS AWARE OF THAT BUT UH WHERE S THE LINE WHERE YOU WHERE YOU SAY TO SOMEBODY I M GOING TO DRUG TEST YOU TOMORROW SO PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THESE MEDICATIONS OR WHERE S YOU KNOW HOW CAN .
WELL WEL THE QUES .
HOW YOU CAN DO IT .
RIGHT THE QUESTION BECOMES WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT SOMEBODY WHO TESTS WHO TESTS POSITIVE .
EXACTLY .
D THAT S WHERE THE REAL STICKING POINT COMES IN .
UHHUH .
IT S NOT I DO NT THINK THERE S ANY PROBLEM WITH TESTING PEOPLE .
SURE .
IT S WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE INFORMATION .
SURE EXACTLY AN AND TH THE ONLY THING THAT I WOULD SAY ON THAT IS IT COULD BLACKLIST AN EMPLOYEE LATER ON LET S SAY UH YOU VE TAKEN MEDICATION OF SOME SORT EVEN THOUGH THEY USUALLY HAVE YOU AT THE TIME LIST WHAT MEDICATIONS YOU VE TAKEN UH LET S SAY YOU DO COME OUT POSITIVE AND YOU VE TAKEN ADVIL OR ANY OF THE IBUPROFEN PRODUCTS OUT THERE OR YOU VE HAD A COLD AND YOU VE BEEN ON MEDICATION OR WHATEVER YOU COME OUT POSITIVE IS IT THEN THE CHANCE THAT THE EMPLOYER WILL LOOK AT YOU IN MORE OF A NEGATIVE FASHION AND SAY WELL YOU KNOW THIS IS KIND OF IFFY YOU KNOW ARE THEY REALLY ON DRUGS OR OR THEY ON DRUGS YOU KNOW WHAT I M SAYING WHERE .
RIGHT .
THERE MIGHT BE IN THE BACK OF THE MIND OF THE EMPLOYER THAT THIS PERSON UH IS ON DRUGS OR MAKE UP THEY MAY MAKE UP THEIR MIND THAT LET S GET RID OF THIS EMPLOYEE YOU KNOW WHAT I M .
RIGHT .
SAYING .
WELL YEAH I THINK CLEARLY THE PERSON WHO IS THE LINE OWN THE LINE MANAGER .
UHHUH .
THE EMPLOYEE SHOULD NOT BE PRIVY TO THE INFORMATION OF DRUG TESTING THAT SHOULD GO TO AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT UH AGENCY WITHIN A CORPORATION .
EXACTLY .
UH .
AND IT S A THEY CAN THAT THE IF IT DOES COME OUT POSITIVE THE FIRST TIME THEY NEED TO GO BACK AND FIND OUT WHAT MEDICATIONS DID THAT PERSON TAKE YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN IT IT S KIND OF LIKE UH I THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE AWARE AT LEAST NOW COMMON KNOWLEDGE IS THAT .
YEAH JONATHAN UH YOU .
S YOU SAY IT S NEAR AND DEAR TO YOUR HEART .
BUYING A CAR IS UH SOMETHING .
YOU RE CONTEMPLATING I TAKE IT .
UH FANTASIZING ABOUT .
UH .
CA NT DO IT RIGHT NOW .
OUR SITUATION IS THAT WE RE A TWO CAR FAMILY .

WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU LL UH WHAT KIND OF A CAR DO YOU THINK YOU LL BUY NEXT .
WELL SINCE I JUST TURNED FORTY I M THINKING ABOUT A FORTY YEAR OLD MAN S CAR SOMETHING UH SOMETHING REAL SPORTY .
UHHUH .

THIS THEIR THROAT WHEN THEY SAT IN THE BACK SEAT .
UHHUH .

I GET I WANT TO HAVE UH AIR BAGS UH BOTH DRIVER S AND PASSENGER SIDE AND FOUR DOOR BECAUSE IT S MUCH MORE CONVENIENT IF YOU RE CARRYING ANYBODY TO YOU KNOW RATHER THAN HAVE THEM STOOP DOWN TO GET OVER SO .
SURE .
I THINK THE FOUR DOOR IS PROBABLY A MAJOR REQUIREMENT AND OTHER THAN THAT UH YOU KNOW REASONABLE COST AND SAFETY AND UH AS MUCH ECONOMY AS YOU CAN GET OUT OF A CAR .
UH YOU KNOW I M NOT LOOKING FOR ONE WITH A GREAT BIG ENGINE UH .
SURE .
SOMETHING .
THAT WILL CARRY IT AROUND CAREFUL I GUESS IS BEST BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE IT .
RIGHT NOW WE VE GOT A V SIX AND IT THAT SEEMS TO BE JUST FINE .
I KNOW THEY S THEY RE COMING OUT WITH SOME V EIGHT NOW AND I THINK THAT S PROBABLY A LITTLE OVER KILL FOR THIS DAY AND AGE .
YEAH I WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT THE V EIGHTS ARE COMING BACK SO THEY VE GOT SOME .
PRETTY POWERFUL SIXES .
UHHUH .
AND UH YOU KNOW V EIGHTS SEEM TO BE A RETURN TO THE DAYS OF YOU KNOW TEN OR TWELVE MILES .
A GALLON .
RIGHT .
I UH I DRIVE A A TRUCK A FORD TRUCK .
I I LIKE TRUCKS BECAUSE THEY RE SPACIOUS AND IT S HANDY TO HAUL THINGS .
UH IT S NOT RELATED TO MY BUSINESS I JUST REALLY USE IT BASICALLY FOR TRANSPORTATION BUT THERE S SO MANY OCCASIONS WHEN I VE HAD TO MOVE SOME MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY OR DO THIS OR THAT AND IT S .
SURE .
IT S HANDY TO HAVE A TRUCK AND NOT HAVE TO BORROW ONE .
IS UH TRACTION MUCH OF AN ISSUE FOR YOU UP THERE .
TRACTION .
MUMBLEX .
UH NOT REALLY UH YOU KNOW IT S A TWO WHEEL DRIVE TRUCK AND I FIGURE IF IT S SO BAD THAT I NEED A FOUR WHEEL DRIVE I PROBABLY OUGHT TO BE HOME ANYWAY .
ACTUALLY UH PRETTY GOOD WAY OF LOOKING AT IT YEAH .
WE UH WE HAD A SMALL ACCIDENT WITH OUR MINI VAN .
WOW .
A FEW YEARS AGO .
A CASE WHERE THERE WAS A SORT OF FREAK ICE STORM AND WE WERE NT AWARE OF IT AND JUST SLIPPED ON SOME BLACK ICE AND WENT INTO ANOTHER CAR AND THIS IS A REAR WHEEL DRIVE MODEL .
SO WE GOT SOME MONSTER STUDDED SNOW TIRES AFTER THAT .
UHHUH .
HAVE NT HAD ANY PROBLEMS SINCE .
WHAT KIND OF WHAT MAKE IS THE MINI VAN .
IT S A MAZDA .
MAZDA I SEE .
AND UH WE RE PLEASED WITH IT IN TERMS OF COMFORT AND UH DRIVEABILITY .
FUEL ECONOMY IS NT GREAT BEING A MINI VAN BUT UH IT S REAL NICE FOR CARRYING AROUND OUR KIDS AND OTHERS AND .
RIGHT .
IT S UH GOT SOME NICE FEATURES IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO REMOVE SEATS AND FLIP THEM AROUND SO WE VE BEEN ABLE TO DO SOME REAL CREATIVE UH LOAD HAULING WHEN CALLED UPON .
ONE OF MY SONS HAS A A PLYMOUTH UH VAN .
UHHUH .
OR YOU KNOW UH UH THAT SAME TYPE OF THING THE VOYAGER I GUESS .
RIGHT .
AND UH THEY HAVE A A CHILD .
THAT S FIVE YEARS OLD AND IT S REALLY HANDY FOR HAULING HIM AROUND AND AND THEIR STUFF AND OF COURSE AS HE GETS FRIENDS I M SURE THAT WILL BE EVEN HANDIER .
SO I KNOW IF WE WERE IF WE HAD KIDS STILL AT HOME WE RE IN OUR FIFTIES NOW BUT IF WE HAD KIDS STILL AT HOME WE D CERTAINLY HAVE TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER A VAN JUST FOR THEIR FUNCTIONAL VALUE .
YEAH I THINK THAT WE RE GOING TO BE UH OWNING A MINI VAN FOR SOME YEARS TO COME .
PROBABLY TILL THE KIDS ARE OUT OF UH HIGH SCHOOL ANYWAY .
WHAT ABOUT UH ALL WHEEL DRIVE .
IS THAT .
SOMETHING THAT YOU D BE INTERESTED IN OR IS THAT .
UH I D BE SATISFIED WITH A A GOOD FRONT WHEEL DRIVE CAR WHEN IT COMES TIME TO REPLACE THE SENTRA .
UHHUH .
AND EVEN AS AS LIGHT AS THAT IS WITH UH THE SMALL TIRES .
IT S IT S DONE PRETTY WELL .
UHHUH .
IN WINTER UH AGAIN LIKE YOU IF CONDITIONS ARE ARE THAT BAD I PROBABLY DO NT WANT TO BE DRIVING ANYWAY .
RIGHT .
SO I KNOW I D BE HAPPY WITH A A REASONABLE UH FOUR DOOR .
YOU KNOW AGAIN WE VE WE VE GOT THE SAME ISSUE WITH GETTING KIDS INTO THE .
KAY DAVE .
WHAT KIND OF PETS DO YOU HAVE .
OH WE HAVE ONE .
ROTTEN CAT .
ONE ROTTEN CAT .
YEAH IT S MY SON S CAT .
I HEARD A LAUGH IN THE BACKGROUND .
YEAH THAT S THE BOYS .
THEY KNOW I DO NT LIKE IT .
DO NT YOU LIKE CATS .
WELL I LIKE CATS .
THIS THIS CAT IS A UH MORE LIKE A DOG .
OH YEAH .
YEAH HE S UH A ONE OWNER .
HE LIKES ONE BOY IN THE FAMILY AND THAT S ABOUT IT .
THAT S ODD .
HOW DOES HE TREAT THE OTHER PEOPLE .
JUST UH STAYS AWAY OR RUNS .
WOW .
USUALLY .
BUT HE FOLLOWS HE LL FOLLOW MY OLDEST SON AROUND .
YOU KNOW WHEN HE IS IN THE HOUSE HE WILL COME UP AND HE LL JUMP ON HIS LAP BUT IF ANYBODY REACHES OVER TO PET HIM OR WHATEVER HE LL JUST KIND OF LOOK AT THEM LIKE WHAT ARE DOING .
DID HE RAISE HIM OR SOMETHING .
HE S HE WE BOUGHT THE CAT FOR HIM AND SO HE S UH BEEN THE ONE THAT YOU KNOW SPENT THE MOST TIME WITH HIM .
BUT I I VE NEVER OWNED A CAT LIKE THAT .
I VE HAD CATS GROWING UP ALL THE TIME AND YOU KNOW THEY ARE .
UHHUH .
USUALLY EITHER THAT WAY WITH EVERYBODY OR FRIENDLY TO EVERYBODY .
HUH THAT S INTERESTING .
SO IT S A WEIRD CAT .
HUH .
WE HAVE A A MUTT .
A MUTT .
WELL WE WE NAMED IT .
HOOPER BECAUSE THAT S WHERE WE GOT IT FROM .
UHHUH .
UH SOME LADY SHE UH A LOT OF PEOPLE UH UH DROP OFF ABANDONED ABANDONED PETS AT HER HOUSE .
OH .
AND SHE USE TO WORK FOR A VETER VETERINARIAN SO SHE WOULD SPAY UH NEUTER THEM .
UHHUH .
GIVE THEM .
ALL THEIR SHOTS AND WE SAW AN AD SAYING IT WAS FREE SO WE WENT DOWN THERE AND PICKED IT UP AND IT S BEEN AN EXCELLENT DOG BUT IT S MY FIRST DOG .
I VE HAD AND WE GOT IT BECAUSE MY WIFE STAYS HERE AT HOME ALONE .
UHHUH .
WHILE I GO TO WORK SO THAT S MOSTLY WHY WE GOT IT .
TO KEEP HER COMPANY WHILE I AM AWAY AT WORK .
SO THAT IS THAT IS THAT KIND OF YOUR CHILD RIGHT NOW .
UH YEAH .
RIGHT NOW IT IT IS .
YOU FEEL LIKE .
IT .
S KIND OF GOOD TRAINING .
I MEAN WE HAVE BEEN TRYING FOR KIDS BUT .
OH UHHUH .
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE NT HAD ANY BUT IT S PRETTY GOOD TRAINING I THINK REALLY KEEPS HER ON HER TOES .
HAVE HAVE YOU HAD DOGS BEFORE .
UH MY BROTHER HAS .
UH WE DID NT DO A LOT WITH THEM .
UH I NEVER FELT LIKE IT WAS MINE OR ANYTHING YOU COULD NT DO ANYTHING .
UHHUH .
BUT I MEAN THAT DID DID MORE RESPONSIBILITY .
WHEN IT S YOURS AND NOT YOUR BROTHERS .
YEAH .
BUT .
WELL I JUST UH WE VE YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS GROWING UP I HAD WE ALWAYS HAD A DOG AND WE HAD MOSTLY MUTTS WELL NOT MUTTS BUT MIXES .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW LIKE ONE OR TWO MIX AND THOSE DOGS ALWAYS SEEM TO BE THE BEST DOGS .
THAT S WHAT .
WE FOUND .
OURS IS UH LIKE A COCKAPOO .
UHHUH .
I THINK IT S HALF COCKER SPANIEL AND HALF POODLE .
UHHUH .
BUT IT S A REALLY GOOD DOG .
YEAH .
I DO NT KNOW THEY SEEM TO BE I MEAN LISTEN BETTER OR SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
IS YOUR CAT .
A PUREBRED .
NO .
NO IT S JUST UH AN ACCIDENT .
FROM A FRIE UH FROM MY MY SON S FRIEND DOWN THE STREET .
THEY RE .
UHHUH .
THEY RE CAT WAS AN OUTSIDE CAT AND JUST END UP WITH SOME KITTENS AND SO .
WOULD YOU EVER WANT A DOG IN THE FAMILY .
UH WE I WOULD .
WE UH WE HAD A DOG .
THAT WAS A UH MIX BETWEEN AN ALASKA MALAMUTE AND A LABRADOR .
UHHUH .
AND UH I SHOULD SAY A PUP AND HE WAS JUST TOO BIG FOR OUR KIDS .
OH YEAH .
WHEN WE GOT HIM AND WE WHEN WE MOVED INTO OUR HOUSE .
THAT WAS THE FIRST THING .
WE WANTED TO GET WAS UH YOU KNOW WAS A PET AND IT WAS A DOG THAT WE GOTTEN AND HE WAS HE WAS JUST TOO BIG .
UHHUH .
UH THE KIDS COULD NT HANDLE HIM AND I WAS STILL GOING TO SCHOOL AND MY WIFE WAS WORKING AND I WAS WORKING AND SO WE JUST DID NT HAVE TIME TO REALLY TRAIN HIM SO HE WAS KIND OF JUS YOU KNOW HE WAS TOO BIG FOR THE KIDS TO HANDLE SO HE WAS JUST TIED UP TO A POST .
OH YEAH .
SO WE GAVE HIM TO UH I DO NT KNOW IF YOU VE THERE IS A PLACE OUT HERE UH CALLED SHORTIES LANE OUT HERE IN HARRISVILLE .
UHHUH .
AND THEY HAVE UH I GUESS IT S KIND OF AN ANIMAL SHELTER BUT HE JUST TAKES A FEW THE ANIMALS IN AND SOME .
HE DESTROYS AND SOME .
HE KEEPS .
UHHUH .
SO WE TOOK HIM UP THERE AND HE ENDED UP KEEPING HIM .
UH CAUSE HE HAS HAD HIM FOR SIX OR SEVEN YEARS .
WE WE VE SAW HIM JUST ABOUT A YEAR AGO AND UH I THOUGHT BOY THAT SURE LOOKS LIKE THAT PUP .
WE GAVE AWAY .
UHHUH .
AND SO WE ASKED HIM ABOUT IT .
ONE DAY AND HE SAID YEAH HE S BEEN THE BEST DOG .
I VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE .
WOW .
JUST GOES EVERYWHERE WITH HIM .
I HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT GREAT DOG .
HE JUST NEEDED A LOT OF TIME .
YEAH .
I GUESS UH UH IT S AN EASY ONE FOR ME .
I THINK THAT S UH THERE S SOMETHING SERIOUSLY WRONG YEAH .
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU ARE YOU KNOW PARTICULARLY UPSET ABOUT .
UH I GUESS UH I THINK THEY VE LOST THEIR COMPASS AND UH I M NOT SURE THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT UH UH PUBLIC EDUCATION SUPPOSED TO BE FOR ANYMORE .
BUT UH I VOTED WITH MY FEET AND UH MY KIDS GO TO PAROCHIAL SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
SO UH .
WHAT DO YOU FEEL THAT YOUR KIDS ARE GETTING IN THE PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS THAT THEY WOULD NT GET IN A THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM .
WELL ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE UH CUSTOMERS CARE .
THAT S ONE THING .
EVERYBODY CARES ABOUT THE EDUCATION .
THE KIDS ARE GETTING .
AND UH THEY UH TAKE AN ACTIVE RELATIVELY ACTIVE PART .
WHICH UH I MEAN IF YOU RE UH SENDING TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS .
THAT WAY .
EVERY YEAR YOU UH WATCH WHAT GOES ON AND YOU UH UH PAY ATTENTION AND PARTICIPATE AND AND YOU CAN INFLUENCE THE WAY THINGS ARE .
SO YOU RE SAYING THAT THE TAXPAYER .
WHO ALSO IS REALLY PAYING THROUGH THE POCKETBOOK FOR THE EDUCATION OF THE CHILD MAY NOT BE QUITE SO CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT THEY ARE PAYING THE TUITION FOR THAT CHILD IN THE FORM OF UH REAL ESTATE OR OTHER TAXES AND AND CONSEQUENTLY THEY RE NOT SO MOTIVATED TO GET INVOLVED AND MAKE SURE THINGS HAPPEN THE WAY .
THEY D LIKE TO SEE THEM HAPPEN .
YEAH .
THE IMMEDIACY JUST IS NT THERE .
UHHUH .
AND UH UH I ALSO THINK THAT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS AND ACTUALLY I DO NT THINK THIS I THINK THIS IS A CULTURAL PROBLEM .
THE UH PROBLEM WITH PUBLIC EDUCATION IS REALLY UH REALLY A PROBLEM WITH THE CULTURE .
AND I GUESS MY EVIDENCE FOR THAT IS THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN PLACES LIKE CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE WHERE ONLY A MINORITY OF THE TAXPAYERS HAVE CHILDREN IN SCHOOL AND YOU CA NT GET A TAX LEVY PASSED .
UH PEOPLE ARE UH RELUCTANT TO PASS UH SCHOOL TAX LEVIES EVEN UH WHEN THE MONEY IS NEEDED OR WOULD BE WELL SPENT BECAUSE .
IT S UH THEY DO NT HAVE KIDS IN THE SCHOOLS .
RIGHT .
I THINK THAT S A A LOSS OF CIVIC VIRTUE AND A LOSS OF UH UH THE CULTURAL ATTITUDE THAT WE USED TO HAVE THAT EDUCATION WAS FIRST EVEN IF IT WAS NT OUR KIDS .
I THINK THAT S UH THAT S THE PRINCIPAL PROBLEM IS THAT UH PEOPLE NO LONGER SEE IT AS UH AS THEIR PROBLEM AND THERE S AN IMMEDIATE PROBLEM .
RIGHT .
IT TROUBLES ME TOO THA THAT THE PRIORITY SEEMS TO BE WITH MY PARTICULAR PURSE STRINGS RATHER THAN THE PUBLIC GOOD AND BY DEFINITION FOR SOME OF US AT LEAST THE PUBLIC GOOD INCLUDES HAVING AN EDUCATED POPULACE AND THEN .
RIGHT .
IDEA THAT UH YOU CAN MAKE A SOUND JUDGMENT WITH RESPECT TO SMALL VOTES IN THE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL OR BIGGER VOTES AT .
YEAH .
THE NATIONAL LEVEL .
UH IT MEANS THAT YOU VE GOT TO BE INFORMED AND YOU VE GOT TO HAVE A CERTAIN LEVEL OF EDUCATION TO DO THE READING .
YEAH .
AND THE CRITICAL THINKING INVOLVED TO COME UP WITH A DECISION .
YOU KNOW I I BELIEVE THAT THE ORIGINAL IDEA OF PUBLIC EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES WHICH .
I GUESS WAS CONTROVERSIAL AT THE TIME OF THE CONSTITUTION .
UH YOU KNOW IT BARELY MADE IT .
I THINK IT WAS ADDED AFTERWARDS .
I THINK THE REAL THE PRINCIPAL WAS UH EDUCATION FOR CIVIC PARTICIPATION .
RIGHT .
THE IDEA WAS THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE AN EDUCATION SO THAT THEY WOULD BE A BETTER VOTER AND YOU COULD NT PULL THE WOOL OVER THEIR EYES .
RIGHT .
IT HAS TAKEN ON A MORE PROFOUND AND YOU D THINK WE D NOTICE IT ECONOMIC UH THRUST .
YEAH .
WELL THAT S EXACTLY WHAT .
I WAS GOING TO SAY .
NOW THERE SEEM TO BE REALLY THREE REASONS FOR EDUCATION .
ONE IS EDUCATION FOR CIVIC DUTY .
ONE IS EDUCATION FOR ECONOMIC REASONS .
AND ONE IS EDUCATION FOR CIVILIZATION .
I MEAN AND I THINK THAT ONE .
WELL I M GLAD THAT YOU ADDED THAT ONE .
YEAH I THINK THAT ONE S SIGNIFICANT .
THAT S WHAT .
I USED TO THINK EDUCATION WAS ALL ABOUT WHEN I WAS A COLLEGE PROFESSOR AND THEN I QUIT AND GOT DISABUSED OF THAT NOTION .
BUT UH THE UH UH NOW THE ONLY THING PEOPLE SEEM TO AGREE ON IS THAT EDUCATION IS UH AN ECONOMIC ENTERPRISE TO TRAIN PEOPLE FOR JOBS .
AND UH I M NOT SURE THAT PEOPLE IN THE EDUCATION ESTABLISHMENT REALLY KNOW WHAT .
THEIR PURPOSE IS .
AND I M REALLY SAD TO SAY THIS I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE BUT I REALLY THINK THAT UH THE EDUCATIONAL ESTABLISHMENT HAS BECOME PART OF THE PROBLEM .
AND UH THAT S WHY I GUESS I M SORT OF RELUCTANTLY UH IN FAVOR OF THESE UH CHOICE PROGRAMS .
RIGHT .
WELL I I G AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT YOU VE SAID SO FAR AND THE ONLY THAT I D WANT TO ADD IS THAT I M A LITTLE MORE IN CONTACT I THINK WITH PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS THAN PERHAPS YOU ARE UH EXCEPT AS A PARENT OF YOUR CHILD AND THE SENSE THAT I GET FROM PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS THAT I KNOW IS THAT THEY ARE VERY CONSCIOUS OF WHAT .
THEY FEEL THEY SHOULD BE DOING AND THEY ARE THE THREE THINGS THAT YOU MENTIONED .
BUT THEY FIND THAT THEY ARE ALSO BEING ASKED TO DO A BUNCH OF OTHER STUFF .
WHICH .
THEY THINK IS ONLY TANGENTIALLY RELATED .
RIGHT .
THAT S WHAT .
LIKE CONSUMER .
OKAY I GUESS IT TOOK SO I GUESS THE RECORDING HAS STARTED NOW .
YEAH .
UH .
SO HAVE YOU EVER SERVED ON A JURY .
I SERVED I WAS IN THE AIR FORCE AND SERVED ON A COURT MARTIAL UH BOARD A COUPLE OF TIMES WHICH IS VERY SIMILAR TO A JURY .
A LOT OF THE SAME RULES APPLY .
HAVE YOU EVER SERVED ON ONE .
YEAH I FINALLY SERVED ON ONE LAST YEAR .
I VE UM BEEN VOTING FOR YEARS AND I COULD NT FIGURE OUT WHY I HAD NT BEEN CALLED YET .
UHHUH .
AND I FINALLY WAS .
SO IT WAS AN INTERESTING EXPERIENCE .
I WAS KIND OF BORING .
WAS IT CIVIL OR CRIMINAL .
UH IT WAS UH .
A GRAND JURY OR .
UH IT WAS UH WELL LET S SEE IT WAS MUNICIPAL COURT .
UHHUH .
SO IT WAS A COMBINATION OF UH AND I WAS IN THE POOL FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS .
I SEE .
SO IT WAS A COMBINATION OF CRIMINAL AND CIVIL AND THEY HAD UH WELL MOST OF THE TIME .
WE WE SPENT SITTING AROUND IN THE JURY ROOM AND GETTING TO KNOW THE OTHER POTENTIAL JURORS .
UHHUH .
AND THEN IT WAS ALWAYS EXCITING WHEN WE GOT CALLED TO TO TO GO BECAUSE THEN WE THOUGHT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING ELSE BESIDES UH JUST SIT IN THE JURY ROOM .
UHHUH .
UH DID DID THE JUDGE UH HAND DOWN SENTENCES OR DID YOU FOLKS DO THAT .
UH YEAH THE JUDGE DID .
UH I UH I HAD A HARD TIME GETTING SEATED ON A JURY .
I KEPT GETTING UH I D BE QUESTIONED UH FOR EMPANELING THE JURY AND .
UHHUH .
THEY KEPT UH DISMISSING ME .
UM .
COURSE .
THEY DO NT HAVE TO GIVE A REASON BUT IT S JUST .
NO .
WHETHER THE PROSECUTOR OR THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY FEELS LIKE YOU KNOW THEY WANT TO GET THE BEST UH MIX FOR THEIR CASE SO .
THAT .
THEY ASK ALL KINDS OF WILD QUESTIONS .
THAT S A SCIENCE IN ITSELF .
YEAH WELL I KEPT GETTING CALLED UP FOR DRUNK DRIVING QUESTIONS AND I THINK PART OF IT WAS THEY DID NT UH THEY DID NT LIKE THE FACT THAT I DO NT DRINK ANY MORE .
SO .
UHHUH I SEE .
BECAUSE YOU D PROBABLY BE UH TOO PURITANICAL AND .
YEAH THAT WAS .
MUMBLEX .
PROBABLY IT ALTHOUGH IN MY CASE .
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN MORE UH SYMPATHETIC WITH THE PERSON .
WHO GOT CAUGHT I DO NT KNOW .
UHHUH .
SO UH WERE WERE THE UH SENTENCES THAT THE JUDGE HANDED OUT WHAT .
YOU THOUGHT TO BE FAIR OR WOULD IF YOU WERE DECIDING DO YOU THINK THAT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT .
WELL I WAS NEVER THERE NEVER THERE FOR ANY SENTENCING .
UH I FINALLY GOT EMPANELED ON ONE CASE UH ON MY NEXT TO THE LAST DAY AND UH WE GOT INTO THE UH JURY ROOM TO UH DECIDE THE CASE AND THERE WAS ONE .
GUY ON THE JURY .
WHO ANNOUNCED TO EVERYBODY THAT HE DID NT NEED TO DELIBERATE BECAUSE HE D ALREADY DECIDED THAT THE GUY WAS UH NOT GUILTY AND HE WOULD NEVER VOTE FOR GUILTY .
HUH .
SO UH THEY APPOINTED ME .
JURY JURY FOREMAN AND I UH DID NT THINK THAT UH GOING IN WITHOUT DELIBERATING ALLOWED US TO REACH A VERDICT SO I TOLD THE JUDGE THAT WE WERE NT WERE UNABLE TO REACH A VERDICT BECAUSE WE COULD NT GET ONE MEMBER OF THE JURY TO DELIBERATE .
UM .
SO THE WHOLE THING HAD TO BE TRIED OVER AGAIN .
WOW I BET THAT MADE HIM HAPPY .
YEAH .
YEAH IT WAS UH IT WAS FUNNY .
THE UH I JU I I DO NT KNOW I UH I DID NT UH UH I DID NT LIKE NOT BEING ABLE TO DELIBERATE .
RIGHT .
I UH I I WANTED TO VOTE GUILTY FOR THE GUY AND THE OTHER PEOPLE WERE KIND OF MIXED .
UHHUH .
SO UH THE GUY HAD TO GO THROUGH THE WHOLE THING .
ALL OVER AGAIN .
COST HIM .
A LOT OF MONEY I M SURE .
YEAH .
OH HOW MANY MEMBERS WERE ON THE JURY .
WAS IT .
A SIX OR TWELVE MEMBER JURY .
UH IT MUST HAVE BEEN SIX .
UHHUH .
YEAH .
THAT S KIND OF CURIOUS TO ME .
I DID NT REALIZE UNTIL THE UH WAYNE KENNEDY SMITH TRIAL UH A FEW MONTHS AGO THAT THEY HAD SIX MEMBER JURIES .
I THOUGHT THAT THEY YOU KNOW IT WAS ALWAYS TWELVE TWELVE MEN TRIED AND TRUE SO TO SPEAK .
UM .
BUT UH APPARENTLY FOR SOME SOME CRIMES IT S PERMISSIBLE TO HAVE SIX PEOPLE SIT IN JUDGMENT .
UM .
I KNOW ON A GETTING TO THIS UNANIMOUS THING WHETHER YOU KNOW A JURY SHOULD BE UNANIMOUS OR NOT OR NOT IN A COURT MARTIAL CASE .
IT DOES NT REQUIRE THE JURY TO BE UNANIMOUS .
IT S A SIMPLE MAJORITY YOU KNOW RULES .
YEAH .
WELL LET S .
MUMBLEX .
SEE IS IT ON UH CAPITAL CRIMES THAT THEY HAVE TO BE UNANIMOUS AND .
PROBABLY ON CAPITAL I DO NT KNOW WE WERE NT WE WE THE TWO THAT I WERE ON HAD TO DO WITH DRUGS .
UHHUH .
AND UH WE WERE UH UNANIMOUS IS ACQUITTING THE PERSON EVEN THOUGH WE IN OUR IN OUR UH GUT FELT THAT THE INDIVIDUALS WERE BOTH GUILTY JUST BECAUSE OF THE FRIENDS BECAUSE OF VARIOUS THINGS THE GOVERNMENT REALLY FAILED TO PROVE ITS CASE AND YOU KNOW BEING FAIR TO THE PERSON IF THE GOVERNMENT DOES NT PROVE ITS CASE NO MATTER HOW YOU FEEL YOU HAVE TO GO BY WHAT S OFFERED AS PROOF AND WE HAD TO ACQUIT HIM IN BOTH .
CASES .
UH IT WAS TOO CIRCUMSTANTIAL .
UH YEAH IT WAS YEAH IN SOME OF THE CRITICAL THINGS LIKE THE OFF SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS AT ONE TIME IN ONE OF THE CASES HAD VIDEOTAPED .
THIS PERSON BUT SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THE CAMERA AND THE TAPE AND .
UM .
ALL .
THEY COULD DO WAS TESTIFY .
OKAY .
SO UH MIKE WHAT ARE YOUR OPINIONS ON UH TRIAL BY JURY .
WELL I WORK FOR AN INSURANCE COMPANY SO I SEE A LOT OF UH VERDICTS .
THAT ARE PRETTY CRAZILY DECIDED .
UM BY JURIES PARTICULARLY AND I KNOW IN ENGLAND .
THE JUDGES SET ALL OF THE AWARDS .
YOU KNOW JURIES WILL DECIDE THE GUILT OR INNOCENCE BUT THEN THEY LEAVE THE AWARDS UP TO MORE LEARNED PEOPLE .
AND I THINK MAYBE THAT AVOIDS SOME OF THESE TOTALLY RIDICULOUS YOU KNOW LIKE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS .
UHHUH .
YEAH .
THAT THAT SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE BUT LEAVE IT UP TO THE MORE EXPERIENCED PERSON .
WHO KNOWS HOW IT FITS INTO THE UH KIND OF THE RATE FOR DIFFERENT MUMBLEX .
OH EXACTLY .
EACH INDIVIDUAL JURY REALLY DOES NT HAVE ANY PERCEPTION OF WHAT UM THE GOING YOU KNOW IF YOU WILL THE GOING UH AWARD SHOULD BE FOR A CERTAIN TYPE OF CASE YOU KNOW WITHIN SOME KIND OF RANGE .
UHHUH .
WHEN YOU GET ONE WAY OUT LIKE THAT BUT THEN REALLY DOES NT PEN WIND UP PENALIZING THE PERSON THAT THEY WENT AFTER .
WHO .
IT REALLY PENALIZES IS THEIR INSURANCE COMPANY .
WHICH THEN TRANSLATES INTO HIGHER RATES FOR ALL OF US .
RIGHT .
IF THEY GET SOME OF THOSE MEGA AWARDS AGAINST THEM .
YOU KNOW THEY RE NOT GOING TO SIT THERE AND LOSE MONEY .
IF THEY ARE LOSING MONEY THEN THEY RE GOING TO RAISE RATES .
RIGHT .
TH THEY HA .
SO IT .
ALL COMES FILTERING DOWN TO US .
ALL IN INDIVIDUALLY .
RIGHT .
AND UH GRANTED SOME PEOPLE NEED TO BE COMPENSATED IF THEY HAVE REALLY BEEN WRONGED .
WELL .
YOU KNOW .
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT SETTING LIKE WELL FOR EXAMPLE A CAR TYPE ACCIDENT WHERE UH OR SOME INCIDENT WHERE SOMEONE LOSES A LIMB .
DO YOU THINK THE JURY SHOULD HAVE A DOLLAR FIGURE FOR LOSING AN ARM A DOLLAR FIGURE FOR LOSING DIFFERENT BODY PARTS .
I DO NT KNOW .
YOU KNOW SOME OF THE HEALTH INSURANCE IS WRITTEN THAT WAY .
YOU KNOW THAT UH IF YOU BUY AN ACCIDENT AND DEATH OR DISMEMBERMENT POLICY YOU KNOW IT .
S PRE SPECIFIED IN THE POLICY SO MUCH BUT I DO NT KNOW THAT YOU CAN NECESSARILY PUT A A VALUE ON SOMEBODY .
S LIMB .
UHHUH .
UH ARBITRARILY THAT IS ALWAYS GOING TO FIT IN ALL CASES .
I THINK MAYBE YOU LOOK AT UH THE AGE OF THE PERSON AND THEIR STATION IN LIFE AND AND UH HOW MUCH LONGER THEY HAVE OF WORK YEARS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO PUT UP YOU KNOW WITH WITH THAT .
I MEAN MAYBE YOU DO NT AWARD AN EIGHTYFIVE YEAR OLD GUY .
THE SAME THING THAT YOU WOULD AWARD A TWENTYONE YEAR OLD .
HUH .
I I THINK IT HAS TO BE SOME KIND OF COMMON SENSE APPLIED THERE .
AND THERE MAY BE WHERE THE JUDICIARY IS A LITTLE MORE LEARNED ABOUT THAT TYPE OF THING BECAUSE THEY CAN BE SCHOOLED IN THAT KIND OF THING .
UHHUH .
AND THAT CAN BE PART OF CONTINUING EDUCATION MAYBE FOR JUDGES .
YEAH .
I DO NT KNOW .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW TO GET INTO THE ECONOMICS OF THINGS UH BECAUSE IF THEY WHEEL SOMEBODY INTO A COURTROOM AND THE JURY S HEART GOES OUT TO THAT PERSON AND THEY DO ONE OF THESE MEGA AWARDS .
YEAH .
IT REALLY YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY IS NOT PENALIZING THE PERSON THAT THEY RE TRYING FOR GET AWAY .
THAT S TRUE .
IF IT S A COMPANY YOU KNOW THAT THEY RE INSURED .
UNLESS THE AWARD IS SO STAGGERING THAT IT GOES ALL BEYOND THEIR LAYERS OF INSURANCE .
WHICH IS ANOTHER PET PEEVE OF MINE WHEN THEY DO AWARD PUNITIVE DAMAGES .
HUH .
I THINK THOSE SHOULD BE UNINSURABLE .
I THINK THOSE SHOULD HAVE TO BE PAID BY THE CORPORATION .
ITSELF .
THAT .
OH OUT OF THEI R .
THAT DID THE DAMAGE .
AS OPPOSED TO THE CORPORAT INSURANCE PAYING THE BILLS .
YEAH .
MUMBLEX .
YEAH .
UHHUH .
WELL WE RE .
FOR FOR HONEST MISTAKES WHERE THEY VE DONE SOMETHING AND AND SOMETHING HAPPENS .
ONE OF THEIR EMPLOYEES CAUSES DAMAGE OR SOMETHING .
WH .
SURE .
THAT S WHAT .
THEY BUY INSURANCE FOR .
WHO WHO DO THEY GET THEY GET INSURED THEY GET INSURED FROM OTHER INSURANCE COMPANIES OR HOW DOES THAT WORK .
WELL I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT ANY COMPANY .
UH .
OH OKAY YOUR TALKING ABOUT CORPOR .
LET S JUST SAY A LUMBER MANUFACTURING COMPANY AND .
SURE .
UH SOMEBODY IS ON THE PREMISES AND ONE OF THE EMPLOYEES ACTUALLY IS DRIVING BY WITH A FORKLIFT AND HE PUSHES THE WRONG BUTTON AND HE DROPS A LOAD OF LUMBER ON SOMEBODY AND IT INJURES .
OKAY .
THEM .
WELL .
SURE .
INSURANCE SHOULD PAY FOR THAT .
BUT IN SOME INSTANCES YOU RE GOING TO PUT COMPANIES OUT OF BUSINESS BY TAKING THAT STANCE IF THEY HAVE TO TAKE IT OUT OF THEIR OWN RETAINED EARNINGS .
WELL I M NOT TALKING ABOUT ANY LOSS .
I WAS TALKING ABOUT ONLY LOSSES .
THAT ARE JUDGED FOR A PUNITIVE DAMAGE .
WHICH IS ANOTHER CATEGORY OF THE JURIES ARE AWARDING DAMAGES THESE DAYS BASED ON THE PERSON S ACTUAL INJURIES AND WHAT .
THEY ARE DUE .
AND THEN THEY ARE AWARDING A SECOND AMOUNT AS PUNISHMENT TO THE COMPANY .
WHICH IS A L USUALLY A LOT LESS .
BUT IT S AN AN AMOUNT THEIR DESIGNED TO STING THEM .
A LITTLE FOR THEIR .
THAT .
NEGLIGENCE .
FOR OH TH .
FOR GROSS WANTON NEGLIGENCE IN A CLAIM .
UHHUH .
AND UNFORTUNATELY THE CH THE LATELY THE COURTS HAVE BEEN DECIDING THAT THOSE COULD BE PAID FOR BY INSURANCE TOO .
UHHUH .
SO AGAIN IT NEVER REALLY PENALIZES .
RIGHT .
THAT WILL .
THE COMPANY DOING THE WRONG .
THEY CAN GO RIGHT ON DOING THE SAME OLD THING .
THEY ALWAYS USED TO .
HUH .
AND IF IF THEY KNOW SOME PRACTICE IS WRONG YOU KNOW I M NOT TALKING ABOUT YOUR ISOLATED OCCURRENCES I M TALKING MORE ABOUT THE YOU KNOW THE THING THAT THEY KNOW MAYBE THEY RE WILLFULLY MANUFACTURING SOMETHING THAT THEY KNOW IS HURTING PEOPLE OUT THERE AND THEY CONTINUE TO DO IT EVEN AFTER THEY BECOME AWARE .
SURE .
OF THAT .
OKAY .
THEN I THINK THEY OUGHT TO HAVE TO PAY SOMETHING OUT OF THEIR OWN POCKET .
HI .
OKAY DO YOU WORK WITH A COMPANY THAT UH GIVES DRUG TESTING .
SORT OF I M A I M A STUDENT BUT UH .
I M IN THE NATIONAL GUARD AND THEY DO A LITTLE BIT OF DRUG TESTING .
OH THEY DO .
YEAH .
UHHUH WHAT UH DID THEY DO THAT BEFORE YOU WENT IN OR WHAT .
UH THEY THEY DO IT BEFORE YOU GO IN AND OCCASIONALLY THEY LL HAVE A A RANDOM URINALYSIS .
OH THEY WILL HUH .
YEAH SO YOU CA NT BE SMOKING MARIJUANA IN IN THE MILITARY ANYMORE .
OH OKAY WELL I VE I WORKED I DO NT WORK RIGHT NOW BECAUSE MY COMPANY I WORKED FOR P I E WENT BANKRUPT .
OH .
BUT UH THEY WAS GETTING A PROGRAM SET UP THAT FOR ALL NEW HIRES THEY WAS GOING DRUG UH GIVE THEM DRUG TESTS .
OH .
BUT UH THEY DID NT HIRE VERY MANY NEW HIRES BECAUSE ALL THE PEOPLE THAT USUALLY WORK THERE YOU KNOW JUST STAYED THERE BECAUSE IT WAS THEY HAD BEEN THERE FOR A LONG LONG TIME .
UHHUH .
BUT UH ACTUALLY I THINK THEY SHOULD DO IT .
YEAH I I BELIEVE THEY SHOULD TOO .
YOU KNOW UH I DO NT THINK ANYBODY NEEDS ANYBODY THAT S TO BE WORKING FOR THEM THAT S ON DRUGS .
UHHUH .
OF ANY KIND YOU KNOW .
YEAH DEFINITELY .
BUT UH I DO NT KNOW WHETHER I BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD JUST RANDOMLY DO IT I THINK THEY SHOULD KIND OF WARN THEM LIKE YOU KNOW WELL WE RE GOING TO DO THAT OR MAYBE TELL THEM BEFORE THEY DO GET HIRED YOU KNOW .
OH .
THAT THIS IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN AND .
UH .
THEN IF YOU DO NT LIKE IT WHY THEN YOU KNOW YOU LL HAVE TO GO LOOK FOR A JOB SOMEPLACE ELSE .
BUT AFTER YOU YOU HAVE .
TO DO RANDOMLY OTHERWISE PEOPLE WILL CHEAT .
WELL I SUPPOSE YOU ARE RIGHT THERE TOO YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
UH PERSONALLY I .
THEY I KNOW WHEN I WAS DOING MY UH BASIC TRAINING IN A I T .
UHHUH .
THERE WAS GUYS WHO WOULD FOOL AROUND AND THEN WHEN THAT URINALYSIS CAME AROUND THEY WOULD BE ALL SCARED SO IT DOES WORK IT IS EFFECTIVE .
UHHUH UHHUH HUH .
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE DONE DRUGS BUT YOU VE STOPPED AND UH YOU DO GET CAUGHT IT IS KIND OF KIND OF HARSH .
UHHUH .
YEAH .
WELL I SUPPOSE THEY FIRE YOU AND EVERYTHING RIGHT THEN HUH OR WHAT DO THEY DO WITH YOU GUYS IF THAT YOU GUYS GET .
UH WE GET COUNSELING AND UH I THINK PART OF OUR PAY IS DOCKED IF WE RE .
OH I .
FIRST TIME OFFENDERS .

UH WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT OUR UH LIKE UH OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TESTING DO YOU THINK OUR GOVERNMENT AGENCIES SHOULD TEST .
YEAH I THINK SO I THINK THEY ALL SHOULD TEST REALLY .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW UH IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THERE IS SO MUCH MORE OF IT GOING ON ANYMORE .

THAT I DO NT KNOW WHAT S WRONG WITH THE PEOPLE UH BUT I THINK THAT THE THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT STOPPING IT COMPLETELY ABOUT IT COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY YOU KNOW THEY JUST SLAP SOMEBODY S LITTLE HAND AND YOU KNOW WELL DO NT DO THAT AGAIN AND .
OH I KNOW YEAH THEY ARE NT .
AND THEN TH YOU KNOW THEY LL GET OUT AND THEY RE RIGHT BACK AT IT AGAIN .

THAT WOULD BE REALLY UNFAIR THEN HUH .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
MUMBLEX I BELIEVE YOU SHOULD HAVE THE TESTING BUT THEY SHOULD BE LIKE IF YOU GET IF YOU GET A POSITIVE THEY SHOULD DOUBLE CHECK YOU AND STILL GIVE YOU THE BENEFIT OF A DOUBT .
YEAH FIND OUT WHAT YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE BEEN TAKING SOME KIND OF MEDICATION AND YOU KNOW IF THAT WOULD EFFECT IT AND EVERYTHING .

UH YOU NAME IT AND FOR ME THIS IS THE FIRST JOB I VE HAD WHERE THEY VE COVERED THAT MUCH SO I M PRETTY SATISFIED MYSELF .
UHHUH .
UM WHAT S YOUR SITUATION .
I WORK FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND .
OH .
UH OUR BENEFITS PACKAGE IS NT UH IS NT QUITE AS GOOD IN SOME WAYS UH YOU KNOW OVERALL I M SATISFIED WITH IT WE DO NT HAVE THE VISION CARE WE DO HAVE THE HEALTH CARE AND THE UH AND THE MEDI OR THE DENTAL .
UHHUH .
UH .
ARE YOU A PROFESSOR THERE .
NO I WORK IN I M A ON THE PROFESSIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE AND TECHNICAL STAFF AND I EFFECTIVELY I RUN THE TELEPHONE SWITCH AT UH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE .
OH I SEE OKAY .
UH SO THE UH THE BENEFITS UH PROBABLY THE MAIN THING I LIKE ABOUT THE BENEFITS IS THE UH THE UH VERY GENEROUS VACATION TIME AND SICK TIME .
OH NO DOUBT .
WE GET FIFTEEN DAYS A YEAR SICK TIME AND UH WE GET TWENTYFOUR DAYS A YEAR RIGHT FROM THE DAY ONE WHEN YOU START WORK YOU GET TWENTYFOUR DAYS A YEAR UH TIME OFF .
RIGHT WELL THAT S GOOD .
YEAH .
YEAH THAT S ONE OF THE THINGS I GUESS I WOULD CHANGE ABOUT HONEYWELL IS UH I USED TO WORK WITH THE ARMY RESEARCH INSTITUTE AND BEING A UH A GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION YOU GOT QUITE A FEW HOLIDAYS OFF .
RIGHT .
BUT HERE YOU DO NT GET THAT YOU MAYBE GET TWO OR THREE A YEAR .
UHHUH .
SO IT S REALLY UNLESS YOU UNLESS YOU HAVE SOME VACATION TIME OR SOME SOME SICK LEAVE OR WHATEVER UM YOU KIND OF HAVE TO FINAGLE YOUR WAY AROUND TO GET THAT TIME .
UHHUH .
SO THAT S THAT S KIND OF A DRAWBACK I THINK BUT UH I DO NT KNOW WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER MOST IMPORTANT YOU THINK IN TERMS OF OF THE DIFFERENT BENEFITS .
WELL I THINK UH THE THE HEALTH CARE OF COURSE IS AN IMPORTANT AND HAS TO BE THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT BENEFIT .
UHHUH .
AND UH THE RATES THAT WE KEEP PAYING SEEM TO KEEP INCREASING UH .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW I M I M A LITTLE DISTURBED ABOUT THAT BUT I THINK THAT S A NATIONAL TREND AND I DO NT KNOW THAT UH I DO NT KNOW WHAT THE SOLUTION IS TO IT IT S BIGGER THAN JUST THE BENEFITS PART .
YEAH I DO NT KNOW IF YOU SAW ON TWENTY TWENTY THE OTHER NIGHT THEY UH THEY BASICALLY REVIEWED OREGON S PLAN .
UHHUH .
OR THE OREGON PLAN .
RIGHT .
TOWARD UH NATIONALIZING HEALTH CARE AND THAT KIND OF THING IT S KIND OF AN INTERESTING PLAN IT S KIND OF COLD THOUGH THEY VE ESSENTIALLY MADE UP A LIST OF UH OH ALL THE DIFFERENT UH MEDICAL MALADIES THAT YOU CAN HAVE .
OH YEAH .
AND THEN BASICALLY MADE A CUTOFF ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTYSEVEN AND BELOW WILL NOT BE COVERED BY BY UH SUBSIDIZED HEALTH CARE AND THE ONES ABOVE WOULD .
UM .
SO IT S KIND OF LIKE DRAWING THIS LINE AND AND IF YOU HAVE IT GREAT IF YOU DO NT YOU RE KIND OF OUT OF LUCK .
UHHUH .
BUT UM IT WAS KIND OF AN INTERESTING SHOW .
UM .
I THINK YOU RE RIGHT I THINK HEALTH CARE IS PROBABLY THE THE MOST PRESSING .
RIGHT .
UH THE PRESSING ONE BUT I LL TELL YOU I I DO NT MIND HAVING DENTAL YOU KNOW SOMETIMES DENTAL COSTS CAN BE UM JUST ABOUT AS EXPENSIVE IF NOT MORE AND I KNOW HISTORICALLY A LOT OF COMPANIES I THINK CARRIED DENTAL AS A RIDER ALONG WITH THE MEDICAL .
UHHUH .
BUT I M NOT SURE THAT S THAT S WIDELY FOLLOWED ANY MORE I M NOT SURE HOW HOW DOES UH UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE HANDLE IT .
WELL WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT PLANS THAT WE CAN SUBSCRIBE TO UNDER DENTAL UH DEPENDING AND AND THE COST BETWEEN THEM IS VERY IS VERY LITTLE I THINK IT COSTS ME SOMETHING LIKE FIVE DOLLARS A A MONTH FOR THE DENTAL PLAN .
UM .
BUT IT PAYS UH A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT I MEAN THE EXAMINATIONS AND AND UH CHECKUPS EVERY YEAR OR EVERY SIX MONTHS ARE FREE .
GREAT .
AND UH IT IT COVERS THE BULK OF THE DENTAL EXPENSES .
IS THAT UH LET ME INTERRUPT IS THAT THE SAME FOR BOTH UH PROFESSORS AND AND ALSO STAFF AND ADMINISTRATION IS THAT GENERALLY ACROSS THE BOARD DO YOU THINK OR .
UH YES IT IS THE BENEFITS PLAN IS DIFFERENT FOR OPERATING FOR WHAT WE CALL OPERATING STAFF WHICH ARE CONSIDERED TO BE UH CLERICAL PERSONNEL ACCOUNTANTS THINGS LIKE THAT .
RIGHT .
AS OPPOSED TO WHAT THEY CALL THE P A T STAFF WHICH I BELONG TO .
UHHUH .
BUT THE MAIN I THINK THE THE HEALTH AND ALL THAT AND THE DENTAL IS THE SAME FOR EVERYBODY AND THE RETIREMENT PLAN BUT .
UHHUH .
THE MAIN DIFFERENCE IS IN THE UH THE WAY SICK TIME IS ACCRUED AND VACATION TIME IS ACCRUED .
OH OKAY .
UH FOR THE OPERATING STAFF IT S ON A SENIORITY IT S YOU KNOW BASED ON HOW LONG THEY VE WORKED THERE .
RIGHT .
THAT DETERMINES HOW MUCH UH VACATION TIME THEY GET .
YEAH I M KIND OF INTERESTED BECAUSE I M ACTUALLY THAT S THE ROUTE I D LIKE TO TAKE WHEN I FINALLY GET MY DEGREE .
UHHUH .
IS TO UH IS TO TEACH IN A UNIVERSITY .
UHHUH .
I M A DOCTORAL STUDENT IN FLORIDA RIGHT NOW .
OH .
BUT UH YEAH THAT S THAT S INTERESTING THAT S ONE OF THE THINGS I D LIKE TO THINK ABOUT IS IN WHAT KIND OF BENEFITS THEY WOULD UH THEY WOULD COVER AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
COLLEGE PROGRAMS BELONG TO THIS T I A A UH C R E F RETIREMENT FUND .
OH IS THAT RIGHT .
RIGHT AND IN THE CASE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE UH .
UH I VE HAD UH THREE BOYS THROUGH I GUESS UH SOME CHILD CARE EACH ONE OF THEM AND NOW THEY RE IN SCHOOL SO IT S ALL OVER BUT UH I GUESS I WOULD SAY IT S NOT EASY TO FIND WHA WHAT .
MOST PARENTS WOULD WANT .
WELL I CAN PROFIT BY THIS BECAUSE I M DUE WITH MY FIRST IN ABOUT THREE MONTHS .
IS THAT RIGHT .
I GUESS UH THE ONLY RULE UH I CAN THINK OF IS THAT I LIKE TO LOOK FOR PLACES WITH UH GOOD RESPECTABLE NONPROFIT BEHIND THEM LIKE A UNIVERSITY OR A HOSPITAL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
IF THEY RE ASSOCIATED WITH A COLLEGE OR A UNIVERSITY THEY RE USUALLY A PRETTY GOOD BET .
HUH .
UH I THINK IT S SORT OF THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT .
YOU WOULD WANT WHEN YOU BUY A CAR OR REFRIGERATOR .
SOMETHING .
YOU D LIKE TO GET IT FROM SOME GOOD CUTTHROAT CAPITALIST COMPANY BUT NOT WITH CHILD CARE .
I GUESS NOT USU I SUPPOSE YOU RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE .
YEAH .
FOR PROFIT .
UHHUH .
PLACES I WOULD REALLY LOOK AT THEM AWFULLY CAREFULLY BUT UH WHEN I WAS WHEN MY KIDS WERE YOUNG I WAS TEACHING AT A UNIVERSITY AND UH THE CHILD CARE CENTER ASSOCIATED WITH OUR UNIVERSITY WAS QUITE GOOD SO .
UHHUH .
I FELT CONFIDENT THAT THEY D DO RIGHT .
OF ARE NT DO NT THEY .
KIND OF USE .
THEM FOR EVERYBODY KIND OF USE .
THEM FOR GUINEA PIGS .
FOR THEIR PER FOR THEIR PET THEORIES OR SOME SUCH THING .
OH YOU MEAN UH LEARNING TYPE UH YEAH .
YES .
I MEAN ACTUAL EXPERIMENTS THEY WOULD HAVE TO GET YOUR PERMISSION .
BUT YEAH I SUPPOSE UH IF YOU RE IF THERE IS A PSYCHOLOGY DEPARTMENT OR AN EDUCATION DEPARTMENT AROUND YOU MIGHT FIND YOU MIGHT FIND THAT THEY RE PUSHING ONE FORM OF EDUCATION OR ANOTHER I GUESS THAT S TRUE .
BUT UH I NEVER HAD BAD EXPERIENCE IN THAT RESPECT .
OF COURSE YOU ALSO TEND TO GET PEOPLE .
THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE UNIVERSITY AND THE HOSPITAL AS THE PARENTS AND THEY YOU KNOW PRETTY GOOD PEOPLE .
UM .
WELL THE THING .
I REALLY WORRY ABOUT IS UH THE SEXUAL ABUSE CASES YOU READ ABOUT .
UHHUH .
AND I MEAN YOU D JUST FEEL AWFUL IF SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAPPENED .
YEAH .
I NEVER REALLY WORRY VERY MUCH ABOUT IT .
I TEND TO THINK THOSE ARE VERY RARE BUT QUICKLY EXPLOITED AND MADE PUBLIC SO I .
UHHUH .
NEVER REALLY WORRIED TOO MUCH ABOUT THAT BEING UH UH THE CASE WITH MY BOYS .
OH .
UH I YOU KNOW I THINK THOSE THINGS GET INTO THE HEADLINES IMMEDIATELY WHEN SOMEBODY FINDS OUT ABOUT THEM BUT .
UHHUH .
I DO NT THINK IT S AS COMMON AS UH THE NEWSPAPERS WOULD MAKE YOU BELIEVE .
UHHUH .
AND ANOTHER THING IS COST .
OH YEAH .
I MEAN THAT .
I KNOW SO MANY OF MY FRIENDS I WENT TO SCHOOL WITH WHO ARE HAVING BABIES RIGHT NOW AND THEY FINDING IN SOME CASES THEY RE FINDING IT S JUST NOT WORTH IT TO WORK BECAUSE IT S ALL GOING OUT IN DAYCARE .
RIGHT .
UM .
WELL IN OUR CASE WE MADE THE DECISION THAT MY WIFE WOULD STAY HOME UNTIL THE BOYS WERE UH IN SCHOOL .
AND I M REALLY HAPPY WE DID IT ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY VERY DIFFICULT .
AND .
UM .
I THINK IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND WE WERE UH WE JUST DECIDED THAT WE WOULD DO IT AND WE WENT AHEAD BUT UH NOT EVERYBODY CAN MAKE THAT CHOICE AND EVEN EVEN THOUGH MY WIFE WAS NT WORKING WE DID HAVE UH ONE OR ANOTHER OF THE BOYS IN UH CHILD CARE FOR PARTTI JUST FOR PART OF THE DAY .
UH OR A COUPLE OF DAYS .
A WEEK JUST SO THAT UH OTHER THINGS COULD GET DONE AROUND THE HOUSE AND SO ON SO .
HUH .
SO WE DID LOOK AROUND .
I THINK MY WIFE IS MUCH BETTER THAN I AM AT THAT WALKING INTO A PLACE AND GETTING A FEELING FOR WHETHER IT IS A LOVING AND CARING PLACE OR NOT AND UH .
HUH .
SO I WOULD ALWAYS TRUST HER JUDGMENT ON THAT .
HUH .
WELL I M JUST THANKING HEAVEN .
MY HUSBAND JUST GOT A NEW JOB .
HIS LAST COMPANY HE WAS ONLY WORKING FOUR DAYS .
A WEEK .
UHHUH .
SO IT S AND HE JUST GOT A NEW JOB .
HE .
S GETTING LOTS OF OVERTIME HE GOT A PAY RAISE AND SO I M JUST GRATEFUL THAT WE DO NT HAVE TO WORRY SO MUCH ABOUT MY WORKING OR NOT .
THERE S ABSOLUTELY NO QUESTION THAT YOU RE GOING TO BE THE BEST CHILD CARE PROVIDER FOR THAT KID SO YEAH DO IT AS LONG YOU CAN .
I SUPPOSE .
BUT I THINK YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO LOOK THROUGH A PLACE AND YOU HAVE TO GET A FEEL FOR UH HOW THEY TREAT THE KIDS AND UH UH WHAT KIND OF STAFF MEMBERS THEY HAVE AND .
UHHUH .
HOW MUCH TURNOVER .
THEY HAVE AND THINGS LIKE THAT BEFORE YOU .
UHHUH .
COMMIT YOUR CHILD TO THEM .
AND I THINK YOU HAVE THE MAIN THING IS THAT YOU HAVE TO DETERMINE THAT THEY RE PERFECTLY OPEN .
THAT YOU RE WELCOME ANYTIME WITHOUT NOTICE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY AND SO FORTH AND IF THEY RE AT ALL QUEASY ABOUT THAT THEN .
YOU HAVE TO START WONDERING IF THEY DO NT WANT YOU .
I D LOOK ELSEWHERE YEAH .
YES .
RIGHT .
HUH .
YOU HAVE OTHER FRIENDS .
THAT HAVE KIDS UH BEING TAKEN CARE OF IN UH CHILD CARE .
UH I HAVE ONE BUT I HAVE NT REALLY HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO HER ABOUT THAT FOR A WHILE .
UHHUH .
SO .
BUT I REALLY THINK THE NEWS REPORTS ARE UH TEND TO SENSATIONALIZE THE PROBLEMS .
UHHUH .
I THINK THE PROBLEMS ARE MORE ONES OF COST AND RESOURCES AND UH PAY AND EXHAUSTION AND .
YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE THAT RATHER THAN THESE UH UH REALLY WILD ABUSE CASES THAT YOU READ ABOUT BECAUSE IT MAKE GOOD COPY .
THIS IS TRUE .
YEAH .
CURRENT AFFAIR CAN .
GET SEVERAL SHOWS MUMBLEX CHILD CASES .
UHHUH .
WELL .
UH LET S SEE .
HOW ABOUT UH LET S SEE ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO UH WHAT DO YOU THINK WAS DIFFERENT TEN YEARS AGO FROM NOW .
WELL I WOULD SAY AS FAR AS SOCIAL CHANGES GO UH I THINK FAMILIES WERE MORE TOGETHER .
THEY THEY DID MORE THINGS TOGETHER .
UHHUH .
UH THEY ATE DINNER AT THE TABLE TOGETHER .
UH THE PARENTS USUALLY TOOK OUT TIME UH YOU KNOW MORE TIME THAN THEY DO NOW TO COME WITH THE CHILDREN AND JUST SPEND THE DAY DOING A FAMILY ACTIVITY .
UHHUH .
UH ALTHOUGH I M NOT A MOTHER I I STILL THINK THAT UH A LOT HAS CHANGED SINCE TEN YEARS AGO .
UH WHAT DO YOU .
WE .
THINK ABOUT THAT .
WELL UH ACTUALLY TEN YEARS FROM TODAY SEEMS RATHER SHORT .
YEAH .
UH BUT I DO AGREE THAT UH GENERALLY IT S SOCIETY HAS SORT OF UH LET S SEE RUSHED EVERYTHING AHEAD .
UHHUH .
AND UH I DO NT KNOW IT LEAVES LEAVES A LOT OF TIME OUT FOR FAMILY AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
IN OTHER WORDS THEY JUST PRIORITIZE THEIR LIVES DIFFERENTLY .
BUT I THINK THAT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH ECONOMIC SITUATION .
YES .
WHAT ABOUT LIKE AS FAR AS UH SOCIAL CHANGES IN THE INDIVIDUAL .
DO .
UH .
YOU THINK THAT THE INDIVIDUAL HAS AS MUCH TIME AS THEY DID LET S SAY TEN TWENTY YEARS AGO .
UM .
IT DEPENDS .
UH IT S HARD TO SAY BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE WERE BUSY TEN TWENTY YEARS AGO TOO .
UHHUH .
UH I JUST .
WELL HOW HOW OLD ARE YOU .
I M TWENTYEIGHT .
TWENTYEIGHT .
OKAY I M TWENTYTHREE .
YEAH .
SO THERE S MAYBE A FIVE YEAR GAP BETWEEN US .
YEAH .
SO UH .
I JUST I THINK THAT THINGS WERE A BIT WERE HAVE BEEN BUSY ALL ALONG .
IT S JUST .
HUH .
A MATTER WHERE PRIORITIES ARE AT PLACED .
YES .
AND THAT UH USUALLY AS FAR AS FAMILIES ARE CONCERNED THERE USED TO BE JUST ONE PERSON WORKING AND USUALLY THE OTHER PARENT WAS HOME .
UHHUH .
AND NOW UH IT S PRETTY MUCH AN ECONOMIC NECESSITY OF FOR MOST IN MOST PLACES FOR BOTH .
PARENTS TO WORK .
DO YOU THINK IT S AN ECONOMIC C NECESSITY OR DO YOU THINK THAT WE RE WE RE UH ALL TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH A CERTAIN STANDARD OF LIVING .
I THINK THAT S PART OF IT TOO .
BUT I DO THINK .
I MEAN DO YOU THINK .
PEOPLE REALLY NEED TWO CARS AND .
NO NO .
I DO NT .
A HOUSE IN THE SUBURBS OR .
NO I DO NT THINK THAT .
BUT THEN THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE .
THAT THAT DO NT HAVE THAT .
UHHUH .
BUT THAT REALLY DO NEED TO WORK .
UHHUH .
I THINK MAYBE THOSE PEOPLE .
THAT REALLY DO NEED TO WORK BOTH .
PARENTS JUST TO SURVIVE .
AND .
YEAH .
THEN THERE TH IS IS THAT OTHER GROUP .
THAT IS .
UHHUH .
WORKING TO MAINTAIN A STANDARD OF LIVING .
OKAY .
THAT UH THEY THINK IS IS SURVIVING WHICH IS REALLY MORE LUXURIES .
UHHUH .
UH BUT I .
I TEND TO THINK THAT IT S LESS THOSE PEOPLE .
THAT HAVE THE TWO CARS AND EVERYTHING THAN IT IS THE GROUP .
THAT IS JUST TRYING TO SURVIVE .
YO SO YOU THINK IT S WHICH GROUP ARE YOU SAYING IS THE ONE TRYING .
I M SAYING THAT THE UH THE GROUP .
THAT IS JUST TRYING TO SURVIVE FROM DAY TO DAY WHERE BOTH .
PARENTS ARE WORKING .
UHHUH .
IS MORE OF THE MAJORITY THAN THE THAN THE PEOPLE .
THAT HAVE THE HIGHER STANDARD OF LIVING .
BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT ECONOMICS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AND STATISTICS ON WHO HAS THE MONEY AND WHO .
THE DECREASING UH MIDDLE CLASS IN THIS COUNTRY .
UHHUH .
I THINK THAT THAT S IN MY OPINION THE CASE .
OKAY .
SO .
I MEAN I HAVE MET PEOPLE .
THAT UH BOTH .
THAT THAT JUST WANT TO MAINTAIN A THE STANDARD OF LIVING AND THOSE .
THAT THAT REALLY NEED THE JOB .
OKAY .
AND THEN SOMETIMES I I OFTEN UH FIND THAT MAYBE THERE S SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS AVAILABLE TO US .
YO A MICROWAVE A V C R A ANSWERING MACHINE .
UHHUH .
A YOU KNOW A SPECIAL A DISHWASHER UH A REFRIGERATOR AND SOME OF THOSE ITEMS UM FOR THE FOR THE UH WELL I GUESS WE RE STICKING MORE TO SOCIAL CHANGES BUT UH .
UHHUH .
PEOPLE WANT ALL OF THAT AND NOT ALL OF THOSE ARE NECESSITIES .
RIGHT .
SO THEY RE TRYING TO IT HAS BECOME A NECESSITY .
THINK ABOUT THIS .
UH DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN IN SCHOOL .
I DO .
UH I HAVE TWO .
THAT ARE UH NOW JUST ABOUT READY TO GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE .
UH .
BUT I ALSO HAVE TWO .
THAT ARE JUST ENTERING SCHOOL .
UH .
SO YOU SEE A BIG DIFFERENCE THEN IN BEFORE AND .
UH WELL .
NOW DO YOU OR .
I THINK THEY RE JUST PUSHING THEM .
MU ENTIRELY TO FAST .
A LOT OF TESTING .
UH WELL IT SEEMS TO ME THAT KINDERGARTEN IS NOW THE EQUIVALENT OF FIRST GRADE .
UHHUH .
MY SON LEAVES THE HOUSE AT SEVEN THIRTY AND DOES NT GET HOME UNTIL THREE OCLOCK .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK THAT S SUCH A LONG DAY FOR A KINDERGARTNER .
I DO TOO I OH I THINK THAT S AWFUL .
AND UH I HAVE A PRESCHOOLER .
UH I WAS TOLD BY HER PRESCHOOL TEACHER THAT SHE THOUGHT MAYBE SHE WAS TO IMMATURE FOR KINDERGARTEN AND I THOUGHT WELL HOW MATURE DO YOU HAVE TO BE .
I KNOW .
WHAT S THE NEW CRITERIA HUH .
AND UH THERE IS A DO YOU HAVE THE STANDARDIZED TESTING NOW .
WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF TESTING AND IT S OVER AND OVER .
IT .
S .
I T B S OR AND UH JUST EVERYTHING EVERYTHING .
YEAH .
AND THEY TEST TEST TEST .
I LIVE IN PLANO ACTUALLY AND I DO NT KNOW IF YOU VE HEARD OF PLANO BUT .
NO .
IT S A VERY TRANSIENT COMMUNITY .
A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM EVERYWHERE IT S JUST NORTH OF DALLAS .
UHHUH .
AND IT S GROWN IN LEAPS AND BOUNDS .
I WE MUST HAVE MAYBE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE NOW .
OH .
AND MOST OF THEM FROM OTHER PLACES .
YEAH .
UH J C PENNEY S COME DOWN FROM NEW YORK AND OF COURSE T I AND XEROX FROM ROCHESTER AND WE JUST .
HAVE LOTS OF PEOPLE FROM EVERYWHERE .
YEAH .
LOTS OF INDUSTRY COMING IN .
AND IT S A VERY WEALTHY COMMUNITY .
UH NOT THAT I AM BUT OTHER PEOPLE SEEM .
TO BE AND I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW WHY BUT I MEAN THEY DO .
THEY HAVE .
YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT .
THEY RE DOING RIGHT .
I I WOULD I REALLY WOULD .
I MEAN THEY JUST HAVE BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL HOMES AND THEY HAVE EVERYTHING .
THE KIDS ONLY WEAR NAME BRAND THINGS TO SCHOOL AND IT S ONE OF THESE THINGS .
OH ME .
WELL THAT MAKES IT HARD FOR YOU DOES NT IT .
WELL IT DOES YOU KNOW .
IT REALLY DOES BECAUSE I M A SINGLE MOM AND I HAVE A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD NOW AND .
OH ME .
UH YOU KNOW IT DOES .
I MEAN WE DO IT TO A POINT BUT .
YEAH .
UH NOT TO WHERE SHE FEELS DIFFERENT BUT .
IT S HARD TO EXPLAIN TO THEM WHY YOU CA NT .
SOME OF THEM ARE VERY RICH AND SO UH WE JUST KIND OF HAVE .
EVERYTHING HERE AND WE HAVE A VERY GOAL ORIENTED POPULATION BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS ARE .
RIGHT .
AND SO I DO NT KNOW HOW MUCH OF IT .
IS US AND HOW MUCH OF IT IS TEXAS BUT THE KIDS ARE EXPECTED TO EXCEL IN .
EVERYTHING .
OH DEAR .
AND IT S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE YOU HAVE SO MANY CHILDREN AND JUST SO MANY ACTIVITIES THAT EVERYBODY CA NT BE FIRST AND THEY RE .
RIGHT .
EXPECTED TO BE .
YOU KNOW THEIR PARENTS EXPECT IT THE TEACHERS EXPECT IT TEXAS WANTS VERY BADLY TO BE CONSIDERED TOPS IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM .
RIGHT .
AND IF YOU READ NATIONAL SURVEYS THEY RE FAR FROM IT .
AND SO THERE S JUST A WHOLE LOT OF TESTING AND A WHOLE LOT OF PUSHING TO DO WELL ON THESE TESTS .
HOW ABOUT THE KIDS .
HOW ARE THEY COPING WITH IT .
WELL NOT VERY WELL .
THEY BRING HOME NOTES .
THAT SAY THEY HAVE TO GET A GOOD NIGHT S SLEEP .
HUH .
AND EAT RIGHT IN THE MORNING BEFORE .
TESTS .
I MEAN THEY MAKE A BIG DEAL .
TO ME THE PAPER SHOULD JUST BE PUT ON THE DESK .
THAT DAY AND SAY JUST DO THIS .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW I JUST FEEL THEY DO BETTER THAT WAY .
YEAH .
RATHER THAN .
AND .
ANTICIPATING .
YEAH .
AND AND I HAVE OLDER CHILDREN TOO THAT NOW ARE OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND THEY VE ALWAYS DONE THIS HERE .
I MEAN IT S ALWAYS BEEN THE SAME BUT IT IS IT S GETTING WORSE AND WORSE IS MORE PRESSURE FOR EVERYTHING .
AND I JUST THINK IT S REALLY AWFUL AND I I M WITH YOU ON THAT .
YOU DO NT HEAR TOO MANY PEOPLE SAY THIS BUT I THINK IT S A VERY LONG DAY .
OH IT IS .
AND MY FEELING IS THAT YOU KNOW YOU RE ONLY A KID ONCE AND YOU DO NT WANT TO .
THAT S RIGHT .
SPEND YOUR WHOLE LIFE IN SCHOOL .
MY SON SAID THAT CAME HOME AND HE SAID HE SAID MOM ALL .
WE DO IS WORK .
UHHUH UHHUH .
WE HARDLY EVER PLAY AND .
AND I DO NT THINK THAT S RIGHT .
I THINK WE SHOULD DO WHAT .
EUROPE DOES AND INCLUDE CULTURAL ACTIVITIES IN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM .
OH LIKEWISE .
I DO NT THINK I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR DANCING LESSONS GYMNASTICS PIANO .
RIGHT .
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THOSE THINGS INCLUDED IN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM .
WOULD NT THAT BE GREAT .
BECAUSE I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE WELLROUNDED KIDS .
UHHUH .
NOT JUST BOOK SMART KIDS .
RIGHT .
AND SO I JUST FIND THIS A REAL PROBLEM .
I THINK IF THEY RE GOING TO BE THERE ALL DAY THEY SHOULD FIND TIME .
ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS ONCE WAS OUT OF SCHOOL WITH MONO IN HER JUNIOR YEAR .
I THINK IT WAS .
AND SHE HAD A HOME TEACHER FOR LIKE FOUR HOURS .
A WEEK AND WHEN SHE WENT BACK IN SIX WEEKS SHE WAS AHEAD .
SO WHAT .
IS THAT RIGHT .
DOES THAT TELL YOU .
IT TELLS YOU .
THERE S A WHOLE .
OH MY GOSH .
LOT OF WASTED TIME .
OH MY GOSH .
AND THEY COULD BE USING THIS TIME BETTER .
WELL FOR EXAMPLE IN MY SON S KINDERGARTEN .
THEY RE REALLY FINISHED AT LUNCH TIME .
AFTER LUNCH THEY HAVE SOME UH I M TRYING TO THINK IF THEY HAVE RECESS AFTER LUNCH AND THEN THEY HAVE NAPS OR REST PERIOD .
UHHUH .
AND UH I THINK EITHER SEND THEM HOME OR DO SOMETHING .
THAT S A VERY LONG DAY FOR KINDERGARTNERS .
A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING .
I AGREE .
BUT I THINK THAT WORKING PARENTS HAVE KIND OF DEMANDED THIS .
I WOULD NT BE SURPRISED .
YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY DO NT THEY DO NT WANT TO SEND THEM TO DAYCARE .
I DOUBT IF THEY WOULD SAY IT WAS TOO LONG .
THAT S WHY THEY WANT THEM THERE BECAUSE THEM .
SOMEBODY TAKES CARE OF THEM .
ALL DAY .
UH DO YOU HAVE THE BEFORE SCHOOL CARE .
AT YOUR SCHOOL AND THE AFTER SCHOOL CARE .
WE HAVE THEM AT ONE SCHOOL LIKE .
I DO NT BELIEVE THAT WE RE .
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT UH RECYCLING PROGRAMS IN ATLANTA JULIE .
THE RECYCLING PROGRAM HERE IS JUST TERRIBLE .
I MEAN IT S HARD TO FIND PLACES TO GO .
I MEAN KROGER DOES A COUPLE THINGS .
THEY I DO NT THINK THEY DO THEY DO NEWSPAPERS .
I DO NT KNOW THERE S THERE .
S BIG BINS OUT THERE I DO NT KNOW IF THEY EVER GET I I REALLY DO NT KNOW WHAT .
THE DETAILS ARE .
THERE SHOULD BE SOMEPLACE WHERE YOU COULD CALL AND FIND OUT .
AS A MATTER OF FACT I M PRETTY SURE THERE S A PLACE .
YOU CAN CALL AND FIND OUT THE CLOSEST YOU KNOW THING TO YOU BUT I THINK THERE SHOULD BE SOME KIND OF CURBSIDE SERVICE .
YEAH .
THAT S THE ONLY WAY .
I COULD REALLY .
THE ONE IN FLORIDA IS SO COOL BECAUSE THEY PICK UP EVERYTHING .
THEY PICK UP NEWSPAPERS AND UH YOU KNOW MILK JUGS AND ALUMINUM AND TIN CANS YOU KNOW LIKE SOUP COMES IN AND STUFF .
UHHUH .
THEY PICK UP EVERYTHING .
DURING THE SUMMERS LIKE THE AROUND WHERE I LIVE THE UH HOMELESS PEOPLE SEE I MEAN THEY .
ALL HAVE LIKE SHOPPING CARTS AND .
UHHUH .
STUFF AND THEY RE GO AROUND AND COLLECT CANS .
UHHUH .
AND ALUMINUM AND STUFF AND SO WE USED TO JUST SAVE THEM UP AND THEN THEY D COME AROUND AND WE D GIVE THEM TO THEM .
UHHUH .
BUT WHEN DURING THE WINTER TIME .
I THINK THEY THEY MOVE SOUTH OR SOMETHING .
YEAH .
SO I DO NT DO THAT ANYMORE .
AND THE THE RECYCLING AT GEORGIA TECH LIKE THAT UH OUTSIDE THE UH STUDENT CENTER .
UHHUH .
THEY NEVER EMPTY THOSE THINGS .
I KNOW IT I KNOW IT .
THEY JUST OVERFLOW .
IT PILES UP .
SO WHAT S A GUY TO DO .
YOU KNOW .
I JUST DO NT KNOW .
I ASKED MYSELF .
I JUST DO NT KNOW AND NOW THEY HAVE LIKE BINS AND STUFF .
THAT ARE A LITTLE .
MORE CONVENIENT BECAUSE MEAN UNTIL SEVEN OCLOCK YOU GOT TO PAY TO PARK AT THE STUDENT CENTER YOU CA NT REALLY UNLOAD ALL YOUR STUFF .
REALLY .
HUH OH YEAH THAT S TRUE HAD NT THOUGHT ABOUT THAT .
THAT IS VERY INCONVENIENT .
UHHUH .
INCONVENIENT EVEN .
I KNOW IT I KNOW IT .
BUT UH SO YOU DO RECYCLE DO NT YOU .
OH YEAH .
YEAH I M KIND OF I M KIND OF BAD ABOUT IT .
THE MUMBLEX .
IF I IF SEE A S IF I SEE A PILE OF CANS OR BOTTLES OR SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
I LL THROW IT IN THERE BUT I DO NT REALLY I DO NT EVER TAKE ANYTHING .
WELL I MEAN IT S REAL YOU OUGHT TO BECAUSE THE THE THE FARMER S MARKET RECYCLES ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING .

UHHUH .
AND THEN GO AND HAND THEM TO THEM .
THE NEXT TIME AND USE THEM OVER AND OVER .
UHHUH .
A BUT ALSO MOST PLACES LIKE BIG STAR DOES AND I M NOT SURE IF KROGER DOES OR NOT BUT .
THEY LL ASK YOU WHETHER YOU WANT BAGS OR PAPER OR PLASTIC .
YEAH AND THEY THEY HAVE LIKE LITTLE LITTLE BOXES THAT YOU CAN PUT YOUR OLD BAGS IN .
UH .
CAN BRING THEM IN .
THOSE PETROLEUM PRODUCTS ARE GOING TO KILL US .
I KNOW IT I KNOW IT .

HOSTILE PLANET .
THE PETROLEUM PRETTY MUCH I MEAN THOSE PETROLEUM PRODUCTS I THINK ARE THE BIG UH YOU KNOW .
DID YOU KNOW THAT .
THE GREAT SATAN OF THE RECYCLING .
NO REALLY NOT .
DID YOU KNOW THAT LIKE SOMETHING LIKE FIFTY PERCENT OF THE WORLD S LANDFILLS IS LIKE PAPER .
UM .
FILLED WITH PAPER .
PAPER JUST SEEMS SO INNOCUOUS .
HUH .
PAPER DOES NT SEEM THREATENING AT ALL YOU KNOW .
WELL IT IS IT IS THOUGH .
IT COMES FROM TREES .
HOW CAN IT BE BAD .
IT IS BECAUSE THEY .
THEY TREAT IT WITH CHEMICALS OR SOMETHING .
WHY CA NT TREES BREAK DOWN .
I DO NT GET IT .
WELL THEY DO TREAT PAPER WITH CHEMICALS LIKE YELLOW PAPER YOU KNOW .
YEP .
TAKES SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY TIMES AS LONG TO DECOMPOSE .

UHHUH .
UH I EMBARRASSED TO SAY IT S PRETTY TRIVIAL .
ALL .
WE ALL .
I DO IS UH KEEP A LIST OF THINGS LIKE DEBTS .

OH .
I DO EVERYTHING ON PAPER .
UHHUH .
UH I DO NT EVEN USE A CALCULATOR FOR THE STUFF .

UHUH .
YOU KNOW I MEAN I I I VE NEVER LIKED CREDIT CARDS .
UHHUH .
AND A LOT OF DEBT YOU KNOW YOU .
UHHUH .
BUY SOMETHING ON CREDIT AND YOU PAY TWICE AS MUCH FOR IT WHEN YOU GET DONE .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW SO .
ACTUALLY I MEAN I LIKE USING CREDIT CARDS FOR EVERYTHING BUT JUST PAYING OFF THE BILLS .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE THAT WAY .
IT S A RECORD OF EVERYTHING AND I DO NT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT KEEPING RECORDS OF ANYTHING ELSE .
I DO NT HAVE .
BECAUSE THEY COME IN AT .
TOO MANY .
THE END OF THE MONTH .
I DO NT HAVE TOO MANY WEAKNESSES BUT I FOUND OUT A CREDIT CARD WAS ONE OF THEM .

UHHUH .
UH I LL BE GOING BACK DOWN THERE IN MAY AND HOPEFULLY BE PICKING IT UP A LITTLE MORE REGULARLY .
RIGHT TH THE ONE FACTOR THAT REALLY BOTHERS ME IS THE EXPENSE OF PLAYING GOLF .
I WAS GOING TO SAY .
I MEAN IT S A GREAT GAME BUT I MEAN TO PLAY A REALLY NICE COURSE YOU VE GOT TO HAVE A REALLY BIG WALLET I MEAN .
YEAH THAT S THAT S TRUE ALL TOO MANY TIMES .
YEAH .
FORTUNATELY UH DOWN WHERE I LIVE IN FLORIDA THERE S SOME GOLF COURSES THAT ARE PRETTY REASONABLE IF YOU KNOW WHERE TO LOOK .
UHHUH .
UH ONE OF THEM IS THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA GOLF COURSE .
RIGHT .
WHICH IS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC AND THAT S PRETTY PRETTY GOOD .
YEAH I UH ATTEND THE INDIANA UNIVERSITY AND IT S THE SAME WAY HERE THEY HAVE A REALLY NICE CHAMPIONSHIP STYLE COURSE THAT .

YEAH .
IT S NICE TO SEE THOSE WHO GUYS THEY HAVE SUCH GOOD STYLE THAT UH .

THEY NEED TO GET A NEW PHOTOGRAPHY METHOD .
BECAUSE ONCE THE GUY HITS THE BALL AND THEY GOT TO TRY TO FOLLOW THE BALL .

OH YEAH .
AND I WAS ABLE TO GO AND SEE ONE OF THE ROUNDS OF THAT AND THAT WAS REALLY FUN I MEAN YOU KNEW IT .

I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT IT WAS WOULD BE THAT MUCH FUN TO GO TO A BIG GOLF TOURNAMENT AND WATCH BUT MAN IT WAS IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE JUST TO FOLLOW THOSE GUYS AROUND AND ACTUALLY WATCH THEM PLAY .
YEAH YEAH I VE NEVER BEEN TO A TOURNAMENT UH YOU KNOW LOOKING AT IT ON T V YOU RE THINKING MAN WHAT A BORING THING YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
BUT UH THAT S THAT S WILD THOUGH I LL HAVE TO SEE IF I CA NT GET A CHANCE .
YOU GOT .
TO GO .
I MEAN IT S UH IT S A LOT MORE EXCITING THAN ACTUALLY W THAN WATCHING IT ON T V AND IF YOU PICK A GROUP OF GOLFERS AND FOLLOW THEM AROUND I MEAN IT S JUST WATCHING THEM THE WHOLE TIME INSTEAD OF LIKE ON T V YOU GET TO SEE THEM MAKE A TEE SHOT .
RIGHT .
AND THEN THEY GO OFF TO SOME OTHER HOLE AND THEY COME BACK WHEN THEY RE PUTTING .
BUT YOU KNOW IT S REALLY SOMETHING ELSE .
YEAH I CAN IMAGINE MUMBLEX WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING .

YEAH .
BUT UH YEAH I GUESS WHEN I GET BACK I M GOING TO SCHOOL IN FLORIDA ACTUALLY UH AND FORTUNATELY I VE BEEN ABLE TO TO PLAY SOME GOLF ON A STUDENT BUDGET WHICH IS .
UHHUH .
REAL HELPFUL YOU KNOW BUT IT IT S UNFORTUNATE YOU KNOW YOU HEAR ABOUT JAPAN .
RIGHT .
I GUESS YOU KNOW IT S IT S LIKE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR MINIMUM OR THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR MINIMUM JUST TO LIKE TO PRACTICE EVEN MUMBLEX .
YEAH AND THOSE FEES TO JOIN A CLUB LIKE A MILLION DOLLARS OR WHATEVER IS JUST .
YEAH .
THAT IS OUT OF CONTROL .
I MEAN YOU D REALLY WANT TO REALLY BE LIKING YOUR GOLF .
YEAH I GUESS THEY HAVE THOSE UH DRIVING RANGES THAT ARE ACTUALLY STACKED ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER .
YEAH I SAW ONE OF THOSE ON T V THAT IS PRETTY WILD .
MUMBLEX YEAH YEAH I I PLAYED UH UH EIGHTEEN HOLES WITH SOME JAPANESE GUYS IN IN GAINESVILLE AS A MATTER OF FACT AND IT WAS REALLY WILD THEY WERE INTO IT .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW THEY KICKED OUR BUTT ALL THE WAY TO .
HI .
HI .
UH UH I I SHOULD SAY SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
THAT I M THE UH LEAST INFORMED THIS IS TOTALLY ACCIDENTAL THAT I HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THIS TOPIC .
BUT IT S I M THE LEAST INFORMED PERSON IN THE WHOLE UNITED STATES .
THIS HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED YET BUT I I I VE NEVER READ A NEWSPAPER IN MY ENTIRE LIFE AND I VE I I NEVER WATCH T V NEWS NOR LISTEN TO THE NEWS ON THE RADIO UNLESS I M JUST HAPPENING TO BE LISTENING TO MUSIC AND THEY SLIP IT ON IN THE CAR RADIO BEFORE I CAN TURN IT OFF .
BUT .
ANY PARTICULAR REASON .
WELL NO .
I I VE I VE EXPLORED THAT WITH LOTS OF PEOPLE .
UH THEY VE TRIED TO LOCK ME UP AND UH THINGS LIKE THAT .
BUT UH UH I M BASICALLY NOT INTERESTED AND I ALSO FIND THE UH EVERYTHING IS SO SLICK AND SUPERFICIAL AND MISGUIDED AND MIS AND OFF THE UH UH WHAT .
AM .
I TRYING TO SAY .
UH .
I DO LEARN ABOUT THINGS .
UHHUH .
HUH .
LARGELY FROM FRIENDS AND I OCCASIONALLY WILL READ SOMETHING LIKE THE NEW YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS .
YOU KNOW SOMEONE WILL WRITE A BOOK ABOUT SOMETHING AND THEN I LL LEARN ALL ABOUT THIS THING .
THAT WAS IN THE NEWS TWO YEARS EARLIER .
UHHUH .
BUT IT AND SOMEHOW AND ANYTHING .
I PARTICIPATED IN OR KNOW ABOUT WHEN I READ ABOUT IT IN THE PAPER IS ALWAYS SO UH COVERED FROM SUCH A FUNNY AND SUPERFICIAL PERSPECTIVE THAT I DO NT HAVE MUCH CONFIDENCE IN IT .
BUT I MEAN I DO NT THINK IT S JUST THAT I M LAZY .
I REALLY DO NT I I I LIKE TO REFER TO THIS AS SORT OF CONSUMER REPORT PHENOMENON .
UHHUH .
WHICH IS EVERYBODY THAT I KNOW READS CONSUMER REPORTS SO THE PEOPLE .
WHO DO FEEL THAT CONSUMER REPORTS DOES A WHOLLY INADEQUATE JOB IN THEIR AREA OF PARTICULAR INTEREST .
UHHUH .
BUT ASSUME THAT THEY DO A REASONABLE JOB IN OTHER AREAS .
UHHUH .
UH WITHOUT THINKING THAT THERE WERE PEOPLE IN WHO THINK EACH OTHER AREAS AREA OF OF SPECIALTY AND UH I GUESS YOU COULD EXPLAIN IT .
TWO WAYS .
AND AND THE CYNICAL VIEW IS WELL THESE THINGS ARE NT DOING A VERY GOOD JOB AT ALL .
AND THE VIEW THAT I WOULD RATHER TAKE .
UHHUH .
IS THAT THERE S A DIFFERENT AMOUNT OF INFORMATION .
YOU NEED WHEN YOU RE PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN A TOPIC OR UH PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN BUYING SOMETHING AS A YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
AS A HOBBYIST VERSUS WHEN YOU WANT TO GO OUT AND BUY A BLENDER BECAUSE YOU NEED TO MIX THINGS .
YEAH .
AND I THINK THE SAME THING IS TRUE WITH NEWS .
IF YOU WANT TO JUST HAVE AN IDEA AS TO WHAT S GOING ON MOST PAPERS A AND ESPECIALLY THE BETTER PAPERS THE THE TIMES THE WALL STREET JOURNAL THE .
UHHUH .
WASHINGTON POST GIVE YOU .
A REASONABLE IDEA .
YEAH .
IF YOU WERE DEEPLY INVOLVED IN IT THEN YOU IMMEDIATELY REALIZE THAT WHAT .
THEY PRINT IS STUFF THAT YOU PROBABLY KNEW ALREADY AND THE STUFF THAT YOU WANT THEY RE NOT PRINTING BECAUSE THE AVERAGE PERSON DOES NT NEED OR WANT TO KNOW .
RIGHT .
DOES NT WANT .
THAT MUCH .
LET ME ASK BY THE WAY JUST FOR THE RECORD .
I I M I TOTALLY CONCEDE THAT INTELLIGENT PEOPLE READ THESE THINGS AND INTELLIGENT PEOPLE WRITE THEM .
SO I MEAN I M NOT BEING ELITIST IN THAT SENSE I HOPE .
UH .
WELL I MEAN THERE S THERE S A REASONABLE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER IT S WORTH THE AMOUNT OF TIME .
IT TAKES TO KEEP UP ON THINGS .
YEAH .
WHAT .
AND MOST PEOPLE THINK IT IS AND I CAN I CAN YOU KNOW ACCEPT THAT SOME PEOPLE THINK IT S NOT AND CAN FIND BETTER WAYS TO USE IT .
YEAH .
BY THE WAY WHEN YOU SAY MOST PEOPLE THINK IT IS I THINK IT S LIKE NINETYNINE POINT NINETYNINE THINK IT IS PERCENT .
I DO NT THINK IT S THAT HIGH .
OH YOU DO NT .
I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE .
WHO MAY WATCH THE T V NEWS IN THE EVENING BUT DO NT SPEND THE TIME TO ACTUALLY READ A NEWSPAPER .
RIGHT .
AND I THINK THEY RE SAYING WELL IF SOMETHING S REALLY IMPORTANT I LL AT LEAST FIND OUT THAT IT HAPPENED .
YEAH .
AND AND THAT S A THAT S IS A REASONABLE START AND FOR AWHILE I DID NT READ A NEWSPAPER WHEN I CAME OUT HERE BECAUSE I DID NT FIND ONE THAT I LIKED .
UH AND IF SOMETHING .
IMPORTANT HAPPENED IT WAS COVERED ON T V AND I COULD THEN GO AND AND PICK UP NEWSPAPERS IF IF IT WERE IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO READ ABOUT .
UHHUH .
AND I IMAGINE YOU GET THE SAME LEVEL OF MUMBLEX .
SOMETHING THAT YOU CARED ABOUT HAPPENED YOU D FIND OUT FROM FRIENDS OR OTHER CHANNELS .
YEAH .
UH I DID ON THE UH THE SUPREME COURT HEARINGS AR THE FOR UH UH THE WHOLE BUSINESS OF UH SEE I ACTUALLY HAVE A A .
CLARENCE THOMAS OR .
YEAH THE THOMAS AND ANITA HILL BUSINESS .
RIGHT .
I I MEAN THAT S THAT S THE CLOSEST THING .
I DEEPLY CARED ABOUT THAT .
UHHUH .
UH AND I SORT OF HAD PLANNED TO HAVE DINNER WITH A FRIEND OF MINE AND WHEN I ARRIVED AT HER .
HOUSE SHE WAS ENGROSSED IN THAT .
WE ENDED UP WATCHING IT FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS .
ZOOMING OUT AND GRABBING SOMETHING TO EAT AND THEN ZOOMING BACK AND EA WATCHING IT .
SOME MORE .
AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS TERRIFIC BECAUSE SHE ACTUALLY HELPED ME UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON .
BUT EVEN THEN I DID NT END UP DOING IT ON MY OWN .
UH UH .
YEAH .
I STAYED AS FAR AWAY FROM THOSE AS I COULD .
UHHUH .
I DECIDED I DID NT WANT TO WASTE THE TIME .
I HAD I GUESS FIVE YEARS AGO NOW WASTED THAT KIND OF TIME WITH OLIVER NORTH HEARINGS .
RIGHT RIGHT .
YEAH .
AND AFTERWARDS DECIDED THAT WHAT .
I HAD GOTTEN OUT OF IT JUST WAS NT WORTH THE TIME .
I PUT IN .
UHHUH .
AND THAT THESE THINGS ARE JUST VERY SLOW IN SEEING INFORMATION .
YEAH .
COME OUT .
DO YOU EVER READ .
I M NEVIN FROM SUNNYVALE CALIFORNIA .
HI THIS IS JIM BLISS FROM MINNEAPOLIS MINNESOTA .
HOW YOU DOING .
PRETTY GOOD .
GOOD .
UH I GUESS THE TOPIC IS TRIAL BY JURY AND .
YEP .
HOW WE SHOULD CHANGE THAT OR HOW WE WOULD CHANGE IT .
UH I M READY WHENEVER YOU ARE .
OKAY .
SO UH WHAT ARE YOUR WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE SUBJECT THERE .
WELL I DEFINITELY THINK LIKE DECISIONS HAVE TO BE UNANIMOUS .
YEAH .
YEAH I THINK THAT S PROBABLY A GOOD THING .
IT S PROBABLY THE SAFEST THING .
YEAH .
I MEAN IT S TO EASY TO GET A QUORUM .
YEP .
AND SIMPLE MAJORITY WO NT DO .
NO .
AND EVEN LIKE YOU KNOW TWOTHIRDS MAJORITY I MEAN IT S .
YEAH THAT S YEAH QUORUMS ARE TO EASY TO GET .
YEP .
AND THERE S ALWAYS THAT THAT CHANCE THAT ONE OR TWO PEOPLE COULD BE PLAYING DEVIL S ADVOCATE FOR A GOOD REASON YOU KNOW .
SO IT S IT S .
YEAH .
DEFINITELY BUT UH I DO NT KNOW .
I COULD I COULD NT BELIEVE THEY SUGGESTED THAT JUDGES SHOULD BE DOING THE SENTENCING .
YEAH .
LIKE GIVES THEM .
A LITTLE .
TOO MUCH POWER .
YEAH .
THA I I KNOW OF A COUPLE OF PEOPLE AT LEAST .
WHO WOULD BE ARGUING WITH THAT .
OR ARGUING AGAINST THAT PRETTY VEHEMENTLY .
BUT UH .
PLUS YOU KNOW YOU MAY BE YOU KNOW DOING YOU KNOW A A GUILTY VERDICT BUT IT MAY NOT BE YOU KNOW IT MAY BE FOR TECHNICAL REASONS .
YEAH .
ABOUT THE ONLY GOOD THING .
I WOULD SAY ABOUT THAT IS IT .
W THAT IT WOULD UH HURRY THE PROCESS UP A BIT .
YEAH .
BUT I MEAN EVEN NOW WE VE GOT I KNOW WE VE GOT PLENTY OF CASES OUT THERE WHERE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WRONGLY CONVICTED AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND .
I KNOW MUMBLEX .
THAT S WHAT .
THE TRIAL BY JURY .
I MEAN JEEZ IF IF THE JUDGE WAS DOING IT .
HIMSELF WITHOUT ANY CHECKS AND BALANCES .
YEAH .
WHOSE TO SAY .
IT THERE WOULD BE MUCH MORE OF THAT .
YEAH NO DOUBT .
ARE YOU INVOLVED IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM AT ALL .
NO .
BUT I .
OKAY .
I TEND TO FOLLOW IT JUST TO JUST TO KNOW WHAT S GOING ON .
YEAH YEAH .
I VE GOT SOME FRIENDS .
THAT ARE LAWYERS SO .
YEAH I DO TOO SO .
ONE OF THEM JUST GOT HIS LAW DEGREE .
BUT UH TO TELL YOU .
THE TRUTH I M NOT REAL FAMILIAR WITH UH THE SYSTEM OF JURIS JURISPRUDENCE .
THE WAY .
IT IS RIGHT NOW .
NO .
I REALLY HAVE NT STUDIED IT IN DEPTH .
YEAH .
I KNOW A LITTLE MORE ABOUT CIVIL CASES WHEN THAN CRIMINAL CASES .
YEAH .
WHICH IS IT S MORE IN HOW YOU PRESENT IT VERSUS YOU KNOW WHO S RIGHT .
I M SURE OF IT .
BECAUSE A LOT OF THOSE THINGS IT S ALL IT S IN IT S LARGELY A MATTER OF VIEWPOINT .
YEP .
AND WHO CAN ARGUE THEIR CASE BETTER .
UH IT S KIND OF WEIRD .
I DO NT KNOW YOU .
I ALWAYS THINK ABOUT WATCHING THE PEOPLE S COURT OR SOMETHING .
AND HOW WEIRD .
THOSE CASES GET .
I KNOW .
IT S JUST .
WHEN I WAS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO INVOLVED IN SOME PRETRIAL STUFF AND .
YEAH .
LIKE YOU KNOW YOU GO SAY OKAY WE CA NT BRING UP THIS POINT BECAUSE THEN THEY RE GOING TO YOU KNOW THE OPPOSITION WILL SAY THIS THIS AND THIS AND .
UHHUH .
AND IT S LIKE BOY THE STUFF THAT THEY CAN TWIST AROUND .
YEP .
IS IT S PRETTY AMAZING .
AND IT S LIKE THE THE TRUTH IS NT REALLY IMPORTANT ANYMORE .
IT S .
YEAH IT S NOT .
AND THEN YOU GET PEOPLE .
WHO WHO BRING IN CASES JUST BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BRING THEM UP JUST BECAUSE .
YEP .
LIKE THIS THIS FRIEND OF MINE S PRETTY OBNOXIOUS AND HE REALLY GETS INTO SUING PEOPLE .
AND SO HE LL HE LL SUE JUST ABOUT ANYBODY JUST FOR THE CHANCE TO GET INTO COURT .
AND ARGUE HIS CASE .
YOU KNOW IT S LIKE .
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LITTLE ABUSE OF OUR SYSTEM BUT .
IT IS .
IT S IT S WASTING PEOPLE S TIME AND THE TAXPAYERS MONEY AND EVERYTHING ELSE .
BUT UH .
YEAH BUT IT S FOR THE MORE GENERAL PEOPLE DO NT WANT TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW IT S .
AND AND MOST OF THE TIME .
THEY RE LOOKING TO PLACE BLAME .
UH .
YEP .
AND STUFF .
SEE YOU RE FROM CALIFORNIA IS THAT RIGHT .
UH YEAH .
WELL ORIGINALLY FROM CHICAGO BUT .
OH OKAY .
I WAS JUST THINKING I WONDER I WONDER HOW HOW THE CIVIL SYSTEM OR THE COURT SYSTEM MUST DIFFER BETWEEN THERE AND SAY WHERE I AM IN MINNEAPOLIS .
MUMBLEX .
I REALLY .
FROM WHAT .
I UNDERSTAND IT S ALL PRETTY THE SAME EXCEPT WHEN YOU GET TO LOUISIANA .
AND LOUISIANA IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CAUSE .
IT WAS BASED ON THE WHAT IS IT IT S BASED ON COMMON LAW AND .
UHHUH .
THE REST OF THE COUNTRY IS NOT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
YEAH .
PRETTY STRANGE .
BUT UH FORTUNATELY I NEVER HAVE HAD TO GO IN .
YEAH I HAVE NT EITHER OTHER THAN .
EVEN EVEN FOR JURY DUTY .
BUT UH THAT FRIEND OF MINE S TELLING ME THAT I MIGHT HAVE TO GO IN FOR UH AS A WITNESS .
HE MAY SUBPOENA ME .
SO WE LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS .
BUT UH .
YEAH .
I M NOT REALLY SURE HOW WE COULD CHANGE THE LEGAL SYSTEM TO MAKE IT BETTER .
MUMBLEX .
YEAH .
IT S THERE ARE TOO MANY BIG PROBLEMS YOU KNOW .
THERE S THERE S SUCH A BACKLOG OF COURT CASES RIGHT NOW .
I KNOW .
YOU KNOW TO TRY TO GET THEM .
ALL IN IN A GOOD TIME AND WE ALREADY HAVE TOO MANY LAWYERS AS IT IS .
YEAH .
AND IF IT .
S CRIMINAL CASES WE YOU CA NT PUT THEM IN JAIL BECAUSE THERE S NO ROOM LEFT .
YEAH .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
AND IN FACT THEY RE EVEN LETTING SOME GO .
YEAH .
I I I M ORIGINALLY FROM FLORIDA AND IT S LIKE .
HUH .
IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY YEAR .
THEY LET OUT MORE AND MORE JUST CAUSE THEY DO NT HAVE ROOM FOR THEM YOU KNOW .
THAT S NOT A THAT S NOT A GOOD SOLUTION EITHER .
NOT AT ALL .
I M NOT REAL SURE WHAT .
THE .
WELL JACKIE UH ON TAXES I I GUESS I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT I THAT MY OPINION IS THAT I DO THINK AMERICAN S ARE PAYING TOO MUCH IN TAXES .
UH WHAT S YOUR FEELING ABOUT THAT .
I AGREE .
I THINK TAXES ARE HIGH .
RIGHT UH WHERE YOU LIVE DO YOU HAVE A STATE INCOME TAX AND A SALES TAX .
BOTH .
OH YES .
UHHUH .
UH UHHUH .
IN NEW HAMPSHIRE WE HAVE UH UH NO NO WHAT .
WE CALL BROAD BASE TAXES .
NO INCOME TAX AND NO SALES TAX .
HUH .
UH WE TAX BUSINESS UH EIGHT PERCENT BUSINESSES ARE TAXED EIGHT PERCENT AND WE HAVE WHAT .
WE CALL THE FIVE B S .
UH TH FOR OUR TAXES .
BOOZE UH BUTTS CIGARETTES BEDS UH HOTEL ROOM TAX .
UHHUH .
BELLIES A MEAL TAX AND BETS GAMBLING .
OH .
SO UH WE DO HAVE A VERY LOW TAX RATE BUT YOU KNOW COMBINED WITH THE FEDERAL INCOME TAX .
I THINK THAT AMERICAN S GENERALLY DO PAY TOO MUCH IN TAXES AND MUMBLEX .
RIGHT .
YEAH I I AGREE AND I MUMBLEX THINK IT S ABOUT THE TIME OF THE YEAR WHEN YOU JUST START GETTING WELL IF YOU DO GET MONEY BACK FROM LIKE JOBS I M STILL A STUDENT .
UHHUH .
SO UH I ONLY WORK PART TIME SO I I GET A CHECK BACK SO .
WELL THAT S NICE .
FROM FROM TAXES BUT .
NICE NICE TO GET A REFUND .
YEAH .
IT IS BUT IT S NOT MUCH .
SO .
UHHUH .
DO YOU THINK THAT UH FOR WHATEVER TAXES WE DO PAY THAT UH WE ARE GETTING VALUE FOR IT .
NO .
YEAH .
UH MY MY OPINION OF TAXES IS THAT WE JUST SEND MONEY TO WASHINGTON OR TO THE STATE AND THEY SAY THEY ARE GOING TO SEND SOME BACK IT S LIKE GIVING YOURSELF .
A TRA IT .
S LIKE ONE ARM GIVING THE OTHER A TRANSFUSION .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW WHAT .
I MEAN .
YEAH .
UH IT IT REALLY UH I SHOULD SAY ONE ARM GIVING ANOTHER ARM .
A TRANSFUSION THROUGH A LEAKY TUBE BECAUSE .
YEAH .
THERE YOU GO .
RIGHT BECAUSE UH THERE S AN OLD SAYING IN AMONGST TAXES AND POLITICIANS THAT THERE S A FLY PAPER EFFECT AND THAT IS THAT MONEY TENDS TO STICK WHERE IT LANDS FIRST AND WHEN YOU SEND IT TO WASHINGTON OR SEND IT TO YOUR STATE CAPITOL UH A LOT OF IT STAYS THERE AND NOT THAT MUCH COMES BACK TO YOU .
RIGHT YEAH .
I DO NT KNOW .
I DO NT SEEM LIKE THEY ARE DOING MUCH WITH IT MUMBLEX I MEAN THERE .
S PLANS THERE AND NOW THAT THEY ARE VOTING AND PEOPLE YOU KNOW GETTING INTO MUMBLEX DRUG AND THAT STUFF .
UHHUH .
THEY HAVE NICE PLANS AND UH BUT THEY DO NT ALWAYS WORK AND THEN YOU KNOW THEY TRY TO RAISE TAXES MORE AND I DO NT WHAT HAPPENS WITH ALL THE MONEY BECAUSE IF THEIR PLANS DO NT WORK YOU KNOW BUT TAXES GET RAISE SO .
I DO NT KNOW .
I M NOT REALLY INTO POLITICS UH .
THAT IT .
I DO NT REALLY UNDERSTAND IT .
UHHUH .
BUT IT S JUST YOU KNOW .
WELL IT DOES IT IT DOES SEEM THAT THE MORE TAXES .
THAT ARE RAISED THE MORE .
THE POLITICIANS SPEND .
UH IT S ALMOST LIKE THEY WILL SPEND AS MUCH AS THE THEY RE ALLOWED TO COLLECT .
YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
UH THERE IS AN INTERESTING PROPOSAL .
THAT S BEEN GOING AROUND NOW FOR A FEW YEARS OF HAVING A FLAT TAX .
UH TEN PERCENT OR THIRTEEN PERCENT .
THERE WOULD BE NO FIGURING .
I MEAN YOU WOULD TAKE YOUR INCOME TAX YOU WOULD HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT I MEAN YOU WOULD TAKE YOU TOTAL SALARY .
UHHUH .
THOSE .
WHO MADE UNDER A CERTAIN AMOUNT WOULD NT OWE ANY TAXES AND THEN THERE WOULD BE A SET AMOUNT FOR HOWEVER MANY PEOPLE YOU KNOW DEPENDENT YOU HAVE AND YOU WOULD JUST PAY A FLAT TAX .
NO EXEMPTIONS NO DEDUCTIONS OR ANYTHING ELSE AFTER YOU KNOW AFTER YOU FIGURE UP WHO S IN YOUR FAMILY .
RIGHT .
HUH .
AND THAT WOULD ELIMINATE A LOT OF THE BUREAUCRACY IN THE .
I R S AND IT WOULD ELIMINATE ALL THESE LOOP HOLES THAT THE FAT CATS GET AWAY WITH .
YEAH .
THE COULD BE NICE .
YEAH .
HUH .
I I D LIKE TO SEE SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
I THINK IT WOULD BE FAIRER AND IT WOULD PUT A YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE TAX ATTORNEYS OUR OF BUSINESS AND I AM SURE THEY WILL FIGHT IT .
TOOTH AND NAIL BUT I REALLY THINK A FLAT TAX WOULD BE A LOT FAIRER FOR ALL AMERICANS .
RIGHT YEAH .
I MEAN IT DOES NT SEEM RIGHT THAT SOMEBODY .
THAT MAKES TWENTYFIVE OR THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PAYS FOUR OR FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TAXES WHILE SOMEBODY .
THAT MAKES TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS MIGHT PAY NOTHING IN TAXES .
RIGHT HUH .
IT DOES NT SEEM FAIR TO ME .
YEAH IT IS NT THERE IS NOT MUCH OUT THERE .
THAT IS FAIR THAT S FOR SURE .
RIGHT .
HUH .
I WILL AGREE TO THAT .
I THINK YOUR TAXES IN WISCONSIN ARE PRETTY HIGH .
I I IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN ARE NT THEY .
I .
UH .
MEAN FOR YOUR STATE .
WHAT IS DO YOU KNOW WHAT .
YOUR STATE INCOME TAX RATE IS .
UM NO .
TWENTY PERCENT .
I I HAVE NO IDEA I JUST .
MY DAD DOES IT .
ALL FOR ME .
JUST YOU JUST PAY IT HUH .
I USE .
YOU RE LIKE YOU RE LIKE MY DAUGHTER .
WHO IS IN COLLEGE DOWN IN MASSACHUSETTS AND UH SHE WORKS AS A WAITRESS AND SHE IS ATTENDING COLLEGE FULL TIME ALSO .
UHHUH .
AND SHE SENDS HER TAXES TO ME AND I FIGURE THEM UP .
SHE REALLY HAS NO IDEA .
SHE GETS A REFUND CHECK AND .
OKAY UM I GUESS WE RE GOING TO TALK DESCRIBE UH JOB BENEFITS AND SO WHAT DO YOU THINK NEXT TO SALARY DO YOU RANK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT JOB BENEFITS .
UH I WOULD SAY THE MEDICAL UH GROUP INSURANCE AREA .
UHHUH .
AS FAR AS UH COVERING MEDICAL COSTS FOR YOURSELF OR FAMILY MEMBERS .
UHHUH .
WELL UM DOES YOUR COMPANY HAVE GOOD BENEFITS IN THAT IN THAT REGARD .
YEAH I THINK I WORK FOR A PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM DISTRICT .
UHHUH .
AND UH SO IT S DIFFERENT THAN A COMPANY WHERE MOST COMPANIES FUND ALMOST THE ENTIRE THING WHERE THE SCHOOL DISTRICT DOES UM THE EMPLOYEE MUST PICK UP A GREATER FIGURE IN THE WAY OF UH COSTS .
OH YEAH .
BUT OVERALL UM I VE BEEN PLEASED WITH IT OVER THE YEARS .
UHHUH .
I THINK THE BIGGEST FRUSTRATION IS BECAUSE OF THE COST OF INSURANCE GOING UP EVERY YEAR OUR DISTRICT HAS HAD TO ALTER UH YOU KNOW CHANGE COMPANIES OR NOW WE RE ON A MANAGED CARE THING WHICH HAS STRESSED A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT .
UHHUH .
ALTHOUGH IT HAS NOT DISTURBED ME .
ANY .
I SEE .
HOW ABOUT YOURSELF .
UH WELL I M MY MEDICAL COVERAGE IS WITH AN H M O .
UHHUH .
UM SO THAT S IN MY OPINION THAT S GET THAT S BORDERING ON A HEALTH CLINIC BUT IT SEEMS TO BE A GOOD WAY TO MAINTAIN COSTS AND STILL PROVIDE A GOOD AMOUNT OF COVERAGE .
RIGHT YEAH .
UM .
OUR DISTRICT DID THAT FOR THE NINETYONE AND THE NINETY SCHOOL YEAR OR CALENDAR YEARS AND I WAS IN THE H M O AND UM I WAS BECAUSE MY MY SAME DOCTOR YOU KNOW AGREED TO BE IN IT FOR UH THEY USUALLY SIGN A CONTRACT OR SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
AND UM UH I DID HAVE SURGERY LAST SUMMER AND I PAID TEN DOLLARS WHEN I WENT TO SEE HIM THAT FIRST DAY AND I VE NEVER SEEN ANOTHER BILL SO I .
RIGHT .
I HAVE TO SAY IT REALLY WORKS .
BUT AGAIN I WAS FORTUNATE BECAUSE MY DOCTOR AGREED TO BE IN IT .
UH IF YOU VE BEEN GOING TO A DOCTOR FOR YOU KNOW TEN YEARS OR SOMETHING AND HE ELECTS NOT TO JOIN IT CAN BE VERY STRESSFUL FOR .
YES .
YOU KNOW THOSE PEOPLE .
THAT S RIGHT YEAH I M I M FAIRLY YOUNG .
MYSELF I VE ONLY BEEN WHEN I FIRST STARTED WORKING WHICH THREE YEARS AGO IS WHEN I FIRST GOT INTO FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT .
UHHUH .
AND UH AT THAT TIME .
I IMMEDIATELY JOINED THE H M O AND I NEVER REALLY SO THE ONLY DOCTOR .
I I VE KIND OF CONSISTENTLY HAD HAS BEEN THROUGH THE H M O AND UH .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW FOR ME .
IT S WORKED OUT REAL GOOD .
RIGHT BUT IF YOU YOU KNOW HAVE A FAMILY AND AND UM EVERYBODY S GONE TO DIFFERENT DOCTORS UH IT IS HARD TO GIVE UP SOMEBODY .
WHO .
YOU FEEL KNOWS YOU AND YOUR BODY AND YOUR JUST HAS YOU KNOW ALL THE MEDICAL HISTORY AND YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH IT .
UHHUH .
I I M SURE IT WOULD BE VERY STRESSFUL AND MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE JUST ELECTED THAT IF THAT HAPPENS I WILL GO AND JUST PAY .
YOU CAN CONTINUE TO GO TO YOUR OWN DOCTOR .
UHHUH .
BUT YOUR BENEFITS ARE NOT AS YOU KNOW GOOD SO UH .
UHHUH .
YEAH UM LIKE YOU YOU MENTIONED YOU WORK FOR A SCHOOL SYSTEM .
I WORK FOR UH GEORGIA TECH IN THE .
OH ALL RIGHT .
RESEARCH BRANCH AND I GUESS ANOTHER .
ONE THAT THAT I RANK UP THERE HIGH IS THE UH KIND OF JOB FLEXIBILITY AND TIME OFF UM I ENJOY AS A BENEFIT .
I DO TOO .
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT LIKE SPRING BREAK AND .
RIGHT .
RIGHT .
YEAH GETTING A LOT OF BREAKS .
RIGHT .
BETWEEN QUARTERS AND THAT AND HAVING A LOT OF VACATION .
IT IT REALLY UM I DO NT THINK MOST OF OUR TEACHERS NOW I M NOT A TEACHER I AM A SECRETARIAL EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT BUT I DO NT THINK THE TEACHERS COULD STAND THE STRESS .
ALL ALL YEAR LONG .
UHHUH .
FRANKLY .
IT IS JUST TEXAS HAS REALLY UM YOU KNOW THEY WANT EVERYBODY EDUCATED NO MATTER .
WHAT .
IT COSTS UH AND IT IT WOULD BE JUST WE .
ALL LOOK FORWARD TO LIKE IN TWO WEEKS WE HAVE SPRING BREAK AND .
UHHUH .
I DO NT KNOW WHO LOOKS FORWARD TO IT MORE THE STUDENTS OR THE TEACHERS AND THE STAFF .
RIGHT .
WHAT DO YOU DO THERE .
WELL UM I M NOT ACTUALLY ON THE TEACHING FACULTY BUT WE HAVE A LARGE RESEARCH ORGANIZATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE UNIVERSITY AND THAT S WHO .
I WORK WITH .
OKAY .
UM AND WE RE GIVEN YOU KNOW A GOOD BIT OF FLEXIBILITY IN WHAT .
WE DO .
WE CAN KIND OF PURSUE OUR OWN INTERESTS IN TERMS OF THE RESEARCH AREAS THAT WE STUDY .
WELL THAT S GOOD .
YEAH I WOULD THINK THAT THAT TYPE OF EMPLOYMENT YOU RE YOU RE ONE DAY .
YOU MIGHT BE REALLY TUNED IN AND THE NEXT DAY OH A LITTLE LUKE WARM OR SOMETHING .
RIGHT .
AND UM IT S GOOD THAT THEY ALLOW YOU .
THAT .
RIGHT .
IT UM AS I SAY THE SCHOOLS NOW WE DO HAVE TO WORK YOU KNOW THE DAY BUT WE DO GET MANY DAYS OFF AND UH WE .
ALL LOOK FORWARD TO IT .
UHHUH .
THAT S THE ONLY REASON .
I WORK THERE IS THAT MY CHILDREN NOW HAVE GRADUATED AND GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE BUT AT THE .
OH YEAH .
TIME I WORKED THERE BECAUSE MY HOURS AND DAYS WERE THE SAME AS THEIRS .
UHHUH .
AND UH I VE JUST CONTINUED TO UH STAY THERE MUMBLEX .
ARE THERE ARE THERE ANY THINGS .
THAT THAT YOU D LIKE TO SEE CHANGED IN TERMS OF THE THE BENEFITS .
OKAY UH I JUST CURRENTLY QUIT MY JOB AND SO I REALLY DO NT RECEIVE ANY BENEFITS RIGHT NOW .
RIGHT .
BUT MY HUSBAND DOES AND UH I THINK ONE OF THE UH MY FIRST OF ALL ALWAYS SALARY AND SE THE SECOND THING IS UH BECAUSE WE HAVE CHILDREN SO IT WOULD BE UH HEALTH BENEFITS AND MEDICAL BENEFITS AND .
YEAH YEAH DEFINITELY .
AND UH RIGHT NOW WE HAVE PROBABLY SOME EXCELLENT BENEFITS RIGHT NOW WE HAVE WITH AETNA AND UH I DO NT KNOW IF YOU RE FAMILIAR WITH THEM BUT WE RE REAL HAPPY WITH THEM .
YEAH YEAH I VE HAD A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT JOBS WITH A VARIOUS TYPES UH IN THE COMPUTER FIELD AND SO I VE SEEN A VARIETY OF TYPES OF BENEFITS UH I VE WORKED FOR FOR MUMBLEX FOR AWHILE AND THEY ARE YOU KNOW A REALLY ACADEMIC TYPE OF PLACE AND THEN I VE WORKED WITH REGULAR YOU KNOW INDUSTRY TYPE PLACES AND THEN WITH OTHERS THAT ARE KIND OF HALF WAY BETWEEN AND STUFF SO I VE SEEN A WIDE RANGE OF BOTH YOU KNOW NONSALARY TYPE BENEFITS AND OTHER STUFF YOU KNOW LIKE HEALTH CARE THAT S EITHER FULLY OR PARTIALLY PAID AND YOU KNOW SOME HAVE LIKE BONUSES AND OTHERS HAVE HAD LOTS OF VACATION TIME BUT NOT MUCH OTHER TYPES OF BENEFITS AND .
UHHUH .
SO YEAH I WOULD I D SAY HEALTH CARE IS WAY UP THERE ESPECIALLY ANYBODY WITH KIDS UH .
YEAH .
AND THAT S ONE OF THE BIG THINGS THAT WE ALWAYS LOOK AT YOU KNOW WHEN WE WHEN I THINK ABOUT T CHANGING JOBS IS YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF HEALTH CARE THEY HAVE AND DOES THE COMPANY PAY FOR IT YOU KNOW ALL OR PARTIALLY OR HOW DOES THAT WORK .
UHHUH .
AND UH ALSO UH VACATION TIME TOO IS A IS A BIG ONE FOR ME .
YEAH YEAH .
UH AND I GUESS SUPPORT FOR WHATEVER WHATEVER OTHER .
YOU KNOW KINDS OF PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES YOU HAVE AT YOU KNOW WORK .
YEAH .
UH CAUSE I VE .
HUH .
BEEN AT PLACES WHICH OFFER A LOT OF SUPPORT AND OTHERS THAT DO NT OFFER ANY AND .
RIGHT .
SOME THAT SOMETIMES THAT S COINCIDED WITH A PLACE THAT OFFERS MORE VACATION TIME THOUGH SO THAT S NOT SO BAD YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW IT S KIND OF A GIVE AND TAKE KIND OF THING I THINK .
UHHUH .
UH I SAY THAT HEALTH CARE IS PROBABLY DEFINITELY NUMBER ONE THOUGH MUMBLEX WANT TO JUST YOU KNOW ALL YOUR SALARY CA NT EVEN BEGIN .
YEAH .
TO PAY FOR WHAT YOU CAN WIND UP LOSING YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
IN A MAJOR ILLNESS OR SOMETHING UH .
RIGHT UH AND AND AND ANOTHER GOOD THING IS WITH THE HEALTH BENEFITS WHEN THEY GIVE YOU MORE THAN TWO CHOICES ON WHO TO GO WITH .
YEAH .
AND THAT REALLY HELPED US OUT A GREAT DEAL SO BUT MY HUSBAND DOES GET VACATION AND IT S WORKED OUT REALLY GOOD FOR US TOO .
UHHUH .
SO BUT .
YEAH FLEXIBLE HOURS ARE ARE PRETTY IMPORTANT TO ME AS WELL .
YEAH .
UH CAUSE THAT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE MY WIFE WORKS PARTTIME .
UHHUH .
AND SHE WORKS UH AS A ASSISTANT MANAGER IN A FABRIC STORE .
UHHUH .
AND SO SHE WORKS A LOT OF EVENINGS AND WEEKENDS AND SO TWO DAYS A WEEK I UH MANAGE TO GET HOME EARLY ENOUGH TO MEET THE KIDS ON THE BUS SO SHE WOR YOU KNOW GOES IN EARLY THOSE DAYS AND WORKS LIKE YOU KNOW NOON TIL CLOSE UH SO WE HAVE MUMBLEX .
WELL THAT S GREAT THAT YOU ALL CAN WORK THAT OUT THAT S REALLY GOOD .
YEAH AND BEING ON A YOU KNOW RIGID SCHEDULE WOULD NT THERE WOULD NT BE ANYWAY TO DO THAT AT ALL .
RIGHT .
AND I THINK IT S KIND OF NEAT TO BE ABLE TO SPEND THE AFTERNOONS WITH THE KIDS OCCASIONALLY TOO .
UHHUH .
I MEAN USUALLY YOU KNOW YOU GO TO WORK BEFORE THEY RE AWAKE OR AS THEY RE GETTING UP FOR SCHOOL AND YOU GET HOME AND IT S ALREADY DARK UNLESS IT S SUMMER TIME YOU KNOW AND EVEN IN SUMMER TIME SOMETIMES YOU GET HOME SO LATE THAT THERE S YOU KNOW YOU CA NT DO ANYTHING WITH THEM .
YEAH .
AND ESPECIALLY IN THE WINTER I MEAN YOU G GET UP IN THE DARK AND COME HOME IN THE DARK YOU KNOW IT S LIKE IT S LIKE A VAMPIRE SOMETIMES .
YEAH IT S THE SAME WITH MY HUSBAND CAUSE HE S GOT PRETTY FLEXIBLE HOURS IF AS LONG AS HE PUTS IN THE HOURS HE NEEDS TO DO MUMBLEX .
WORKED OUT REALLY WELL FOR US TOO .
YEAH .
UH WELL IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU LOOK FOR OR .
UH A LOT OF MUMBLEX I GUESS IS .
YOU VE HIT PRETTY YOU VE PUT A LOT OF THE MAIN POINTS IN .
YEAH I THINK SOME OF IS HOW THE UH YOU KNOW I GUESS IT S NOT REALLY A DIRECT BENEFIT BUT HOW YOUR UH PERFORMANCE IS RATED AND STUFF LIKE THAT AT WORK .
UHHUH .
CAUSE I VE BEEN UH ESPECIALLY IN LARGE CORPORATIONS YOU CAN REALLY YOU KNOW WIND UP GETTING HAVING YOU KNOW REAL PROBLEMS I VE FOUND OUT I VE WORKED FOR A FEW YOU KNOW SEVERAL THOUSAND PLUS YOU KNOW TYPE COMPANIES .
YEAH .
AND IT AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU RE DOING LIKE PROFESSIONAL WORK WHERE I YOU KNOW IT S KIND OF ETHEREAL AS TO WHAT YOU RE DOING .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW IF YOU RE LIKE I VE I WORK WITH UH COMPUTER SYSTEMS A LOT SO IT S KIND OF HARD TO SAY YOU KNOW IF YOU RE YOU KNOW A BRICK LAYER SOMEBODY CAN LOOK AND SEE YOU KNOW WELL YEAH YOU LAID YOU KNOW FIFTEEN THOUSAND BRICKS TODAY AND THEY WERE ALL STRAIGHT AND YOUR BUILDING DID NT FALL DOWN YOU KNOW YEAH YOU DID A GREAT JOB BUT IF YOU BUILD COMPUTER SYSTEMS LIKE WELL YOU KNOW WHAT DOES THAT COMPUTER PROGRAM REALLY DO YOU KNOW OR ESPECIALLY IF YOU WRITE LIKE PAPERS YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
OR DO DESIGN STUDIES OR SOMETHING IT S REAL HARD TO RATE SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
IT S LIKE GET A PAINTER YOU KNOW OR SOMETHING A ARTIST IT S LIKE WELL MUMBLEX YOU HOW DO YOU REALLY RATE YOU KNOW MICHELANGELO YOU KNOW HOW WOULD YOU TELL IF HE WAS YOU KNOW REALLY GOOD OR SOSO OR WHATEVER .
YEAH AND THAT DOES MAKE A WAN A PERSON WANT TO STAY .
SO .
HOW S YOUR PRODUCTS BEEN .
UM I REALLY HAVE NT HAD UH TOO MANY PROBLEMS .
UH SEEMS TO ME THAT EVERYTHING THAT I BUY GOES BAD JUST AFTER THE WARRANTY RUNS OUT .
I HEAR THAT ONE .
HAVE YOU HAD ANY LATELY GO OUT .
YEAH I VE HAD A DRYER AN ICE MAKER A MICROWAVE ALL THREE AND THEY UNFORTUNATELY I BOUGHT THEM .
ALL THREE AT THE SAME TIME WHEN I BOUGHT MY NEW HOUSE AND UH I REALLY DO NT HAVE ANY RECOURSE SO I HAD TO CALL AND HAVE THEM .
ALL REPAIRED AND THAT .
OH WOW .
YEAH IT WAS A HASSLE .
SO YOU DID NT GET ANYTHING EVEN ALL THE ALL THE WARRANTIES WERE OUT .
YEAH THE WARRANTY ON THE REFRIGERATOR UH THE I THE REFRIGERATOR WARRANTY S STILL GOOD BUT THE ICE MAKER .
ITSELF PASSED ITS THREE YEARS AND IT WAS THREE YEARS AND TWO MONTHS .
YOU RE KIDDING .
NO .
YEAH WE JUST MOVED INTO A NEW HOUSE TOO SO WE HAD TO BUY ALL THOSE TOO .
UH WATCH OUT .
YEAH THE ONLY THING .
I VE HAD PROBLEMS WITH IS UM I BUY A LOT OF WOOD WORKING EQUIPMENT THROUGH THE MAIL .
UHHUH .
AND I BOUGHT THIS PAINT STRIPPER WHERE THEY ADVERTISE THAT IT S NONTOXIC AND SUCH AND WHEN YOU GET THE PRODUCT .
IT ENDS UP BEING TOXIC AND ALL THESE WARNINGS .
SO .
UM .
I DID NT RETURN IT BECAUSE IT D PROBABLY COST ME MORE THAN I JUST ENDED UP USING IT .
BUT THAT S ABOUT THE ONLY THING .
I VE HAD GONE WRONG .
BUT .
I USUALLY HAVE PRETTY GOOD LUCK WITH APPLIANCES BUT I JUST UH IT WAS WITHIN TWO DAYS THAT ALL THREE OF THESE STOPPED WORKING AND THE .
THAT S INCREDIBLE .
THE ICE MAKER WAS UH HAD TO HAVE A NEW PUMP AND THE UH MICROWAVE HAD TO HAVE UH SOME KIND OF SOMETHING .
I CA NT EVEN PRONOUNCE .
AND THEY UH THE DRYER HAD TO HAVE A NEW HEATING ELEMENT SO IT WAS ABOUT ALMOST THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR ALL THREE OF THEM .
AND THEY .
ALL WENT OUT AT THE SAME TIME .
UH WITHIN TWO DAYS OF EACH OTHER .
OR TWO DAYS .
WOW .
I WAS IT .
WAS NT .
A GOOD WEEK .
I WAS PRETTY MAD .
AND PLUS THE PLACE THAT I D BOUGHT THEM .
ALL HAD GONE OUT OF BUSINESS SO EVEN IF I I THINK EVEN IF I HAD UH HAD KEPT THE WARRANTY THE SERVICE AGREEMENTS WERE WITH THE COMPANIES .
THAT THAT MANUFACTURED BUT STILL THEY WERE THROUGH THAT RETAILER SO I DO NT KNOW IF I COULD HAVE TAKEN IT TO ANOTHER RETAILER OR NOT .
WOW IT S FRUSTRATING .
BUT I DID NT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ALL THAT BECAUSE THEY WERE NT UNDER WARRANTY .
SO .
IT WAS A CALL TO THE LOCAL APPLIANCE DEALER .
UHHUH .
WHO CAME OUT AND FIXED THEM .
ALL BUT I THE ONLY OTHER THINGS THAT I VE EVER HAD TROUBLE WITH UH I SEEM TO HAVE A REAL BAD TROUBLE WITH ELECTRIC HAIR DRYERS BLOW DRYERS .
UHHUH THEY GO OUT A LOT .
YEAH I VE HAD TWO OR THREE OF THOSE GO OUT .
ONE WAS UNDER WARRANTY AND THE OTHER TWO WERE NT BUT I JUST OTHER THAN THAT YOU KNOW T V S AND THINGS LIKE THAT I HAVE NT EVER HAD ANY TROUBLE WITH .
I DO NT THINK PRODUCTS ARE GETTING MUCH BETTER THOUGH .
YEAH .
SEE I M IN THE MANUFACTURING MUMBLEX HOME FROM WORK AND MAKE UM AUTOMOTIVE AIR BAGS THE SAFETY AIR BAGS .
OH REALLY .
YEAH .
THAT S INTERESTING .
AT MORTON INTERNATIONAL AND I THIN WELL IT S IT S CHANGED A LOT WITH THE MANUFACTURING ENVIRONMENT .
WE TEST EVERYTHING AFTER EACH ASSEMBLY PROCESS AND SO OUR TESTING IS PRETTY THOROUGH BUT .
DO YOU DO YOU TEST EACH INDIVIDUAL .
ONE .
UM .
OR DO YOU JUST TEST LIKE IF YOU VE GOT TEN YOU TEST ONE AND BY THE TEST RESULTS OF THE ONE .
YOU ASSUME THAT THE OTHER NINE ARE OKAY .
UM THE TESTS THAT WELL WE TEST EVERY ONE ELECTRICALLY .
WE DO NT I THINK THEY TEST FOUR OR FIVE .
A DAY ACTUALLY EXPLODING THE AIR BAGS .
UHHUH .
AND BUT WE DO TEST AFTER DURING THE ASSEMBLY PROJECT PRODUCT UM AFTER WE ASSEMBLE EACH PART OF THE INFLATOR OR WHAT EXPLODES THE BAG WE CHECK TO MAKE SURE .
IT S THERE AFTER WE INSTALL IT SO EACH ASSEMBLY PROCESS HAS AN INSPECTION RIGHT AFTER IT S DONE AND THEN WE DO ELECTRICAL TESTS ON THEM DURING THE PROCESS SO .
WELL THAT S SOMETHING .
I VE NEVER HAD TO USE IT S NEVER I VE NEVER BEEN INVOLVED IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT SO LUCKILY THAT S A PRODUCT THAT I HAVE NT HAD TO TEST .
YEAH .
BUT I THINK IT S A GREAT IDEA .
I M I M SEEMS LIKE ALL THE GOOD LOGICAL IDEAS TAKE FOREVER TO COME ABOUT BUT THAT .
WELL THEY DO THE ALL THE TESTING THAT WE HAVE TO DO THROUGH THE GOVERNMENT IT S INCREDIBLE HOW MUCH TESTING .
THEY HAVE TO DO .
OH I M SURE THEY WANT TO BE THOROUGH BEFORE THEY .
BUT UH EVEN YOU KNOW I DO NT MIND SPENDING THE EXTRA MONEY ON THE CAR .
UHHUH .
IF YOU KNOW EVEN IF THEY PASS THE SAVINGS THE COST ONTO THE CONSUMER BECAUSE IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A REAL WORTHWHILE THING .
I M NOT A REAL BIG SEAT BELT MY UH .
WHAT DO YOU DO THERE IN LUBBOCK AS FAR AS UH RECYCLING IS CONCERNED .
WELL YOU KNOW THEY ACTUALLY STARTED AND I ASSUMED IT WAS T I WIDE UH THEY THEY STARTED PUTTING OUT AT LEAST RECYCLING BINS FOR THE PAPER .
UHHUH .
UH I VE YOU KNOW EITHER COMPUTER PAPER OR DIFFERENT TYPES OF PAPER .
UHHUH .
I VE HAD SOME IDEAS ON HOW I THINK THEY COULD PROBABLY DO IT A LITTLE LESS EXPENSIVELY AND ACCOMPLISH THE SAME PURPOSE BUT I I GUESS I NEED TO PUT IT ON PAPER AND TURN IT IN .
OH YEAH WHA .
UH .
WHAT WOULD BE MORE EFFICIENT ABOUT IT WHA WHAT .
WELL THE WAY THEY HAVE YOU KNOW THEY HAVE BOXES LOCATED AT CERTAIN AREAS THROUGHOUT A MODULE OR DOWN THE HALL OR .
UHHUH .
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE NT GOING TO GET UP WALK OUT OF THEIR OFFICES AND GO THERE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW WHERE I USE TO WORK WE HAD WHAT WE CALLED TREE BOXES THAT S JUST WHAT WE CALLED THEM .
UHHUH .
AND THEY WERE RECYCLED CARDBOARD THEY WERE EIGHT AND A HALF BY ELEVEN AND YOU SET IT BY YOUR DESK AND YOU KNOW AS YOU GOT RID OF A PIECE OF PAPER YOU STUCK IT IN THERE AND WHEN IT FILLED UP YOU CALLED YOU KNOW FACILITIES WHOEVER TO COME PICK IT UP AND THEY BROUGHT YOU ANOTHER BOX SO NOT ONLY IS IT YOU KNOW I THINK MORE PEOPLE WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT AND USE IT UH I THINK YOU SAVE A LOT OF THE CLEANING SERVICE S TIME AND EFFORT AND MONEY THAT WE ARE PAYING FOR THEM TO TO EMPTY THE TRASH CANS AND COMBINE IT AND BUNDLE IT AND THINGS LIKE THAT NOW WHEN IT COULD ALL BE DONE IN ONE STEP .
OH .
KIND OF TYPE THING .
I SEE .
SO .
YEAH I I I UH WAS GOING TO SAY CAUSE I KNOW I HAVE RIGHT HERE A TRASH CAN FOR TRASH AND A TRASH CAN FOR FOR PAPER ON IT .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW AND UH IF .
IF .
IF I HAVE A IF I I PRINTED UP SOMETHING THAT I DO NT NEED IT JUST CHUNK IT IN THE IN THE PAPER .
RIGHT BUT SOMEBODY STILL HAS TO COLLECT ALL THAT .
THAT S TRUE .
AND BUNDLE IT TOGETHER AND WHEREAS IF YOU HAD A BOX THAT PRETTY SOON IT GOT FULL YOU CLOSE THE BOX IT S ALREADY BUNDLED IT S ALREADY DONE FOR YOU .
CERTAINLY THAT S A GOOD IDEA .
SO YOU RE SAVING A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT I JUST NEED TO PUT IT ON PAPER AND .
YEAH .
I GUESS RECOMMENDED IT TO SOMEBODY AND SEE IF THEY THINKS IT S FEASIBLE .
UHHUH .
SO UH WHAT ELSE DO THEY DO IN THE DALLAS AREA .
WELL UH AS FAR AS T I IS CONCERNED I M NOT SURE UH AND I HAVE HEARD YOU KNOW UH IN RESIDENTIAL SITUATIONS I LIVE IN A DORM AND I HAVE HEARD IN RESIDENTIAL SITUATIONS UH LIKE IN PLANO .
UHHUH .
UH THAT THEY ARE DOING UH STUFF LIKE HAVING RECYCLE PICKED UP .
UM .
WHERE UH THE CITY UH I GUESS THE SANITATION DEPARTMENT UH AS PART OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY PICKS UP UH THE RECYCLED ITEMS AS WELL YOU KNOW THE PLASTICS AND THE PAPER UH AND ALUMINUM AND UH THE ONLY RESPONSIBILITY OF THE OF THE PATRON IS TO SEPARATE THEM AND THEN THE THE UH I GUESS THE DEPARTMENT TAKES THEM AND AND DOES WHAT THEY DO WITH THEM AND IT DOES NT COST THE PATRON ANYTHING DOES NT REALLY COST THE UH DEPARTMENT .
ANYTHING EXTRA .
RIGHT THEY DO NT PAY THEY DO NT PAY FOR THE RECYCLED ITEMS .
THAT SOUNDS GOOD THERE S I I VE BEEN WANTING TO PUT LIKE TWO OF THREE BINS LIKE RIGHT OUT MY GARAGE DOOR WHERE YOU KNOW FROM THE KITCHEN WHERE YOU KNOW YOU CAN THROW CANS IN ONE OR THE GLASS IN THE OTHER OR THE THE EVEN UH THERE ARE AREAS THAT CAN RECYCLE THE THE TIN CANS LIKE YOUR .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW VEGETABLE THINGS COME IN AND UH SO I I VE NOT DONE THAT BUT THAT S KIND OF WHAT I WANT TO SET UP SO BECAUSE WE DO GO THROUGH ALUMINUM CANS YOU KNOW THAT S PROBABLY THE ONE WE USE MOST .
UHHUH .
UH BUT .
WELL WH WHAT KIND OF SERVICES DO YOU HAVE THERE IN LUBBOCK AS FAR AS UH WHERE CAN YOU TAKE YOUR RECYCLE ITEMS I I LIVED IN ABILENE FOR A UH I WENT TO SCHOOL THERE AT ABILENE CHRISTIAN AND I IT WAS SO HARD TO UH YOU KNOW IF YOU .
FIND A PLACE .
YOU WANTED TO RECYCLE YOU NEWSPAPERS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE .
WELL UH UH THEY THEY DO HAVE FACILITIES FOR RECYCLING THE NEWSPAPERS ALUMINUM CANS THOSE ARE THE TWO MAJOR ITEMS YOU KNOW WE CAN TAKE OIL LIKE CAR OIL RECYCLED OIL TO THEY HAVE UH UH DUMP AREAS LIKE AT THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS .
UM .
THROUGHOUT TOWN .
UHHUH .
UH I DO NT KNOW THAT THEY YET HAVE THE FACILITIES HERE TO DO THE TIN CANS .
UHHUH .
UH I THINK THEY CAN DO THE PLASTICS LIKE THE LITER BOTTLES .
UHHUH .
THINGS LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
UH BUT I I DO NT KNOW I KNOW FOR SURE THOUGH THEY HAVE THE NEWSPAPER AND THE ALUMINUM CAN AND THEN THE OIL AT THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS .
UHHUH .
SO .
WELL THAT S GOOD .
I DO THAT I THINK PEOPLE ARE BECOMING MORE AWARE .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW OF OF THE WASTE AND YOU KNOW I I LIKE TO SEE YOU KNOW YOU DRIVE THROUGH BURGER KING NOW AND THE BAGS ARE RECYCLED PAPER .
UHHUH .
AND YOU KNOW SO YOU KNOW I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE ARE MORE AWARE OF IT OR BECOMING MORE AWARE OF IT YOU KNOW MAYBE IT S MAKING AN IMPACT .
UHHUH DO YOU TEND TO BUY MORE RECYCLED ITEMS THAT IF SOMETHING UH THE PACK SAYS RECYCLED AND SOMETHING ELSE DOES NT DO WOULD YOU TEND TO CHOSE THE ONE THAT DOES OR .
I M NOT AS GOOD ABOUT SEARCHING SOMETHING OUT LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
BUT IF I AM THERE AND THE CHOICE IS THERE .
UM .
I WOULD PROBABLY TAKE THE RECYCLED PRODUCT .
UHHUH .
SO YOU KNOW THAT S JUST WHERE I PROBABLY NEED TO BE A LITTLE MORE RESPONSIBLE CITIZEN WISE YOU KNOW LOOKING OR SEARCHING THOSE OUT BECAUSE YOU FIGURE IF WE AS THE CITIZENS DO THAT THEN THE MANUFACTURES AND PRODUCERS WILL START PACKAGING IT THAT WAY .
SURE YEAH .
SO UH YOU KNOW THEY ARE GETTING AWAY FROM THE STYROFOAM .
OKAY KAREN .
YOU YOU RE FIRST .
OKAY .
I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST THING FOR ME IS ROOM FOR ADVANCEMENT .
YOU KNOW NOT TO GET IN LIKE IN A DEAD END JOB .
UHHUH .
AND PLUS FOR ME IT S UH I MEAN LIKE MEDICAL AND YOU KNOW UH BENEFITS AND DENTAL .
OKAY .
THEY RE ALSO IMPORTANT .
YEAH .
I GUESS ONE OF THE DIFFERENCES I SEE IS UH WORKING FOR A UNIVERSITY UH THERE IS ROOM FOR ADVANCEMENT BUT NOT SO MUCH SO OUR IN UH QUITE A HIGHLY UNIONIZED ENVIRONMENT .
UM .
AND THEN ALSO IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE ASSOCIATION SO THERE IS A PROGRESSIVE PATH BUT NOT BEING IN THE SAY .
THE COMMERCIAL SECTOR THE MOTIVATION IS NT THERE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE .
UM .
UH LIKE REALLY .
ARE THEY LIKE PRETTY MUCH TRAIN FOR A SPECIFIC JOB AND THAT WHAT .
I HIRED FOR AND THEN I JUST VERY LITTLE VARIATION FROM THAT .
YEAH SOMEWHAT THAT BUT THEN ALSO THERE JUST IS NT THE ABILITY TO IN ONE SENSE HAVE UH A BROADER SCOPE FOR REWARDING PEOPLE FOR THEIR PERFORMANCES .
UHHUH .
UH SO THAT S IN OUR SITUATION WHERE WE ARE DEALING WITH AN INSTITUTION UH IT S A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT TO RECOGNIZE AN INDIVIDUAL S PERFORMANCE .
UHHUH .
AND I SUPPOSE THAT S MAYBE A DISADVANTAGE OF BEING IN A LARGER INSTITUTION PERHAPS SOMEWHAT EVEN WITH THE BUSINESS UH .
BUT I AGREE YOU KNOW THE UH MEDICAL BENEFITS AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS ARE ONE OF THE BIG PLUSES OF WORKING FOR A LARGE ORGANIZATION AND ALSO THE UH SECURITY ASPECT FOR LONG TERM EMPLOYMENT UH .
WELL YOU KNOW THAT S INTERESTING THOUGH .
BECAUSE I DO NT KNOW IF THAT S NECESSARILY THE CASE ANYMORE .
I USE TO THINK THAT YOU KNOW AFTER YOU WORK YOU MEAN SECURITY JOB SECURITY .
JOB SECURITY YES .
UH THAT USE TO BE I THINK A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO BUT I DO NT KNOW IF IT IS SO MUCH ANYMORE .
IN FACT THEY WE JUST HAD A LAY OFF IN WHAT .
NOVEMBER I GUESS .
UHHUH .
BUT UH IT .
WAS NT NECESSARILY I MEAN YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE HAD BEEN THERE A LONG TIME .
YEAH WE ARE SEEING THAT HERE AS WELL .
LIKE IN SOME OF THE LARGE OIL COMPANIES .
THERE HAS BEEN MASSIVE LAY OFFS .
UHHUH .
UH SO I I THINK THERE .
IT S PROBABLY A MAJOR DISTINCTION BETWEEN INSTITUTIONS AND THE CORPORATE WORLD .
UHHUH .
IN UH INSTITUTIONS ARE SLOWER TO REACT BOTH ON THE GROWTH SIDE AND THEN ALSO ON THE REDUCTION SIDE WHERE THE BUSINESSES WE NEED TO CUT BACK THAT S WHAT .
WE DO .
UHHUH .
NO DOUBT .
BUT .
YEAH .
YEAH AND INSTITUTIONALLY LIKE HERE AT THE UNIVERSITY OH IF THERE IS A CUT BACK WELL GEE IT S NOT WHERE IT NECESSARILY WHERE IT S NEEDED IT S WHERE IT S MOST EXPEDIENT WHICH .
EXPEDIENT YEAH THAT S EXACTLY IT .
YEAH WHERE THE MOST DOLLAR WHERE WHERE YOU KNOW IT CUTS BACK THE MOST .
WELL IN ONE SENSE FOR US IT S WHERE IT MAKES THE LEAST NOISE .
WHICH MEANS IT .
S .
OH .
OFTEN THE LOWEST SUPPORT TYPE ROLES .
OH .
SEE YEAH .
SO WE .
YEAH .
I THINK THAT S ONE OF THE THINGS TOO .
YOU GET TOO MANY MANAGEMENT PEOPLE YOU KNOW .
IT S VERY EASY .
YEAH AND IT S VERY EASY FOR THEM TO SAY OH THIS IS THE BEST WAY WHEN THEY REALLY ARE NT AWARE OF WHAT ALL IT TOOK TO GET THE WORK DONE YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
AND THEN THEY WONDER WHY IT DOES NT GET DONE IN THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME .
WELL THOSE PEOPLE ARE NT THERE ANYMORE .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE IT S SUPPORT PEOPLE .
THAT ARE PROVIDING .
YEAH .
THE SPEED FOR IT .
UHHUH .
YEAH BUT SO WHAT ELSE DO YOU THINK IS IMPORTANT .
WELL THE UH THAT S MAYBE THE MAJORITY OF THE IMPORTANCE I GUESS .
YEAH BECAUSE MY PERSPECTIVE IS FROM AN INSTITUTION UH THE THERE IS NOT MUCH INCENTIVE FOR INNOVATIVENESS .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE THE LIMITATION FOR REWARD IS VERY SEVERE .
UHHUH .
BUT IF YOU RE IN THE CORPORATE WORLD I THINK THERE IS CONSIDERABLE MOTIVATION FOR I GUESS IN INNOVATION ALTHOUGH HE YOU KNOW THE MORE COMPLEX YOUR STRUCTURE .
THE UH LESS DIFFICULT IT IS TO KIND OF CARRY SOME THINGS THROUGH .
UHHUH .
BUT UH I THINK THERE IS UH IT S A LONG TERM TYPE OF PROCESS WHERE IN A SMALL ORGANIZATION .
IT S UH THINGS CAN HAPPEN MUCH MORE QUICKLY AND SO YOU CAN SEE THE REWARD OF THE EFFORTS .
I THINK PROBABLY IN A SMALL YEAH I WAS GOING TO SAY MORE IT S MORE PERSONAL FOR ONE THING .
YOU PROBABLY HAVE A BETTER TEAM UH COOPERATION OR TEAM PLAYING ATMOSPHERE .
RIGHT .
PROBABLY WHERE AS IN A BIGGER CORPORATION I THINK YOU RE JUST A NUMBER YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
YOU END UP BEING YOUR OWN PERSON .
UHHUH .
AND UH IF YOU DO YOUR JOB FINE AND IF SOMEBODY ELSE IS MESSING IT UP WELL THEN THAT S THEIR PROBLEM AND .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW YOU REALLY .
WHEREAS YEAH IN A SMALLER I THINK YOU WOULD BE MORE WILLING TO EITHER HELP THAT PERSON OR HELP IT GET ACCOMPLISHED YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
YEAH .
IT BECOMES THE ORGANIZATION INSTEAD OF PERSON BEING YOU KNOW A PART OF THE INDIVIDUAL .
THEMSELVES .
UHHUH .
WELL I HAVE NT HAD AN AWFUL LOT OF UH INCIDENTS REGARDING CHILD CARE .
WHEN MY TWO YEAR OLD WAS IN NEW ORLEANS SHE GOT BIT ON THE CHEEK AND UH BUT UH THAT S ABOUT THE THE UH THE EXTENT OF IT .
BUT BUT BUT WHEN I REALLY AM A AM CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT UH SO MANY OF THESE CHILD CARE PLACES ARE ARE COMING UNDER UH UH YOU KNOW INVESTIGATION FOR FOR UH YOU KNOW CHILD MOLESTATION .
UHHUH .
AND I AND I AND I M SAYING TO MYSELF WELL YOU KNOW Y YOU DUMP YOUR YOUR YOUR LITTLE TURNIP OFF TO UH YOU KNOW THIS CHILD CARE PLACE AND THEY DO NT PAY VERY MUCH AND W WHY WHY WOULD THEY BE INTERESTED IN IN YOUR LITTLE TURNIP UNLESS YOU KNOW ONE OF THE MOTIVATIONS IN THE HIDDEN AGENDA IS WELL THAT S SOMEBODY TO MOLEST YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
AND UH THAT S A TERRIBLE KIND OF THING AND I DO NT THINK MY CHILDREN HAVE EVER BEEN SUBJECT TO THAT BUT MY WIFE DID NT WORK AND SO WE REALLY DID NT HAVE THAT MUCH EXPOSURE TO IT .
UHHUH .
WELL I AM A WORKING MOTHER .
I HAVE THREE CHILDREN AND MY CHILDREN SINCE I UH SINCE THEY WERE VERY YOUNG I VE HAD VARIOUS UM DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES CHILD CARE ARRANGEMENTS AND LIKE MOST WORKING MOTHERS I M REALLY NOT DEFENSIVE ABOUT IT .
I PERSONALLY FEEL UH IN OUR PARTICULAR SITUATION I M A MUCH BETTER MOTHER WHEN I WORK OUT OF THE HOME AND MY KIDS I THINK ARE VERY VERY SECURE WELL RAISED CHILDREN .
MY COMMENT ON THIS IS THAT WE PAID AN ABSOLUTE FORTUNE .
HUH .
OVER THE YEARS FOR A VARIETY OF OPPORTUNITIES .
SO I I I E YOU KNOW IT IS A PROBLEM .
AND BUT AS YOU POINTED OUT I I THINK THE REAL PROBLEM IS THE LOW PAY CHILD FACILITIES AND THAT IS SOMETIMES WHAT SOME WOMEN .
WHO HAVE TO WORK THAT IS ALL .
THEY CAN AFFORD .
WHEN OUR CHILDREN WERE VERY YOUNG WE HAD A PAY A LIVE IN PAID BABYSITTER THAT .
HUH .
WAS WONDERFUL .
AND THEN AS THEY GOT OLDER THEY WENT TO UH I PREFERRED TO CALL THEM SCHOOLS AND THEY WERE REALLY ALL DAY PRESCHOOLS AND THEY WERE WONDERFUL .
AND I THINK THEY GOT EXPOSED TO A LOT OF NEAT THINGS .
OH WELL THAT S INTERESTING .
BUT WE DID WE REALLY TRULY DID PAY A FORTUNE .
I MEAN WE WERE PAYING AT ONE POINT WELL ABOUT ABOUT A CLOSE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS .
A WEEK FOR TWO CHILDREN .
OH MY GOD .
SO .
WELL YOU MUST HAVE A JUST ONE HERO ACE PROFESSIONAL JOB TO SUPPORT SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
WELL I MUS I M A PHYSICIAN .
UH .
OH WELL YEAH .
AND AS IS MY HUSBAND .
AND AND I FELT UH VERY GOOD ABOUT WORKING .
I M A PEDIATRICIAN ACTUALLY .
UHHUH .
SO UH BUT I THINK THERE ARE SOME WONDERFUL CHILD CARE OPPORTUNITIES OUT THERE FOR CHILDREN BUT AND WE .
ALL KNOW THE KIND OF THINGS THAT YOU RE SUPPOSED TO LOOK FOR .
I THINK .
WELL NOT NOT ALL OF US .
YOU KNOW WHAT .
THE KIND OF THINGS YOU RE SUPPOSED TO LOOK FOR .
I M AN ENGINEER .
OH .
WELL .
AND .
I THINK IT S REAL IMPORTANT THAT YOU HAVE A PLACE THAT FIRST OF ALL PARENTS HAVE A LOT OF INPUT INTO AND THAT THEY RE ALWAYS WELCOME AND THAT THEY HAVE A LOT OF ACTIVITIES WHERE PARENTS COME IN DURING THE DAY AND THAT AT ANY TIME .
YOU CAN DROP IN .
AND WE HAD A REALLY WONDERFUL ARRANGEMENT UH I M WITH THE UNIVERSITY ACTUALLY .
UHHUH .
AND THEY HAD A WONDERFUL UH PROGRAM .
THAT STARTED AT AGE THREE AND IT WAS ABOUT A BLOCK AWAY FROM THE HOSPITAL WHERE I WORK .
AND SO MANY TIMES AT LUNCHTIME I WOULD GO OVER AND VISIT THE CHILDREN AND EAT WITH THEM AND SEE WHAT .
THEY WERE DOING .
AND THEY HAD WONDERFUL THEY HAD THINGS LIKE GARDENS AND LOTS OF PETS AND JUST THEY HAD A FOUR TO ONE .
YEAH .
UH TEACHER STUDENT RATIO .
SO THAT THAT SORT OF AN MOST OF THE TEACHERS HAD DEGREES .
UH .
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS .
A WEEK .
YEAH .
FOR TWO KIDS .
THAT S INCREDIBLE .
IT WAS INCREDIBLE ACTUALLY .
OH OH .
BUT IT WAS GOOD .
I MEAN IT WAS IT AT THAT TIME .
THERE WERE TWO CHILDREN AND THEY WERE IN SPECIAL PROGRAMS AND EACH ONE WAS A LITTLE OVER TWO HUNDRED .
A WEEK AND THEN IN ADDITION I PAID A LITTLE BIT EXTRA .
BUT .
WELL .
THE KIDS WERE I MEAN THEY REALLY HAD SOME GREAT OPPORTUNITIES .
BUT THA .
W .
WHAT .
YOU WERE ALLUDING TO EARLIER IS YOU KNOW WOMEN .
WHO WORK FOR MINIMAL WAGE .
YEAH .
AN AND AND REALLY HAVE T FEEL THEY HAVE TO PUT THEIR CHILDREN SOMETIMES THEY DO PUT THEM IN UH FAIRLY LOW .
YOU KNOW .
PAYING SIT SITUATIONS .
THEY COULD SOMEBODY WILL HAVE A JOB AT THREE HUNDRED .
A WEEK TO GET OFF WELFARE AND .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THAT S A GOOD STARTING WAGE BUT .
UHHUH .
BOY THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS .
A WEEK DOES NT GO VERY FAR ON CHILD CARE .
NO EVEN THAT THAT REALLY I THINK I DO NT IT S BEEN AWHILE SINCE I VE LOOKED AT MY YOUNGEST CHILD IS EIGHT .
SO IT S BEEN A LITTLE WHILE SINCE I VE LOOKED INTO ACTUALLY DAYCARE CENTERS .
BUT THEY ARE .
HUH .
YOU KNOW THE GOOD ONES DO COST MAYBE SIXTY DOLLARS .
A WEEK SINCE MUMBLEX .
I MEAN WE USED TO PAY PAY FIFTY CENTS .
AN HOUR TO BABYSIT .
BUT MI MINE ARE TWENTYTWO TWENTYTHREE AND TWENTYSEVEN SO .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THAT I GUESS BABYSITTERS NOW ARE UP AT WHAT FIVE DOLLARS .
AN HOUR .
SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
OH MY .
WELL YOU KNOW BUT YOU MADE THE COMMENT EARLIER WHY WOULD SOMEONE BE INTERESTED IN CHILDREN .
I MEAN IT HAS BEEN A REAL UH TH THERE HAVE BEEN SOME GOOD ENTREPRENEURIAL TYPE EXPERIENCES .
AND I THINK I THINK THEY HAVE CAPTURED A CERTAIN MARKET .
AGAIN THE BUT THEN THERE ARE BABYSITTING GROUPS .
AS A PEDIATRICIAN ONE OF THE THINGS WE VE BEEN REAL CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE INFECTIONS .
UHHUH .
AS YOU START PUTTING LOTS OF LITTLE KIDS TOGETHER THE INFECTION RATES .
THAT GO AROUND .
OH YEAH .
RIGHT UH ACTUALLY I LIVED OVER IN EUROPE FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS I LIVED IN GERMANY AND IN GERMANY THEY DO NT HAVE THE JURY SYSTEM .
WHAT .
THEY DO IS THEY HAVE UH THREE JUDGES BASICALLY .
AND YOU GET UP THERE AND THE PROSECUTING ATTORNEY PRESENTS HIS EVIDENCE AND YOUR DEFENSE ATTORNEY PRESENTS THEIR EVIDENCE AND THOSE THREE GUYS TAKE THE EVIDENCE GO OFF FIGURE IT OUT AND THEN COME BACK AND SAY WHETHER YOU RE GUILTY OR NOT .
OU OU OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS IN SUCH TOTAL CHAOS .
I THINK WHAT .
THEY NEED TO DO IS THEY NEED TO SOMEHOW TAKE THE MONEY OUT OF IT .
I MEAN WHEN YOU HAVE A MAN .
THAT S SIGNED A A A STATEMENT SAYING HE S GUILTY WE HAVE A A FAMILY CALLED ALL DAY FAMILY .
THEY WERE ALL MURDERED .
UHHUH .
ALL THE PEOPLE SIGNED CONFESSIONS THEY WENT TO A TRIAL BY JURY .
THEY BEEN TRYING THESE PEOPLE NOW FOR TWENTYTWO YEARS EVER SINCE I WAS A CHILD .
WOW .
AND WHAT .
THEY VE DONE IS THEY VE BOUGHT MERCEDES AFTER MERCEDES AFTER MERCEDES IS WHAT .
THEY VE DONE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH JUSTICE WHATSOEVER .
WELL YOU KNOW IT S IT S ONE OF THOSE THINGS I MEAN UH UH I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT IT .
I IF THEY DID IT WITH THE UH JUST THE JUDGES THE POLICE HAVE TO DO A LOT BETTER JOB OF MAKING SURE THAT THEIR EVIDENCE IS AIRTIGHT BECAUSE THE JUDGES SITTING IN THAT KIND OF STUFF DAY AFTER DAY THEY KNOW ALL THE PROCEDURES THEY KNOW WHAT S GOOD AND WHAT IS NT THEY D BE ABLE TO SAY I M SORRY YOU CA NT USE THIS AS UH EVIDENCE YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT WAS EITHER ILLEGALLY OBTAINED OR WHATEVER AND YOU KNOW YOU WOULD NT HAVE THIS UH UH THEATRICS WHERE THE LAWYER JUMPS UP AND PRESENTS IT TO THE TO THE JURY AND THEN THE JUDGE SAYS OH NO D DISREGARD THAT .
COME ON ANY JURY S NOT GOING TO DISREGARD THE EVIDENCE YOU KNOW .
UH THAT S TRUE .
I I I THINK OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS ATTORNEY WELFARE .
MYSELF .
THAT MAY VERY WELL BE .
I I HOLD IT IN THE UTMOST CONTEMPT .
UH .
THE UH D MY FAVORITE IS THE POLICE DEPARTMENT THEY RE NOT AIMED AT THE CRIMINAL .
THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS AIMED AT THE CITIZENS BECAUSE YOU AND I WE HAVE WORK SCHEDULES WE CAN BE CALLED AT WORK WE HAVE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS THEY CAN TRACE US DOWN WE HAVE TELEPHONES THEN WE HAVE CHECKBOOKS .
CRIMINALS HAVE NONE OF THESE THINGS .
THEY RE REAL DIFFICULT TO CATCH AND IF THEY DO CATCH THEM THEY DO NT GET ANY MONETARY GAIN OUT OF IT WHEREAS US WE WRITE A CHECK .
YEAH .
SO WHERE DO YOU THINK THEY TARGET THEIR EFFORTS .
THAT S TRUE .
YOU .
D .
THEY TARGET THEIR EFFORTS TOWARD THE CITIZENS .
WELL .
NOT THE CRIMINALS .
HOW WOULD YOU GO ABOUT CHANGING IT .
YOU KNOW THAT S A I VE NAILED THE PROBLEM DOWN BUT I .
LEAVE THE DETAILS UP TO SOMEBODY ELSE HUH .
YEAH I M GOING TO HAVE TO LEAVE THOSE DETAILS LIKE WHAT WOULD YOU DO ABOUT I THINK TO BEGIN WITH YOU WOULD H YOU WOULD HAVE LIKE HERE IN ATLANTA AREA OUR CRIME RATE IS JUST ASTRONOMICAL YET YOU GO OUT ON THE STREETS AND THEY RE GIVING SPEEDING TICKETS .
YEAH .
I THINK SOMEHOW YOU HAVE TO SEPARATE THE REVENUES FROM .
WELL YOU KNOW UH TALKING ABOUT THE LAWYERS YOU KNOW WHAT MIGHT VERY WELL DO UH CAUSE A UH A DROP IN THE NUMBER OF LAWYERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT IS TO SET THE FEES FOR CASES .
IT .
S KIND OF LIKE DO IT DO IT IN THE SIMILAR VEIN SIMILAR LIKE UH V C R OR TELEVISION REPAIR .
IF YOU TAKE YOUR T V IN A LOT OF THESE T V REPAIR PLACES WILL SAY WELL I LL REPAIR YOUR T V FOR A HUNDRED DOLLARS AND IF HE GETS IN THERE AND STARTS ROOTING AROUND AND FINDS SOMETHING IN THERE .
THAT S REALLY TREMENDOUSLY WRONG WITH IT THEN HE EATS IT .
HE HE REPAIRS IT GIVES IT BACK TO YOU AND TAKES YOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS .
NOW IF HE COMES IN AND SAYS YOU KNOW I LL REPAIR YOUR YOUR V C R OR SOMEBODY ELSE S V C R FOR A HUNDRED DOLLARS GETS IN THERE MAYBE IT S A BLOWN FUSE TAKES HIM .
TWO MINUTES HE .
FIXES .
IT HE STILL CHARGES YOU THAT HUNDRED DOLLARS .
SO MAYBE IF WE DID THAT WITH THE LAWYERS SO THAT YOU KNOW WHETHER IT S A MURDER CASE OR A YOU KNOW A CIVIL UH SOMEBODY SUING SOMEBODY ELSE YOU GET X DOLLARS FOR THAT CASE AND THAT S IT .
NOW .
NONE OF THIS .
I FIRMLY BELIEVE IN THAT BECAUSE WHEN YOU GET THE MOST HEINOUS OF CRIMES HAVE YOU EVER NOTICED YOU ALWAYS GET THE MOST RENOWNED DEFENSE ATTORNEY .
OH YEAH .
AND HERE S THIS BUM .
THAT DID NT HAVE A JOB .
YEAH .
AND HE S GOT A ATTORNEY THAT YOU AND I COULD NEVER AFFORD .
THAT S TRUE .
WHO .
S .
YEAH .
PAYING FOR THAT .
UM Y WELL YOU YOU KNOW YOU RE TALKING TO PART OF THEM .
THAT S PAYING FOR THAT .
YEAH AND YOU RE TALKING TO THE OTHER HALF .
THAT S PAYING FOR IT .
THAT S RIGHT .
YOU KNOW THAT S IT IT S IT S AMAZING AND AND WHEN YOU STOP AND LOOK AT IT I MEAN THE JUDGES TH THEY RE ALL FORMER LAWYERS .
YEAH WELL THAT S ANOTHER PROBLEM .
I THINK TO REALLY CORRECT THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM YOU HAVE TO GET THE LAWYERS OUT OF IT .
I MEAN THEY RE THEY RE TOTALLY AND MORALLY BANKRUPT WITHOUT ANY ETHICS WHATSOEVER AND WITH THAT TYPE PERSON RUNNING IT I MEAN YOU YOU COULD EXPECT THAT YOU .
SO JULIE HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT AIDS RESEARCH .
I THINK WE NEED WE DEFINITELY NEED MORE OF IT DEFINITELY .
I D AGREE TOO BUT I MEAN IT SEEMS LIKE IT JUST MAKES ECONOMIC SENSE IN THAT YOU KNOW UH YOU KNOW IT WOULD HAVE MADE EVEN BETTER ECONOMIC SENSE TO TO TO HAVE HAD A LOT MORE RESEARCH THAN A L L LONGER AGO .
OH YEAH YEAH FOR CERTAIN .
YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU KNOW BECAUSE UH THE COUNTRY S GOING TO WIND UP PAYING FOR THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS .
EXACTLY .
UHHUH .
EXACTLY .
DOES DOES LIKE D DO HEALTH INSURANCE POLICIES LIKE FOR COMPANIES AND THINGS DO THEY COVER DISEASES LIKE THAT .
I THINK THEY COVER AIDS BUT WHAT .
THEY DO IS UH IF YOU KNOW YOU APPLY FOR FOR TO GET A A INSURANCE POLICY .
UHHUH .
THEY LL UH CHECK TO SEE IF YOU RE H I V POSITIVE AND IF YOU ARE NOT ONLY WILL THEY NOT GIVE YOU UH A POLICY BUT THEY LL UH THEY HAVE LIKE THERE S LIKE YOU KNOW A DATABASE OF PEOPLE .
THAT HAVE TESTED POSITIVE SO YOU LL NEVER BE ABLE TO GET INSURANCE EVER AGAIN .
UM WELL THAT S BUT THAT S WHY THEY SHOULD HAVE S STARTED DOING STUFF BEFORE .
I MEAN STILL YOU KNOW SINCE IT S DORMANT FOR SUCH A LONG TIME THERE S STILL PROBABLY A LOT OF PEOPLE YOU KNOW BEFORE THE TESTS EVER REALLY CAME OUT .
YEAH .
WHO ARE WHO ARE DRAINING A LOT OF MONEY RIGHT NOW .
YOU KNOW .
I THINK A LOT OF IT WAS WAS JUST THAT YOU KNOW BECAU BECAUSE OF OF THE AUDI YOU KNOW BECAUSE BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF THE HIGH RISK GROUPS WERE PEOPLE .
RIGHT .
NO ONE REALLY CARED ABOUT .
RIGHT .
THAT .
RIGHT AND ALL THESE GODFEARING PEOPLE WERE LIKE WELL YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
GOD IS TRYING TO KILL OFF ALL THE ET CETERA ET CETERA .
UHHUH YEAH UH YEAH ONE ONE ONE H ONE HUMOROUS RETORT .
I HEARD HEARD SOMEONE YOU KNOW WHO CLAIMED THAT YOU KNOW AIDS WAS YOU KNOW GOD S PUNISHMENT .
UH .
WAS THAT THEN LESBIANS MUST BE GOD S CHOSEN PEOPLE .
YEAH .
BUT UH .
BOY THAT S A GOOD ONE .
SO UH .
YES .
UH DO YOU THINK D YOU MEAN DO YOU ACTUALLY THINK WE RE DOING ENOUGH RIGHT NOW TO .
NO I REALLY DO NT .
I DID I DID LIKE A RESEARCH KIND OF THING ON AIDS RESEARCH AND STUFF AND UH REALLY WE RE NOT DOING MUCH AT ALL I MEAN MOST OF WHAT GETS RAISED I MEAN IT S NOT REALLY FEDERAL MOVEMENT MOST OF WHAT GETS RAISED GETS RAISED BY UH UH YOU KNOW .
PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS .
CONSCIOUS YEAH COMMUNITIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
LIKE UH SAN FRANCISCO HAS A A REAL UH STRONG AIDS SUPPORT GROUP AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF AND .
UHHUH .
AND UH GET THEY GET DONATIONS FROM THE COMMUNITY YOU KNOW THEY RE REAL .
UHHUH .
AND FROM CORPORATIONS AROUND THE AROUND THE CITY YOU KNOW FOR AIDS RESEARCH AND THAT KIND OF THING AND UH I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE OF THAT SORT OF ON A FEDERAL LEVEL YOU KNOW RATHER THAN JUST IN THE PLACES WHERE IT S YOU KNOW WHERE IT S PREDOMINATED SO FAR BECAUSE IT S YOU KNOW IT S .
UHHUH .
BOUND TO SPREAD .
I MEAN IT SEEMS THAT YOU KNOW IT S JUST YOU KNOW OF IT S JUST GOING TO REACH A STEADY A STEADY STATE .
A LET A LOT LOT HIGHER POINT THAN IT WILL IF WE YOU KNOW WE D NIP IT IN THE BUD TO Q QUOTE BARNEY FIFE .
RIGHT .
YEAH .
I DO NT KNOW I DO NT KNOW I I I DO NT KNOW WHAT .
THE LIKELIHOOD OF THAT IS BUT I MEAN YOU KNOW PEOPLE REALLY WAKING UP .
UHHUH .
ESPECIALLY WITH THE ULTRA CONSERVATIVES .
UHHUH .
MOVE OUR OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM S SORT OF SEEMS TO BE TAKING .
UHHUH .
I WOULD PROBABLY AGREE WITH THAT .
YEAH SO .
UH SO DO DO YOU THINK IT S MORE IMPORTANT TO SPEND MONEY ON RESEARCH OR FOR SUPPORT OF UH PEOPLE .
GOD THAT S A GOOD QUESTION FISH .
I DO NT KNOW UH I THINK I THINK ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS .
THAT S REALLY IMPORTANT TO SPEND MONEY ON IS EDUCATION NOT SUPPORT OR OR RESEARCH PER SE BUT BUT EDUCATION BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE SORT OF GET DRUMMED OUT OF THE WORK PLACE AND OUT OF SOCIETY YOU KNOW KIND OF LIKE LEPERS WOULD .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
AND IT S REALLY IT S REALLY NOT NECESSARY UH UNTIL UNTIL THE DISEASE REACHES ITS FINAL STAGE YOU KNOW BECOMES REALLY INFECTIOUS .
UHHUH .
AND UH I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE SUPPORT THEY COULD GET IS FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT .
THEY RE GOING THROUGH AND EVERYTHING AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND THAT .
UHHUH .
THEY RE NOT YOU KNOW THEY DO NT THEY DO NT HAVE TO BE JUST COMPLETELY CUT OFF FROM FROM THE COMMUNITY .
UHHUH .
AND THAT AND UH I DO NT KNOW I GUESS I THINK THAT THAT UH RESEARCH IS I GUESS THE MOST IMPORTANT JUST BECAUSE I YOU KNOW IT IT REALLY NEEDS TO COME TO AN END .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW .
I DO NT KNOW .
I DO NT KNOW FISH .
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT SUBJECT .
I THINK IT S I THINK IT STANDS A REALLY INTERESTING QUESTION OF UH .
WELL I M ARE YOU THERE .
YES YES .
OKAY I M SURE THAT I PROBABLY UH PRESCRIBE TO DIFFERENT MAGAZINES ONES THAT YOU DO I TAKE DOLL READER AND DOLL WORLD .
DIFFERENT SET .
BECAUSE I COLLECT DOLLS UH I ALSO TAKE BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS .
UHHUH .
I LIKE THAT AND THEN UH MY HUSBAND HE JUST UH SUBSCRIBED TO A WOOD HE JUST STARTED A WOODWORK SO HE JUST SENT AWAY TO GET SOME WOODWORKING BOOKS .
OH MUMBLEX .
SO WHAT KIND DO YOU UH GET .
WELL I HAVE A BUNCH OF COMPUTER JOURNALS .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE I M IN COMPUTER SCIENCE BUT BEYOND THAT UH LATELY I VE BEEN READING I VE ALWAYS LIKED THE NEW YORKER .
UHHUH .
AND LATELY I VE BEEN PICKING UP SOME OF THE TRAVEL UH BOTH TRADE MAGAZINES AND JUST THE GENERAL TRAVEL MAGAZINES .
UHHUH .
UH TRYING TO KEEP UP ON WHAT S GOING ON MUMBLEX MY .
IS IT .
WIFE ALSO GETS A LOT OF THE FOOD MAGAZINES BON APPETITE AND FOOD AND WINE AND GOURMET .
YEAH I USED TO TAKE THAT RIGHT .
YEAH AND SHE STILL LIKES TO GET TIME .
YEAH .
WHICH I VE NEVER LIKED VERY MUCH BUT SHE SEEMS TO .
YEAH I DO NT I IF I YOU KNOW IF I HAPPEN TO FIND IT I LL GO AHEAD AND READ IT SOMEPLACE YOU KNOW IF I M IN A DOCTOR S OFFICE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT OTHER THAN THAT I NEVER I NEVER LIKED THAT REALLY .
DO YOU READ A NEWSPAPER .
I READ MY NEWSPAPER .
I CAN HARDLY WAIT IN THE MORNINGS FOR THE NEWSPAPER .
YEAH .
TO GET HERE YOU KNOW SO I DO LIKE TO READ THE NEWSPAPER UH EVEN THIS LITTLE NEWSPAPER THAT PATTERSON PUTS OUT IN FACT IT PUTS IT OUT ON TUESDAYS AND THURSDAYS I CAN HARDLY WAIT TO GET THAT TO GET THE LOCAL NEWS BUT UH OTHER THAN THAT MAGAZINES I DO NT KNOW THERE S SO MUCH ADVERTISING IN THEM ANYMORE .
SOME OF THEM I USED TO GET FOR THE ADVERTISING LIKE BYTE MAGAZINE WHICH IS UH ONE OF THE .
OH OKAY .
LARGER COMPUTER ONES I HAVE NT BOUGHT IT NOW FOR ABOUT EIGHT YEARS .
UHHUH .
BUT WHEN I USED TO GET IT IT WAS ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED PAGES ABOUT THREE HUNDRED OF THEM ADVERTISING .
HUH .
BECAUSE THAT WAS INTERESTING I THINK A LOT OF THE TRADE MAGAZINES ARE LIKE THAT .
UHHUH UHHUH .
THAT THAT HALF THE FUN IS FINDING OUT WHAT ALL THE PRODUCTS ARE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
BUT YOU KNOW SOME OF THE GET RIDICULOUS TRAVEL AND LEISURE ALL OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS MAGAZINES .
UHHUH .
SO TRAVEL AND LEISURE FOOD AND WINE AND I THINK THEY HAVE SOME OTHERS UH CERTAINLY HALF THE PAGES AND MAYBE MORE ARE PURE ADS PLUS THEY HAVE THE ADVERTISING SUPPLEMENT SECTIONS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE ARTICLES BUT ARE PAID FOR AND .
IT IS IT S CLEAR THAT I I VE BOUGHT SOME OF THESE THROUGH WHOLESALERS AND THEY DO NT CARE IF THEY MAKE ANY MONEY ON THE MAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTION THEY RE MAKING EVERYTHING ON ADS .
YEAH RIGHT RIGHT YEAH WELL I I ONLY YOU KNOW SUBSCRIBE TO THE THINGS I M INTERESTED IN I USED TO BE INTO COIN COLLECTING SO I USED TO GET THE COIN MAGAZINE THE PAPER ACTUALLY IS WHAT IT WAS YOU KNOW I USED TO GET THAT SO NOW THAT I M INTO DOLLS THAT S ABOUT .
UHHUH .
ALL I REALLY REALLY WANT YOU KNOW .
HAVE YOU EVER UH READ OR SUBSCRIBE TO CONSUMER REPORTS FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME .
NO HUHUH UH I THINK THEY RE INTERESTING .
BUT NOT WORTH IT .
YEAH .
I I VE ALWAYS HAD THIS ONE OF THE REASONS I LIKE JUST TO PICK UP MAGAZINES IN OTHER FIELDS IS THAT YOU SEEM TO GET A VERY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE .
UHHUH .
SO I VE ALWAYS HAD THIS PROBLEM WITH CONSUMER REPORTS THAT IN THE AREAS THAT I KNOW A LOT ABOUT I DISAGREE WITH THEM .
UHHUH .
AND I ALWAYS WONDER WHETHER THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO KNOW A LOT ABOUT EVERY AREA DISAGREEING WITH THEM ON EVERYTHING .
OR OR WHAT S GOING ON .
UHHUH .
SO I LIKE I VE PICKED UP NOW A SUBSCRIPTION TO ONE OF THE TRAVEL AGENT UH ORGANIZATION MAGAZINES AND IT S A RIDICULOUS DIFFERENCE WHEN YOU START READING FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE UH YOU KNOW THEIR MAJOR INTEREST IS IN COMMISSIONS AND YOU KNOW THERE S VERY LITTLE TALK ABOUT THE QUALITY OF PLACES OR AIRLINES THEIR MAJOR TALK IS ABOUT YOU KNOW COMMISSIONS AND COMMISSION REBATES AND HOW THEY WO NT SUGGEST HOTELS TO PEOPLE IF THE COMMISSION S NOT A THE FULL TEN PERCENT OR WHATEVER IT IS AND .
UHHUH .
IT GIVES YOU A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT PEOPLE DO .
UHHUH UHHUH WELL THOSE TRAVEL MAGAZINES ARE THAT MORE OR LESS SHOW YOU DIFFERENT COUNTRIES THAT YOU COULD GO TO OR .
UH SOME OF THEM THE THE GENERAL TRAVEL MAGAZINES DO I DO NT TEND TO READ IT FOR THAT .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE I DO NT EXPECT TO BE TRAVELING OVERSEAS IN IN THE FUTURE FOR QUITE AWHILE .
UHHUH .
BUT I I USUALLY JUST READ THROUGH THE SECTIONS ON ON DOMESTIC STUFF .
UHHUH UHHUH OKAY WELL I DO NT KNOW ANY OTHER MAGAZINES I COULD TALK TO YOU ABOUT .
NO .
UH I DO NT TAKE ANYMORE THAN THAT .
YEAH I DO NT TAKE MUCH MORE IN MYSELF .
YOU KNOW SO .
OKAY .
WELL I GUESS THAT WILL BE IT THEN AND .
OKAY NICE TALKING TO YOU .
YOUR TURN .
OH I I START .
OKAY .
WELL UH WE KEEP A BUDGET TO AN EXTENT .
UH AND REALLY I I WE WERE REALLY FORCED INTO KEEPING A BUDGET BECAUSE I M I M PAID ONCE A MONTH .
WHICH SORT OF SORT OF FORCES SOME UH UH RESTRICTIONS AND YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE ALL YOUR BILLS ARE PAID .
UH ABOUT YOURSELF .
WELL I HAVE TO SAY I REALLY DO NT HAVE A BUDGET .
BOTH MY WIFE AND I UH GREW UP IN UH FAMILIES OF RATHER MODEST MEANS AND UH OUR FAMILY INCOME AT THIS POINT IS COMFORTABLE .
UPPER MIDDLE CLASS .
I GUESS YOU MIGHT SAY .
AND UH WE RE BOTH SO UH FRUGAL THAT UH WE REALLY DO NT NEED A BUDGET YOU KNOW .
WE JUST SORT OF INVEST THE MONEY AND GO ON VACATIONS AND ALWAYS NEVER SEEM TO HAVE ANY MONEY PROBLEMS .
WHICH .
I GUESS IS A COMFORTABLE THING .
YEAH .
WELL I GUESS THAT REALLY IS SORT OF UH KEEPING A BUDGET YOU KNOW .
YOU STAY WITHIN YOUR UH .
WELL WE STAY WITHIN OUR MEANS BUT WE .
WITHIN YOUR MEANS .
DO NT DO IT UH BY CONSCIOUS EFFORT .
IT JUST SORT OF HAPPENS AUTOMATICALLY .
YEAH .
ALTHOUGH WE JUST MOVED TO CALIFORNIA AND UH THE COST OF LIVING HERE IN CALIFORNIA IS UH I WOULD SAY RATHER PATHOLOGICAL .
YES .
UH HOUSING PRICES ARE YOU KNOW LIKE FROM FOUR TO TEN TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE THAN UH UH THEY WERE WHERE I CAME FROM IN UH DALLAS .
OH YOU MOVED FROM DALLAS TO SAN FRANCISCO .
YEAH .
SO UH .
THAT IS A HUGH DIFFERENCE .
UH THAT PRESENTS A A REAL SHOCK .
YEAH .
AC AC ACTUALLY OUR STANDARD OF LIVING HAS GONE DOWN SOMEWHAT SINCE WE VE MOVED TO CALIFORNIA BUT .
BUT YOU HAVE GOOD SOUR DOUGH AND IT S A BEAUTIFUL PLACE TO LIVE .
YEAH .
IT S GOD S COUNTRY .
YEAH .
UH AND ONE WAY .
YOU KNOW THAT IS THAT ONLY GOD CAN AFFORD IT .
UH SO BUDGET IS NOT A PROBLEM FOR US .
UH AT LEAST .
IT HAS NT BEEN .
IT MAY MAY BE AT THIS POINT .
BUT UH UP UNTIL THIS POINT .
IT REALLY HAS NT BEEN .
WHEN I UH WAS IN UH UNDERGRADUATE SCHOOL .
A LONG LONG TIME AGO I UH NOTED THAT THE MONTHLY SALARY STARTING AVERAGE MONTHLY SALARY SALARY FOR ENGINEERS .
THAT YOU KNOW IN MY DISCIPLINE WAS LIKE OH SIX HUNDRED TEN DOLLARS .
A MONTH OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
AND UH I NOTED AT THAT POINT THAT I WAS YOU KNOW IF THAT S WHAT .
MY SALARY WAS THAT I DREW THEN I WOULD BE MAKING ALMOST TWICE AS MUCH AS MY FATHER MADE DURING HIS BEST YEAR EVER .
SO I STOPPED WORRYING ABOUT MONEY .
YEAH .
AND IT NEVER HAVE WORRIED ABOUT MONEY SINCE THEN .
WELL THAT THAT S A SYSTEM TOO .
SOMETIMES UH IT S A BIT OF A A PROBLEM YOU KNOW BECAUSE I GUESS I DO NT REALLY MANAGE MY MONEY .
THE WAY .
I SHOULD .
BUT UH I SUPPOSE I VE LOST MONEY ON NOT TAKING GOOD ADVANTAGE OF OF UH INVESTMENTS BUT .
WELL THEN AGAIN YOU KNOW YOU SAID YOU YOU ARE ABLE TO TAKE TRIPS .
AND YOU DO OBVIOUSLY HAVE ENOUGH TO LIVE ON SO I GUESS YOU RE INDIRECTLY BUDGETING .
UHHUH .
UH JUST BYEBYE THE FACT THAT YOU SAID YOU RE BOTH VERY FRUGAL UH IN SPENDING THE MONEY .
SO I MEAN THAT S THAT S A FORM OF BUDGETING I WOULD THINK .
IT S IT S KIND OF A STRANGE TOPIC TO TO TRY TO FOR TWO PEOPLE .
WHO DO NT REALLY HAVE A BUDGET TO TALK ABOUT BUDGETING AND HOW THEY MANAGE THEIR MONEY .
WELL I GUESS WE RE BOTH LUCKY IN THAT REGARD THEN .
YEAH .
HOW BIG IS YOUR FAMILY .
UH WELL WE RE WE HAVE ONE ON THE WAY .
I SEE .
UH MY WIFE AND THEN WE RE WE RE HAVING ONE ON THE WAY IN UH IN UH SEPTEMBER .
SO HOW YOU WHE ONCE YOU GET TEN CHILDREN THOUGH YOU MAY HAVE .
NO I THINK IT S JUST GOING TO BE ONE .
OH ALL RIGHT .
HOW ABOUT YOURSELF .
I HAVE TWO KIDS .
UH ONE .
OH .
NINE AND ONE THIRTEEN AND THEY ARE BEGINNING TO BE A BUDGET PROBLEM BUT UH HAVE NOT BEEN REALLY UP UNTIL THIS UP TO THIS POINT .
DO THEY BUDGET AT ALL .
I MEAN DO YOU HAVE THEM ON AN ALLOWANCE .
I GIVE THEM .
A I GIVE THEM .
AN ALLOWANCE AND THEY UH I BASICALLY GIVE MY SON TEN DOLLARS .
A WEEK AND I PUT HALF OF IT IN THE BANK AND I GIVE GIVE HIM .
THE OTHER HALF IN COLD CASH .
YEAH .
AND UH HE HAS A TELLER CARD SO HE CAN UH DO WHAT .
HE .
WI DO WHAT .
HE WISHES WITH THE MONEY THAT I PUT IN THE BANK .
BUT AT LEAST IT IS NT YOU KNOW BURNING A HOLE IN HIS POCKET .
YEAH .
IF HE WANTS TO USE IT HE HAS TO GO GET IT AND THAT USUALLY .
SO .
HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT SATURNS .
I VE HEARD SOME ABOUT SATURNS .
I DO NT KNOW A LOT ABOUT THEM .
I HAVE NT BEEN OVER UH TO A DEALER TO LOOK AT THEM ALTHOUGH I DID SEE SOMETHING IN TONIGHT S PAPER .
THAT SAID THAT THEIR UH RELIABILITY IS RATED TO BE EQUAL TO THAT OF THE I GUESS THE JAPANESE CARS .
OOH THAT S GREAT .
ACTUALLY THAT S KIND OF THE TYPE OF CAR THAT I I M THINKING ABOUT WE MIGHT GET .
SATURNS YOU CA NT GO TO A DEALER UNLESS YOU GO TO A A SATURN DEALER .
UHHUH .
THIS THIS OFFSHOOT OF G M .
YEAH .
AND UH SUPPOSEDLY THEY VE GOT GREAT CUSTOMER SATISFACTION FROM WHAT THINGS I VE HEARD .
UM .
YEAH I VE HEARD A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE THEM .
UH YET I DO NT KNOW WH WHETHER I WOULD BUY SATURN OR NOT AT THIS POINT .
I M KIND OF MY CARD AND UH DESIRES TEND TO BE PRETTY PICKY AND SO UH .
WELL LIKE WHAT .
WELL LET S SEE .
I LI I LIKE CARS .
THAT ARE DESIGNED WITH WITH HUMAN BEINGS IN MIND .
AND THAT S NOT JUST THE DRIVER AND THE PASSENGER BUT THAT S THE PERSON .
WHO S WORKING ON IT CAUSE I DO AL ALMOST ALL MY OWN MAINTENANCE AND UH .
UHHUH .
THOSE TYPES OF THINGS .
AND I FOUND THAT WHILE YOU CAN FIND SOME CARS .
THAT ARE COMFORTABLE TO RIDE IN UH FINDING A CA CAR ANYMORE THAT S THAT S FAIRLY EASY FOR ME TO WORK ON IT S JUST NOT VERY EAS IT S NOT VERY ALMOST UNLIKELY AT THIS POINT .
YEAH .
AND UH YO .
YEAH .
I VE GOT A SIXTYFIVE MUSTANG AND .
OOH .
I AND I DO THE WORK ON MOST OF THE WORK ON THAT .
MYSELF .
UHHUH .
AND WHEN I LOOK AT MODERN CARS AND STUFF LIKE THAT I JUST SAY I WILL NEVER DO THAT WITH THE MODERN CARS .
IT S NOT WORTH MY TIME .
YOU CA NT GET IN THERE .
YOU CA NT DO ANYTHING .
YEAH .
AND IT S SO COMPLICATED TOO .
I LOOK AT IT AND I SAY BOY YOU KNOW I I D HAVE TO ALMOST GO TAKE A CLASS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
WELL I VE GOT AN EIGHTYTHREE SAAB .
UHHUH .
AND I FIND THAT FOR A NORMAL YOU KNOW EVERYDAY THINGS .
IT S REALLY VERY EASY TO WORK ON AND SO UH YOU KNOW I M KIND OF SPOILED .
I USED TO HAVE A MUMBLEX CHEVY .
UHHUH .
WITH A THREE FIFTY IN IT .
YEAH .
AND UH I REALLY LIKED WORKING ON IT .
UH CAUSE IT WAS PRETTY EASY TOO .
IT WAS ABOUT A NINETEEN SEVENTY .
SO I M KIND OF UH BIASED IN THAT AND YOU KNOW I WANT A CAR THAT I CAN WORK ON BECAUSE I THINK IT JUST COSTS TOO MUCH EVEN TO GET THE OIL CHANGED ANYMORE .
YEAH .
AND THAT S KIND OF THAT S THAT S PROBABLY ONE THING .
I D LOOK AT .
I THINK ANOTHER THING .
I D LOOK AT IS SAFETY .
YEAH .
THAT S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MY WIFE AND I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT .
ACTUALLY THE CAR ONE OF THE CARS WE D MOST LIKE TO GET WOULD BE THE NEW NINETYONE FORD TAURUS CAUSE THEY RE ACTUALLY ONE OF THE CHEAPER CARS .
THAT HAVE DUAL .
HUH .
SIDE AIR BAGS .
THAT S A REAL NICE CAR I THINK .
YEAH .
I VE DRIVEN SOME UH TAURUSES OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN I VE BEEN ON BUSINESS TRIPS .
UHHUH .
UH AS RENTAL CARS .
AND I VE ALWAYS BEEN VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE TAURUS .
IT S A REALLY NICE CAR .
I THINK IT S VERY IT S A STYLISH CAR .
BOTH INSIDE AND OUT .
IT S COMFORTABLE TO DRIVE .
UH REASONABLE PERFORMANCE AND THIS IS OUT IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WHERE THEY DO NT MAKE A CAR .
THAT S GOT REASONABLE PERFORMANCE ANYMORE .
YEAH .
UH I VE BEEN REAL IMPRESSED WITH THAT .
YO AND I DID NT REALIZE THAT THEY WERE PUTTING DUAL UH AIR BAGS IN THAT CAR NOW .
NINETY YEAH .
OR EXCUSE ME THE NINETYTWOS .
THE .
UHHUH .
NINETYTWOS HAD DUAL AIR BAGS .
THIS NEWEST MODEL .
YOU COULD .
OH I THINK THAT .
GET THEM WITH DUALS .
THAT S EXCELLENT .
THAT S EXCELLENT BECAUSE .
YEAH .
BUT THE THING IS THAT IT S TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS .
ACTUALLY MY MY WIFE AND I ARE ACTUALLY THINKING CONTEMPLATING BUYING A NEW CAR IN THE NEXT YEAR AND A HALF OR SO .
SO WE RE ACTUALLY .
OH .
BEEN LOOKING AROUND AND THINKING ABOUT THINGS .
WE D LIKE TO GET LIKE A OH I DO NT KNOW .
WHAT DO YOU CALL IT .
A DEALER RETURN TYPE THING ON A NINETYTWO AND NINETYTHREE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
YEAR OLD NINETYTWO OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
SURE .
THOSE ARE .
SEE IF WE .
YEAH THAT THAT WOULD BE A GOOD DEAL TO GO WITH .
AND THE OTHER THING .
WE RE LOOKING AT IS THE SATURNS TOO .
OKAY .
BECAUSE THEY LOOKED REALLY NICE .
UHHUH .
WHAT DO YOU WHAT DO YOU LOOKING FOR IN IN THOSE .
WHAT WHAT ATTRACTS YOU TO THE SATURNS .
OR OR OF COURSE WE VE ALREADY TALKED YOU KNOW THE TAURUS IS SAFE .
BUT WH WHAT KIND OF THINGS ARE YOU LOOKING FOR .
WELL THE SATURNS YOU CAN GET AIR BAGS IN THEM .
I DO NT THINK YOU CAN GET DUAL SIDE AIR BAGS .
UHHUH .
BUT ONE OF THE THE TWO THINGS THAT I M REALLY THE THE .
I D SAY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS A CAR .
THAT S NOT GOING TO FALL APART .
THAT DOES NT HAVE PROBLEMS .
UHHUH .
YOU SET DOWN .
YOU LOOK AT CONSUMER REPORTS .
WE VE BEEN POURING OVER CONSUMER REPORTS AND YOU JUST GET SO DEPRESSED FOR THE U S AUTO .
YEAH .
MAKERS WHEN YOU DO THAT .
BECAUSE YOU SEE THE RELIABILITY AND THE TYPES OF PROBLEMS THEY HAVE AND AND THE TWO CARS .
THAT APPARENTLY ARE CLOSE TO THAT .
THAT ACTUALLY HAVE HIGH RELIABILITY THE TAURUS IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST U S CARS .
UHHUH .
AND THE OTHER ONE IS ARE THE SATURNS .
UHHUH .
SO THOSE TWO THINGS .
AND THEN YOU KNOW WE .
KIND OF WANT A FOUR DOOR .
OKAY .
THE LAST AUTO REPAIR .
I HAD WAS I HAVE A NINETEEN EIGHTYFOUR NISSAN TRUCK .
I HAD A TUNE UP DONE AND I HAD I HAD THE BRAKES DONE ON IT AND THEN THE REASON .
I DID THAT WAS BECAUSE I DO NT HAVE A SCOPE AND IT HAS EIGHT SPARK PLUGS AND IT S HARD TO TO GET GET AT THEM AND PLUS THE TIME ON THEM .
I JUST DO NT HAVE TIME ANY MORE .
UH AS FAR AS MAINTENANCE TASKS THAT I DO MYSELF I I USUALLY CHANGE THE OIL AND WASH THE AIR FILTER AND I I HAD AN OCCASION TO CHANGE TO HAVE TO CHANGE THE BATTERY ONCE BUT THE BRAKES I WAS REALLY SURPRISED THAT THE BRAKES .
I WANTED I DO HAVE THE BACKGROUND .
I KNOW WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND I KNOW THAT THE OIL NEEDS SHOULD BE CHANGED VERY REGULARLY AND ALL OF THE BEARINGS AND THE LUBE LUBRICATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE LUBRICATED AND SO I I STAY ON TOP OF THAT BUT I .
I WANTED MY FRONT WHEELS I WANTED THE BEARINGS PACKED AND THEY WANTED SOMETHING LIKE FIFTEEN DOLLARS UH A FRONT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR MAYBE IT WAS THIRTY DOLLARS TO DO IT .
JUST TO PACK THE BEARINGS .
JUST TO PACK THE BEARINGS BUT WHAT .
I FOUND IS THAT THEY HAD A BRAKE JOB AND THEY I HAD THEM THE OTHER THING .
I LET THEM DO SOME TIMES IS THAT I LET THEM GO THROUGH AND LET THEM TELL ME .
WHAT LET THEM DO THE DIAGNOSTICS .
THAT S FREE OKAY .
AND THEN I CAN DECIDE WHETHER I WANT THEM TO DO IT OR WHETHER I CAN DO IT SEE .
RIGHT .
AND THEY TOLD ME THAT MY MY BRAKE PADS WERE GOSH YOU KNOW SEVENTY PERCENT STILL GOOD YOU KNOW BUT STILL IT WAS CHEAPER IN THE LONG RUN AND UH SO I JUST GOT THE .
THE BRAKES DONE AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS A GOOD DEAL .
AND PLUS .
RIGHT .
AND THEY REPACKED THE WHEEL BEARINGS .
AND THEY .
RE REPACKED THE .
THE WHEEL BEARINGS .
YEAH BUT UH I VE I VE HAD CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE .
I M YOU MIGHT SAY I M UH UH GOOD BACK YARD MECHANIC AND I YOU KNOW I TOOK AUTO SHOP IN HIGH SCHOOL IT S BEEN A WHILE BACK BUT I I STILL HAVE A PRETTY GOOD FEEL FOR IT BUT ONE THING .
I DID NT KNOW IS THAT WHEN I WAS MESSING AROUND WITH CARS AND STUFF AND MOST OF THE CARS I I HAD BIGGER CARS AND THE BRAKES GO OUT FAIRLY RAPIDLY ON THOSE AND WHAT .
I WAS SURPRISED AT IS THAT ON MY LITTLE NISSAN I BOUGHT THE TRUCK WITH ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND I HAVE ALMOST ONE HUNDRED AND TEN SO I DROVE ON THOSE BRAKE PADS FOR UH YOU KNOW FORTYFIVE THOUSAND MILES AND THERE WAS HARDLY ANY WEAR TO THEM .
SO THOSE SMALL LITTLE TRUCKS AND CARS LIKE THAT THEY JUST THE LONGEVITY OF THE BRAKE PADS IS REALLY GOOD .
YOU KNOW THEY VE GOTTEN TO THE POINT THAT WHERE THEY DO NT WEIGH VERY MUCH AND THE .
THE .
EXA .
SURFACE MATERIALS ON THE PADS IS SO GOOD .
EXACTLY SO I YOU KNOW I JUST DID IT ANYWAY .
I LIKE TO I LIKE TO STAY UP ON IT .
YOU KNOW LIKE I JUST KIND OF STAY UP ON IT AND THEN IF YOU GO AND LIKE JUST ABOUT ANY POINT ANY .
YOU KNOW POINT IN TIME AND PULL MY DIP STICK AND PULL IT OUT AND LOOK AT THE OIL THE OIL IS YOU MIGHT SAY UH A WHITE GOLDEN BROWN .
YOU KNOW IT S NOT DIRTY .
I I I KEEP IT .
THAT WAY BECAUSE THAT S THAT IS THE KEY TO THE LONGEVITY .
RIGHT .
WELL .
SO SO HOW .
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU VE HAD SOME GOOD EXPERIENCES WITH THAT .
UHHUH .
UH AND MY EXPERIENCES HAVE BEEN KIND OF CONTRARY TO THAT .
OH OH .
UH I I GET A LITTLE MORE INVOLVED IN THE MAINTENANCE OF MY CAR AND UH .
UHHUH .
AND IN FACT .
I HAVE AN EIGHTYSEVEN MUSTANG WITH A THREE O TWO IN IT .
UHHUH .
THAT I VE UH BEEFED UP A LITTLE BIT .
OKAY .
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DID WAS TO CHANGE THE PULLEY SYSTEM ON IT TO USE UNDER DRIVE PULLEYS SO THAT THE ENGINE DOES NT HAVE TO TURN THE ACCESSORIES AND CAN USE MORE OF THE POWER TO THE REAR WHEELS .
UHHUH .
UH THE ONLY CATCH WAS THE FIRST SET OF UNDER DRIVE PULLEYS THAT I PUT ON IT WERE UH NOT EVEN CAST ALUMINUM .
THEY WERE JUST PRESSED ALUMINUM .
YOU RE TALKING ABOUT THE VIBRATION DAMPENER .
WELL THERE S THREE THERE S THREE PULLEYS THAT YOU CHANGE .
YOU CHANGE THE CRANK PULLEY .
THAT S THE VIBRATION DAMPENER YEAH .
THE ALTERNATOR PULLEY AND UH THE WATER PUMP PULLEY .
OKAY .
SO WHEN I CHANGED THOSE OVER I PUT ON THESE THESE PRESSED ALUMINUM THINGS .
UM .
AND UH PROBABLY ABOUT FOUR MONTHS AGO THE WATER PUMP DECIDED TO GO OUT .
UH OH .
SO IN THE PROCESS OF SEIZING THE BELT SPUN ON THE PULLEY AND WORE .
UM .
THROUGH THE WATER PUMP PULLEY ALMOST ALL THE WAY .
UH OH .
BUT NOT FAR ENOUGH TO NOTICE .
HUH .
SO I WAS ON MY WAY TO WORK ONE DAY AND UH THE WATER PUMP PULLEY SPLIT LATERALLY IN HALF .
SO THERE WAS HALF A WATER PUMP PULLEY STILL ATTACHED TO THE WATER PUMP AND THE OTHER HALF WAS KIND OF DANGLING OFF THE END OF THE CRANK .
UHHUH .
AND UH I .
UM ARE YOU WORKING RIGHT NOW .
UH YES I AM .
I M WORKING IN THE COMPUTER SCIENCE DEPARTMENT HERE .
UH .
UH AT C M U .
WHAT KIND OF WHAT KIND OF WORK DO YOU DO .

THAT HAVE GOTTEN THEIR MASTERS AND I THINK THAT UM THEY MIGHT YOU KNOW PAY FOR THAT .
UHHUH .
PAY FOR THE CLASSES AND STUFF BUT I KNOW THEY LET YOU THEY LL LET YOU DECREASE HOW MANY HOURS YOU WORK BY MUMBLEX KIND OF PERCENTAGE .

OH .
THOUGH .
NOW THAT S A BIG WIN .
THAT S ABOUT .
FIVE PERCENT RIGHT THERE SO .
YEAH YEAH .
THAT S .
THAT S ABOUT THE ONLY REAL BONUS .
YEAH .
I HAVE SO I HAVE TO TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN I EVALUATE LIKE HOW MUCH I GET PAID REAL YOU KNOW BECAUSE IF I WAS WORKING SOMEWHERE ELSE I D HAVE TO YOU KNOW PAY AN EXTRA FIVE PERCENT .
YEAH .
OR SO .
I FIGURED FOR AND THEY VE JUST RAISED THE UM INCOME CAPS ON SOCIAL SECURITY TO THE POINT WHERE .

PAYING THAT AS WELL .
YEAH WELL IF YOU COULD CALL IT .
A BENEFIT THAT C M U I MEAN I THE OTHER THING THAT THEY ALLOW YOU TO DO HERE WHILE YOU ARE WORKING IS IS CONSULT FOR UM YOU KNOW OTHER COMPANIES .
OH YEAH .
UM SO THAT S THAT KIND OF HELPS OUT IN TERMS OF .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW KEEPING UPTODATE WITH CONTACTS IN INDUSTRY .

YOU KNOW IN CASE .
MUMBLEX HELP A LOT .
YOU KNOW IN CASE .
YOU EVER NEED TO BAIL OUT .

UHHUH .
THERE S NOT THERE IS NOT A WHOLE LOT OF YOU KNOW FUNDED RESEARCH FROM .
PRETTY GOOD PRETTY GOOD .
SO WE RE TALKING ABOUT DRUG TESTING IN THE WORK PLACE HUH .
DRUG TESTING IN THE WORK PLACE .
UM .
I VE BEEN TESTED A FEW TIMES JUST BEFORE PRE DRUG EMPLOYMENT .
BUT THAT S ABOUT IT .
I VE NEVER HAD RANDOM DRUG TESTING .
YEAH WE HAVE RANDOM DRUG TESTING AT IN MY BUSINESS BUT I VE NEVER BEEN UH NEVER HAD TO DO IT .
OH REALLY .
YEAH YEAH THEY STARTED THAT ABOUT A YEAR AGO AND I THINK IT S MOSTLY FOR THE THE FIELD PEOPLE .
THAT YOU KNOW DRIVE TRUCKS AND HEAVY MACHINERY THAT KIND OF STUFF .
UHHUH .
BUT UH THEY THEY HAVE DONE SOME TESTING AROUND OUR OFFICE MOSTLY AFTER LUNCH LOOKING FOR PEOPLE DRINKING UH DRINKING BEER AND STUFF AT LUNCH TIME AT LEAST THAT S .
OH THEY DO WITH ALCOHOL .
PARDON .
THEY DO IT WITH ALCOHOL .
YEAH YEAH THEY THEY THEY LL CHECK FOR ALCOHOL .
OH I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST LIKE MARIJUANA OR COCAINE .
NO ONCE ONCE YOU START DOING THAT STUFF YOU SORT OF YOU RE SORT OF STUCK INTO UH CHECKING FOR THE WHOLE THE WHOLE THING .
HUH .
THAT S INTERESTING .
YEAH IT S A .
WHAT TYPE OF FIELD OF WORK ARE YOU IN .
I M IN THE OIL BUSINESS .
OH IN THE OIL BUSINESS .
YEAH .
OKAY AND YOU WORK IN THE OFFICE AROUND .

UHHUH .
YEAH SEE I WORK IN THE AUTOMOTIVE AIR BAG INDUSTRY WHERE WE MAKE THE SAFETY BAGS .
UHHUH UHHUH .
FOR THE CARS AND WE WORK AROUND A LOT OF EXPLOSIVES .
WELL THAT SOUNDS LIKE KIND OF AN IMPORTANT JOB TO BE UH STRAIGHT ON .
YEAH SO THAT S YOU KNOW I M ALL FOR IT BECAUSE THE WELL THE TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT .
I WORK IN YOU KNOW THEY RE WORKING WITH EXPLOSIVES AND SO THEY COULD BLOW UP THE WHOLE WELL THEY HAVE SAFETY FEATURES WITH EACH OF THE EXPLOSIVES THEY USE BUT STILL IT CAN BE DANGEROUS .
YEAH YEAH WELL I I I AGREE .
I THINK THAT UH YOU KNOW UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU RE WORKING IN IN HIGH RISK UH UH INDUSTRIES WHERE YOU CAN REALLY HURT OTHER PEOPLE THAT THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE THAT KIND OF STUFF .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW IF IT S AS LONG AS IT S NOT ABUSED UH YOU KNOW RANDOM YOU KNOW AS LONG AS IT S RANDOM AND AND THE INDIVIDUAL S RIGHTS ARE UH ARE PROTECTED I DO NT HAVE THAT BIG A PROBLEM WITH IT .
NOW DO THEY FIRE THEM OR DO THEY .
WELL SEE THIS IS IT THIS IS WHERE I START HAVING MY PROBLEMS WITH MY COMPANY .
I WORK FOR A PRIVATE COMPANY AND .
UHHUH .
AND THE POLICY IS SOMETHING LIKE SEE IF I CAN RE STATE THIS CORRECTLY NOW .
IF YOU TURN YOURSELF IN AS HAVING A DRUG RELATED PROBLEM THEN YOU RE ELIGIBLE FOR COMPANY COUNSELING .
UHHUH .
BUT IF THEY CATCH YOU IF YOU TEST POSITIVE FOR A A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE THEN YOU GET FIRED .
OH WOW .
SO IT YOU KNOW IT S SORT OF ONE OF THESE LITTLE CATCH TWENTYTWOS .
HUH THAT S .
I THINK OUR POLICY IS THAT ALL RIGHT IT S PROBABLY THE SAME THING .
I M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT .
THE .
YEAH REALLY IT S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT YOU READ ONCE AND THEN IF YOU IF YOU RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT YOU JUST FORGET ABOUT IT .
THAT S RIGHT .
BUT I KNOW THEY DO HAVE COUNSELING AND THAT THEY DO GIVE YOU .
A SECOND CHANCE BUT I M NOT SURE IF .
YEAH .
IF IT S IF YOU GET CAUGHT OR IF YOU TURN YOURSELF IN .
YEAH YEAH OUR COMPANY S A LITTLE TOUGHER ON THE SECOND CHANCE .
I MEAN IF IF THEY RE GOING TO GIVE YOU .
THE OPPORTUNITY TO TURN YOURSELF IN THEN THEY OUGHT TO YOU KNOW GO OUT OF THE WAY I THINK A LITTLE BIT MORE TO UH TO HELP YOU GET HELP GET YOU REHABILITATED TO YOU KNOW TO GET GET BACK AT YOUR JOB .
UHHUH .
BUT UH WHEN YOU RE NOT WHEN YOU RE A PRIVATE COMPANY THE RULES DO NT ALWAYS APPLY .
UH DO YOU THINK IT WORKS VERY GOOD WITH THAT RANDOM DO YOU THINK IT LIMITS .
WELL IT S IT S HARD FOR ME TO TO EVALUATE IT BECAUSE EVERYBODY .
I WORK AROUND IS IN AN OFFICE ENVIRONMENT AND YOU KNOW IT S NOT I GUESS I HA HAVE NT RUN INTO ANYBODY .
THAT S THAT S HAD A PROBLEM .
THAT S THAT S BEEN A PROBLEM .
UHHUH .
UH SO I GUE YOU KNOW I GUESS IT WORKS UH MUCH LIKE UH WELL SHOOT LIKE ANY LOTTERY I MEAN EVERYBODY .
S GOT AN EQUAL CHANCE TO GET PICKED .
UHHUH .
SO UH I D RATHER HAVE THAT THAN YOU KNOW SAY WELL THIS WEEK .
THE .
A S AND B S ARE GOING TO BE IN AND NEXT WEEK .
C S AND D S ARE GOING TO COME IN .
YOU COULD TIME IT JUST RIGHT .
YEAH RIGHT RIGHT .
I KNOW ONE EMPLOYEE I KNOW WHEN I WAS WORKING WITH HE HAD ALCOHOL ON HIS BREATH AND I M NOT SURE IF OUR POLICY COVERS THAT OR NOT .
THAT D BE JUST AS DANGEROUS .
YEAH .
WELL ESPECIALLY AROUND UH YOU KNOW EQUIPMENT MACHINERY AND STUFF .
HUH .
THAT S TRUE .
YOU KNOW I VE I VE GONE OUT AND HAD A HAD A BEER AT LUNCH TIME BUT NOT TO EXCESS IN ANY CASE .
UHHUH .
DO THEY GIVE ANY LIMITS ON ALCOHOL OR IS IT .
UH I DO NT REMEMBER TO TELL YOU .
THE TRUTH .
I DO NT THINK THEY DO .
UM WELL THEY MUST I MEAN GEE WHIZ .
THAT JUST SHOWS YOU HOW MUCH I VE BEEN PAYING ATTENTION BECAUSE I I REALLY DO NT KNOW .
I LL HAVE TO GO INTO WORK TOMORROW AND ASK .
OH .
WELL YOU KNOW YOU CAN TAKE SOME OF THAT THAT TESTING A LITTLE BIT TOO FAR .
UH THERE WAS A COMPANY IN HOUSTON .
THAT THEY DID UH AN UNANNOUNCED DRUG SWEEP OF THE OF THEIR COMPANY .
UHHUH .
OH IT WAS IT WAS IT WAS AN UNANNOUNCED SWEEP OF OF IT WAS NOT ONLY DRUGS .
OKAY .
WELL UH I LL LET YOU START I GUESS .
WELL UH YEAH I I M EMPLOYED BY A COMPANY .
THAT DOES DO UH RANDOM DRUG TESTING AND I VE GOT SOME .
VERY DEFINITE UH OPINIONS ABOUT IT .
UH YOU KNOW WHICH HAVE NT CHANGED ALL THAT MUCH FROM MY FIRST REACTIONS FROM FROM WHEN THEY WHEN THEY ANNOUNCED IT .
BUT UH DEVELOPED A LITTLE MORE I GUESS BUT HAVE NT CHANGED THAT MUCH .
WHAT ABOUT YOU .
ARE YOU UH IN INVOLVED AT ALL .
UH NO .
I MEAN I M NOT MY EMPLOYER DOES NOT DO THAT .
UH ALTHOUGH UH I HAD AN EXEMPLOYER THAT UH THE PREVIOUS JOB .
I USED TO HAVE UH THEY AFTER I GUESS A FEW YEARS AFTER I HAD STARTED WITH THEM .
THEY MADE IT .
A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT THAT YOU PASS A DRUG TEST .
YES .
UH I I DO NT KNOW .
MY FEELING IS THAT CERTAIN JOBS THAT WHEN THERE .
S IMMEDIATE THREAT TO LIFE AND LIMB UH IF SHOULD SOMEBODY BE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DRUGS I I D BE WILLING TO SUPPORT THAT .
FOR EXAMPLE UH UH WELL UH UH TRAIN ENGINEERS .
YEAH .
BECAUSE IT YOU KNOW UH LIKE THERE WAS AN INCIDENT SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHERE AN AMTRAK ENGINEER MUMBLEX .
YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
HE CRASHED AND KILLED SOME PEOPLE BECAUSE HE WAS UH SMOKING SOME MARIJUANA AND I GUESS AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS .
I WOULD NT WANT THEM TO BE ON DRUGS .
AND AIRPLANE PILOTS .
BUT WHERE IT S NOT NECESSARY UH IN THAT REGARD WHERE IT S NOT AN IMMEDIATE THREAT TO LIFE AND LIMB OR PROPERTY .
YEAH .
UH I I D I WOULD SERIOUSLY QUESTION IT .
UH SO .
YEAH .
YEAH .
IT UH THAT S THAT S MINE .
IT IT YOU KNOW I I GO BACK IT TO ME NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE TH OUR COMPANY CLAIMS IT S NOT A CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE .
THAT BECAUSE THIS IS UH BETWEEN A COMPANY AND AN EMPLOYEE .
IT IS NOT IT IS NOT A GOVERNMENT IT S NOT THE CONSTITUTION DOES NT APPLY .
BUT I IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT STILL SHOULD .
I I OUR COMPANY S DOING IT BECAUSE THEY RE A UH GOVERNMENT CONTRACTOR .
UH AND SO IT S IT S REQUIRED FOR CERTAIN SOME FORM SOME FORM OF DRUG PROGRAM IS REQUIRED TO GET THE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND I D I D .
SO IT S THE GOVERNMENT .
THAT S MANDATING IT TO A CERTAIN EXTENT .
YES .
OKAY .
AN AND OUR COMPANY HAS TAKEN THAT AND GONE ALL THE WAY .
SAY OKAY UH FIRST OFF WE DO NT WE DO NT HAVE ENOUGH COURAGE TO UH PICK OUT THE PEOPLE .
THAT THAT HAVE SOME SORT OF INDICATION OF POSSIBLE DRUG USAGE UH BECAUSE THAT WOULD OFFEND THEM UH IF THEY IF THEY WERE NT .
SO WE LL JUST ACCUSE EVERYBODY OF USING DRUGS AND .
MAKE IT ALL EVEN .
UH AND .
YEAH .
AND UH .
WELL I .
THEN UH BUT AND THEY SO IT S A A COMPLETE RANDOM TESTING W WELL IT S RANDOM IN THE SENSE THAT YOU DO NT KNOW WHEN .
IT IS NOT RANDOM IN THE SENSE THAT THEY HAVE SAID THAT WITHIN THREE YEARS .
EVERYONE IN THE COMPANY WILL BE TESTED .
HUH .
UH AND UH YOU KNOW I I SIT AT A TERMINAL AND AND WRITE SOFTWARE .
ALL DAY .
IT IT UH CERTAINLY HAS NO LIFE THREATENING UH CAPABILITIES .
RIGHT .
AND .
UH YOU KNOW IN IN MY JOB .
AND AND UH YES I I AGREE THAT THERE ARE THERE ARE UH JOBS .
THAT ARE DEFINITELY LIFE THREATENING AND AND AND TH THERE NEEDS TO BE A LINE DRAWN SOMEWHERE AT REA REASONABLE AND PROPER .
I YOU KNOW .
YEAH YEAH .
I AGREE .
I MEAN IT S WELL THERE S ALSO THE ISSUE OF UH O O OUT HERE I REMEMBER HEARING A YEAR OR SO AGO THAT UH A LOT OF THERE WAS A HIGH ERROR RATE IN THE ANALYSIS OF DRUG RESULTS .
O OR I SHOULD NT SAY HIGH .
WELL .
I MEAN SEVERAL PERCENT .
YEAH .
I THAT THAT I THAT I WILL GIVE CREDIT TO TO OUR OUR COMPANY FOR IN THAT THAT I THINK THERE S THERE S A COUPLE OF LEVELS OF TESTS IN TERMS OF OF UH OF DRUGS .
AND E E ESSENTIALLY THE FIRST THING IS T IS ON THE ORDER OF MUMBLEX PAPER IN THE URINE AND UH OR SOME YOU KNOW IT S NOT QUITE THAT SIMPLE BUT IT S FAIRLY SIMPLE .
KIND OF A COARSE KIND OF TEST .
COARSE KIND OF TEST .
AND THEN THERE S A A MUCH MORE UH UH REFINED TEST UH UH SPECTROGRAPHY OR WHATEVER .
IT S CALLED .
THE CHEMO .
IS THAT DONE .
CHEMOTOGRAPHY .
RIGHT .
UH TO DETERMINE EXACTLY WHAT .
THE WHAT .
THE THINGS ARE .
AND UH .
NOW L LET ME ASK YOU .
THIS .
UH E E AT THE TIME .
YOU HIRED ON WITH THIS COMPANY UH WAS THAT PRIOR TO ANY .
NO I I VE BEEN WITH THIS COMPANY FOR UH FOR SIXTEEN YEARS NOW .
OKAY SO THAT .
AND UH .
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY NOT A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT THAT YOU SUBJECT YOURSELF TO THIS .
NO .
AND IT AND IT AND IT HAS IT HAS YOU KNOW THEY DID THAT THREE OR FOUR YEARS BEFORE THEY DID IT WITH EVERYBODY .
AND I UH AT THAT TIME .
I COULD JUSTIFY IT IN TERMS OF SOMEONE .
NEW COMING IN YOU DO NT YOU DO NT KNOW .
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND UH SOMEONE .
NEW COMING IN THAT KNOWS THEY RE GOING TO HAVE A TEST .
I DO NT KNOW WHAT .

LET SOMEBODY ELSE UH HAVE THE SHOWROOM SHINE MUMBLEX AND I LL PAY FOR THE REST OF IT .
LET SOMEBODY ELSE BREAK IT IN RIGHT .
RIGHT .
AND UH THE VAN .
WE RE SOR WE MIGHT GO AGAIN ON A ON A VAN .
WE WE COULD PROBABLY DO WITH A A SOMETHING JUST A LITTLE BIT LARGER THAN A COMPACT IN A SEDAN NEXT TIME .
I M NOT SURE .
YEAH .
WE HAVE TO WE WE LL HAVE TO FACE IT IN A COUPLE OF YEARS BUT UH .
I I GUESS WE HAD A SMALL TOYOTA WAGON .
RIGHT .
AND WE WERE REAL HAPPY WITH THAT BECAUSE UH MY MY SECOND REQUIREMENT AFTER PRICE IS UH LOW MAINTENANCE .
RIGHT .
AND UH TH IT CERTAINLY HAD THAT .
WE DID NT DO MUCH TO IT AT ALL .
YEAH .
SO .
YEAH MY MY MUMBLEX PRETTY MUCH THE SAME .
I I GOT A LIKE I SAY I GOT ONE OF THOSE TOYOTA FOUR RUNNERS .
UHHUH .
AND UH IT PRETTY MUCH DOES EVERYTHING .
I NEED IT TO .
I MEAN IT IT LL TOW THREE THOUSAND POUNDS SO I CAN TOW EVERYTHING AND IT I CAN THROW I VE HAD ELEVEN PEOPLE IN IT BEFORE .
UHHUH .
BELIEVE IT OR NOT .
AND UH IT S REAL RELIABLE BELIE I I MEAN I VE HAD IT FOR ALMOST FOUR YEARS NOW AND UP UNTIL OH SAY TWO WEEKS AGO IT HAD NEVER HAD ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT .
UHHUH .
AND THEN OF COURSE TWO WEEKS AGO .
IT DECIDED I DO NT KNOW IT S THE STRANGEST WEIRDEST THING IN THE WORLD BUT IT BLEW A HEAD GASKET .
UHOH .

UH I CAUGHT .
HOW AT HOW .
IT REAL EARLY .
AT HOW MANY MILES .
UH OH NINETYSEVEN .
HUH .

NEVER OVERHEATED IT .
I SMELL I SMELLED THE UH I SMELLED THE COOLANT .
UHHUH .
WENT OUT AND LOOKED .
SAW IT WAS SAW WHERE IT WAS COMING FROM .
DROVE IT RIGHT TO THE SHOP AND LEFT IT OFF .
HUH .
WELL THAT WAS MUMBLEX .
AND THAT WAS IT BECAUSE I D I HAVE THAT AND THEN I HAVE A A KAWASAKI MOTORCYCLE .
UHHUH .
WHICH IS ACTUALLY THE USUALLY MY PREFERRED MODE OF TRANSPORTATION IF I CAN TAKE IT AND IT S NOT RAINING .
YEAH .
I MEAN THAT S THAT S SORT OF MY .
HOBBY THOUGH MORE THAN A VEHICLE .
IT IT S A I DO NT KNOW PEOPLE .
WHO BUY MOTORCYCLES FOR TRANSPORTATION .
I THINK ARE KIDDING THEMSELVES .
I HAVE ONE COLLEAGUE .
THAT UH COMMUTES TO WORK ON ONE WHEN IT S NOT RAINING AND UH UH HE S A IT S HE S PRETTY CONSERVATIVE GUY .
I DO NT THINK IT S MUCH OF A SPORT FOR HIM .
I GUESS UH .
I KNOW BUT I BET YOU .
HE REALLY ENJOYS RIDING IT .
I M SURE HE DOES YEAH .
YEAH .
SO YOU KNOW YO .
H WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME .
YOU TOOK OUT TOOK YOUR TRUCK OUT JUST TO JUST TO GO DRIVING .
YEAH .
NO .
AND I GO OUT TWICE A WEEK ON THE BIKE SO .
YEAH .
AT LEAST .
JUST FOR .
UH .
THE ENJOYMENT .
YEAH .
BUT YEAH I I MEAN THE ONLY THING .
I THINK I MIGHT GET A NEW CAR OR NOT NECESSARILY A NEW CAR BUT A ANOTHER CAR UH I WOULD CONSIDER GOING TO A A NON TO A NORMAL PICKUP RATHER THAN A A COVERED PICKUP LIKE THE ONE .
I VE GOT .
JUST BECAUSE THERE S A LOT OF TIMES I WISHED I HAD JU JUST AN OPEN BED TO THROW STUFF IN .
RIGHT .
MUMBLEX .
I M SURE I M SURE THAT THAT S VERY I MEAN YOU GOT ONE .
IT .
S .
THAT S REALLY CONVENIENT TO BE ABLE TO THROW THAT SORT OF STUFF IN THE BACK AND .
IF I ONLY HAD SOME PLACE THAT I COULD STORE THE UH CAMPER TOP I WOULD HAVE IT OFF MOST OF THE TIME .
RIGHT .
I REALLY LEAVE IT ON THERE JUST FOR JUST TO HAVE IT OUT OF THE WAY BECAUSE YOU PUT IT ON THE GROUND .
IT GETS DIRTY .
TO HAVE IT OUT OF THE WAY .
RIGHT .
BUT UH THEY RE SOLID .
UH TRUCKS ARE BUILT UH I MEAN .
I THINK THEY LAST A LOT LONGER THAN ANYTHING ELSE .
THEY RE THE ONLY THINGS AMERICANS STILL KNOW HOW TO BUILD AND UH .
YEAH YEAH THE TRUCKS DO .
UH EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW THE JAP THE LITTLE JAP TRUCKS ARE ARE GOOD THERE TOO .
BUT SO ARE THE THOUGH I THINK THE CHEVIES I DO NT THINK THE CHE I DO NT LIKE THE CHEVIES AS MUCH AS I LIKE THE FORDS .
YEAH .
I THINK THEY I THINK THE FORDS TEND TO LAST A LITTLE LONGER .
RIGHT .
I .
AT LEAST UNTIL RECENTLY .
I .
KIND OF LIKE MINE YEAH SO MINE S A FORD .
A FRIEND OF MINE JUST BOUGHT MUMBLEX BOUGHT LIKE A YEAR AGO .
IT IT S A REALLY NICE TRUCK .
I MEAN I DO NT LIKE DODGES AT ALL BUT ONE OF THE DODGES THEY HAVE OUT NOW HAS A UH THE CUMMINS TURBO DIESEL ON IT .
OH I HEARD ABOUT THAT YES .
OH IT S BEAUTIFUL .
YEAH .
THAT THING THAT THING WILL LAST FOREVER I MEAN .
THAT THAT S A SERIOUS TRUCK .
OH YEAH THAT THING S UH IT S GOT A BOAT ENGINE IN IT .
RIGHT THIS UH I I KNOW A CONTRACTOR .
WHO JUST GOT ONE OF THOSE .
UHHUH .
HE S PLEASED WITH IT .
OKAY .
SO HOW SERIOUS IS THE .
SUBJECT OF CRIME IN YOUR AREA .
WELL NEEDLESS TO SAY HERE IN WASHINGTON D C .
THIS IS THE WAR ZONE .
UH D C AROUND HERE STANDS FOR DRUG CAPITAL OR DEATH CAPITAL .
IT .
S UH IT S REALLY BAD HERE .
UH FOR EXAMPLE THE UH LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL UH THEY VE ALREADY FOUND TWO STUDENTS WITH SAWED OFF SHOTGUNS .
JEEZ .
AND THEY RE STARTING TO UH GET THESE HAND HELD METAL DETECTORS SO THEY CAN INSPECT THE KIDS .
EVERY MORNING WHEN THEY COME TO SCHOOL OF ALL THINGS .
SO .
WELL LUCKILY IT .
HAS NT GOTTEN THAT BAD HERE .
UHHUH .
UH SAN JOSE ACTUALLY HAS A PRETTY GOOD RECORD IN TERMS OF BEING RELATIVELY LOW ON VIOLENT CRIME .
UHHUH .
UH BUT IT S ON THE UPRISE ESPECIALLY IN A LOT OF THE UH OUTLYING AGRICULTURAL TOWNS .
UHHUH .
UH BECAUSE YOU END UP HAVING A LOT OF GANGS FORMING UH LARGELY AROUND THE HISPANIC CORE .
UHHUH .
UH IT SEEMS TO BE THAT UH GANG WARFARE FOLLOWS VERY RAPIDLY ON THE HEELS OF POVERTY CONDITIONS .
UHHUH RIGHT .
THAT S HOW THEY UH THEY BIND THEMSELVES TOGETHER IN GROUPS I GUESS AND UH .
YEAH .
NOW THE INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH I DO NT THINK WE HAVE HERE A A LOT OF GANGS BUT UH ONLY A COUPLE UH .
UHHUH .
OF NOT A WHOLE LARGE GROUP OF THEM BUT UH JUST A FEW .
MOST OF THEM CENTERED AROUND UH DRUG TERRITORY .
UHHUH .
AND SO THEY RE PROTECTING THEIR ECONOMIC INTERESTS I GUESS .
YEAH .
AND UH NOWADAYS THE LATEST THING .
I VE I VE READ ABOUT IN THE PAPER HERE THAT THEY RE DOING AS FAR AS UH CRIMES INVOLVING STEALING CARS IS THAT INSTEAD OF STEALING UH CARS LIKE AT NIGHT BREAKING INTO THEM OR WHATEVER THEY WILL PICK OUT A CAR THAT THEY WANT AND WAIT UNTIL YOU SHOW UP AND THEN AS YOU GET OUT OF THE CAR THEY JUST UH STEP UP AND UH TAKE THE KEYS OFF OF YOU AND DRIVE THE CAR AWAY AND LEAVE YOU STANDING IN FRONT OF YOUR HOUSE .
WELL THAT S EFFICIENT .
YEAH THAT S THE UH LATEST THING .
THAT WAY .
THERE S NO DAMAGE TO THE CAR OR ANYTHING .
THEY JUST WAIT FOR YOU TO SHOW UP AFTER THEY VE PICKED OUT WHICH .
ONE .
THEY WANT .
THEY RE DECIDED THEY RE COMPLETELY UNWORRIED ABOUT BEING IDENTIFIED OR ANYTHING .
UHHUH .
OF THAT SORT .
RIGHT .
JUST WAIT FOR YOU TO DRIVE TO YOUR HOUSE YOU GET OUT AND THEY GET IN .
OFF THEY GO WITH YOUR CAR .
WOW .
SO IT S UH I THINK THEY CALL IT .
CAR JACKING AROUND HERE .
YEAH YEAH I D HEARD THAT PHRASE .
UHHUH YEAH THAT S KIND OF THE LATEST THING BUT EVERY YEAR IN THE D C AREA .
IT GETS PROGRESSIVELY WORSE AS FAR AS THE NUMBER OF HOMICIDES SO IT S UH IT S UNFORTUNATE THAT WE FEEL SOMETIMES EVEN THAT WE HAVE TO BRING OUR KIDS UP IN THIS AREA BECAUSE WE RE NOT FROM AROUND HERE WE RE FROM UH I M FROM OHIO AND MY WIFE S FROM FLORIDA SO .
UHHUH .
AND WE VE JUST COME FROM TWENTY YEARS IN THE MILITARY AND UH WHICH IS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT SO THIS IS A WHOLE NEW THING FOR FOR US TO TO HAVE TO PUT UP WITH AND IT S UH REALLY SCARY SOMETIMES .
YEAH THERE ARE NT THAT MANY .
PLACES .
THAT ARE SAFE FROM THAT SORT OF THING NOWADAYS .
RIGHT .
AND IT S PRETTY BAD WHEN THEY RE USING METAL DETECTORS IN SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
AND UH OF COURSE THE MAYOR UH OF D C IS HAVING A REAL PROBLEM UH TRYING TO WHAT DO YOU DO TO TO REDUCE CRIME IN A IN A MAJOR CITY LIKE D C WHERE IT S A WAY OF LIFE FOR EVERYBODY .
IT .
S UH I WOULD HATE TO HAVE TO WRESTLE WITH THAT PROBLEM .
I DO NT KNOW WHAT WHAT .
THE SOLUTION IS .
UH THERE S NO WAY .
THEY CAN STOP THE DRUGS AND THAT S WHAT S CAUSING ALL THE KILLING .
WELL UH .
THERE S A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I VE HEARD UH MOST OF THEM ARE FAIRLY UH RADICAL IN TERMS .
UHHUH .
OF WHAT .
YOU D HAVE TO DO .
UHHUH .
UH COURSE .
THE THE REASON THAT THAT THESE KIDS TEND TO TO TURN TOWARD THE DRUGS AND EVERYTHING ELSE S SEEMS TO BE JUST YOU KNOW THE THE THE END RESULTS OF OF POVERTY AND AND .
UHHUH .
PARENTS .
THAT ARE NT DOING ANY PARENTING AND EVERYTHING ELSE BECAUSE I MEAN YOU KNOW THE PARENTS ARE NT MAKING A LIVING AT ANYTHING .
RIGHT .
UH .
AND THEY SEE ALL THEIR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS UH .
AND THEY RE ACCIDENTAL PARENTS HALF THE TIME ANYWAY .
YEAH AND THEIR FRIENDS ARE DRIVING MERCEDES AND SO IT S ACTUALLY THEY GROW UP WITH THAT AS THEIR WAY OF LIFE AND UH I THINK UH TO A LARGE EXTENT THEY DO NT UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT THAT WHAT .
THEY RE DOING IS ACTUALLY ILLEGAL BECAUSE THIS IS THE WAY .
THEY WERE RAISED .
IT S ILLEGAL BUT IT S NOT WRONG BECAUSE ALL THEIR FRIENDS DO IT .
RIGHT EXACTLY SO MAYBE IT S THE LAW THAT WRONG IN THEIR EYES AND THEY .
YEAH .
THEY SAY WELL IT S IT S THE LAW .
THAT S UH GOT TO BE CHANGED INSTEAD OF THEIR WAY OF LIFE SO I DO NT KNOW IT S I M GLAD IT S NOT THE KIND OF PROBLEM .
I HAVE TO COME UP WITH AN ANSWER TO BECAUSE IT S NOT .
WELL .
EASY .
I THINK THAT THE DRUG THING WOULD ACTUALLY BE RELATIVELY EASY TO SOLVE IN TERMS OF OF AN ACTUAL SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM .
UH .
UHHUH .
THE THE SOCIAL THE OTHER SOCIAL PROBLEMS WOULD NT WOULD NT GO AWAY .
RIGHT .
UH .
THEY VE ALWAYS BEEN WITH US .
I MEAN THERE S THERE S BEEN A LOT OF UH AND I USED TO THINK THAT THIS WHOLE ARGUMENT WAS COMPLETELY BOGUS BUT THEN THE .
UHHUH .
MORE I THOUGHT ABOUT IT THE MORE SENSE .
IT MADE IS THAT UH ALCOHOL IS AS BAD A DRUG AS ANYTHING ELSE .
UHHUH .
UH AND PROHIBITION DID NT STOP IT AND DID NT DO ANYTHING REALLY .
RIGHT .
TO SLOW .
UH I GET MOST OF MY NEWS UH FROM NEWSPAPERS REALLY .
I READ THE DAILY NEWSPAPER UH THE HOUSTON CHRONICLE AND SOMETIMES I LL READ LIKE THE UH WALL STREET OR THE NEW YORK TIMES .
I DO NT SUBSCRIBE TO EITHER BUT SOMETIMES I GET A HOLD OF COPIES OF IT .
UH HOW ABOUT YOU .
DO YOU UH MOSTLY .
YES .
GET THINGS FROM T V OR MUMBLEX .
I ACTUALLY GET MOST OF MY NEWS COVERAGE OFF UH COMPUTER NETWORKS .
HOWEVER I DO ALSO WATCH TELEVISION NEWS UH USUALLY IN THE MORNING ONCE A DAY AND I READ THE FRONT PAGE OF THE WALL STREET JOURNAL .
OH .
MOST EVERY DAY .
OH THAT S INTERESTING .
YOU SAID COMPUTER NETWORKS .
UH WHAT UH WHAT SORT .
I AM FAIRLY KNOWLEDGEABLE OF MUMBLEX .
UH WELL WELL DOW JONES FOR EXAMPLE HAVE THE CAUSE THE .
UH OKAY .
THAT S INTERESTING .
UH NEWS WIRE AND IT S PICKED UP AND ACTUALLY AVAILABLE UH AT MY OFFICE SO IT S NO FEE OR SUBSCRIPTION EITHER TO READ AT MY LEISURE AND IT S SORT OF BY CATEGORY .
FOR EXAMPLE .
OH .
I .
SO I CAN READ A CERTAIN BUSINESS OR TOPICS .

THE .
A P NEWS WIRE OR IS IT SOMETHING .
THAT IS UH A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FROM THAT .
WELL UH IT S SIMILAR TO THAT BUT IT S DOW JONES WHICH IS UH THE WALL STREET JOURNALS NEWS WIRE .
UH OKAY .
SO THAT S THAT S INTERESTING .
OKAY .
YEAH I VE HAD I HAD ACCESS IN THE PAST TO UH UH THE .
A P NEWS WIRE AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS THAT WAS PRETTY A PRETTY GOOD WAY TO GET NEWS .
UH I VE NEVER USED THE DOW JONES NEWS WIRE BUT UH YEAH IT UH DO YOU GET ANY UH DO YOU READ ANY NEWS MAGAZINES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT FOR SORT OF LIKE A BROADER LIKE MORE LONG TERM ANALYTICAL SORT OF APPROACH .
UH WELL ACTUALLY NOT .
UH I DO UH FOLLOW UH UH UH I DO NT KNOW HOW TO HOW TO DESCRIBE IT SO I LL SAY A RELIGIOUS NEWSPAPER .
WHICH WHICH TALKS ABOUT ISSUES .
THAT ARE RELEVANT TO ME IN A MORE BROAD SENSE .
IT S A WEEKLY .
YEAH .
BUT UH BUT NOT UH NOT LIKE BUSINESS WEEK OR NEWS WEEK OR ONE OF THOSE KINDS OF THINGS .
I D LIKE TO SAY THAT HOWEVER UH THAT I M OVERWHELMINGLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE MEDIA IN GENERAL EXCEPT FOR THE RAW NEWS WIRES .
IN WHAT WAY .
IN LIKE IN SORT OF LIKE UH QUAL UH QUALITY OR SORT OF AN ORIENTATION IN TERMS OF LIKE VIEW POINT OR THE WAY .
THE NEWS IS PRESENTED OR WHATEVER .
UH I THINK THAT .
IT I THINK THAT IT HAS TO DO WITH UH I PERSONALLY THINK UH I I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEIR VIEWPOINT AND I PERSONALLY THINK THAT UH THER .
YEAH .
WELL YOU WO NT OFFEND ME .
SO GO AHEAD AND SAY .
THAT THERE S A STRONG BIA THERE S A STRONG BIAS IN THE MEDIA .
YEAH .
LIKE A LIBERAL TYPE OF BIAS .
YEAH .
ABSOLUTELY .
UH AFTER ALL WHO WHO WRITES .
PEOPLE .
WHO ARE JOURNALIST .
WHO ARE TRAINED TO WRITE AND THEY RE THAT S A LIBERAL UH A LIBERAL FIELD .
YEAH .
AT LEAST FROM ACADEMIA AND UH THE OTHER THING THAT I ALWAYS NOTICE IS THAT WHENEVER THEY WRITE ABOUT SOMETHING THAT I M AN EXPERT IN I FIND THEIR DESCRIPTIONS TO BE WRONG .
YEAH .
YEAH .
AND IT .
THEY THEY GENERALLY MAKE MISTAKE ON ANYTHING TECHNICAL AT LEAST .
THAT S RIGHT .
WELL EVEN IF IT S NOT TECHNICAL .
IF IT S UH SOME SOCIAL THING OR WHATEVER .
IT DOES NT MATTER .
IF I AM AN EXPERT IN IT THEY USUALLY MAKE MISTAKES .
WHICH MAKES ME BELIEVE THINK I M NOT EXPERT IN IT .
THEY RE TELLING ME LIES .
YEAH .
YEAH .
DO YOU BY MISTAKES DO YOU MEAN JUST LIKE HONEST MISTAKES OR DO YOU THINK THEY ARE DELIBERATE SORTS OF THINGS .
UH I THINK BOTH .
UH BY DELIBERATE I UH I MEAN MISTAKE MISTAKES OF OMISSION OR UH OR UH BIASED TOWARD A PARTICULAR VIEW POINT .
YEAH .
YEAH .
A PARTICULAR LIBERAL .
YEAH .
VIEW POINT THAT THEY HAVE .
YEAH .
SO UH UH TO GIVE YOU .
AN EXAMPLE UH WE WILL GO OUT OF THE PRINTING MEDIA .
I KNOW OF CASES WHERE UH WE HAVE ONE TELEVISION MEDIA WHERE THEY WILL SHOW CLIPPINGS FROM ONE EVENT AND DESCRIBE ANOTHER EVENT BUT WITH THE .
THE ATTEMPT TO GIVE YOU .
THE IMPRESSION THAT WHAT .
THEY RE TALKING ABOUT IS THE SAME THING .
THEY ARE SHOWING YOU .
HUH .
WHICH IS SORT OF LIKE A DELIBERATE BIAS .
HUH .
THAT S DISTURBING .
WHICH IS WHICH IS RATHER DISTURBING .
I MEAN HE DOES THAT .
I HAVE NT REALLY NOTICED THEM DOING THAT BUT WHATEVER AGAIN I DO NT WATCH T V NEWS THAT MUCH NOW .
IF I HAD ACCESS TO C N N I WOULD WATCH T V NEWS MORE .
UH I DO NT YOU KNOW BUT I DO NT USUALLY .
YEAH I DO NT HAVE ACCESS EITHER .
ALTHOUGH I DID AT ONE TIME AND IT WAS I DID DURING THE GULF WAR AND IT WAS ADDICTIVE .

UHHUH .
UH BUT UH BUT WHAT DO YOU DO .

SO I JUST UH .
WELL WE JUST HAVE YOU KNOW WE HAVE A GOOD FRIEND .
THAT S ABOUT TO MOVE TO ATLANTA .
I GUESS WE RE NOT SUPPOSE TO TALK ABOUT THOSE THINGS .
I D BETTER GET BACK TO THE SUBJECT .
OH WELL .
BUT UH BUDGETING .
I FOUND YOU KNOW I FEEL A LOT BETTER .
YOU KNOW WE USE TO WORK OUT OF ONE CHECK BOOK .
UHHUH .
AND IT WOULD BE VERY HARD FOR ME BECAUSE I WOULD NT HAVE I WOULD NT HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH MONEY .
I WAS SPENDING IN ONE MONTH .
YEAH .
NOW I HAVE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT .
I M SPENDING AND IT S SO MUCH EASIER .
UH GREG UH I I M NOT FAMILIAR I THINK UH YOU GUYS IN INDIANA DO NT YOU HAVE THE THE DEATH PENALTY .
YEAH WE DO HAVE THE DEATH PENALTY HERE IT S NOT EXERCISED VERY OFTEN BUT WE DO HAVE IT .
UHHUH .
I BELIEVE IT I CA NT EVEN REMEMBER THE LAST EXECUTION WE HAD HERE ACTUALLY .
UHHUH .
UH PERSONALLY I M IN FAVOR OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT I KNOW THERE S A LOT OF LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH IT BUT UH .
UHHUH .
SEEMS TO ME THAT SOME CRIMES ARE JUST SO HEINOUS THAT THAT THE PERSON JUST I FEEL DOES NT DESERVE TO LIVE DOES NT DESERVE FOR THE TAX PAYERS TO SPEND HOWEVER MANY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IT COSTS A YEAR TO KEEP THEM IN IN PRISON FOR LIFE .
RIGHT .
BUT I KNOW THERE S A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THAT LIKE WELL THEY SAY OKAY IF YOU DECLARE SOMEONE PUT THEM ON DEATH ROW AND EXECUTE THEM WELL THEN TEN YEARS LATER YOU FIND OUT THAT HE REALLY DID NT DO IT THEN THAT LIFE WAS WASTED BUT .
UHHUH .
JUST SEEMS LIKE IN SOME CASES THAT IT S A IT S A GOOD POLICY .
UHHUH UH I I TEND TO AGREE WITH YOU UH I VE CHANGED MY VIEWS OVER UH E EVEN WITHIN THE LAST FEW YEARS UH TO BE HONEST UH UH WHEN I WAS IN COLL WHEN I WAS AN UNDERGRADUATE I WAS A MEMBER OF AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL .
UHHUH .
AND UH AND OF COURSE AT THAT TIME YOU KNOW I THOUGHT UH UH IT WAS STUPID TO KILL ANYBODY FOR UH YOU KNOW THAT THE EYE FOR AN EYE WAS A STUPID ARGUMENT .
RIGHT .
BUT THE UH THE MORE NOW I LIVE IN DOWNTOWN DALLAS AND I UH .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW I VE SEEN UH I VE SEEN CASES ON IN THE NEWS AND ALL WHERE WHERE YOU KNOW UH A A PERSON WHO HAD MURDERED A PERSON IS BACK ON THE STREET AND THEN COMMITS ANOTHER MURDER .
RIGHT .
I THINK THAT MAYBE UH A GOOD SOLUTION TO CAPITAL PUNISHMENT MIGHT BE UH RESERVE IT SOLELY FOR UH REPEAT OFFENDERS OF A CRIME LIKE UH MURDER .
THAT S A THAT S A THOUGHT THAT I HAD NEVER REALLY HAD ON THAT .
YEAH UH .
WHICH SEEMS PRETTY SENSIBLE .
YEAH IT SEEMS SENSIBLE AND FAILSAFE I I UH I DO NT YOU KNOW NOT COMPLETELY FAILSAFE BUT IF A MAN S CONVICTED OF TWO MURDERS UH YOU KNOW THERE S A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE THAT SOMETHING S WRONG .
RIGHT .
UH I ALSO UH TO TELL YOU HOW LIBERAL I HAVE TURNED UH TOWARD THIS OR OR OR WHATEVER SIDE THAT IS .
RIGHT YEAH .
I VE KIND OF CHOSEN UH I BELIEVE IT THAT UH BIG TIME DRUG IMPORTERS LIKE UH SAY NORIEGA FOR EXAMPLE .
UHHUH .
THAT THESE PEOPLE NEED TO BE UH ELIMINATED UH .
UHHUH .
FROM SOCIETY AND I THINK I THINK THE DEATH PENALTY IS THE BEST CHOICE FOR THOSE PEOPLE BECAUSE UH REALLY ANY KIND OF UH UH JAIL SENTENCE FOR THEM IS JUST ANOTHER CHANCE TO UH CREATE ANOTHER POWER STRUCTURE .
YEAH YOU RE YOU RE RIGHT THERE UH I GUE BASICALLY MY VIEWS I GUESS THEY TEND TO BE MORE ECONOMICALLY ORIENTED .
UHHUH .
IN THAT I JUST YOU KNOW THEY COME OUT WITH THESE FIGURES THAT IT COSTS FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TAXPAYER DOLLARS A YEAR TO KEEP SOMEONE ALIVE IN JAIL .
RIGHT .
WHEN THEY RE GOING TO BE THERE FOR LIFE THEY RE NEVER GOING TO BE REHABILITATED .
RIGHT .
I MEAN I DO NT BELIEVE THAT THE PRISON SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE TODAY DOES MUCH TOWARDS REHABILITATION TO BEGIN WITH .
RIGHT .
SO TO ME I M PAYING TAXES YOU KNOW TWENTY PERCENT OF MY CHECK OR WHATEVER .
UHHUH .
TO KEEP SOMEBODY ALIVE WHO I IN MY MIND SHOULD NT BE THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND IS NEVER GOING TO BE A VALUABLE OR WORTHWHILE PART OF SOCIETY SO I I M ALL IN FAVOR OF IT .
UHHUH WELL UH DO YOU UH ARE THERE CASES WHERE YOU THINK THAT THAT UH THE CAPITAL THE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT SHOULD NT BE UH UH SENTENCED .
WELL I I REALLY DO NT KNOW ON THAT QUESTION IT JUST SEEMS LIKE FOR INSTANCE THE JEFFREY DAHLMER CASE I MEAN I DO NT REALLY THINK THAT THIS PERSON IS GOING TO EVER BE A WORTHWHILE PART OF SOCIETY I HOPE THE GUY NEVER GETS BACK OUT ON THE STREETS .
UHHUH .
AND IN THAT CASE WISCONSIN DOES NT HAVE A DEATH PENALTY SO HE S GOING TO BE SENTENCED TO LIFE IMPRISONMENT .
RIGHT .
AND I THINK THAT THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO LIVE BUT YOU KNOW THEN YOU RE KIND OF PLAYING GOD .
THAT S TRUE YEAH .
WHICH IS N NEVER A GOOD THING TO DO .
RIGHT .
BUT CASES WHERE I THINK THE DEATH PENALTY SHOULD BE WITHHELD UH NOT REALLY THAT I CAN THINK OF I I WOULD I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF THE DEATH PENALTY IN THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW MURDERS AND LIKE YOU SAID REPEAT MURDERS OR .
UHHUH .
SERIAL KILLERS .
UHHUH .
UH I DO NT REALLY AGREE WITH THE UH DEATH PENALTY FOR PEOPLE LIKE NORIEGA AND SUCH AS THAT I THINK THAT THEY RE THEY RE OPERATING ON A MORE I MEAN I KNOW THAT THEY RE CAUSING MASSIVE PROBLEMS IN SOCIETY UP HERE BUT I DO NT REALLY THINK THAT THAT IT S IT S IN OUR POWER TO TAKE THESE PEOPLE FROM A SOVEREIGN STATE AND SAY YOU DO NT DESERVE TO LIVE BECAUSE .
RIGHT .
THEY RE FEEDING OUR CONSUMER NEEDS .
SURE YEAH I UNDERSTAND I UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT YEAH UH OF COURSE YOU KNOW WITH UH WITH WITH DAHLMER NOW UH YOU YOU REALIZE THAT OHI I THINK IT S OHIO UH GETS TO TRY HIM NEXT AND .
UHHUH .
THEY DO HAVE THE DEATH PENALTY .
YEAH .
YEAH SO UH THAT WAS A CURIOUS CASE I .
YEAH THAT IS VERY CURIOUS .
UH UH SOMETHING IS SORT OF NIGHTMARISH .
YEAH .
TO SAY THE LEAST .
THAT S THAT S RIGHT .
UH WELL HERE IN TEXAS WE UH I THINK EVEN EVEN THIS LAST WEEK LAST WEEK THEY HAD ANOTHER THEY UH YOU KNOW THEY USE THEIR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT BY LETHAL INJECTION UH UH .
WELL UH I .
MYSELF AM NOT IN FAVOR OF DRUG TESTING IN THE WORK PLACE EXCEPT IN IN SPECIFIC UH VERY SPECIFIC IN THIS UH VERY SPECIFIC EXAMPLES SUCH AS UH TRANSPORTATION WORKERS AS IN UH AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS BUS DRIVERS AND THAT KIND OF THING .
WELL .
UM I DO NT REALLY THINK THAT IT S UH TOO MANY I THINK IT S A SEVERE INVASION OF SOMEBODY .
S PRIVACY TO SAY WELL WE RE GOING TO LOOK AT YOUR URINE AND THEN DECIDE WHETHER YOU RE UH YOU KNOW WORTHY OF WORKING FOR US .
I REALLY DO NT SEE THAT THAT S A VERY VERY VALID UH THING FOR A COMPANY TO SAY AND I PERSONALLY I DO NT THINK I WOULD WORK FOR SOMEBODY IF THEY WERE GOING TO REJECT ME ON THE BASIS OF WHAT S INSIDE MY BODY .
YEAH UH I GUESS I BASICALLY AGREE THAT UH DO YOU THINK IT S OKAY FOR A COMPANY TO REJECT SOMEBODY KNOWING THAT THEY LL TAKE DRUGS .
I MEAN SUPPOSE THEY FOUND OUT SOME OTHER WAY .
WELL I THINK I THINK WE I THINK THE PROBLEM HERE IS IS THAT A A DRUG TEST DOES NOT NECESSARILY IMPLY THAT SOMEONE IS TAKING DRUGS OR NOT TAKING DRUGS .
YEAH .
THERE S TOO MANY CASES WHERE IT CAN YOU KNOW THERE CAN BE FALSE POSITIVE RESULTS AND THAT THAT SORT OF THING .
I DO NT THINK THERE S ANY DEFINITIVE YOU KNOW OKAY THIS PERSON IS TAKING DRUGS SO WE DO NT WANT HIM HERE .
YEAH .
UH LIKE I SAID SOME INDUSTRIES THOUGH I THINK IT D BE VERY NECESSARY I WOULD NT WANT ANY AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS HIGH OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT WHEN I M FLYING IN AN AIRPLANE .
YEAH .
BUT UH I I JUST I FIND IT TO BE PRETTY OFFENSIVE THAT THAT IT S SUCH A A BIG DEAL .
I MEAN IF YOUR EMPLOYER S NOT GOING TO TRUST YOU OR YOU KNOW IT I JUST I THINK IT S A WHOLE TRUST ISSUE .
I JUST CA NT SEE IT .
BUT HAVE YOU EVER BEEN IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU YOU WERE DRUG TESTED OR .
UH YEAH I HAVE BEEN .
YEAH .
I .
I ONCE TOO SO .
I MEAN I WAS VERY OFFENDED BY BY THE WHOLE PROCESS .
YEAH .
I MEAN IT S VERY HUMILIATING AND I MEAN I M NOT SPEAKING IN FAVOR OF DRUGS OR AGAINST DRUGS BUT I UH I AM TOTALLY AGAINST THAT SORT OF A UH I MEAN IT S IT S A PRETTY PERSONAL THING WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS I WANT TO LOOK AT YOUR URINE BEFORE I M GOING TO TALK TO YOU .
YEAH .
I HAD IT DURING A JOB INTERVIEW AND I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS DUMB OF THE COMPANY AT A POINT WHERE THEY WERE TRYING TO CONVINCE ME TO TO WANT TO WORK FOR THEM .
RIGHT .
TO DO THIS AND I M JUST LIKE WELL UH I M NOT EVEN GOING TO THINK MUCH ABOUT IT .
YEAH .
IF YOU RE GOING TO TREAT ME WITH THIS MUCH RESPECT EVEN BEFORE .
RIGHT .
YOU VE GOTTEN TO KNOW ME .
RIGHT .
THAT S THAT S BASICALLY MY OPINION ON IT RIGHT THERE IS THAT IT S JUST YOU KNOW I DID I I WAS IN THE SAME SORT OF SITUATION AS IT WAS A JOB INTERVIEW AND THEN YOU HAD A PHYSICAL WHERE YOU WERE DRUG TESTED AND IT S I JUST AND I KNOW PEOPLE .
WHO HAVE BEEN DRUG TESTED AND WHO HAVE NOT YOU KNOW BEEN HIRED BY A CORPORATION .
WHICH UH YOU KNOW I REALLY .
THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IS IS BESIDES ITS BEING AN INVASION OF PERSONAL PRIVACY AS IN MY IT S MY BODILY FLUID AND I DO NT REALLY WANT YOU TO LOOK AT IT OR .
UHHUH .
OR SOMETHING .
PRETTY BASIC LIKE THAT JUST TO THE FACT THAT I DO NT KNOW THAT IT IS A COMPANY S BUSINESS TO REGULATE WHAT .
IT .
S EMPLOYEES ARE DOING WHEN THEY RE NOT AT WORK .
I MEAN DURING THE EIGHT HOURS DURING THE DAY WHEN THEY RE SUPPOSED TO BE THERE I THINK THEY HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO SAY THIS IS THESE BEHAVIORS ARE ACCEPTABLE AND THESE ARE NOT BUT WHEN IT ENTERS INTO WHAT .
THEY RE DOING WHEN THEY RE NOT AT WORK I FIND THAT TO BE FAIRLY OFFENSIVE ALSO .
YEAH WELL LIKE YOU SAY I MEAN IF IT S NOT A CRITICAL KIND OF JOB WHERE SOMEONE COULD GET HURT THEN REALLY WHAT PEOPLE OUGHT TO BE DOING I MEAN THE THE EMPLOYER OUGHT TO BE JUDGING YOU ON HOW WELL YOU DO YOUR WORK .
RIGHT .
RATHER THAN ON THESE OTHER FACTORS .
RIGHT .
AND I MEAN IF YOU ARE DOING DRUGS AND IT S CAUSING A PROBLEM THEN THEY LL NOTICE IT FOR OTHER REASONS .
THAT S EXACTLY RIGHT .
YEAH .
AND ALSO I JUST THINK IT IT GETS A LOT I M A BIG UH SUPPORTER OF PERSONAL FREEDOMS AND PERSONAL PRIVACIES AND I THINK THAT IT JUST MOVES DOWN ALONG A LINE THAT THAT I REALLY WOULD FIND BAD IF IF MOST PEOPLE WENT DOWN THAT LINE INTO REGULATING EMPLOYEES LIVES OUTSIDE OF WORK YOU KNOW THERE S ALREADY TALK OF PEOPLE WELL WE RE NOT GOING TO HIRE YOU IF YOU SMOKE .
MUMBLEX .
WELL YOU KNOW I I CAN SEE HOW THEY CAN SAY IN THE WORK PLACE .
WE YOU DO NT WANT THEM TO SMOKE BUT WHEN SOMEBODY LEAVES WORK I DO NT THINK THAT IT S THE EMPLOYER S RIGHT TO REGULATE THEIR LIFE STYLE AT ALL .
WELL DO YOU THINK IT S SHOULD BE ILLEGAL FOR AN EMPLOYER TO DO THIS OR .
UH I REALLY THINK IT SHOULD BE EXCEPT AS I VE MENTIONED TWICE NOW IN THE SPECIFIED INDUSTRIES .
YEAH .
OR OR JOBS BECAUSE THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS WHERE IT S JUST VITAL THAT A PERSON IS CLEAR MINDED AT ALL TIMES .
AND OTHER THAN THAT I THINK I DO NOT THINK IT SHOULD BE ALLOWABLE .
I THINK IT SHOULD BE ILLEGAL FOR THEM TO TO WANT TO DO THAT .
IT SHOULD IT S KIND OF THE BIG BROTHER SYNDROME I MEAN I JUST ANYTHING LIKE THAT JUST KIND OF SCARES .
ME .
I TEND TO TO VIEW IT EVEN THOUGH I DO NT THINK I D WORK FOR A COMPANY .
THAT DID THAT I SORT OF WANT TO DEFEND AN EMPLOYER S RIGHTS AS OPPOSED TO AN IN UH IN ADDITION TO AN INDIVIDUAL S RIGHTS BUT AN EMPLOYER REALLY I THINK HAS THE RIGHT TO HIRE SOMEONE ON ANY BASIS .
THEY WANT TO .
RIGHT .
AND IF THEY SAY THEY DO NT WANT SMOKERS I SORT OF FEEL LIKE AN EMPLOYER SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY WANT TO ALLOW THAT .
RIGHT .
UH AND I DO NT REALLY .
HI .
OKAY .
SO UH WITH THE ISSUE OF TRIAL BY JURY UH I ACTUALLY FOUND THE WHOLE QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER YOU NEED A A UNAN A UNANIMOUS VERDICT IN A CRIMINAL CASE TO BE SOMEWHAT INTERESTING .
YEAH ACTUALLY I I AGREE THAT THAT S AN INTERESTING THING .
I I BELIEVE THAT S A FOR FOR CIVIL SUITS .
IT S NOT UNANIMOUS RIGHT BUT FOR FOR CRIMINAL SUITS .
IT S UNANIMOUS BY FEDERAL LAW .
I DO NT KNOW IF IT S EVEN TRUE THAT IT S ALWAYS UNANIMOUS BECAUSE I THOUGHT THERE WERE CASES WHERE UH I DO NT KNOW IF IT S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FELONIES AND MISDEMEANORS BUT WHERE IT WAS OKAY FOR A STATE TO HAVE IT LIKE ELEVEN OUT OF TWELVE .
YEAH I ACTUALLY THOUGHT I D READ THAT TOO AND THAT S WHY I PHRASED IT .
THAT WAY .
YEAH .
I WONDER THE DIFFERENCE YEAH THE DIFFERENCE COULD BE THAT FOR UH STATE IF THERE IS SUCH A THING STATE FELONIES VERSUS FEDERAL FELONIES THAT FEDERAL THINGS .
THAT ARE UNDER FEDERAL JURISDICTION REQUIRE THE UNANIMOUS VOTE AND THINGS .
THAT ARE UNDER STATE JURISDICTION EVEN CRIMINAL DO NT REQUIRE BUT I DO NT KNOW WHAT .
THE THE LAWS DO YOU THINK THAT THAT S AN UNREASONABLE UH REQUIREMENT THAT THEY BE UNANIMOUS .
WELL I D BE CURIOUS AS TO WHAT .
THE UH REQUIREMENT FOR A AN ACQUITTAL IS .
AND I I DO NT THINK IT WOULD BE WRONG TO SAY THAT ELEVEN OUT OF TWELVE CAN CONVICT IF THERE WERE SOMETHING .
CORRESPONDING SAYING THAT IF YOU KNOW SIX OR SEVEN VOTED NOT GUILTY THEN INSTEAD OF IT BEING A HUNG JURY THAT WAS AN ACQUITTAL .
BUT I DO NT KNOW WHETHER YOU NEED AN A UNANIMOUS UH VOTE OF NOT GUILTY TO ACQUIT .
YEAH THAT THAT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING CHANGE .
IT WAS ALSO ALLOW THE UH IDEA THAT IF YOU HAD ONE PERSON .
WHO WAS UH VERY DISAGREEABLE THAT I MEAN IT IT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGES THE WAY .
THE PROCESSING OCCURS BECAUSE UH THE FACT THAT IT S W THE THE PRINCIPLE IS THAT THE FACT THAT IT S UNANIMOUS INSURES THE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT UH CRITERION THAT IT UH INCREASES THE THE LIKELIHOOD OF GETTING THE PROPER JUDGMENT .
SO I I THINK IF ANYTHING IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A VERY CLOSE TO UNANIMOUS DECISION .
YEAH I D AGREE WITH THAT .
BUT I VE NEVER HAD THE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE ON A JURY ALTHOUGH I VE BEEN OUT HERE AND REGISTERED FOR I GUESS ABOUT FIVE YEARS .
YEAH ACTUALLY .
BUT .
I I THOUGHT THAT THAT WOULD BE VERY INTERESTING THING TO DO .
I WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT .
I VE BEEN OUT HERE TWENTY .
SOME YEARS AND I VE BEEN CALLED UH THREE DIFFERENT TIMES BUT I VE NEVER ACTUALLY EVEN MADE IT INTO THE THE JURY BOX .
OH .
AND BECAUSE THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND AND I VE NEVER GOTTEN UP THERE TO ANSWER ANY OF THE QUESTIONS .
UH I YEAH I ALSO THINK THAT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD .
I .
WELL THE PEOPLE I KNOW WHO HAVE SERVED HAVE SAID THAT USUALLY WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IS THAT YOU KNOW AFTER INITIALLY FINDING OUT WHERE PEOPLE STAND THAT THE WHOLE DELIBERATION USUALLY RESULTS IF THERE IS A YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE A NINE THREE OR OR MORE SEVERE AND AND THE PEOPLE IN THE MAJORITY TRYING TO CONVINCE THE MINORITY THAT THEY RE RIGHT .
UHHUH .
AND IN FACT I M NOT SURE THAT THAT S ANY MORE UH LIABLE TO GET RID OF THE REASONABLE DOUBT THAN THAN ANYTHING ELSE .
WELL THE THE ONE THING THAT I KNOW DOES SEEM TO HAPPEN FROM PEOPLE I VE TALKED TO ON THIS IS THAT IN THE SITUATION .
YOU JUST SAID WHERE IT S NINE TO THREE OR SOME SUCH NUMBER THAT THERE S AN EFFECT STARTS BEING THAT THERE S STARTS BEING A LOT OF PEER PRESSURE .
UHHUH .
GOING ON AND THAT THAT UH PEER PRESSURE AND IN SOME CASES IF IT S A LONG TRIAL THE DESIRE OF PEOPLE TO GET OUT OF THERE AND NOT BE STUCK IN THERE FOR A VERY LONG TIME THAT PEOPLE ARE CHANGING THEIR MINDS FOR THE WRONG REASONS .
YEAH I D .
UH .
READ ONE BOOK I THINK IT WAS CALLS TRIAL BY JURY OF ALL THINGS THAT UH .
UHHUH .
WENT THROUGH AND INTERVIEWED A BUNCH OF JURORS IN SOME OF THE BIG CASES AND IN MANY CASES LOOKING AT WHAT HAD AT THE EVIDENCE AFTERWARDS AS TO WHETHER THE DECISION WAS RIGHT WENT BACK TO THE JURORS UH BASED ON THE DELIBERATIONS .
SOME OF THEM DID SAY THAT YOU KNOW WHEN THEY WERE THE ONLY ONE LEFT OPPOSING THE VERDICT UH YOU KNOW EVERYONE WAS GETTING ON THEM SO SO HEAVILY THAT EVENTUALLY THEY JUST GAVE IN KNOWING THAT NOTHING .
THEY COULD DO COULD STOP IT FROM EITHER BEING THE VERDICT .
EVERYONE ELSE WAS TRYING FOR OR A HUNG JURY BECAUSE THE ONE VOTE DOES NT MEAN ANYTHING EXCEPT THE ABILITY TO NOT HAVE A VERDICT .
YEAH I I UNDERSTAND .
YOU YOU WOULD HOPE THAT IF YOU WERE IN THAT SITUATION THAT YOU D HAVE THE MORAL FORTITUDE UH TO HOLD OUT IF YOU BELIEVED THAT THAT WAS REALLY THE PROPER RESPONSE .
I THINK OF THE MOVIE UH TWELVE ANGRY MEN .
UHHUH .
YOU EVER SEEN THAT MOVIE .
YEAH ONCE .
UH YEAH IT S IT S IT S EXACTLY THAT SITUATION WHERE UH IT .
S HENRY FONDA AND IT S ELEVEN TO ONE AND HE S THE ONE I I BELIEVE HE WAS OPPOSED TO THE CONVICTION AND UH AND HE HELD ON AND .
UH AROUND HERE WE HAVE A PROGRAM WHERE UH WE WE PUT OUT THE THE WE SEPARATE THE BOTTLES AND THE CANS AND THE PLASTIC STUFF FROM THE NEWSPAPERS .
AND WE KEEP THE NEWSPAPERS IN A IN A THEY RE COLLECTED TWICE A MONTH AND THE TRASH AND AND THIS BOTTLED STUFF .
THAT IS PUT IN A IN A LITTLE BLUE BIN .
THAT S PICKED UP AND SORTED OUT INTO A TRUCK .
SO THEY MA ACTUALLY HAVE ABOUT THREE PASSES AT THIS COLLECTION .
ONE FOR .
SOUNDS .
THE REGULAR TRASH ONE FOR THE UH UH YOU KNOW THE BOTTLES AND CANS AND ONE FOR THE NEWSPAPERS .
BUT I GATHER YOU DO NOT SEPARATE UH THE BOTTLES AND CANS .
NO THEY THEY DO THAT ON THE TRUCK .
UHHUH .
THEY SEPARATE THEM AS THEY AS THEY YOU KNOW DUMP THEM .
AND YOU KNOW ONE GUY COMES AROUND WITH HIS TRUCK AND AND DUMPS IT .
ALL IN THERE .
AND I THINK THEY RE THEY RE RUNNING OUT OF UH YOU KNOW MUMBLEX .
THE SANITARY LANDFILL I THINK UH IS YOU KNOW RUNNING OUT .
OF COURSE UH YOU BEING FROM NEW MEXICO YOU VE PROBABLY BEEN N TO WASHINGTON .
ESPECIALLY IF YOU RE YOUR PRESENT LOCATION .
YES .
YOU MUST HAVE COME TO WASHINGTON AT LEAST ONCE .
YES I KNOW .
NOT ONLY HAVE I COME TO WASHINGTON BUT UH I FIND IT VERY AMUSING THAT UH THE THING .
THAT WAS JUST INSTITUTED HERE IS VERY SIMILAR .
THAT IS WE ALSO HAVE BLUE BINS .
WE ALSO SEPARATE NEWSPAPERS FROM ALL OF THE OTHER STUFF .
WHICH GOES INTO THE BIN AND GETS SEPARATED IN THE TRUCK AND UH LANDFILL SPACE IS IN DEED THE DRIVING FACTOR HERE .
AND IN FACT UH DESPITE ALL OF OUR OPEN SPACE OUT HERE LANDFILL SPACE IS STILL UH VERY HARD TO COME BY .
MY YOU VE GOT A LOT .
A A LOT OF NOTHING OUT THERE .
A .
YOU KNOW THEY GOT I MEAN THERE THERE S GOT TO BE A CREVICE BETWEEN TWO MOUNTAINS THAT NOBODY GIVES A DOGGONE ABOUT THAT YOU COULD YOU COULD USE FOR LANDFILL .
MUMBLEX .
AH BUT IF SOMEBODY CAN MAKE A REGULATION ABOUT IT THEY WILL .
WELL WHAT .
OTHER WE WE WHAT UH WHAT .
UNIQUE THINGS YOU THINK UH THAT YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT IN IN WHAT IN LOS ALAMOS .
WELL UH .
UH OTHER OTHER THAN NUKING IT .
YES OTHER THAN NUKING IT .
UM IN FACT LOS ALAMOS UH HAS UH DONE A FAIR AMOUNT OF RESEARCH UH IN RECYCLING THINGS IN GENERAL .
UM IT IT INVOLVES FOR INSTANCE UH CREATING BIOLOGICAL ORGANISMS .
WHICH CAN REMOVE HEAVY ELEMENTS LIKE SELENIUM AND BARIUM AND UH OTHER THINGS FROM UH WASTE MATERIAL IN GENERAL .
AND UH AND PURIFY THE WASTE OF SPECIFIC UH UH NASTY ELEMENTS .
WELL IS NT THAT A THAT S A THAT S PRETTY UH UPSCALE UH TRASH UH UH SITUATION .
I DO NT THINK ANYBODY AROUND HERE WOULD UNDERSTAND ALL THE .
ALL THOSE EXOTIC TECHNIQUES YOU KNOW GETTING .
AND .
RID OF THE HEAVY METALS .
THE THING .
THAT JUST WAS IN THE LOCAL NEWS BULLETIN WAS SOMEBODY HAS UH TER MADE SOME SPECIAL UH POLYMERS .
THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO UH MAKE CERTAIN ACTINIDE ELEMENTS ADHERE TO THEM .
UH UH THEY VE UH LOOKED AT UH PLUTONIUM AND URANIUM AND UH SOME OTHER SIMILAR THINGS TO .
HUH .
TRY TO REMOVE THOSE FROM RADIO ACTIVE WASTE AND AGAIN THIS IS DRIVEN BY ALL OF THE DOCUMENTATION AND UH E S AND H UH UH CONSIDERATIONS .
THAT UH PEOPLE ARE UH WORRYING ABOUT I THINK MUCH MORE THAN THEY SHOULD .
ACTUALLY .
WE .
I VE BEEN INVOLVED IN RECYCLING FOR LONG BEFORE IT BECAME FASHIONABLE .
BACK WHEN I WAS IN GRADUATE SCHOOL I DID ALL OF THE RECYCLING OF THE UH PAPER FROM THE COMPUTER CENTER AND UH IN FACT .
I THINK I WAS THE FIRST PERSON IN OUR DEPARTMENT TO HAVE MY THESIS PUBLISHED ON RECYCLABLE PA RECYCLED PAPER .
HUH .
WELL THAT S CERTAINLY UH YOU KNOW UH GETTING INTO THE SWIM OF THINGS .
I I THINK IT SHOULD BE I IT SHOULD GO TO THE TO THE HEART OF THE MATTER THOUGH AND SAY OKAY GUY YOU Y EVERYBODY GETS YOU KNOW FIVE POUNDS OF GARBAGE THAT THEY CAN THROW AWAY YOU KNOW .
UH BUT MORE THAN THAT EVERY WEEK UH YOU VE GOT TO PAY BY THE POUND .
I I THINK .
I THINK THAT S A WONDERFUL IDEA .
I THINK PEOPLE WOULD BE WOULD GET VERY VERY YOU KNOW THEY D BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT HOW THEY BOUGHT STUFF .
THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE .
I WOULD SEE IS UH AND THIS WOULD ACTUALLY BE A LITTLE MORE WORKABLE SINCE WEIGHING EVERYBODY .
S GARBAGE WOULD BE A REAL PAIN .
UH IF YOU DID IT BY VOLUME RATHER THAN BY WEIGHT .
UHHUH .
IT WOULD UH SPEAK MORE DIRECTLY TO THE SPACE NEEDS AND THE LANDFILL AND IT WOULD .
YEAH .
ALSO CAUSE PEOPLE TO COMPACT THEIR GARBAGE MORE .
UHHUH .
UH AND UH AND LIMITING THE VOLUME IS PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO THE REAL PROBLEM THAN LIMITING THE WEIGHT .
WELL OF COURSE THAT UH YOU KNOW THOSE BIG TRUCKS CAN CAN PROBABLY ARE FAR MORE EFFICIENT IN PACKING THAN ANY KIND OF LITTLE HOUSEHOLD COMPACTOR .
KIDS TOO .
YEAH .
MUMBLEX .
OH YOU LAUGH .
HOW MANY WHAT AGES .
WELL TWENTYSEVEN UP .
UH .
AND WE HAD FIVE .
YOU VE BEEN THROUGH THE FUN PART .
OH YEAH .
AND HOW ABOUT YOURSELF .
I HAVE A FOUR AND A HALF AND A THREE .
OH .
WELL .
SO .
IT S I I M SURE THERE S A LOT OF DIFFERENCES IN THE WAY IN THE WAY .
IT S DONE NOW AND THEN .
YEAH .
WELL WHEN MINE WERE GROWING UP I DID SOME TRAVELING AND BUT NOT THAT EXTENSIVELY BUT I ALWAYS MUMBLEX JUST MADE IT .
A POINT YOU KNOW TO SPEND ABOUT TEN MINUTES WITH EACH ONE OF THEM .
YEAH .
SO IT WAS AN HOUR YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
BUT WHETHER IT WAS GOING BACK AND LAYING IN BED WITH THEM AND JUST SHOOTING THE BREEZE OR WHATEVER TELLING THEM STORIES OR READING TO THEM .
WHAT WAS THE AGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE YOUNGEST AND THE OLDEST .
SIX YEARS .
SO THEY WERE ALL REAL CLOSE .
YEAH .
THAT S TOUGH .
THAT S A LOT OF TIME .
OH YEAH .
WE LOOK BACK AND WONDER HOW WE DID IT .
DID YOU .
BOTH WORK .
YOUR WIFE TOO .
NO SHE NEVER DID .
UH WELL QUALIFY THAT .
MUMBLEX .
SHE WORKED AT HOME I M SURE .
WELL YEAH YEAH .
BUT THAT S UH WELL BOTH MY HUSBAND AND I WORK AND SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW BY THE TIME .
I PICK THEM UP AND GET THEM HOME AND GET THEM FED I HAVE VERY LITTLE TIME .
EACH EVENING .
YEAH .
MAYBE THIRTY MINUTES MAX .
WELL THAT S PLENTY THOUGH .
AND WELL HE SPENDS A LOT OF TIME WITH THEM WHILE I M COOKING AND THEN I SPEND TIME WITH THEM WHILE YOU KNOW HE S DOING OTHER STUFF .
AND AND OF COURSE WE TRY TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON THE WEEKEND .
YOU KNOW THERE S A LOT OF TIMES MY HOUSE MAY NOT BE AS CLEAN AS I PARTICULARLY LIKE IT BUT IT S NEAT IT S STRAIGHT AND I CAN LIVE WITH IT BECAUSE .
YEAH .
I DO STUFF WITH MY KIDS YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
WELL YOU KNOW WITH KIDS YOU RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A NEAT HOUSE .
WELL I VE ACCEPTED THAT TOO .
AND YOU KNOW .
THAT S TRUE .
IT IT S TOUGH TO FIND TIME .
IT IS .
E ESPEC ESPECIALLY WITH BOTH OF THEM WORKING .
YEAH .
THAT S TRUE .
AND YOU JUST HAVE TO SET THE TIME AND SAY OKAY THIS IS GOING TO BE IT .
WELL THAT S TRUE AND AND WE DO A LOT OF THAT ON THE WEEKENDS YOU KNOW .
WE TRY TO SPEND SATURDAYS TOGETHER .
RIGHT .

WELL I DECIDED THAT YOU KNOW YOU NEED THAT ONCE IN AWHILE .
THAT YOU YOU NEED TO PLAN THE QUALITY TIME AND AND I DO THINK THAT IF YOU PLAN IT AND SPEND THAT AND MAKE IT .
QUALITY TIME .

WELL THAT THEY SAY IT IT ALL IT TAKES IS ABOUT FIVE TEN MINUTES .
A DAY .

AND UH WELL YEAH IF .
MY DAUGHTER S LIKE MOMMY CAN I HELP YOU WITH THE LAUNDRY .
OF COURSE YOU CAN .

AND WE D TAKE TURNS BEING PRESIDENT .
OH .

THAT WEEK AND THEN .

I .
FACT THEY WERE ALL IN UH OVER THE WEEKEND FOR EASTER .
OH THAT S WONDERFUL .

WE DID OR HOW WE DID IT YOU CAN ALWAYS COME BACK AND TALK TO ME ABOUT IT .
WELL WE DID TOO .
YEAH .
AND I REMEMBER THE ONE DAUGHTER SAYING WE HAD A A FRIEND OF HERS THAT USED TO DRIVE US UP A TREE .
UHHUH .
AND SHE SAID HEY I DO NT MAKE FUN FUN OF YOUR FRIENDS SO WHY MAKE FUN OF MINE .
UH WELL .
KIND OF R KIND OF HIT US BETWEEN THE EYES .
YEAH YEAH .
YOU DO NT THINK OF IT .
THAT WAY DO YOU .
NO .
BUT THAT THAT WAS ALWAYS GOOD QUALITY TIME FOR US .
NOW THAT S GOOD .
I LIKE .
AND THEN .
THAT IDEA .
NEVER ATTEND BUT IF IF THEY MISSED IT THEY HAD TO ABIDE BY THE RULES .
WHATEVER WAS VOTED ON HUH .
YEAH AND BOY THEY THEY D SHOW UP .
WELL I THINK THAT S GREAT .
AND WE D USUALLY TAKE NOTES .
YEAH .
AND YOU KNOW THE YOUNGER KIDS UH OR MAYBE ALL OF THEM NEEDED HELP AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER .
YEAH .
AND UH BUT THEY WERE USUALLY TOUGHER ON THEMSELVES THAN THEY WERE ON US .
AND THEY LOVED IT .
I I THINK THAT S TRUE .
I CAN REMEMBER TIMES MY PARENTS WOULD SAY WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD BE A FAIR PUNISHMENT .
YEAH .
AND WE WOULD ALWAYS COME UP WITH SOMETHING .
THAT WAS HARDER THAN WHAT .
THEY WOULD HAVE DONE .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
SO I DO THINK IT S RIGHT THAT THEY RE HARDER ON THEMSELVES YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
BUT UH BOY I I FEEL FOR YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND .
OH WHY IS THAT .
WELL MY MY UH TWO OF MY UH .
OKAY .
OKAY YOU GO FIRST .
WELL I HAVE UH TWO KIDS I HAVE ONE SEVEN AND ONE FIVE .
UHHUH .
AND UH THEY RE IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL HERE IN TYLER AND UH I M HAPPY WITH IT .
UHHUH .
I M HAPPY WITH THE SCHOOL IT S GREAT GOOD TEACHERS GOOD CURRICULUM UH THEY LEARN A LOT THEY HAVE NO PROBLEMS UH BUT I DO LIVE IN THE BETTER WELL IN THE BEST PART OF THE CITY THOUGH I LIVE IN YOU KNOW THE REAL RICHY PART I GUESS .
I M NOT .
BUT EVERYBODY AROUND ME IS AND UH BUT THEY RE I HAVE FRIENDS .
THAT LIVE IN THE OTHER THE LESS FORTUNATE OR WHATEVER .
YOU WANT TO CALL IT .
PART OF TOWN AND THEIR SCHOOLS ARE KIND OF RUNDOWN AND UH OLDER AND THEY DO NT REALLY OFFER AS MUCH I DO NT KNOW AS UH THE SCHOOL THAT MY GIRLS ARE IN .
I DO NT REALLY THINK THAT S FAIR .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW .
UH BUT YOU KNOW I M HAPPY WITH WHAT .
THEY RE IN SO GO AHEAD .
WELL YEAH IT IT S IT S PRETTY MUCH WHAT .
I WAS S GOING TO SAY IS THERE S A LOT OF DISPARITY BETWEEN DIFFERENT NEIGHBORHOODS AND WHAT SORT OF SCHOOLS GO IN .
UHHUH .
UH I GREW UP IN NEW YORK AND .
WOW .
UH THE PLACE OR NOT NEW YORK CITY UPSTATE NEW YORK .
UHHUH .
AND I WENT TO UH THE CITY OF ROCHESTER SCHOOL DISTRICT .
UHHUH .
AND S A LOT OF MY FRIENDS WERE IN ONE OF THE NEIGHBORING SUBURBS AND IT .
WAS NT WE WERE NT TOO FAR REMOVED GEOGRAPHICALLY FROM EACH OTHER BUT THE DIFFERENCE IN SCHOOLS I THINK WAS PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL .
UHHUH .
AND UH ONE OF THE THINGS .
THAT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF IS IF THE ENTIRE COUNTY HAD HAD HAD JUST ONE SCHOOL SYSTEM .
RIGHT .
AND THAT WOULD RESULT IN SOME UH COULD RESULT IN MORE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF MONEY BECAUSE WHAT WAS HAPPENING WAS YOU KNOW ALL THE VERY RICH PEOPLE WENT OUT TO THE MOVE OUT TO THE SUBURBS AND THE CITY HAD A VERY LOW TAX BASE SO THEY DID NT HAVE A LOT .
UHHUH .
OF MONEY TO WORK WITH .
AS A RESULT THE SCHOOLS WERE RUNDOWN THERE WAS NT AS MANY YOU KNOW OF THE NICE SUPPLIES IN SCIENCE CLASS THAT WE WOULD HAVE LIKED .
THERE WAS NT AS MANY ADVANCED PLACEMENT COURSES UH WHEN I WAS A SENIOR .
UHHUH .
THAT SOME OTHER SCHOOLS HAD .
AND UH IT IT SO I YOU KNOW I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS ONE OF THE WAYS TO TO TO HELP SCHOOLS IN GENERAL UH AND GET THEM .
ALL TO A MINIMUM LEVEL OF OF OF COMPETENCY ALMOST WOULD BE TO EXPAND THE SIZE OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS SO YOU GET A WIDER VARIETY OF PEOPLE AND THE THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THEN THEN THEN PEOPLE WILL EITHER THE RICH PEOPLE WILL EITHER PULL THEIR KIDS OUT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL AND PUT THEM IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS OR .
YEAH .
THEY LL MOVE FARTHER AWAY .
RIGHT .
TO GET BETTER SCHOOLS .
SO YOU KNOW IT IT S KIND OF YOU END UP CHASING LIKE A DOG CHASING ITS OWN TAIL SORT OF .
ALSO UH THE THE FAMILY ENVIRONMENT YOU KNOW YOU CAN COME TO SOUTH TYLER WHERE I LIVE AND YOU HAVE GOT ROOM MOTHERS IN EVERY ROOM YOU VE GOT ART MOTHERS YOU VE GOT EVERY EVERY HOLIDAY THERE .
S PARTIES .
ALL THESE KIDS HAVE THESE REALLY SUPPORTIVE REALLY SUPPORTIVE PARENTS ALWAYS UP THERE FOR .
YEAH .
SOMETHING .
YOU CAN GO TO NORTH TYLER TO THE SCHOOLS AND THE PARENTS MIGHT NOT COULD EVEN TELL YOU .
WHAT .
THEIR KID S TEACHER S NAME IS .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW UH THAT HAS A A WHOLE LOT TO DO WITH IT YOU KNOW AS FAR AS THEIR LEARNING I MEAN IF THE PARENTS ARE NT UH YOU KNOW WILLING TO GO WITH THE KIDS AND FIND OUT WHAT .
THEY RE LEARNING AND IF THEY RE LEARNING .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THEY REALLY DO NT HAVE MUCH OF A CHANCE .
YEAH .
AT ALL .
WHY IS THAT .
HUH .
WHY IS THAT .
WHY YOU ASKING .
YOU .
J THEY JUST DO NT I MEAN I MEAN I M I M UP THERE AT MY KIDS SCHOOL I KNOW WHAT .
THEY RE LEARNING AND IF THEY RE UP I CALL AND FIND OUT YOU KNOW IS SHE HAVING PROBLEMS DOES SHE NEED HELP WITH ANYTHING NO SHE S DOING FINE OKAY YOU KNOW UH AND I I KNOW KIDS THAT THEIR PARENTS COULD REALLY GIVE A RIP AND THE KIDS .
RIGHT .
ARE NOT MOTIVATED .
RIGHT .
THEY HAVE NO MOTIVATION FROM HOME SO THEY JUST GO TO SCHOOL AND YOU KNOW EH YOU KNOW I LL GET THROUGH THE DAY AND UH BRING HOMEWORK HOME AND THERE S NOBODY TO TO SIT THEM DOWN AND SAY YOU RE GOING TO DO THIS .
RIGHT .
UH JUST YOU KNOW THEY THEY TAKE A NOTION TO DO IT THEY DO AND UH THAT DOES NT WORK EITHER YOU KNOW THEY HAVE TO HAVE GUIDANCE AND .
UHHUH .
UH THEY CA NT JUST HAVE IT AT SCHOOL AND THEN COME HOME AND THERE S NOTHING YOU KNOW .
YEAH YEAH .
YEAH I KNOW THAT THAT THAT WAS A BIG FACTOR FOR ME .
I ENDED UP COMING OUT OF OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM VERY WELL .
UHHUH .
AND WAS VERY GOOD EDUCATION UH ENDED UP GETTING SOME SCHOLARSHIPS TO GO TO COLLEGE AND .
UHHUH .
WHICH HAS BEEN YOU KNOW WHICH IS REALLY NICE AND .
YEAH .
I THINK THE DIFFERENCE FOR ME WAS THAT MY PARENTS WERE YOU KNOW THEY WERE DEFINITELY THEY WERE ALWAYS THERE WAS LIKE WELL YEAH OF COURSE .
YOU RE GOING TO STUDY AND DO WELL AND THAT S THE WAY OF COURSE ARE YOU .
WELL ACTUALLY UH .
I I DO NT THINK I M IN THE UH MAJORITY OF IN IN TEXAS I DO NT THINK I AGREE WITH .
OH REALLY .
NO .
YOU DO NT BELIEVE IN IT .
UH I WOULD NT SAY THAT .
I THINK I WOULD HAVE SAID THAT A FEW YEARS AGO .
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I THOUGHT IT WAS UH A SIGN OF A CIVILIZED SOCIETY IF YOU DID NT HAVE UH CAPITAL PUNISHMENT BUT UM UH MAYBE SLOWLY CHANGING MY OPINION .
YEAH .
I M NOT THOROUGHLY OPPOSED TO IT .
I STILL THINK IT .
S SORT OF TRUE THAT A MORE CIVILIZED SOCIETY WOULD NT HAVE TO USE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT BUT I M BEGINNING TO BELIEVE THIS IS LESS CIVILIZED SOCIETY THAN I THOUGHT .
YOU SOUND A LOT LIKE A FRIEND OF MINE .
A .
UHHUH .
A GIRL .
I HANG OUT WITH .
SHE HAS VERY VERY BLACK AND WHITE OPINIONS YOU KNOW .
THERE S NO GRAY IN HER OPINIONS YOU KNOW .
SHE SHE PROBABLY WOULD AGREE MORE WITH YOU BUT BUT I DO NT KNOW .
I THINK I WOULD RATHER A PERSON GO AHEAD AND BE PUT DOWN THAN GIVE THEM .
THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET OUT AND DO IT AGAIN .
I VE NEVER HAD A A PUNISHMENT OR A A CRIME LIKE A MURDER TOUCH MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY .
UHHUH .
BUT I STILL FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS A GOOD WAY TO TO PUNISH ESPECIALLY CRIMINALS .
WHO SEEM TO HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO REMORSE FOR WHAT .
THEY VE DONE .
YEAH .
AND WE SEE THAT MORE AND MORE .
LIKE IN OUR STATE RIGHT NOW THERE S A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD BOY .
WHO RAPED AND THEN KILLED A SEVEN YEAR OLD GIRL .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THAT S FOURTEEN YEARS OLD .
WHAT S HE GOING TO BE DOING WHEN HE TURNS INTO AN ADULT .
YEAH .
I CERTAINLY DO NT UH ADVOCATE TURNING PEOPLE LIKE THAT LOOSE .
YEAH .
I M NOT SURE EXECUTING THEM UH DOES ANYMORE THAN KEEPING THEM IN JAIL BUT UH .
NO IT DOES NT BUT .
IT COSTS LESS .
YEAH .
THAT THAT S A FACTOR .
AND YEAH TO ME .
IT IS .
I MEAN I WORK AND I PAY MY TAXES AND I LIVED OUT IN TEXAS FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND THEY RE AND THAT S A PRETTY HEAVY STATE COMPARED TO GEORGIA .
I MEAN YOU .
GUYS ARE ARE A LOT MORE UH FOR TO EACH HIS OWN EVEN THAN WE ARE IN GEORGIA .
RIGHT .
BUT EVEN IN GEORGIA .
THAT S THE ATTITUDE FOR THE MOST PART .
IF I WORK AND PAY MY DUES .
UHHUH .
YOU WORK AND PAY YOUR DUES AND WE D GET ALONG JUST FINE .
YEAH .
BUT WHEN I VE GOT TO WORK TO PAY MY DUES AND YOUR DUES .
YEAH .
THEN I DO NT LIKE YOU VERY MUCH ANYMORE .
YEAH .
WELL I THE COST IS SOMETHING BUT IT S BUT I THINK IT S RELATIVELY UNIMPORTANT COMPARED TO WHAT S THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY OF .
DEALING WITH CRIME AND I GUESS I WOULD LIKE I DO NT KNOW THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES CERTAINLY UH NONE OF THEM HAVE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT AND THEY .
OH REALLY .
THEY DO NT HAVE A CRIME PROBLEM EITHER .
NO YOU CA NT THEY DO NT EXECUTE ANYBODY IN BRITAIN OR FRANCE AND I DO NT BELIEVE THEY DO IN GERMANY OR ITALY .
EITHER AND THEY DO NT HAVE THE CRIME PROBLEMS WE DO .
I DO NT REALLY THINK THAT THERE IS TOO MUCH OF A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO .
YEAH .
I GUESS WHAT WORRIES ME ABOUT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS UH WHEN I SEE PEOPLE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT IT AND UH UH SORT OF BLOODTHIRSTY .
I THINK IT BRINGS OUT THE WORST IN THE IN THE PEOPLE .
WHO DO THE PUNISHING AND THE THAT THAT BOTHERS ME .
YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT .
BUT IT BUT UH .
I MEAN I I D HATE TO BE THE PERSON TO PULL THE SWITCH YOU KNOW .
I WOULD NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS WANT THAT JOB .
HUH .
BUT I DO BELIEVE IT S NECESSARY AND I .
YEAH .
ON THE ONE HAND .
I I GUESS I ADMIRE THE PERSON .
WHO HAS THE GUTS TO DO IT BECAUSE I COULD NT .
HUH .
I COULD NT STAND BEHIND A GUN AND SHOOT SOMEBODY FOR NOTHING AND I COULD NT PULL THE SWITCH BUT UH .
WELL ACTUALLY I WHA THE OTHER THING .
THAT BOTHERS ME IS WHEN IT BECOMES A POLITICAL ISSUE BECAUSE I DO NT REALLY THINK IT UH I DO NT REALLY THINK IT S A VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF FIGHTING CRIME OR LAW AND ORDER OR ANYTHING ELSE .
I THINK IT JUST BECOMES A UH SYMBOLIC I M TOUGHER THAN YOU ARE TYPE OF EMOTIONAL ISSUE FOR POLITICIANS SO .
YEAH .
I WOULD LIKE FOR IT TO BE SETTLED ONCE FOR ALL AND UH GET IN THE BACKGROUND WHILE THE MORE IMPORTANT ISSUES GET DISCUSSED UH UH .
RIGHT .
LIKE I SAID SOME YEARS AGO I THINK I WOULD HAVE SAID THERE S NO PLACE FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IN THE .
CIVILIZED WESTERN COUNTRY .
UHHUH .
NOW I M I M NOT SO SURE OF THAT .
I M I I WOULD NT VOTE AGAINST SOMEBODY JUST BECAUSE IT WAS FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT AND .
WHAT .
NOR THE OTHER WAY AROUND .
WHAT S MAKING YOU BECOME MORE CONVINCED THAT IT MIGHT BE A GOOD WAY OF PUNISHING .
UH I GUESS I M I M MY VIEW OF UH MY I M BEGINNING TO BELIEVE THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE SIMPLY NOT REHABILITATABLE AND UH THAT UH UH .
COSTS AND OTHER FACTORS JUSTIFY UH UH EXECUTING PEOPLE .
YEAH .
MAYBE IT S MORE A SYMBOLIC GESTURE THAT UH UH THAN ANYTHING ELSE AND UH I VE ALSO NEVER BEEN A VICTIM ALTHOUGH I HAVE SOME I HAVE TWO FRIENDS WHOSE WIVES WERE MURDERED AND UH .
OH GOSH .
I CAN IMAGINE THAT UH UH FOR SOME PEOPLE .
IT WOULD BE THE ONLY FORM OF JUSTICE IN THAT CASE .
OH YES IF IT EVER TOUCHED MY FAM .
UH I THINK UH ACTUALLY I M FAIRLY PLEASED WITH THE BENEFITS THAT WE HAVE AT THE UH WORKING FOR A LARGE CORPORATION .
AND FOR ME THERE S ABSOLUTELY NO QUESTION .
WHAT S THE MOST IMPORTANT BENEFIT .
RIGHT .
I THINK IT .
S HEALTH CARE .
IT .
S .
WHAT I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD SAY THAT .
OH AND IF YOU TRY TO GET IT OUTSIDE OF YOUR CORPORATION YOU RE GOING TO PAY AN ARM AND A LEG .
RIGHT .
BELONGING TO A GROUP IS THE BELONGING TO A HEALTH GROUP IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT PROTECTION .
YOU CAN HAVE AFTER YOU .
RIGHT .
UH SO THE UH SOMETIMES I THINK IT S MORE IMPORTANT THAN SALARY .
UH DO YOU ALSO GET DENTAL .
YES .
AND UH I DO NT KNOW IF I WOULD RANK THAT SECOND BUT UH SINCE I HAVE THREE BOYS UH IT IT CAN TURN OUT TO BE IMPORTANT .
YEAH YOU KNOW .
OH I KNOW .
IN A IN A GIVEN YEAR DENTAL CA DENTAL EXPENSES CAN REALLY KILL YOU .
NOW MY HUSBAND IS WITH UH NORTHWEST AIRLINES AND HE GETS UH YOU KNOW THE FULL HEALTH AND DENTAL AND UH WE HAVE FOUR CHILDREN AND WHAT .
YOU PAY JUST TO HAVE TEETH CLEANED IS OUTRAGEOUS .
RIGHT .
AND I DO NT KNOW HOW PEOPLE .
THAT DO NT HAVE IT CAN AFFORD IT .
RIGHT .
IT .
S UH .
OR MAYBE THEY DO NT .
RIGHT UH AND THEN UH UH IF THE CLEANING DOES NT GET YOU THE ORTHODONY WILL .
THAT S RIGHT .
THAT S RIGHT .
UH I GUESS THAT WOULD BE UP THERE .
UH I M NOT SURE IF I WOULD RANK UH HOW I WOULD RANK THAT NEXT TO SAY COMPARED TO RETIREMENT OR UH UH UH PRETAX SAVINGS WAS ANOTHER THING THAT I THINK IS A .
UHHUH .
A GREAT A GREAT BENEFIT MUMBLEX .
RIGHT .
AND I I THINK IT S REALLY SOMETHING THAT THE UH THE GOVERNMENT OUGHT TO ENCOURAGE MORE BECAUSE UH THERE ARE ALL THESE COMPLAINTS ABOUT HOW WE RE NOT A SAVING COUNTRY .
RIGHT .
AND WHERE THE AVERAGE SAVINGS RATE IS SOMETHING LIKE FOUR PERCENT IN THIS COUNTRY AND FIFTEEN PERCENT IN UH GERMANY AND JAPAN .
UH .
WELL IT S A LOT EASIER TO TO SAVE IT WHEN YOU DO NT GET YOUR HANDS ON IT FIRST .
RIGHT .
WHEN YOU HAVE THE WHEN YOU HAVE THE UH THE ECONOMY TO SCALE AND EVERYTHING THAT A LARGE CORPORATION HAS AND YOU CAN UH OFFER SOME INCENTIVE AND IF THE GOVERNMENT GOES ALONG BY NOT TAXING IT WHEN YOU PUT IT ASIDE .
RIGHT .
YOU CAN REALLY BUILD UP UH THE SAVINGS AND THE THAT YOU WOULD NT OTHERWISE DO AND .
UH WHAT ABOUT WHAT ABOUT UH LESSER UH BENEFITS PERHAPS FOR YOU BUT FOR FOR THE WOMEN IN THE IN THE CORPORATION .
FOR EXAMPLE UH OH .
LEAVE .
YEAH .
DO THEY .
E EVEN DO THEY HAVE FATHER LEAVES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT .
YOU KNOW I I DO NT THINK SO YET .
THEY MAY HAVE UH JUST PLAIN PARENTAL LEAVE WHICH .
EITHER .
ONE CAN TAKE .
UHHUH .
UH I THEIR UH I KNOW THEIR MATERNITY LEAVE IS ON THE ORDER OF SIX WEEKS .
WHICH .
I THINK IS TOO SHORT .
UH .
OH I DO TOO .
UH UH I REALLY THINK THAT WE NEED TO GET INTO THE MOLD WHERE WE TALK ABOUT YEARS RATHER THAN MONTHS OR WEEKS .
OH I THINK I THINK IT S JUST A CRYING SHAME UH .
FOR A MOTHER TO HAVE TO GO BACK TO WORK AT SIX WEEKS .
RIGHT AND UH .
SHE IS NT RECOVERED .
AND UH .
THERE .
THE INFANT NEEDS HER DESPERATELY .
AT THAT POINT AND TIME .
THERE OUGHT TO BE UH UH SOME COMPROMISE .
THAT COULD WHERE UH WHERE THE PERSON WOULD BE GUARANTEED A UH CAREER TYPE POSITION BUT NOT NECESSARILY A CONTINUATION OF EXACTLY THE SAME POSITION .
UHHUH .
UH IN EXCHANGE FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME .
RIGHT I AGREE .
IT .
S UH IT S SO IMPORTANT TO FAMILIES THEN AND UH AND YET ANYBODY .
WHO S GOTTEN FAR ENOUGH TO GET A GOOD SALARY IS REALLY RELUCTANT TO GIVE THAT UP .
OH SURE .
UH .
ESPECIALLY IN THIS DAY AND AGE .
THAT .
YOU DO NT WANT TO START OVER AGAIN ANYWHERE .
YEAH YOU RE RIGHT .
I THINK YOU VE PUT YOUR FINGER ON THE ONE BENEFIT THAT I THAT I WOULD MOST LIKE TO SEE UH CHANGED .
UH THE UH PARENTAL LEAVE .
WELL I THINK THEY RE AT THEY RE COM THEY VE COME A LONG WAY .
RIGHT .
UH AT LEAST .
SOME COMPANIES .
SOME OF THEM UH MY GIRLFRIEND IN PARTICULAR THAT WORKS FOR A A RENTAL CAR AGENCY AND UH AS MANAGER AND UH THEY HAVE A VERY VERY POOR LEAVE POLICY AND UH I JUST DO NT KNOW HOW HOW WOMEN DO IT .
PARTICULARLY SINGLE PARENTS .
WHO DO NT HAVE THE SUPPORT AT THE OTHER END .
UH .
RIGHT .
THEY DO IT BY SHORTCHANGING THEIR KIDS .
THERE S NO OTHER WAY .
I MEAN .
THAT S RIGHT .
THAT S EXACTLY RIGHT .
UH UNLESS THEY RE PART OF SOME EXTENDED FAMILY .
WHICH IS UNLIKELY .
UH .
RIGHT .
MUMBLEX PEOPLE MOVING AS MUCH .
AND UH THEY JUST IT S JUST A TERRIBLE CHOICE YOU SHOULD NT HAVE TO MAKE IT .
UHHUH .
UH YOU RE RIGHT .
AND UH .
ONE OF THE BENEFITS WE GET OF COURSE IS TRAVEL .
OH RIGHT .
BOY WOULD I LIKE TO HAVE THAT .
IT S WONDERFUL .
YEAH .
THE ONLY TROUBLE IS THAT YOU CAN AFFORD TO GO ANYWHERE BUT YOU CA NT AFFORD TO STAY ONCE YOU GET THERE .
OH LISTEN I HAVE FRIENDS IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT CITIES .
IF YOU JUST FLY ME THERE I LL TAKE CARE OF THAT .
THAT S RIGHT .
YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN AWFUL LOT OF FUN JUST JUST GETTING THERE IS HAS TO BE HALF THE FUN .
RIGHT .
SO AND UH I GUESS THE .
OKAY MARTIN DO YOU DO ANY EXERCISE .

UHHUH .
BUT HE HAD A LOT OF UH FACTS TO TO GIVE AND UH THINGS LIKE HOW MANY SOLID WASTE PLANTS WERE BEING SHUT DOWN AND AND UH ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING THINGS THAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT WAS RECYCLING OF OF NEWS PRINT .
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT UH THE CITY OF NEW YORK AND HOW THEY WENT AND COLLECTED ALL THIS NEWS PRINT .
YEAH .
AND THEY COULD SELL IT FOR A WHILE .
THEY WERE ABLE TO SELL IT FOR SOME AMOUNT PER TON AND NOW AT THIS STAGE OF THE GAME WHERE THEY HAVE GOTTEN INTO RECYCLING THEY VE COLLECTED SO MUCH NEWS PRINT THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY TO HAVE IT HAULED AWAY .
RIGHT .
THAT S A THAT S A COMMON PROBLEM THOUGH .
THAT IT SEEMS THAT HAS HAPPENED IN DALLAS AS WELL AS NEW YORK AND I TRY TO RECYCLE ALL OF THE NEWSPAPERS .
THAT COME TO MY HOUSE AND AFTER A WHILE .
I JUST QUIT TAKING THE NEWSPAPER BECAUSE I COULD NT RECYCLE IT ANYMORE WHICH IS NT GOOD FOR BUSINESS ON THE OTHER END EITHER I SUPPOSE .
YEAH .
WE RE DOING SOME HERE IN IN CASH VALLEY THE COMMUNITY HERE .
UHHUH .
THERE S UH WE VE ACTUALLY GOT A KIND OF A NICE SET UP .
WE VE GOT A COUPLE OF PLANTS HERE THAT ACTUALLY TAKE UH RECYCLED PAPER AND SHRED IT AND SPRAY IT WITH CHEMICAL TREATMENT SO THAT IT S NOT A FIRE HAZARD .
RIGHT .
AND MAKE IT INTO INSULATION AND THEY CAN ACTUALLY USE AS MUCH RECYCLED PAPER AS THE COMMUNITY CAN GET TO THEM .
BECAUSE THEY ARE ACTUALLY BUYING IT AND SHIPPING IT IN FROM OUTSIDE .
WELL THAT S GOOD .
SO ONE OF THE REAL KEYS IT SOUNDS LIKE TO GETTING RECYCLING FOR UH PAPER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO GO IS TO GET SOME SORT OF BUSINESS TO ACTUALLY WANT IT ONCE YOU HAVE COLLECTED IT .
RIGHT .
THERE HAS TO BE UH A REUSE FOR IT .
I MEAN THAT S WHY THEY RECYCLE .
THE ONE .
I THINK IS THE MOST INTERESTING IS WITH THE RECYCLED BOTTLES AND ALL THAT UH THE INDUSTRY SEEMS TO BE DOING WITH THE RECYCLED POLYMERS .
UH EVERYTHING FROM UH WASTE BASKETS TO CARPET TO THE NO STICK I MEAN THE STICKY SLIDE RUGS UNDER THE CARPET .
UHHUH .
AND UH I THINK THEY ARE EVEN PUTTING IT IN THE ROADWAYS THESE DAYS AND THEY RE MAKING CLOTHES NOW THAT ARE RECYCLED .
LIKE THE RECYCLED PLASTIC COKE BOTTLES AND AND MILK CARTONS AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
AND THERE WAS A PAPER PRESENTED AT THIS CONFERENCE FROM A GUY FROM ALABAMA AND HE WAS KIND OF HIRED TO DO A STUDY BY TWO DEPARTMENTS FOR THE GOVERNMENT .
ONE WAS LIKE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND THE OTHER ONE WAS OH I CA NT REMEMBER WHAT BUT THE BASIC IDEA IT WAS PRESENTED TO HIM WAS HOW CAN WE MAXIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAT WE CAN GET BACK FROM RECYCLING AND MINIMIZE THE VOLUME OF STUFF THAT WE ARE PUTTING INTO OUR LANDFILL .
UHHUH .
AND UH THE SOLUTION THAT HE CAME UP WITH FOR PLASTICS AND IT WAS REALLY QUITE AMAZING HE SAYS WELL THE BEST THING TO DO WITH PLASTICS IS TO BURN THEM .
OH REALLY .
HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION PLASTICS IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS IN LANDFILLS CAUSE IT S IT S LOW WEIGHT BUT IT S HIGH VOLUME SO IT TAKES UP A LOT OF SPACE .
RIGHT .
AND THERE S ALMOST NO ENERGY THERE S VERY LITTLE ENERGY VALUE IN ACTUALLY DOING A LOT OF THE RECYCLING BUT THERE IS A LOT OF ENERGY IN IT IF YOU CAN BURN IT AND USE IT PRODUCE ELECTRICITY .
HUH .
SO HIS SOLUTION WAS TO BURN PLASTIC .
COLLECT IT AND BURN IT .
WELL IT S CARBON SO THAT MAKES SENSE LIKE A CARBON FUEL OF SOME SORT BUT .
YEAH .
WHAT .
AND IT S MORE THAN EVEN PAPER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
THERE IS MORE ENERGY IN IT PER POUND OR WHATEVER .
WHAT ABOUT EMISSIONS .
WELL THAT WAS HE DID NT DEAL WITH THAT .
OH .
HE JUST SAID BURN IT .
OKAY .
HE DID NT TALK ABOUT CLEANING IT UP OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT .
SO IT S NOT VERY PRACTICAL MUMBLEX .
NO .
WELL IT S INTERESTING .
I BET THAT WAS A GOOD DAY AT THE YEAH CONFERENCE THEN .
YEAH WELL REAL INTERESTING .
DID IT CHANGE ANYTHING FOR YOU .
UH NOT TOO MUCH .
UH I GOT A BIT ACTUALLY .
I THINK THAT UH ONE UH ADVANTAGE OF HAVING UH THE UNANIMOUS VERDICT IS THAT IN A CRIMINAL CASE .
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DO NT UH CONVICT SOMEONE .
WHO UH REALLY SHOULD NT BE CONVICTED .
DEFINITELY .
UM AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW A UNANIMOUS VERDICT UH HELPS TO ENSURE THAT .
I GUESS MAYBE ONE DRAWBACK OF IT IS THAT IF YOU HAVE ONE JUROR .
WHO IS VERY UNREASONABLE IN SOME WAY THAT UH YOU UH WOULD HAVE A PROBLEM UH YOU KNOW THAT YOU WOULD NT CONVICT SOMEONE .
WHO MAYBE SHOULD BE CONVICTED .
UHHUH .
HAVE YOU EVER SERVED ON A JURY BEFORE .
UH I HAVE TWICE .
OH OKAY .
IT WAS A PRETTY WILD EXPERIENCE .
UH WHAT SORTS OF CASES WERE THEY .
THEY WERE JUST YOU KNOW SMALL TIME CASES WHERE UH TRAILERS AND BANKS WERE INVOLVED YOU KNOW .
SO WERE THEY CRIMINAL OR CIVIL .
THEY WERE CIVIL .
THEY WERE NT .
OH OKAY .
THEY WERE NT ANY CRIMINAL .
WHAT UH WHAT WAS THE VERDICT .
DID THE DID THE JURY HAVE TROUBLE REACHING A DECISION .
UH THE JURY IT WAS UH LET ME SEE I THINK IT WAS TEN TO ONE ON THE JURY BECAUSE THEY ONLY HAD TO HAVE ELEVEN PEOPLE .
YEAH .
SO IT WAS THEY AND UH THE ONE CHANGED HIS VOTE AT THE END .
SO DID IT BECOME .
SO IT BECAME UNANIMOUS YOU KNOW AFTER THEY TURNED IT IN .
YEAH .
AND THEN HE CHANGED HIS MIND AFTER THEY TURNED IT IN .
UH .
BUT IT THEN BECAME UNANIMOUS .
UH .
BUT SINCE IT WAS A CIVIL CASE .
IT REALLY DID NT MATTER RIGHT .
YOU JUST NEEDED A MAJORITY .
RIGHT .
WHAT WAS WHAT WAS THE OTHER CASE .
THAT WAS ALSO CIVIL .
THE THE OTHER CASE WAS JUST TRAFFIC THE AND YOU KNOW IT WAS SEAT BELT LAW .
YEAH .
AND IT IT DID NT EVEN HARDLY .
OH DID NT REALLY EVEN COUNT .
GO THROUGH SO .
YEAH .
I M I M A COLLEGE STUDENT SO I HAVE NT BEEN YOU KNOW A JURY ELIGIBLE AGE FOR VERY LONG .
YEAH .
UM AND UH I DID GET ONE SUMMONS ACTUALLY AT ONE POINT BUT I DECLINED IT .
WHICH .
I M ABLE TO DO BECAUSE I M A STUDENT BECAUSE IT WAS UH A VERY BAD TIME .
YEAH .
WELL YOU LEARN A LOT GOING TO THE JURIES LIKE THAT THOUGH .
YEAH I MEAN I I REALLY I WOULD LIKE TO UH TO DO AT SOME POINT UM BUT I I HAVE NT .
UH ONE ONE THING THAT I I THINK IS UM YOU KNOW MAYBE IS A PROBLEM IS UH I I THINK THAT THE CRIMINAL JURY SYSTEM WORKS PRETTY WELL NOW BUT I WONDER IF MAYBE IN SOME CIVIL CASES .
IT DOES NT WORK AS WELL .
ESPECIALLY SORT OF .
I WOULD NT THINK THAT IT DOES .
HOW WHA .
I MEAN FROM FROM MY FROM WHAT .
I EXPERIENCED IN THEM IT DID NT YOU KNOW IT DID NT TURN OUT THE WAY .
I PLANNED IT I MEAN THE WAY THAT I WOULD THINK THAT IT WOULD GO .
UH YOU THOUGHT IT TURNED OUT PRETTY WELL .
YEAH BUT IT WAS YOU KNOW IT WAS JURY WAS UNORGANIZED AND IT WAS IT WAS JUST WAS NT ORGANIZED ENOUGH FOR ME .
YEAH .
I M NOT USED TO IT NOT BEING ORGANIZED AND I JUST ASSUMED THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN .
OH SO IT WAS JUST KIND OF A ZOO AND THE JURORS JUST SORT OF SOMEONE HAD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON .
THAT S ABOUT WHAT .
IT WAS .
UM .
THAT S INTERESTING .
DID IT DID IT WORK OUT PRETTY WELL IN THE END .
I MEAN DID A COUPLE OF PEOPLE SORT OF GRADUALLY SORT OF ASSUME UH SORT OF A MODERATOR ROLE IN THE TRIAL OR .
YEAH THEY WELL THEY PICKED ONE PERSON AND THEN HE FINALLY YOU KNOW MODERATED EVERYTHING AND MADE IT TURN OUT THE WAY .
IT SHOULD HAVE .
SO IT .
WORK IT DID END UP WORKING OUT PRETTY WELL .
YEAH IT ENDED UP WORKING ALL RIGHT .
THE ONE THING .
I SOMETIMES WONDER ABOUT UM IN CIVIL CASES IS UH WHETHER ESPECIALLY SORT OF IN UH MAYBE LIKE PRO PRODUCT LIABILITY OR MEDICAL MALPRACTICE WHERE THERE S UM SORT OF A VERY TECHNICAL DECISION TO BE MADE SOMETIMES .
YES .
YOU KNOW IT S NOT JUST A MATTER OF UM OF YOU KNOW DID THIS GUY RIP OFF THIS GUY AND IT S JUST A MATTER OF INTERPRETING A CONTRACT IT S SORT OF A MATTER OF UM YOU KNOW SOMETIMES GETTING INTO VERY TECHNICAL ISSUES AND I WONDER IF UH IF THERE S REALLY UM IF THE SYSTEM WORKS ADEQUATELY IN IN EDUCATING THE JURORS ABOUT UH WHATEVER UM YOU KNOW ISSUE IS UNDER DISCUSSION .
I I DO NT THINK THAT THEY THEY THEY EDUCATE THEM ENOUGH TO TO REALLY KNOW WHAT S GOING ON .
IN IN THE CASE .
YOU WERE INVOLVED IN YOU SAID IT WAS JUST SORT OF A BANK MATTER OF SOME KIND .
SO .
YEAH THE THE BANK WAS SUING THEM FOR UH BECAUSE THEY WENT TO GET THE THE TRAILER .
YEAH .
THAT WHICH WAS UH SEEMINGLY THEIR PROPERTY .
UH .
IT WAS ON HIS PROPERTY .
OH SO THE DEAL WAS THAT HE HAD UH BORROWED MONEY FROM THE BANK TO BUY IT AND .
RIGHT .
HE HAD NT MADE THE PAYMENTS .
SO THEY CAME TO GET IT .
YEAH .
AND THEN WHEN THEY CAME TO GET IT WELL IT WAS ON THE LANDLORD S PROPERTY AND HE WOULD NT LET THEM TAKE IT OFF .
UH SO THEY WERE SUING TO GET IT BACK .
SO AND THEY ARE IT WAS A DOUBLE WIDE SO THEY D ALREADY TAKEN IT APART .
UH .
SO THEY LEFT IT .
THERE .
YEAH .
AND THEN WHEN THEY CAME BACK TO GET IT .
A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER IT HAD RAINED AND GOT ALL IN IT .
UH .
SO THEY WERE SUING HIM FOR THE MONEY AND YOU KNOW THERE S NO WAY .
THEY COULD BECAUSE IT IT WAS THE MOVING COMPANY .
BYE .
SO WE RE UH OUR DISCUSSION S ABOUT UH THE CARE OF THE ELDERLY .
THAT S RIGHT THAT S RIGHT .
YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT UH WHAT DO YOU THINK IS IMPORTANT .
IF YOU WERE UH I DO NT KNOW HOW HOW OLD YOU ARE BUT IF YOU HAD IF YOU HAD UH PARENTS SAY OR OR OR TH GRANDPARENTS WHATEVER .
IT IS UH WHO WERE READY .
WHO WHO .
YOU THOUGHT MIGHT BENEFIT FROM A NURSING HOME WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD LOOK FOR .
UH WELL I ACTUALLY MY DAD S MY DAD S ALMOST NINETY AND .
HUH .
HE LIVES BY HIMSELF AND HE S IN GOOD SHAPE .
YEAH .
UH BUT UH SOME FRIENDS OF MINE HAVE UH GONE THROUGH THIS .
I THINK I D LOOK FOR A HOME WHERE THEY GOT A LOT OF ATTENTION AND UH WHERE THEY DID SOME THINGS TO TRY TO KEEP THEM UM MENTALLY ALIVE .
YEAH .
AND WHERE THERE WAS UH CARING AND COMPASSIONATE WHERE THERE WERE CARING AND COMPASSIONATE PEOPLE UH OPERATING IT .
DO .
HUH .
YOU HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE WITH THIS .
YOURSELF .
WELL MY UH UH MY WIFE S GRANDMOTHER .
UHHUH .
IS IN A NURSING HOME IN UH MINNESOTA AND WE GO THERE UH ONCE A YEAR .
WE SEE WE TEND TO SEE HER THERE CAUSE WE RE IN BOSTON SO WE RE PRETTY FAR AWAY .
WHEN WE VISIT MINNESOTA THOUGH WE GO TO SEE HER .
UHHUH .
AND IT SEEMS UH I MEAN THE THE ENVIRONMENT THERE I DO NT KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT IT BUT IT IT SEEMS NICE ENOUGH .
UH IT IT S HARD AT LEAST HALF OF THE RESIDENTS I WOULD SAY ARE NOT NOT MENTALLY SOUND .
SO IT S HARD TO TELL HOW MUCH OF THAT RUBS OFF ON THOSE .
WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO R TO RETAIN UH CLARITY SAY UH YOU KNOW .
FROM THE LACK OF STIMULATION YOU MEAN .
YEAH .
WELL I I DON I DO NT KNOW .
WE WE ALSO MY WIFE AND I UH UH VOLUNTEER TO GO TO A UH NURSING HOME .
THAT S JUST A MILE FROM OUR HOUSE .
WE UH SHE GOES MORE OFTEN THAN I .
WE USED TO GO ONCE A MONTH ONCE EVERY TWO MONTHS TO VISIT SOME OF THE PATIENTS THERE .
AND WE D TAKE WE HAVE A TWO YEAR OLD SON AND SO WE SOMETIMES WE D TAKE HIM WITH US .
AND UH THERE I WOULD SAY IT S THE SAME THING .
IT S IT S A NICE UH RELATIVELY NICE ENVIRONMENT BUT AGAIN UM IT MUST BE DEPRESSING FOR THE PEOPLE .
WHO WHO ARE WHO ARE JUST E E ESSENTIALLY NOT ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES IN THEIR OWN HOUSE BUT BUT CERTAINLY UH CERTAINLY HAVE AR AR ARE HAVE RETAINED ALL OF THEIR UH MENTAL SKILLS AND SO ON .
IT S MUST BE DEPRESSING TO TO WALK WALK THE HALLS AND SEE AN AND SEE ALL THESE OTHER PEOPLE .
WHO REALLY DO NT KNOW WHERE THEY ARE .
DO YOU THINK THAT IN THE CASE OF THE ONE THAT YOU VE ACTUALLY HAD SOME EXPERIENCE WITH THAT THE PEOPLE .
WHO OPERATE IT SEEM TO HAVE WHAT .
YOU D PERCEIVE OF AS GENUINE CONCERN .
I THINK YEAH I THINK THEY RE RELATIVELY RE RESPECTFUL .
YEAH AND AND CONCERNED THAT IN AS MUCH AS THEY CAN BE .
I I THINK SOMETIMES YOU KNOW I VE NOTICED UH PEOPLE ASKING FOR UH SOME OF THE PATIENTS ASKING FOR THINGS UH JUST REPETITIVELY .
UHHUH .
AND BUT THINGS .
THAT ARE NOT REASONABLE AND SO .
YEAH .
AT SOME LEVEL .
THE THE THE UH I M SURE THAT THE THAT THE UH THE STAFF L LEARN WHAT S NORMAL FOR THIS PERSON AND SO IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE MAYBE THEIR NOT CATERING TO THIS PERSON S NEEDS IS REALLY BECAUSE THIS PERSON IS JUST YOU KNOW IS JUST IN A STATE WHERE THEY DO NT REALLY NEED WHAT .
THEY THINK THEY NEED YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
IT IT S POSSIBLE I WAS THINKING ALSO THAT THERE D BE THERE COULD BE A FAIR BURN OUT FACTOR .
OH YEAH .
UM IN JUST HAVING TO RESPOND TO PEOPLE S NEEDS WHERE THE NEEDS ARE SOMETIMES DEPENDING ON THE PERSON NOT GOING TO BE WHAT .
WE WOULD PERCEIVE OF AS RATIONAL NEED .
YEAH .
I LL TELL YOU .
ONE THING THOUGH THAT LL THAT THAT I I SAW THAT WAS REALLY NICE .
WE SAW A HUSBAND AND WIFE WE USED TO SEE A HUSBAND AND WIFE IN THERE UH TOGETHER AND THEY WERE IN THE SAME ROOM .
WHICH NOT ALL HUSBAND AND WIVES WERE BUT THESE TWO WERE .
UHHUH .
AND WHEN YOU WALKED INTO THEIR ROOM THEY HAD BROUGHT ALL THEIR FURNITURE FROM THEIR HOUSE .
UHHUH .
SO IT .
AND SO .
GIVES THEM .
A SENSE OF IDENTITY .
YEAH YOU WALKED IN THERE AND IT DID NT LOOK LIKE UH YOU KNOW HOW YO YOU YOU WALK INTO SOME ROOMS AND THERE S IT S COMPLETELY GENERIC .
THERE S NOTHING MAYBE A PICTURE OR TWO .
THAT BELONGS TO THAT PERSON AND THAT S IT .
BUT THIS ROOM ON THE OTHER HAND YOU KNOW THEY GOT RID OF ALL OF THE SORT OF STANDARD ISSUE BEDS AND DRESSERS AND THIS AND THAT AND THEY HAD ALL THEIR STUFF FROM THEIR HOUSE AND IT LOOKED LIKE UH I I IT MUST HAVE BEEN IT WAS NICER TO WALK IN THERE AND TO TALK TO THEM AND IT MUST ALSO GIVE THEM .
A SENSE OF UH UH SECURITY AND AND UH AND AND YOU KNOW S S UH .
YEAH I I THINK PART OF WHAT .
YOU RE SAYING MATCHES .
WHAT .
I H HAVE READ .
I USED TO INITIALLY THINK THAT THE ONLY PEOPLE .
WHO WENT INTO SUCH RESIDENCES WERE PEOPLE .
WHO UH WERE ADEQUATELY DEFICIENT IN THEIR ABILITIES UH .
YEAH .
PHYSICAL OR MENTAL THAT THEY COULD NT TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES .
BUT I ALSO KNOW A COUPLE OF PEOPLE WHOSE PARENTS HAVE GONE INTO SUCH THINGS BECAUSE I THINK THEY PROVIDE UM A LOT OF SOCIAL ACTIVITIES .
HUH .
YEAH .
UH THE ONE OF MY FRIEND S PARENTS .
WHO WENT IN BECAUSE SHE HAD LARGELY LOST HER ABILITIES AND SHE WAS IN THERE FOR AWHILE WHEN THEY WERE AWAY ON VACATION .
UH AND .
HUH .
MUMBLEX TEMPORARY .
I THAT THAT S THAT S NEW TO ME .
I .
WELL I THINK IT I THINK T IT WAS SORT OF ON THE GROUNDS THAT THEY WERE CONSIDERING WHETHER SHE WOULD LIVE THERE AND I FEEL LIKE THE WHOLE VOCABULARY OF THIS IS VERY LOADED IF YOU THINK OF WORDS LIKE LIKE PUT HER IN THERE .
RIGHT RIGHT .
AND THERE THERE S SO MUCH .
UH WELL I M NOT SURE HOW IT IS IN GEORGIA BUT IN IN PITTSBURGH .
THE R THE CRIME RATE REALLY IS NOT VERY HIGH AT THE MOMENT .
IS THAT IS THAT TRUE FOR FOR ATLANTA .
ATLANTA IS KIND OF HIGH .
UH IT S IT S LOWER THAN IT HAS BEEN IN THE PAST .
UH I GUESS NINETEEN NINETY IS WHEN IT START TO DROP OFF AND USUALLY AROUND THE CHRISTMAS SEASON IS USUALLY WHEN THE CRIME RATE IS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER .
YEAH I THAT S PROBABLY NOT TRUE ONLY FOR ATLANTA BUT FOR JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE .
YEAH .
UH WHAT KIND OF CRIME PROBLEM DO YOU USUALLY RUN INTO .
ANY SPECIFICS .
WELL UH THE LEAST WHAT FROM WHAT S ON THE NEWS UH THERE ARE VERY FEW LIKE ACTUAL ROBBERIES REPORTED UH UH OF OF RESIDENCES .
WHAT S MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR IS UH ROBBERY OF UH YOU KNOW KNOCKING OVER A A SMALL STORE OR A CAR THEFT YOU KNOW IT THINGS OF THAT NATURE .
VERY FEW UH ASSAULTS ALTHOUGH ON THE COLLEGE CAMPUSES UH THERE ARE UH CASES OF YOU KNOW LIKE PEOPLE GETTING MACHINE FROM A FROM AN AUTOMATED TELLER AND YOU KNOW SOMEBODY TRYING TO TO DEVICE .
A SCAM FOR FOR UH GETTING THE MONEY FOR THEM THAT ACTUALLY PREYS MOSTLY ON FOREIGNERS .
UM .
BUT MOSTLY PETTY THINGS AND N NO NOTHING NOTHING REALLY TOO BIG .
RIGHT WELL I GUESS HERE WE RUN INTO THAT SOMETIME BUT I GUESS A LOT OF CRIMES ARE DONE WITH APARTMENT TYPE BREAK INS .
RIGHT .
THAT TYPE NOT MUCH HOME BREAK INS .
THERE ARE SOME BUT NOT NOT VERY HIGH .
UH AS FAR AS TELLERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT IT S NOT EXTREMELY HIGH EITHER .
THERE WERE ONE CASE WHERE UH THIS ONE GUY UH WAS TAKING WOMEN FROM THE TELLER AND AND YOU KNOW MAKING THEM GIVE HIM .
MONEY AND STUFF AND .
UHHUH .
THEN AT THE SAME TIME RAPING THEM .
ALL SO SO THAT S KIND OF LIKE A DOUBLE ASSAULT THERE .
YEAH UH A STRANGE CASE THAT UH THAT HAPPENED OH IT S ABOUT ABOUT A YEAR AGO WAS SOMEONE ACTUALLY STOLE A COMPLETE AUTOMATED TELLER MACHINE .
REALLY .
IT WAS A FREE STANDING MACHINE AND THEY BACKED UP INTO IT WITH A TRUCK .
UHHUH .
AND PUT IT ON THE BACK AND DROVE AWAY WITH IT .
OH WOW .
NOW THERE S A CRIME FOR YOU .
YEAH THERE S A CRIME .
YEAH BUT UH I GUESS MOST OF THE THINGS .
THAT HAPPEN AROUND HERE ARE ARE PRETTY UH INNOCUOUS .
ALTHOUGH UH FROM WHAT .
I HEAR IN THE NEWS AND AND I I S SAW AN EPISODE OF THE T V SHOW COPS .
UHHUH .
UH ONE TIME .
THAT WAS IN PITTSBURGH AND UH IT IT IT DID SURPRISE ME BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY WERE DOING DRUG ARRESTS AND THING AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT I I DO NT REALLY THINK THOSE THINGS HAPPEN TOO OFTEN BECAUSE LIKE I SAID FROM WHAT S REPORTED IN THE NEWS AT LEAST IT S IT S NOT ALL THAT COMMON .
OH OKAY .
I DO NT KNOW CRIME SITUATIONS HERE THEY LIKE I SAY LOT OF LOT OF CASES IS USUALLY JUST APARTMENTS AND AND BREAK INS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND A LOT OF IT IS DUE TO DRUGS .
YEAH .
UH DRUG RELATED YOU KNOW IN IN MOST CASES IT S NOT LIKE UH IT S SOMEONE DO STEAL A A OR TELEVISION OR V C R OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT IS FOR DRUGS YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU REALLY CA NT ON THE STREET MAKE ANY MONEY OFF OF IT PER SE YOU KNOW YOU GOING TO GET TEN OR FIFTEEN BUCKS FOR IT .
YEAH .
SO YOU REALLY NOT MAKING A SIZEABLE PROFIT .
SO IT S NOT REALLY LUCRATIVE TO TAKE CHANCES LIKE THAT YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH IT IT DOES EXIST .
YOU KNOW I JUST TO DIVERGE A LITTLE BIT UH I LIVE IN AN APARTMENT .
RIGHT NOW I M FINISHING OUT MY LAST SEMESTER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AND UH THE APARTMENT LIKE WOULD BE VERY EASY FOR JUST ABOUT ANYONE TO BREAK IN .
RIGHT .
BUT EVEN SO IT I MEAN IT S IT S STILL DIFFICULT FOR ME TO CONVINCE MY APARTMENT MATES TO TO LIKE LOCK THE DOORS WHEN THEY GO OUT YOU KNOW AND THINGS LIKE .
YEAH .
THAT .
UHHUH .
UH IT WOULD BE SO EASY FOR SOMEONE .
WHO IS MOTIVATED TO DO SO TO JUST YOU KNOW SIT OUT BACK TAKE A LOOK AT WHEN PEOPLE ARE HERE AND WHEN THEY RE NOT .
UHHUH .
JUST COME IN YOU KNOW THERE S A T V AND A V C R AND THEY COULD UH THEY COULD GET IN PRETTY EASY AND AND ESPECIALLY UH SINCE THERE ARE BEDROOMS UPSTAIRS .
UHHUH .
AND PEOPLE LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN YOU KNOW WHILE THEY RE UPSTAIRS PLAYING MUSIC IT COULD STILL HAPPEN THEN .
YEAH THAT S TRUE BUT YOU D BE SURPRISED ALSO HOW MUCH PEOPLE WATCH YOU THAT EVEN NOT UH PARTICIPATING IN ANY TYPE CRIME .
I GUESS THERE WAS ONE CASE I WAS SURPRISED UH SO HAPPENED THIS PERSON WORKED AT THE SAME PLACE I WORK FOR GEORGIA TECH AND THEY WORK AT THE SAME PLACE .
I DID BUT I DID NT KNOW THAT THEY HAD BEEN WATCHING ME BECAUSE I WAS GETTING READY TO TO GO IN MY CAR ONE MORNING AND THE FIRST THING .
THEY SAID IS UH YOU MUST DO NT HAVE TO BE TO WORK AT EIGHT YOU KNOW LIKE SHOCK .
ANYWAY UH .
HOW ABOUT YOU .
WHAT DO YOU DO WITH YOUR BUDGET .
WHAT DO I DO UH AT THE MOMENT .
IT S UNDER CHAOS .
UH RIGHT NOW I M JUST UH I I DO NT REALLY HAVE A BUDGET PER SE .
I M I UH IT S CALLED LIVING WITHIN YOUR MEANS .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW WHICH MEANS AT THE MOMENT PAYING OFF THE VISA BILL AND KEEPING EVERYTHING ELSE UNDER CONTROL AND HOPING THE CAR DOES NT COLLAPSE .
YEAH .
THAT S TRUE .
UH BUT UH NO I DO NT REALLY HAVE A BUDGET AT THE MOMENT .
UH BUT I HAVE UH I HAVE A ROUGH FEEL FOR HOW MUCH MONEY .
I CAN AFFORD TO SPEND EACH MONTH AND THEN I DO NT USUALLY DO NT EXCEED THAT UNLESS I UNLESS THE VISA BILL GETS OUT OF HAND FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER LIKE IF I HAVE CAR EXPENSES AND THEN THAT THEN IT GOES THROUGH THE MOON SO .
YEAH THAT S SORT OF A PROBLEM .
YEAH SO UH WHAT DO YO .
WE RE TRYING WE RE TRYING TO UH SO FAR WE ARE IN THE CLEAR CREDIT WISE BUT UH THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IS SO NOT MUCH ON THAT SIDE OF IT TO ADD TO IT .
WE RE TRYING TO THINK OF HOW TO PUT AWAY SOME SAVINGS AND STUFF LIKE THAT BUT .
SO YOU CAN AFFORD TO GET A HOUSE .
YEAH WE D LIKE TO DO THAT SOME DAY .
WE HAVE THIS DREAM .
YEAH .
BUT WE DO NT KNOW HOW LONG .
IT WILL BE A DREAM .
WE WE RE KIND OF REAL WE RE REAL HAPPY THAT WE DO NT HAVE ANY DEBT BUT WE RE AT THE SAME TIME .
WE RE REAL SCARED ABOUT INCURRING IT IN THIS UH ECONOMY RIGHT NOW SO .
YEAH .
WE RE STEPPING REAL CAREFUL AND TRYING TO SEE WHAT S THE BEST WAY TO SAVE WHAT THE LITTLE BIT THAT WE DO GET YOU KNOW ON TOP OF EXPENSES .
EVERY MONTH .
SO WHAT DO YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND DO .
WE RE MISSIONARIES ACTUALLY .
ARE YOU REALLY .
YEAH UHHUH .
AND UH IT WILL BE EASIER ONCE WE GET OVERSEAS CAUSE .
WE HAVE UH LIKE UH UH SUPPORT QUOTA .
UM .
AND IT S CHEAPER TO LIVE OVERSEAS THAN IT IS TO LIVE HERE .
NO KIDDING .
AND IT DOES NT GET SWITCHED VERY EASILY ONCE YOU COME HOME .
I SEE .
SO .
OVERSEAS WHERE WOULD YOU BE GOING .
AFRICA NIGERIA .
REALLY .
YEAH .
REALLY .
HOW LONG WOULD YOU BE THERE .
ABOUT FOUR YEARS .
WE RE CAREER SO WE WE GO OVER SEAS FOR FOUR YEARS AND THEN WE COME BACK FOR A YEAR .
WE GO OVER FOUR WE COME BACK FOR A YEAR .
WITH WITH WHAT CHURCH .
UH WE RE WITH WYCLIFF BIBLE TRANSLATORS .
OH YES .
YES .
SO .
I UH I KNOW WHO .
THEY ARE .
THEY UH THEY HAVE AN OFFICE UH IN IN COSTA MESA AS I RECALL .
YEAH THEY COULD VERY WELL AND .
THERE THERE WAS UH YOU KNOW THERE WAS A FAIRLY LARGE BUILDING THAT THAT WAS WELL THAT BELONGS TO THEM .
SO UH ARE YOU UH ARE YOU UH ACTIVE IN TRANSLATION .
UH WE WILL BE .
I WAS OVER OVER FOUR YEARS DOING LANGUAGE SURVEYING WHICH IS THE FIRST STEP .
YOU RE KIND OF LIKE THE SCOUT .
THAT GOES AHEAD OF THE TEAM AND ASSESSES THE NEED .
UHHUH .
AND UH CAME HOME AND GOT MARRIED AND WE WILL GO BA BACK AS TRANSLATORS CAUSE WE WANT TO RAISE A FAMILY AND IT IS EASIER TO RAISE A FAMILY AS TRANSLATORS .
WELL I ALWAYS WANTED TO DO TRANSLATION BUT AS LONG AS I WAS SINGLE AND FOOT LOOSE SO TO SPEAK IT S EASIER .
YOU KNOW THEY REALLY NEED SURVEYORS CAUSE YOU COULD YOU RE FREE TO TRAVEL ANYWHERE .
YOU DO NT HAVE KIDS HANGING AROUND YOU AND STUFF .
TRUE TRUE ENOUGH .
SO UH WHAT WHAT UH WHAT LANGUAGES DO YOU SPEAK BESIDES ENGLISH OF COURSE .
WELL I HAVE A SMATTERING OF ABOUT TEN DIFFERENT ONES BUT THERE S I M NOT BILINGUAL IN ANY OF THEM BECAUSE I KEPT SWITCHING FROM ONE AREA TO THE OTHER YOU KNOW SINCE I DID .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW COMPLETE A SURVEY IN ONE AREA I D SWITCH TO THE OTHER .
SO I KNOW THE GREETINGS IN ABOUT TEN .
AND HOW TO DO MARKET STUFF BUT IN ABOUT UH ABOUT FIVE .
I GUESS I CAN DO BETTER IN IT .
AND MY FRENCH IS PRETTY GOOD BUT IT S UH MUMBLEX FRENCH SO UH I M TERRIFIED TO SPEAK IN UH .
IN FRANCE .
IN FRANCE .
YEAH BECAUSE THEY RE REAL SNOBBY ABOUT THEIR LANGUAGE AND MUMBLEX FRENCH IS STREET FRENCH AND I JUST PICKED IT UP OFF THE STREET AND I KNEW WHAT .
I WAS I KNEW WHAT .
I WAS COMMUNICATING BUT I DID NT KNOW WHAT .
I WAS SAYING .
I NEVER SAT THERE AND GOT A DIRECT TRANSLATION AND SAID SOMETHING HERE WHEN I CAME HOME AND FRENCH TO SOMEBODY AND HE PALED AND SAID UH I M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU .
WHAT .
YOU SAID .
SO SINCE THEN I HAVE REFRAINED FROM SPEAKING ANY FRENCH .
SO .
IN MUMBLEX .
UH .
I DO NT KNOW WHAT .
I SAID TO HIM BUT UH I DID NT ASK HIM EITHER .
MUST HAVE BEEN TERRIBLE .
THE UH WAS IT .
HENRY MACON SAID THAT THE THE UH LANGUAGE WAS LIKE A MAN SLOWLY BLEEDING TO DEATH .
SO THEY HEMORRHAGED HIM TO DEATH WITHOUT NEW INFUSIONS .
THAT WILL EVENTUALLY DIE AND I IT JUST AMAZES ME THAT THE FRENCH DO NT RECOGNIZE THAT .
FREE STYLE ENGLISH IS JUST TAKES ON .
OKAY SO WHAT ARE WHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS ON CAPITAL PUNISHMENT .
I HAVE AMBIVALENT FEELINGS BECAUSE I DO NT THINK IT SERVES AS A KIND OF DETERRENT .
WE WOULD LIKE TO THINK IT IS .
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IT IS VERY VERY EXPENSIVE TO MAINTAIN YOU KNOW TEXAS HAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS IN THE COUNTRY .
YES .
AND IT S EATING US ALIVE BUDGET WISE AND UH .
SO ARE THEY CURRENTLY PRACTICING CAPITAL PUNISHMENT .
YES WE .
IN YOUR STATE .
DO PRACTICE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT BUT THE NATURE OF THE UH COURTS AND THE APPEALS AND THE STAYS AND ALL THAT MEANS THAT IT S A VERY LONG HAUL BEFORE ANYBODY S EVER EXECUTED .
YES THAT S SIMILAR TO GEORGIA .
YEAH .
AND THEN I WAS READING IN THE PAPER JUST THIS MORNING IT S INTERESTING BECAUSE I HAD FORGOTTEN I GUESS THAT I WROTE THIS LITTLE TOPIC DOWN THAT IT COSTS MORE TO EXECUTE SOMEBODY TH THAN IT DOES TO KEEP THEM .
THAT S PROBABLY TRUE CONSIDERING .
BECAUSE OF ALL THE COSTS OF THE APPEALS AND ALL THAT .
YES .
YOU KNOW .
YES UH I GUESS IN A WAY THAT IT IT .
KIND OF DEFEATS .
THE PURPOSE OF HAVING CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IF .
WELL I THINK CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS SUPPOSED TO BE PRIMARILY A DETERRENT TO OTHER PEOPLE .
YES .
YOU KNOW WHO WOULD SEE IT .
RIGHT THAT WOULD BE THE INTENT OF IT .
YEAH BUT I M NOT SURE HOW SUCCESSFUL .
THAT IS .
WELL I THINK IT WOULD BE MORE SUCCESSFUL IF IT WAS APPLIED IN A MORE EXPEDIENT MANNER IF THERE WERE NT SO MANY .
QUICKER .
APPEALS .
MAYBE YEAH .
YEAH IF IF THE PERSON .
WHO S GOING TO COMMIT THE CRIME .
UHHUH .
KNEW THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE PUNISHED SEVERELY POSSIBLY CAPITAL PUNISHMENT .
WHAT WHAT KIND OF WORK DO YOU DO .
UH I M A RESEARCH ENGINEER I WORK UH F WITH GEORGIA TECH .
UM WELL SEE I M A SCHOOL PRINCIPAL .
UM .
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL .
YES .
AND IN A VERY POOR SECTION OF TOWN WITH P PREDOMINANTLY ANGLO KIDS .
AND I SEE KIDS ALREADY THAT ARE GOING TO BE CRIMINALS .
UM .
IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING .
WE CAN DO AND SEE I M AFRAID I THINK IF WE WOULD TAKE THE EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF MONEY AND INVEST IT IN YOUNG PEOPLE THAT I MEAN COURSE YOU COULD NT DO THAT BECAUSE YOU GOT TO DO SOMETHING WITH THE ONES .
THAT ARE ALREADY THERE .
UHHUH .
BUT I THINK WE WOULD MAKE A BIGGER INVESTMENT IN KIDS WE D HAVE FEWER DECISIONS TO MAKE .
UM THAT S PROBABLY TRUE BUT I GUESS .
DOWN THE ROAD YOU KNOW .
THERE .
S OTHER FACTORS THAT .
OH YEAH .
BUT P P PUMPING MORE MONEY INTO THE SCHOOL SYSTEM IS A .
WELL .
GOOD THING BUT IT S NOT GOING TO .
I M NOT TALKING ABOUT JUST IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM .
OH I SEE .
SEE I M TALKING ABOUT LIKE IN IN UH I M AFRAID I THINK THAT THERE ARE KIDS .
WHO JUST OUGHT TO BE TAKEN OUT OF THEIR HOMES AND REARED .
UH I KNOW THE INSTITUTIONS DO NT WORK THAT WELL BUT IT S A BAD DAY BECAUSE I GET ALL THESE KIDS THROUGH MY OFFICE .
I HAVE A SCHOOL OF FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTYSEVEN KIDS .
UHHUH .
FIVE HUNDRED OF THEM ARE GOOD SOLID KIDS AND I HAVE THE SAME THIRTYSEVEN IN MY OFFICE .
EVERY DAY .
UM .
AND A LOT OF THEIR PARENTS ARE TOTALLY IRRESPONSIBLE .
SOME OF THEM IN THE PENAL SYSTEM .
SO THAT S A DIFFICULT SITUATION .
AND YOU KNOW YOU JUST SEE THOSE KIDS GOING DOWN THE ROAD .
NOW NOT ALL OF THEM WILL COMMIT OFFENSES .
THAT HAVE TO DO WITH CAPITAL PUNISHMENT BUT SOME OF THEM HAVE ALREADY BEEN IN YOUTH CENTERS .
UM .
AND THAT KIND OF THING AND IF WE HAD SOMETHING TO DO BEFORE THEY GET TO BE FULLBLOWN ADULT CRIMINALS AND I M NOT TALKING ABOUT NECESSARILY IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM I M NOT SURE THAT THE SCHOOL SYSTEM SHOULD BE THE AGENT OF ALL THE SOCIAL ACTION .
UHHUH .
I THINK THAT S ONE REASON .
WE HAVE PROBLEMS IN SCHOOLS UH AND SOME OF THEM ARE OUR PROBLEMS BUT A LOT OF IT S BECAUSE EVERYTHING .
SOCIETY WANTS WE ARE SUPPOSED TO DO .
UHHUH .
BUT THAT S ANOTHER SUBJECT BUT .
WELL THAT S PROBABLY TRUE .
W .
ANYWAY I DEALT WITH TWO OR THREE KIDS TODAY .
THAT ARE GOING TO END UP WHERE SOMEBODY HAS MAKING A DECISION .
WHAT TO DO WITH THEM .
UM YEAH I GUESS THAT S NOT AN EASY SOLUTION .
THERE S THERE S NO EASY .
UHHUH .
SOLUTION FOR THAT .
I DO NT I DO NT KNOW THAT THERE IS AN EASY SOLUTION BUT IF YOU COULD FIND A WAY TO PREVENT SOME OF IT AND I M NOT SURE WHAT .
IT WOULD BE .
UHHUH .
IT WOULD BE MONEY BETTER SPENT THAN DO YOU KNOW IT COSTS MORE TO KEEP AN INMATE ON DEATH ROW THAN IT DOES TO SEND A KID TO HARVARD .
THAT S TRUE .
I M SURE IT IS YEAH .
STATISTICALLY THAT S TRUE .
UM YEAH I DO NT I DO NT CERTAINLY CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS NT .
UHHUH .
GOING TO SOLVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS BUT .
ARE YOU FOR IT .
UH .
I M FOR IT IN .
I GUESS I AM .
IN SOME CASES .
FOR CERTAIN CRI .
YEAH .
YEAH IN CERTAIN CRIMES .
WHAT KIND OF CRIMES WOULD YOU .
D USE IT FOR .
UH PREMEDITATED MURDER .
UHHUH .
CRIMES OF THAT NATURE I THINK SHOULD DEFINITELY ANY MASS MURDERER TYPE INDIVIDUAL .
I I WOULD CONSIDER IT FOR SEXUAL ABUSE OF CHILDREN ON GOING .
UM .
YOU KNOW NOT ONE INSTANCE BUT PERPETUAL ABUSERS OF CHILDREN .
UHHUH .
WELL YOU ALWAYS HAVE CASTRATION .
WELL YOU KNOW SOMEBODY ELECTED THAT RECENTLY .
YES I READ ABOUT THAT .
AND ALL THE CIVIL RIGHTS PEOPLE ARE UP IN ARMS ABOUT IT YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
BUT UH .
UH ANYWAY WE RE SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT RECYCLING .
BASICALLY WHAT WHAT .

TEST DRIVE A CORVETTE LAST YEAR MAYBE THE YEAR BEFORE IT WAS BRAND NEW WHITE IT WAS LIKE A BIG MARSHMALLOW WHEN YOU SAT IN THE SEATS THEY ADJUSTED TO FIT AROUND YOU .
UH .
I MEAN THEY CAME IN AND UP AND OUT AND I MEAN THEY DID WHATEVER AND AND WE WENT FOR A TEST DRIVE IN THAT AND I WAS ABLE TO OPEN THAT UP PRETTY GOOD AND THAT WAS REALLY FUN AND I WANTED IT BUT I HAD A CHOICE OF THAT OR MY HOUSE AND I THOUGHT THAT I D CONTINUE .
TO LIVE IN MY HOUSE SO .
YEAH THERE THERE S SOMETHING ABOUT HAVING A PLACE TO LIVE I DO NT KNOW .
YEAH YOU KNOW IT S JUST NECESSARY AND I DID I THOUGHT WELL A TENT WOULD NT BE BAD BUT PROBABLY NOT PRACTICAL .
COULD SLEEP IN THE BACK OF THE VETTE .
YEAH RIGHT SO .
I FIND THAT UH THAT THE CORVETTES ARE ARE BECOMING REALLY REALLY NICE CARS .
THEY ARE THEY RE PRETTY ARE NT THEY LATELY .
YEAH AND .
THEY REALLY ARE .
THEY THEY VE IMPROVED .
THE PERFORMANCE AND THE SUSPENSION SUCH THAT THEY RE ACTUALLY A LOT OF FUN TO DRIVE .

YEAH I MEAN THAT YOU KNOW .
IS NT THAT A PRACTICAL VAN .
THERE S SOME THAT ARE PRETTIER THAN OTHERS AND YEAH THE NEW TYPE IS PRETTIER THAN WHAT THEIR THEY USED TO LOOK LIKE BUT I SURE DO NT THINK IT S ATTRACTIVE YOU KNOW IT S NOT LIKE LIKE DRIVING A LITTLE SPORTS CAR .
YEAH IT IT S VERY HARD TO FIND SOMETHING PRACTICAL THAT S ALSO ATTRACTIVE .
YEAH I DO NT THINK THAT HAPPENS SO BUT I I LOVE MINE SO AND I I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE I DROVE A FRIEND S IN HAWAII AND I JUST WENT HOME AND I WALKED IN AND I PICKED IT OUT AND HE SAID TAKE IT HOME AND BRING IT BACK IF YOU WANT TO AND I NEVER DID I JUST WENT BACK AND SIGNED THE PAPERS AND I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT MY CAR WHEN I GOT IT NOTHING I DID NT KNOW HOW ANYTHING WORKED .

YEAH AND I VE HAD IT IT S ALMOST THREE YEARS ACTUALLY AND I VE I STILL LOVE IT I PUT THE TOP DOWN EVERYWHERE I GO I TIMED IT WHEN I FIRST GOT IT AND IT TOOK TWENTY MIN I MEAN TWENTY SECONDS AND SO I FIGURED THERE WAS NOWHERE I WAS TO LATE TO GO THAT I DID NT HAVE TWENTY MORE SECONDS .
RIGHT .

AND AND YOU COULD NT GET HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO GO BACK UP ABOUT THE SAME TIME .
TWENTY SECONDS YEAH THAT S ALL IT TAKES I MEAN IT S JUST A BUTTON THAT S IT YOU .
YEAH SO .
RELEASE IT RIGHT AT THE TOP SO YOU DO NT HAVE TO .
SO YOU WO NT GET .
GET OUT OR ANYTHING .
YEAH AND TWENTY SECONDS YOU PROBABLY WO NT GET CAUGHT IN ANYTHING TOO SUBSTANTIAL .
WELL I DID ACTUALLY LAST WEEK GOING TO THE AIRPORT I JUST HIT A DOWNPOUR AND I WAS ON A HIGHWAY GOING LIKE EIGHTY .
SO I REALLY DID I MEAN I WAS SOAKING WET I THOUGHT I WOULD DROWN IN THE SECONDS THAT IT TOOK ME TO PULL OVER .
WHOOPS .
BUT IT ALL DRIED OUT YOU KNOW DID NT .
YEAH .
TAKE LONG WHEN THE SUN CAME OUT BUT IT WAS KIND OF FUNNY I M SURE PEOPLE AROUND ME REALLY ENJOYED IT BUT .
OH NO I WAS JUST DOWN IN AUSTIN LAST WEEK AND THE WEATHER WAS PRETTY NICE TOO SO .
OH AND WAS NT IT PRETTY LAST WEEK WITH THE BLUEBONNETS AND EVERYTHING YEAH YEAH .
WITH THE BLUEBONNETS OUT YEAH IT REALLY WAS YEAH I DECIDED THAT AUSTIN IS CERTAINLY SOMEPLACE THAT I COULD HANDLE LIVING .
YEAH A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT AND IT S PRETTY FAR FROM WHERE I LIVE .
STEVE THIS IS LIKE I MENTIONED BRIAN AND I GUESS WE RE GOING TO WANT TO BE TALKING ABOUT CHILD CARE UH DO YOU HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE IN UH FINDING CHILD CARE .
WELL OURSELVES WE HAVE I GUESS NEVER HAD TO LOOK FOR CHILD CARE .
UHHUH .
OUR KIDS ARE NOW FOURTEEN AND EIGHTEEN .
BUT UH AND SO YOU KNOW YOU GO BACK THOSE MANY YEARS AND UH WE DID NT DO IT VERY MUCH .
UHHUH .
WE I GUESS WE WERE IN A SITUATION WHERE WE DID NT NEED TO BE LOOKING AT UH TWO FAMILY INCOME AT THE TIME .
UHHUH .
AND OUR KIDS WERE OLDER BUT I VE HAD TO DEAL WITH UH YOU KNOW FRIENDS OF OURS THAT HAVE USED CHILD CARE AND THAT KIND OF THING .
RIGHT .
UH SO IT MY INVOLVEMENT HAS NT BEEN DIRECT BUT STILL HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW CERTAINLY EXPOSED TO CRITERIA PEOPLE ARE USING .
UHHUH .
HOW ABOUT YOURSELF .
WELL UH WE RE KIND OF LUCKY I I M UH I M WORKING MY WIFE IS NT WORKING AND SHE IS TAKING CARE OF THE KIDS ALSO AND AND SO WE HAVE NT HAD TO LOOK FOR CHILD CARE EITHER WHICH HAS BEEN VERY NICE BUT I DO HAVE LIKE YOU MENTIONED A LOT OF FRIENDS A LOT OF UH COWORKERS AND ASSOCIATES THAT ARE LOOKING FOR CHILD CARE AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY RE VERY CRITICAL ABOUT IS THE NUMBER OF KIDS THAT ARE IN THE CHILD CARE UH WHAT KIND OF YOU KNOW UH GUIDANCE COUNSELOR TO STUDENT OR YOU KNOW UH ADULT TO CHILD RELATIONSHIP HOW MANY .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW YOU DO NT WANT TO HAVE THIRTY OR FORTY KIDS AND ONLY ONE ADULT THEN .
RIGHT .
UH SOMETHING HAPPENS AND THE ADULT WOULD NT BE ABLE TO UH ACCOMMODATE OR TAKE CARE OF THE KIDS VERY WELL .
RIGHT .
AND UH THEY ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE KIDS ARE BEING TAUGHT AND NOT JUST PLAYING AROUND ALL THE TIME SO YOU KNOW DEPENDS ALSO UPON THE THE LEVEL OF THE CHILD WE UH WE UH TAKE A VERY CLOSE LOOK AT FINDING A A PRESCHOOL A GOOD PRESCHOOL FOR OUR KID .
UHHUH .
AND I KIND OF RELATE THAT TO THAT IN IN MAKING SURE THAT THE THE UH TEACHERS ARE VERY WELL EDUCATED THEMSELVES THEY HAVE A GOOD CURRICULUM AND THAT THEY RE WILLING TO TEACH THE KIDS AND HAVE A FUN TIME WITH THEM AND IT S VERY IMPORTANT I FEEL UH THAT THE KIDS INTERACT WITH OTHER CHILDREN ALSO IT S A IT S A GOOD WAY TO DEVELOP .
YEAH .
RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER KIDS THEIR AGE AND UH GET TO KNOW AND WORK WITH KIDS SO I DO NT KNOW I I GUESS WE RE KIND OF IN THE SAME BOAT WE HAVE NT HAD TO LOOK VERY CAREFULLY FOR CHILD CARE .
YEAH I I KIND OF THINK THAT UH YOU KNOW SOME OF OUR FRIENDS OR EVEN OUR OWN CHILDREN WILL BE IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY MAY NEED TO LOOK FOR CHILD CARE .
UHHUH .
BUT EVEN YOU KNOW HERE I GUESS WE HAVE IN ONE SENSE TWO FORMS OF UH CHILD CARE THERE S WHERE INDIVIDUALS WILL IN ONE PRIMARILY BABYSIT .
UHHUH .
CHILDREN IN THEIR OWN HOME AND THAT WILL BE GROUPS OF ANYWHERE FROM ONE OR TWO TO MAYBE SEVEN OR EIGHT CHILDREN .
UHHUH .
AND THEN OTHERWISE THERE WILL BE THE MAJORITY ARE COOPERATIVE DAYCARES UH PEOPLE FORM A COOP AND UH PARENTS WILL WORK IN THE COOP AND PUT A FAIR NUMBER OF HOURS FREQUENTLY THEY WILL HIRE STAFF TO BE AT THE DAYCARE AND THE EMPHASIS IS PRIMARILY UH SOMEPLACE FOR THE CHILDREN TO BE .
UHHUH .
BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE S SOME FAIRLY GOOD TRAINING PROGRAMS AND AND SOME OF THEM FORMAL TWO YEAR PROGRAMS .
RIGHT RIGHT .
UH SO THAT YOU KNOW THERE IS SOME DEFINITE UH CREATIVE PLAY GOOD SOCIAL INTERACTION THAT KIND OF THING .
I THINK IT S UH IMPORTANT LIKE YOU MENTIONED THAT S A GOOD IDEA ON THE UH PARENT COOP BECAUSE UH I M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE WELFARE OF MY KIDS AND I DO NT WANT TO JUST TAKE THEM TO SOMEBODY I PICK OUT OF THE YELLOW PAGES OR OUT OF SOME AD SOMEWHERE I WANT TO TRUST THE PEOPLE .
YEAH .
AND UH YOU KNOW YOU HEAR IN THE NEWSPA YOU HEAR ON THE T V AND YOU READ THE NEWSPAPER QUITE OFTEN OF OF PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW DO NT TREAT OR TAKE CARE OF YOUR KIDS THE WAY YOU THINK THEY OUGHT TO BE TAKEN CARE OF SO AND HOPE TO NEVER GET INTO THAT SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE TO HAVE TO FIND SOMEBODY AND WE HAVE TO TRUST SOMEONE WITH THE WELFARE OF OUR CHILDREN AND HOPE THAT WE CAN STAY IN THIS SITUATION FOR AWHILE SO .
YEAH YOU KNOW WE VE EVEN HAD SOME OF THOSE KINDS OF SITUATIONS PUBLICIZED HERE .
UHHUH .
AND I GUESS YOU KNOW IT ARE IT S UH TYPICALLY UH WHETHER IT S BEEN CHILD CARE IN A HOME .
UHHUH .
OR IN A LARGER SITUATION WHERE ACTUALLY IT S MORE OF AN INSTITUTION AND YOU VE ACTUALLY GOT CHILDREN THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD CONSIDER PROBLEM CHILDREN AND IT S NOT AND IT S MORE OF A GROUP HOME RATHER THAN .
YEAH .
ACTUALLY DAYCARE S TYPE OF FACILITY .
THAT S TRUE THAT S TRUE .
UH .
WELL STEVEN IT S BEEN .
WHY DO NT YOU GO AHEAD AND START .
OKAY .
WELL I THINK THE COURT SYSTEMS COULD STAND SOME IMPROVEMENT .
UH TRIAL BY JURY IS GOOD BUT A LOT OF TIME I A LOT OF CASES UH IS CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT THAT CONVICTS A PERSON WHICH .
I DO NT THINK IS ALL THE TIME GOOD .
BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT S HARD TO GET ALL THE FACTS AND TO PROVE A PERSON INNOCENT I MEAN PROVE A PERSON GUILTY IF YOU DO NT REALLY KNOW OR YOU DO NT REALLY HAVE AN EYEWITNESS .
AND HOW CAN YOU CONVICT SOMEBODY ON CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE IS BEYOND ME .
I DO NT KNOW .
SO YOU THINK IF IF TRIALS WERE HELD BY JUDGES OR EXPERTS THAT THEY THEY WOULD TEND NOT TO UH ADMIT NOT TO CONVICT PEOPLE ON CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE .
I THINK SO .
YOU KNOW I I ATTENDED A TRIAL IN UH GERMANY WHEN I WAS A STUDENT AND UH .
UHHUH .
THAT S THE SORT OF SYSTEM .
THEY HAVE .
THE TRIALS ARE HELD BY A PANEL OF THREE UH THREE OR FOUR JUDGES .
WHO ARE WELL THEY RE LIKE LAWYERS I GUESS .
THEY RE EXPERTS IN THE LAW .
RIGHT .
AND UH THERE THERE REALLY IS NT A JURY AND UH UH THEY DO THE QUESTIONING ALSO .
THE JUDGES DO THE QUESTIONING AND UH .
UHHUH .
THEY UH I I THINK IT S A LOT HARDER TO GET OFF ON TECHNICALITIES ALSO BECAUSE THEY UH UH THE JUDGE IS ALSO SORT OF A JURY UH BUT I M NOT SURE I LIKE THAT .
I THINK I PREFER THE JURY SYSTEM .
MYSELF .
YOU THINK YOU PREFER THE JURY .
YOU THINK YOUR CHANCES ARE BETTER .
UH WELL ACTUALLY I THINK IN MOST CRIMINAL CASES .
IT WOULD NT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE WHETHER IT WAS A COUPLE OF JUDGES OR JURY .
WHAT WHAT .
I WORRY ABOUT IS CASES WHERE IT S THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE INDIVIDUAL .
THAT S WHERE YOU REALLY NEED A JURY OF PEERS .
WELL THAT S TRUE .
BECAUSE UH ANYTIME TH THE GOVERNMENT UH IS THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE INDIVIDUAL .
YOU NEED SOM Y YOU NEED THE PROTECTION OF ORDINARY CITIZENS .
I THINK THAT S REALLY THE ONLY THING .
I GUESS WHERE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE SYSTEM CHANGE IS UH UH THERE OUGHT TO BE A A WELL I GUESS I DO NT THINK THAT UH UH JURIES NEED TO DECIDE SENTENCING ALL THE TIME .
UHHUH .
I THINK MAYBE TH A JUDGE IS A BETTER JUDGE OF THAT OR UH .
WELL S SOMETIMES THE SENTENCING IS STILL IS NOT FAIR .
I MEAN EVEN IF WELL THE JURY I GUESS THEY DO DECIDE THAT BUT BUT I M LIKE YOU IN A CASE LIKE THAT MOST OF THE TIME ITS I DO NT KNOW MAYBE I M TOO TOO UH UH CONSERVATIVE WHEN IT COMES TO THAT .
TH THE SENTENCING IS REALLY LIGHT COMPARED TO WHAT .
I THINK THEY SHOULD BE IN A LOT OF CASES .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW UH .
WELL IF YOU DRAG TWELVE PEOPLE INTO A COURTROOM I TRUST THEM TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION AS TO WHETHER SOMEONE S GUILTY OR INNOCENT .
THAT S USUALLY A MATTER OF WHO TO BELIEVE AND WHAT FACTS TO BELIEVE .
RIGHT .
BUT PEOPLE .
WHO .
D DO NT HAVE DAY IN AND DAY OUT LIFE LONG EXPERIENCE WITH WHAT PRISON IS REALLY LIKE AND WHAT .
THE OPTIONS ARE TO ASK THEM TO DECIDE FOR ONE CASE ON ONE PERSON BASED ON WHAT .
THEY SEE I THINK THAT IS MAYBE UH A LITTLE BIT NAIVE .
YEAH .
IN TEXAS HERE PEOPLE TEND TO GET WHIPPED UP INTO A FRENZY AND SLAP LONG SENTENCES ON PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
UH IT S KIND OF UH UH A HANGING JURY ATMOSPHERE .
RIGHT .
BUT IN A LOT OF PLACES I THINK PEOPLE BEND OVER THE OTHER WAY BUT I GUESS I GUESS I LIKE THE SYSTEM THAT THEY HAVE IN SOME PLACES WHERE THE DEFENDANT GETS TO CHOOSE WHETHER HE S GOES BEFORE A JURY FOR SENTENCING OR WHETHER THE JUDGE GETS TO CHOOSE IT .
SOME SOME CASES IN SOME JURISDICTIONS THEY CAN DO THAT .
OH REALLY .
I .
KIND OF LIKE THAT SYSTEM .
YEAH .
YEAH .
THAT S THAT S NOT A BAD SYSTEM .
BUT I I DO THINK IT NEEDS TO BE SHAKEN UP A LITTLE BIT .
YEAH .
BUT THE THING IS TOO MAYBE THEY NEED MORE OF A I DO NT KNOW MORE OF A EXPERT TYPES .
YEAH .
TO TO BE ON SOME OF THESE JURY CASES BECAUSE MOST TIME .
YOU JUST PICK YOU KNOW JOE BLOW OR WHOEVER AND A GOOD CITIZEN OR WHOEVER .
RIGHT .
AN AND CALL THEM IN .
AND LAWYERS BLOW SAND IN THEIR EYES .
MUMBLEX EXACTLY .
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MOST CIVIL CASES TRIED BEFORE A PANEL OF EXPERTS INSTEAD OF ORDINARY JURIES .
RIGHT EXACTLY .
INSURANCE CASES AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
YEAH .
WHERE AND UH THERE WOULD BE MORE HONEST SETTLEMENTS INSTEAD OF THIS UH TUGGING OF PEOPLE S HEART STRINGS AND UH .
UHHUH .
MAKING THEM CRY AND FEEL LIKE THEY RE DOING SOMEBODY GOOD BY GIVING THEM .
PUT PUTTING ON A ACT OR WHATEVER .
OR GIVING THEM .
TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO MAKE UP FOR THE PAIN AND SUFFERING .
UHHUH .
EXACTLY EXACTLY .
SO .
IN I THINK I IN CRIMINAL TRIALS YOU NEED THE JURY AS A DEFENSE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT BUT .
MUMBLEX .
WELL HERE IN LOGAN UTAH WE VE GOT A NICE LITTLE VALLEY HERE AND IT S LIKE CRYSTAL CLEAR ALL THE TIME EXCEPT FOR DURING THE WINTER WHEN THE INVERSION SETS IN AND THEN WE GET A LITTLE BIT OF POLLUTION IN THE VALLEY .
HUH .
WELL HERE IN SEATTLE UH IT .
S G THE AIR S GETTING MORE AND MORE POLLUTED .
WE RE UH WE RE IN KIND OF A BASIN .
AND UH SEATTLE IS ON PUGET SOUND .
WHICH IS A INLAND WATERWAY BETWEEN TWO MOUNTAINS .
AND UH THERE S BEEN A LOT A LOT OF GROWTH POPULATION GROWTH AROUND HERE .
AND UH IT S UH IT S GETTING WORSE .
I THINK .
YEAH .
MOST OF IT IS FROM CARS .
YEAH .
DEFINITELY .
HERE IN UTAH UP ALONG THE WASATCH MUMBLEX ALONG THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE OF THESE ROCKY MOUNTAINS HERE WHERE A LOT OF THE BIG CITIES ARE SALT LAKE AND OGDEN AND PROVO AND LOGAN S UP IN THE VALLEY .
A LITTLE BIT FURTHER NORTH WE GET A LOT OF POLLUTION AND IT .
S LIKE SEVENTY PERCENT OF IT IS FROM CARS .
UHHUH .
AND UH IT ALWAYS REALLY HITS HARD DURING THE WINTER WHEN WE GET THE INVERSION .
AND WHEN WE GET .
GET COLD AIR DOWN IN THE VALLEYS AND WARM AIR UP ABOVE AND IT JUST SITS AND SITS AND SITS AND WE RE STARTING TO HIT POLLUTION LEVELS NOW ON THE WASATCH FRONT .
WHICH MATCH THAT OF L .
A .
A FEW YEARS AGO .
OH .
IT S NOT IT S ALMOST SAD .
BECAUSE WHEN I GREW UP HERE IT WAS JUST ALWAYS THE CRISP AIR UP IN THE MOUNTAIN VALLEYS AND NOW IT S NOT IN THE MOUNTAIN VALLEYS .
YEAH .
YEAH I LIVE IN THE .
UNIVERSITY DISTRICT AND UH UH IT S SUPPOSED TO HAVE ABOUT THE WORST AIR POLLUTION .
I THINK PROBABLY DUE TO UH A LOT OF STUDENTS GOING BACK AND FORTH TO SCHOOL .
HUH .
AND THEN WE RE RIGHT NEXT TO INTERSTATE FIVE ALSO .
THEY RE GETTING SERIOUS ABOUT THINGS LIKE UH MANDATORY WELL THEY VE ALREADY PASSED LAWS WHERE YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR CARS CHECKED FOR POLLUTION IF YOU RE IN CERTAIN COUNTIES EMISSIONS .
OH YEAH .
MUMBLEX HAVE THEY STARTED DOING THAT YET .
YEAH .
THEY VE ACTUALLY STARTED DOING IT DOWN ALONG THE NOT IN LOGAN UP HERE CAUSE WE RE DOING A LOT BETTER .
WE HAVE A LOT POPULATION IS A LOT LIGHTER UP HERE .
WE HAVE THAT HERE AND UH THEY RE THEY RE EXPANDING IT TO UH MORE COUNTIES HERE .
UH AS THE POPULATION SPREADS OUT AND I THINK THEY RE ALSO GOING TO BE MAKING IT UH MANDATORY FOR MORE CARS .
TH TH THERE WAS UH SOMETHING IN THE LAW ABOUT IF YOU RE CAR WAS OVER A CERTAIN AGE LIKE OVER TWENTY YEARS OLD YOU DID NT HAVE TO GET IT DONE ANYMORE .
AND .
YEAH .
I THINK THEY RE ELIMINATING THAT UH .
YEAH .
THEY RE GE ELIMINATING THAT OUT HERE .
THAT LOOPHOLE .
YEAH .
THEY RE ALSO TALKING VERY SERIOUSLY ABOUT THE THING CALLED A DIRT GUN .
WHERE THEY RE UH LOOKING AT THE EMISSIONS FROM THE CAR USING BASICALLY A SPECTROMETER AND LOOKING AT THE BASICALLY HOW MUCH OF WHAT IS COMING OUT OF THE EXHAUST .
KIND OF LIKE A RADAR GUN .
AND .
OH REALLY YOU MEAN THEY COULD .
YES .
DO THAT REMOTELY .
YEAH .
DO IT REMOTELY JUST LOOKING AT THE WHAT .
THEY DO THEY DO SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF THINGS .
SOMETIMES THEY PUT A SOURCE LIGHT AND THEY LOOK AT THE SOURCE LIGHT AND THEN AS THE CAR GOES BY YOU CAN SEE THE EXHAUST PIPE AND THE SOURCE LIGHT BEHIND IT AND YOU CAN LOOK AT THE EMISSIONS ACTUALLY .
HUH .
AND .
NOW WHERE DOES THE SOURCE LIGHT GO .
LIKE ACROSS THE STREET .
THEY LL SET UP .
OH I SEE .
LIKE A TRAP OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN SOME SENSE .
AND THEY RE ALSO LOOKING AT UH OTHER YOU KNOW WAYS OF MONITORING THIS AND CAUSE THEY VE FOUND OUT SOMETHING BASICALLY THAT UH AND A POORLY TUNED CAR CAN EMIT SOMETHING IT S AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT .
IT WAS LIKE FOUR HUNDRED TIMES AS MUCH .
JEEZ .
UH OF CERTAIN POLLUTANTS AND IT WAS LIKE UNBURNED HYDROCARBONS THEN A PROPERLY TUNED CAR .
AND AND THE IDEA BEING THAT IF YOU JUST TUNED UP ALL THE CARS WELL IF YOU TUNED UP THIS TEN PERCENT OF THE CARS .
THAT WERE PRODUCING LIKE FIFTY PERCENT OF THE THE POLLUTION THEN YOU KNOW YOU IT D BE ONE WAY TO CUT THE POLLUTION IN HALF .
YEAH .
THAT S NEAT .
BUT IT S ALSO BEEN UH OH YOU KNOW EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT USING MORE MASS TRANSIENT HERE BUT IT UH IT S TOUGH YOU KNOW .
LIKE I VE I VE LOOKED INTO RIDING THE BUS TO WORK AND I CAN DRIVE TO WORK IN UH AND GET THERE IN TWENTY TO TWENTYFIVE MINUTES OVER A VERY CONGESTED CORRIDOR .
WHICH GOES OVER LAKE WASHINGTON ON ONE OF THE FLOATING BRIDGES .
UHHUH .
BUT IF I UH IF I TAKE THE BUS IT REQUIRES SEVERAL TRANSFERS AND IT TAKES OVER AN HOUR .
HUH .
SO SO IT .
YEAH .
AND THEY RE .
IT S IT S NOT HARD TO SEE WHY WHY I KEEP DRIVING .
AND YOU KNOW I FEEL GUILTY CAUSE .
I M DRIVING A .
OKAY .
SO FRANK WHAT UH TYPE OF UH BUDGET DO YOU OR YOUR FAMILY HAVE .
WELL UH I DO NT KNOW THAT WE REALLY HAVE A BUDGET .
I HAVE A SET AMOUNT THAT I THAT I SAVE .
ACTUALLY WELL ACTUALLY THERE IS A A WAY BUDGET OUR MONEY APPARENTLY .
THE UH MY WIFE UH HAS SO MUCH UH GETS SO MUCH TO DO SHOPPING WITH EVERY COUPLE OF WEEKS AND UH WE ALLOT EACH OF US .
SO MUCH MONEY PER WEEK FOR OUR PERSONAL STUFF GAS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND BESIDES THAT I UH YOU KNOW I HAVE A SET AMOUNT THAT I SAVE EVERY MONTH .
RIGHT .
THAT S UH SOUNDS LIKE PROBABLY A TIGHTER CONTROLLED BUDGET THAN WHAT .
I HAVE .
UHHUH .
I AM SINGLE SO .
UHHUH .
I GUESS I DO NT KNOW IF THAT S AN EXCUSE FOR NOT HAVING A TIGHT BUDGET BUT I BASICALLY .
REALLY DO NT NEED TO .
RIGHT I DO NT NEED TO .
I AM THE ONLY THAT I HAVE TO KEEP TRACK OF SO IT MAKES IT .
A LITTLE BIT EASIER .
THAT S RIGHT .
UH AND ALSO I YOU KNOW I TRY TO SAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT .
EACH MONTH AS WELL .
UHHUH .
AND UH I TRY TO TRY TO HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT .
MY EXPENSES ARE AND I AM PRETTY CONSISTENT FROM MONTH TO MONTH .
UHHUH .
AND UH WHENEVER UH I NEED TO UH WHENEVER THAT CHANGES I AM PRETTY WELL AWARE OF IT WITHOUT ACTUALLY HAVING TO MAINTAIN A BUDGET FOR IT .
RIGHT .
WELL I FOUND THAT UH YOU KNOW THINGS AS I HAVE GOTTEN OLDER I AM IN MY FIFTIES NOW BUT BEFORE WE USE TO HAVE TO HAVE TO HAVE A VERY STRICT BUDGET I HAD FOUR KIDS AND UH YOU KNOW WE PLANNED OUT HOW MUCH WE WERE GOING TO SPEND FOR FOOD AND HOW MUCH FOR FOR THIS AND FOR THAT .
KIND OF ANTICIPATE HOW MUCH THINGS WERE GOING TO BE .
UH I GUESS ONE .
INTERESTING ASPECT OF THE BUDGETING .
I DO NOW IS THAT I SET ASIDE UH I .
KIND OF FENCE OFF AREAS OF MY CHECK BOOK .
FOR INSTANCE THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT I KNOW COME UP UH EVERY SO OFTEN .
EVERY SIX MONTHS I HAVE TO PAY CAR INSURANCE .
UH EVERY SIX MONTHS I HAVE TO PAY MY TAXES .
SO .
UHHUH .
I TAKE A SET AMOUNT .
I VE GOT A MONEY MARKET ACCOUNT THAT I DO A LOT OF UH UH SAVING IN AND I ALSO HAVE GOT A CHECKING ACCOUNT BESIDES THAT BUT WHAT .
I DO ON MY MONEY MARKET ACCOUNT MY TAXES FOR INSTANCE .
WHICH AMOUNT TO AN AVERAGE OF TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS .
A MONTH .
I WILL JUST TAKE TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY OUT AND I PUT IT IN PARENTHESIS .
I TAKE IT OUT OF THE RIGHT LINE TOTAL .
UHHUH .
AND PUT IT IN PARENTHESIS IN THERE AND LET IT BUILD UP .
EVERY MONTH .
I ADD TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS TO IT .
THEN WHEN THE TAX BILL COMES IN I VE GOT THAT MUCH SET ASIDE .
RIGHT .
AND I GUESS THAT S A WAY OF BUDGETING .
YEAH .
THAT S I GUESS I .
KIND OF DO A SIMILAR THING .
MORE UH MEDIUM OR LONGER RANGE .
I JUST HAVE A MAYBE A TARGETED AMOUNT THAT I WILL SAVE FOR .
LIKE I AM PROBABLY WITHIN A YEAR .
I WOULD LIKE TO BUY A NEW CAR .
UHHUH .
SO I .
KIND OF HAVE A AN AMOUNT IN MY MIND AND I AM MAKING EVERY EFFORT TO TO SAL PUT A LITTLE BIT AWAY AND INCREASE THE AMOUNT THAT I NEED FOR A DOWN PAYMENT OR WHATEVER .
UHHUH .
YEAH .
UH CARS ARE DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO FIGURE INTO YOUR BUDGET .
NOT ONLY FOR BUYING THEM BUT FOR KEEPING THEM ON THE ROAD TOO .
RIGHT .
UH YOU KNOW WE VE GOT TWO CARS .
MY WIFE HAS A CAR AND I LIKE TO DRIVE PICK UP TRUCK .
SO WE ARE ON A SCHEDULE WHERE I TRY EVERY UH THREE OR FOUR YEARS TO TO BUY A NEW ONE .
AND YOU KNOW I AM CONSTANTLY MAKING CAR PAYMENTS BUT I FIGURE THAT S GOT TO BE THE STORY OF MY LIFE ANYWAY IS MAKING CAR PAYMENTS .
UHHUH .
SO UH YOU KNOW I GET ONE PAID FOR AND UH ACTUALLY I AM SAVING UP FOR ANOTHER ONE BESIDES SO .
HUH .
IT S YOU KNOW IT S KIND OF A NEVER ENDING THING BUT .
RIGHT .
YOU TRY TO YOU TRY TO SCHEDULE THOSE THINGS SO THAT UH YOU ONLY YOU RE NOT PAYING FOR TWO OF AT THE SAME TIME .
RIGHT .
I GUESS IS WHAT .
I AM SAYING .
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT UH LEASING .
WELL UH I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT BUT LEASING WOULD NT YOU KNOW I DO NT USE IT FOR MY BUSINESS .
I SEE .
MY WIFE USES HERS JUST FOR PLEASURE AND I USE MINE JUST TO GO BACK AND FORTH TO WORK .
RIGHT .
WHICH IS ONLY TEN MILES AWAY SO .
BUT IF YOU ARE ROLLING IT OVER EVERY THREE YEARS .
IT MIGHT BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO DO THAT .
YEAH I GUESS .
UH .
YOU KNOW TYPICALLY YOU IF YOU PURCHASE YOUR OWN CAR .
YOU TEND TO MAKE UH THE BEST RETURNS AFTER YOU PAY IT OFF .
UHHUH .
OF COURSE THE LONGER YOU KEEP IT BEYOND THAT POINT THE MORE PROFITABLE .
IT IS TO OWN IT .
YOURSELF .
RIGHT .
YEAH YOU RE RIGHT .
UH I HAVE UH BEEN KNOW TO KEEP TRUCKS OR CARS FOR OH TEN OR TWELVE YEARS BUT I FIND THAT AFTER ABOUT FOUR YEARS THEY .
KIND OF START GOING DOWN HILL AND YOU GOT TO PUT PUT STUFF IN THEM .
YOU KNOW .
THAT S RIGHT .
YEAH MINE S UH SEVEN YEARS OLD AND I THINK LAST YEAR WAS THAT WAS A ROUGH YEAR FOR IT .
I HAD A NUMBER OF EXPENSES .
UHHUH .
BUT UH I AM HOPING THAT MOST OF THEM WERE JUST KIND OF UH YOU KNOW THE AS YOU GET TO A CERTAIN NUMBER OF MILES YOU HAVE TO GET EVERYTHING REPLACED BRAKES SHOCKS AND ALL THAT .
SO I JUST WENT THROUGH THAT WHOLE SET LAST YEAR .
UHHUH .
I HOPE THAT I ONLY HAVE A SLOW PERIOD BEFORE I DO THAT AGAIN .
THOSE THINGS CAN REALLY UPSET YOUR BUDGET WHEN THEY WHEN THEY COME IN .
UH YOU KNOW IT S NICE TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT SET ASIDE FOR THE FOR THE UNEXPECTED SHALL WE SAY .
RIGHT .
SO THAT IT DOES NT UH KILL YOU .
ALL IN ONE MONTH .
RIGHT .
WHAT LINE OF WORK ARE YOU IN .
OKAY .
I SAY THEY UH PROBABLY THE BEST THINGS TO DO IS IS TIE THEM WITH A ROPE AND THROW THEM IN THE WATER IF THEY SINK .
I SEE .
A .
THEY RE INNOCENT RIGHT .
A GOOD A GOOD SOUTHERN SOLUTION .
YEAH .
UH SO UH HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU FEEL .
TH THAT S OF COURSE BEING FACETIOUS BUT .
UHHUH .
YOU D HAVE TO SAY THAT .
UH I DO NT KNOW .
THE THE THINGS THEY ASKED TO TALK ABOUT WERE WHETHER THE UH WHETHER THE JUDGE SHOULD BE THE ONE .
THAT DOES THE UH SENTENCING .
UHHUH .
AND SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT S I THINK THAT S THE WAY .
IT S DONE NOW .
UH AT LEAST .
MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE LAW .
WHICH IS NT VERY GOOD .
UHHUH .
UH IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE JUDGE DOES IT AND I I THINK THAT S PROBABLY ALL RIGHT IN THAT THEY YOU KNOW MAYBE KNOW WHAT .
THE THE NORM IS .
UHHUH .
FOR A PARTICULAR THING .
AND I GUESS ALSO WHAT .
THE SYSTEM WILL ABSORB .
RIGHT .
PROBABLY MORE TUNED IN TO THAT .
POSSIBLY THOUGH ON UH CAPITAL CASES LIKE MAYBE THE DEATH PENALTY .
UHHUH .
UH I M KIND OF UNDECIDED ON THAT WHETHER THE JUDGE SHOULD HAVE THE SOLE I MEAN HE COULD HAVE LIKE A PERSONAL PREJUDICE .
YOU KNOW JUDGES ARE PEOPLE LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE .
THAT S RIGHT .
EVEN THOUGH THEY RE THEY RE SUPPOSED TO BE IMPARTIAL BUT MAYBE UH .
AND I THINK THAT MAY I THAT MAY BE AN EXCEPTION AS WELL .
BECAUSE I THINK THAT DOES NT THE JURY DECIDE ON THE DEATH PENALTY RATHER THAN THAN THE JUDGE .
I I THINK THAT S I THINK THAT S THE WAY .
IT IS .
YEAH .
UH WHETHER THEY THEY DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THEY UH THE ACCUSED OR WHATEVER WOULD GET THE UH GET THE DEATH PENALTY .
DO THEY HAVE A DEATH PENALTY IN CALIFORNIA .
YES .
IN .
YEAH .
FACT THEY RE GOING TO EXECUTE SOMEBODY AT THE END OF THIS MONTH .
UHHUH .
AND UH THERE S A BIG UPROAR GOING ON RIGHT NOW .
UH .
YEAH .
THE UH GOVERNOR YOU KNOW HAS BEEN TRYING TO DECIDE WHETHER HE S GOING TO COMMUTE IT OR NOT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW IT S SOMEONE .
WHO HAD UH .
KILLED TWO TEENAGE BOYS HERE IN SAN DIEGO AS A MATTER OF FACT .
YEAH .
I SOMETHING LIKE THAT I VE GOT NO PROBLEM WITH IT .
UH .
YEAH .
I GUESS THE WAY .
I THINK ABOUT IT IS NOT IT SHOULD NT NECESSARILY BE THOUGHT OF AS REVENGE .
IT S JUST LIKE IF YOU VE GOT LIKE A DOG .
THAT S RUNNING WILD AND BITING PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
PUT IT TO SLEEP YOU KNOW .
JUST GET IT OUT YOU KNOW IT S NOT ABLE TO FIT IN YOU KNOW .
SOMETHING INEXPENSIVE .
YEAH .
YEAH EXACTLY .
UH I GUESS .
KIND OF THE WAY .
I THINK ABOUT IT ALSO IS THEY JUST IF SOMEBODY GETS THE DEATH PENALTY THEY RE THEY RE JUDGED GUILTY THEY GOT THE DEATH PENALTY THEY SHOULD HAVE ONE YEAR AND ONE APPEAL .
COVER ALL THEIR BASES WITH ONE APPEAL AND IF NOT YOU KNOW DO NT DO NT LET THEM SIT UP THERE ON DEATH ROW FOR YOU KNOW FIFTEEN YEARS .
YEAH .
I THINK THIS PARTICULAR CASE HAS BEEN LIKE TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS .
UHHUH .
YEAH THAT .
BUT I GUESS THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL CASES WHERE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN EXECUTED BY MISTAKE AND .
YEAH .
OH I M SURE .
YOU D HATE TO BE ONE OF THOSE .
YEAH .
THE OTHER THING .
THEY ASKED ABOUT WAS WHETHER UH UH THE VERDICT SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE UNANIMOUS .
UHHUH .
WHICH AGAIN I THINK IS THE WAY .
IT IS NOW .
THAT ALL THE ALL VERDICTS WELL MAYBE NOT .
I DO NT KNOW .
AT LEAST IN CAPITAL CASES I D THINK THEY D HAVE TO BE .
I BELIEVE IT IS .
UNANIMOUS .
IN CAPITAL .
I THINK IN LIKE UH LESSER CASES .
IT .
S LIKE TEN OUT OF TWELVE OR FIVE OUT OF SIX WHATEVER .
UHHUH .
HOW EVER MANY IS ON SITTING ON A JURY .
I T I BELIEVE THAT S THE WAY .
IT IS .
BUT I M PRETTY SURE YOU RE CORRECT ON CAPITAL CASES .
UH .
YEAH .
THE PAPER HERE TONIGHT HAD A THING ABOUT THE NORIEGA TRIAL .
UHHUH .
AND THAT THERE S ONE .
JUROR .
THAT IS IS UH DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER ELEVEN .
YEAH .
AND UH THEY VE ONLY DELIBERATED FOUR HOURS OR .
SOMETHING AND THEY SAY THEY RE HOPELESSLY DEADLOCKED .
OH NO .
AND THE JUDGE TOLD THEM .
THEY WERE NT HOPELESSLY DEADLOCKED YET .
I M TELLING YOU GO ONE WAY OR THE OTHER .
THAT THAT S PROBABLY AN EXPENSIVE TRIAL .
UH .
YEAH .
SIX MONTHS SO FAR THEY SAID .
YEAH .
PROBABLY .
SO .
YEAH .
PROBABLY .
YOU KNOW I M NOT SURE THERE S A NUMBER .
IT S PROBABLY LIKE THIRTY FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS .

OURS DID NT .
UHHUH .
AND THE ONES .
THAT WOULD OPEN UH WOULD NT WANT TO STAY OPEN .
THEY WANTED .
UHHUH .
TO SLAM SHUT .
UHHUH .
AND THEY ALSO THERE THEY THEY A LOT OF VIBRATION AND IT CAUSES THE GLASS TO CRACK AND IT S .
UHHUH .
A NEVER ENDING PROBLEM .
UHHUH .
YEAH .
SO .
SO I HAVE NT UH I HAVE NT BEEN IN ANY REALLY HOME REPAIR THINGS LATELY .
I .
SEE WH WHEN YOU RE WITH A BIG COMPANY OR A BIG ORGANIZATION A LOT OF TIMES UH YOU KNOW THE BENEFITS ARE GOOD AND AND YOU KNOW THE PAY IS REGULAR BUT UH YOU KNOW SOMETIMES YOU DO NT GET TUNED IN TO WHAT S GOING ON .
AND I I THINK THE BIGGEST BENEFIT OR THE BIGGEST BENEFIT OTHER THAN WAGES .
THAT THAT UH THAT ANYBODY COULD GET IN IN DEALING WITH A LARGE COMPANY IS TO BE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU YOU GET TO KNOW WHAT S GOING ON .
AND MAYBE THAT S THAT S PROBABLY THE TOUGHEST THING IN THE WHOLE WORLD TO TO DO .
WHAT S WHAT S YOUR FEELING ABOUT BENEFITS .
WHAT SORT OF BENEFITS WOULD YOU LIKE TO GET FROM A BIG COMPANY .
WELL SINCE I M KIND OF ON THE THE OLDER SIDE YOU KNOW I I I JUST FEEL LIKE UH WHEN I START TALKING ABOUT BENEFITS I TALK ABOUT I M CONCERNED ABOUT MEDICAL BENEFITS .
UH MY UH MY HUSBAND WORKS FOR MCDONALD DOUGLAS AND SO HIS BENEFITS HIS MEDICAL BENEFITS ARE SO EXCELLENT YOU KNOW THAT S REALLY GREAT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW I WORK FOR UH WES A BANK WESTERN FINANCIAL .
UHHUH .
AND UH THEY DO NT LET ME KNOW REALLY ABOUT ANYTHING .
THAT S GOING ON .
EVEN SOME OF THE IMMEDIATE THINGS THAT I NEED TO KNOW I DO NT KNOW IT UNTIL THE NEXT HOUR AND ALL OF A SUDDEN .
WE KNOW WE VE GOT CHANGES MADE .
WE RE CHANGING DEPARTMENTS .
WE RE CHANGING POLICIES .
WE RE CHANGING DOING OTHER KINDS OF THINGS .
WHICH TO ME IS IS DISTURBING .
I MEAN I FEEL LIKE IF I I DO NT NECESSARILY NEED TO UH BE INVOLVED SINCE I M PRETTY MUCH ON A LOW LEVEL YOU ARE YOU ARE RIGHT THERE .
YOU KNOW I M PRETTY MUCH ON A LOW LEVEL AS FAR AS UH THE COMPANY IS CONCERNED .
BUT I I DO KIND OF LIKE TO KNOW WHAT S GOING ON AND WHAT S HAPPENING AND I THINK I CAN BE A BETTER AND MORE EFFECTIVE EMPLOYEE IF IF I .
WELL TH I .
HAD A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION ALONG THAT LINE .
I WELL I WORK FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND UH ACTUALLY I WORK FOR THE F B I .
OH MY GOSH .
AND UH AND SO YOU KNOW WE WE DO NT THERE .
S LOTS OF THINGS THAT WE DO NT GET TOLD .
FOR GOOD REASON .
BUT UH BUT BASICALLY UH THERE .
S LOTS OF THINGS .
THAT THAT WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT PROJECTS .
I M AN ENGINEER .
YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
I M I M A COTR .
AND SOMETIM AND I I WORKED IN THE SAME LAB WITH A GUY AND WE DID NT REALLY KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT EACH OTHER .
S PROJECTS FOR TWO YEARS .
AND WE SHOULD HAVE YOU KNOW WE RE WE RE NOW COLLABORATING .
OH .
AND MUMBLEX .
AND IT IT .
FOR TWO YEARS WE DID NT .
AND WE WHICH WAS A KIND OF STUPID .
BUT UH BUT OUR ORGANIZATION IS DOING SOMETHING ELSE T ON MONDAY .
UH WE RE HAVING A FOR ALL UNCLASSIFIED PROGRAMS WE RE WE RE HAVING LITTLE TABLES PUT UP IN FRONT OF MUMBLEX LAB IN THE HALLWAYS AND EVERY ALL THE OTHER EMPLOYEES ARE GOING TO COME AROUND AND SEE WHAT SORT OF THINGS WE DO .
WHICH .
I THOUGHT WAS KIND OF INTERESTING AND .
YEAH THAT IS INTERESTING .
BUT UH BUT THAT THAT SORT SORT OF THING .
BUT IF YOU I THINK YOU CAN TOLERATE A LOT OF PROBLEMS IF YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT S GOING ON .
EXACTLY .
AND AND BUT OF COURSE MOST TIME MOST OF THE TIME MANAGEMENT HAS A HARD TIME DISTRIBUTING OR GETTING THE WORD OUT TO THE PEOPLE .
WHO MUST KNOW .
AND YOU KNOW IF YOU DO NT REALLY COUNT .
IF YOU RE NOT PART OF THE PROGRAM .
YOU MIGHT NOT GET TOLD FOR MONTHS .
OR YOU MIGHT YOU KNOW IF IT DOES NT IMPACT YOU DIRECTLY .
OR IF YOUR MANAGEMENT DOES NT THINK THAT .
BUT BUT REGARD TO BENEFITS .
YOU KNOW MOST COMPANIES HAVE MOST BIG ORGANIZATIONS HAVE DECENT YOU KNOW BENEFITS LIKE RETIREMENT AND THAT SORT OF THING .
IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR .
I WOULD THINK THAT ONE OF THE MAJOR UH SITUATIONS ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU REACH YOU KNOW THE THE MIDFIFTIES WA IS KEEPING A JOB UNTIL YOU RETIRE .
A RIGHT .
AND ENGINEERS ARE UH ARE BAGGAGE TO MOST UH UH AS THEY GET OLDER TO TO MOST COMPANIES .
AND UH IT S VERY MUCH LIKE THE MILITARY IT WINDOWS OUT .
YOU KNOW YOU YOU THINK WELL BOY I M GETTING MORE MONEY AND I M GETTING MORE RESPONSIBILITY I M DOING THIS .
BUT AS YOU CLIMB UP THAT TREE PRETTY SOON YOU RE THE THE BRANCHES GET SMALLER ON THE TOP OF THE TREE .
UHHUH .
AND PRETTY SOON SOMEBODY FALLS OFF .
I I VE FALLEN OFF TWICE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR .
OH .
AND UH AND YOU KNOW I CAN GET UP .
I KNOW .
IT IT SEEMS TO BE BE KIND OF KIND OF SCARY YOU KNOW .
BECAUSE YOU THINK OF UH SEE MY SON S EIGHTEEN RIGHT NOW AND HE HE S UH HE WANTS TO GO INTO ENGINEERING .
AND THE THE THE BRANCHES OF ENGINEERING THAT HE WANTS TO GO INTO IS NOW KIND OF OPEN AND HE S INTERESTED IN BASICALLY THREE DIFFERENT AREAS .
BUT UH IT S DIFFICULT FOR ME TO TRY TO GIVE HIM .
ANY KIND OF ADVICE OR TO ADVISE HIM OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT .
HE NEEDS TO DO HIS OWN COURSE OF INVESTIGATION AND AND SEE WHAT .
HE CAN DO BECAUSE WHO KNOWS WHAT S GOING TO HAPPEN IN ANOTHER THIRTY YEARS .
UHHUH .
YEAH .
AND IN THIRTY YEARS .
IT BECOMES PRETTY CRITICAL .
I MEAN MY UH BROTHERINLAW IS LIKE UH I MEAN HE S SIXTY .
HE S NOT READY TO RETIRE BUT HIS COMPANY IS IS UH IS UH CLOSING UP .
UHHUH .
AND BECAUSE OF THE DEFENSE CUTBACKS AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF .
AND ALL THE NUCLEAR AND STUFF .
WHICH IS WHAT .
HE WHAT .
HE WAS WORKING ON .
HE .
S GETTING CUT BACK AND HE S NOT READY TO RETIRE .
YEAH HE MAY BE RETIRED .
OKAY ERIC .
UH ARE YOU MARRIED AND DO YOU HAVE A FAMILY .
UH YES I AM TO UH BOTH .
QUESTIONS .
OKAY AND DO YOU AND YOUR WIFE HAVE A BUDGET PLAN FOR YOUR FINANCES .
UH YEAH WE DO .
WE UH UH BASICALLY THERE S THE YOU KNOW THE EXPENSES .
THAT ARE FIXED DURING THE MONTH .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THE ONES .
THAT COME EVERY EVERY MONTH AND WE UH ENTER THOSE INTO UH INTO A SPREAD SHEET AND UH WHATEVER IS LEFT UH AFTER THAT WE .
YOU KNOW WE SIT DOWN AND AGREE ON KIND OF WHAT WHAT SORT OF RANGE .
WE ARE GOING TO .
UHHUH .
GENERALLY GOING TO SHOOT FOR .
I SEE .
UH .
SO WHAT DO YOU DO .
WELL THAT S BASICALLY WHAT .
WE DO .
UH ABOUT EVERY EVERY THREE MONTHS OR SO WE .
REEVALUATE OUR BUDGET AND WE SIT DOWN AND JUST WRITE FROM THE LARGEST BILLS DOWN TO THE SMALLEST .
UHHUH .
AND THEN WE .
DIVVY .
THEM UP BETWEEN OUR FOUR PAY CHECKS .
I WORK PART TIME AT NIGHT .
WOW .
AND HE WORKS AND MY HUSBAND WORKS FULL TIMES DAYS AND SO WE HAVE FOUR CHECKS BUT THAT WORKS OUT NICE BECAUSE WE GET PAID EVERY WEEK AND .
YEAH .
SO THAT DOES HELP .
THAT HELPS A LOT .
AND THEN UH WE DO NT HAVE A LOT EX EXTRA FOR EXTRA SPENDING .
SO IT S PRETTY WELL EAR MARKED .
YEAH .
ALL ALLOCATED OUT .
YEAH .
YEAH .
YEAH .
EVERY PENNY IS EAR MARKED BUT UH IT WE HAVE FOUND THAT WORKS THE BEST AND AND SO IF WE CAN JUST DIVIDE THEM UP ALL THE MAJOR BILLS UP .
IN FACT WE FOUND IT EASIER TO DIVIDE THE MAJOR BILLS UP YOU KNOW CUT THE HOUSE PAYMENT IN HALF AND CUT THE LOAN PAYMENT IN HALF BUT AND DIVIDE THOSE UP BETWEEN ALL UHHUH .
ALL THE CHECKS YEAH .
AND SO WE ARE NOT TAKING A HUGE SUM OUT OUT OF ONE AND THEN THE NEXT PAY CHECK WE RE REAL SHORT OR .
RIGHT .
YEAH WE FOUND THAT UH .
IT S DEFINITELY HELPED UH GET A HANDLE ON KIND OF THE UNNECESSARY EXPENSES .
THAT S TRUE .
WE WERE BEFORE WE STARTED DOING THAT KIND OF A THING WE WERE UH SPENDING UH MONEY FOR THINGS .
THAT YOU KNOW WE .
KIND OF TENDED TO EAT OUT A BIT MORE .
UHHUH .
THAN WE SHOULD HAVE .
AND IT WAS EASY TO UH LET THINGS GET OUT OF HAND .
WE THOUGHT IT UH THOUGHT IT TO BE REALLY HELPFUL .
WE HAVE GOTTEN SOME OF OUR LOANS PAID OFF REALLY .
YEAH .
BECAUSE OF THIS AND STUFF LIKE THAT SO .
WELL IT HELPS YOU TO FOCUS WHERE YOUR MONEY GOES .
YEAH .
AND AND I AM SURE YOU FELT THE .
THE SAME FRUSTRATION BEFORE YOU GOT ON A BUDGET BUT YOU RE WONDERING MY WHEN YOU PUT DOWN ALL THE MONEY THAT YOU DO BRING IN AND THEN YOU RE SAYING MY WORD WHERE DID ALL THAT MONEY .
THAT S A LOT OF MONEY BUT .
GO .
WHERE DOES IT GO .
YEAH .
UH .
BUT .
AND ALSO WE HAVE FOUND THAT IF WE WRITE DOWN AND WE DID THIS .
WE ARE NOT REAL CONSISTENT WITH THIS BUT WE DID IT FOR ABOUT A MONTH AND WE WROTE DOWN EVERYTHING THAT WE BOUGHT WHEN YOU KNOW EVERY PAY CHECK .
UHHUH .
AND SO WE COULD SEE WHERE EVERY PENNY WENT AND IT WAS REALLY INTERESTING TO SEE JUST WHAT .
YOU DO SPEND AND LIKE I SAY WE HAVE NT BEEN REAL CONSISTENT WITH IT .
IT S WE SHOULD CAUSE IT DOES HELP .
YEAH THE OTHER THE OTHER THING THAT THAT WE VE FOUND THAT HELPS IS YOU KNOW WE TEND TO FUDGE ON THE BUDGET .
A LITTLE BIT .
UHHUH .
IT S JUST TO UH UH GET UP THE MONEY IN ADVANCE AND PUT IT IN UH UH SO LONG AS IT WAS NT YOU KNOW UNREASONABLY HIGH BUT FOR THINGS LIKE FOOD EXPENSES .
UHHUH .
OR WHATEVER .
JUST PUT IT IN UH .
IN AN ENVELOPE OR WHATEVER AND THAT WAY .
IT .
KIND OF FORCED US TO UH STICK TO THAT AMOUNT .
WEL JUST STICK TO THAT UHHUH .
THAT IS .
AND THEN ONCE THAT WAS GONE WELL .
IF THE ENTERTAINMENT AMOUNT WAS GONE .
YEAH .
THAT .
FOR THE MONTH SAY OH IT S GONE .
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A REALLY GOOD IDEA .
SO .
AND IT REALLY HELPFUL .
UH HAVE YOU DEVELOPED A SAVINGS PLAN OR I R .
A S OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT YET .
WE WE HAVE NT .
WE .
OUR OUR INITIAL GOAL WAS JUST TO RETIRE DEBT UH COMPLETELY RETIRE DEBT FOR CAR PAYMENTS AND .
OH UHHUH .
CREDIT CARD .
UHHUH .
UH CREDIT CARD DEBT AND ALL OF THAT .
WE ARE JUST AT A POINT WHERE WHERE WE COULD START THINKING ABOUT IT SO .
OH THAT S GOOD .
THAT S A GOOD FEELING .
YEAH .
WELL I .
MY HUSBAND JUST GRADUATED FROM THE UNIVERSITY UH A YEAR AGO .
UHHUH .
SO FINALLY .
A STUDENT .
FINALLY WE ARE GETTING TO THAT POINT TOO .
SO ARE YOU STILL GOING TO SCHOOL OR .
YEAH I AM ACTUALLY IN THE IN THE MAS .
WELL HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT TRIAL BY JURY .
I FEEL VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH TRIALS BY JURIES RECENTLY .
UH .
IN WHAT WAY .
IN THAT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THEY ARE SWAYED MORE BY EMOTION THAN UH BY EVIDENCE .
THAT S PRESENTED .
I HAVE UH VERY LITTLE REGARD FOR THE LAW .
PRESENTLY PRACTICED .
OH DO DO YOU FEEL THEY ARE SWAYED MORE TOWARD ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT WITH CRIMINAL OR CIVIL SUITS .
I WAS THINKING PRIMARILY CRIMINAL CASES .
SO DO YOU THINK THAT I MEAN THE .
THE STEREOTYPICAL BLEEDING HEART JURIES .
YES .
WHERE THEY FEEL SORRY .
UHHUH .
THAT S A CONCERN OF MINE .
UH I WOULD FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE IN MANY CASES I THINK WITH JUDGES .
UH YOU KNOW DOING THE SENTENCING .
UHHUH .
THE OTHER THING THE ONLY THING .
THAT REALLY BOTHERS ME ABOUT THAT IS I THINK YOU KNOW THAT A JUDGE CAN BE I I LIKE THE IDEA OF JURIES OF YOUR PEERS .
UHHUH .
UH IN THAT .
YOU YOU YOU GET MORE PERSONALLY MORE THAN ONE PERSON MAKING THE MAKING A DECISION .
AND SECOND OF ALL YOU GET A WIDE VARIETY OF BACKGROUND SO THAT .
YEAH MY QUESTION .
I GUESS ARE THEY REALLY YOUR PEERS .
UHHUH .
I D .
UH .
AGREE WITH THAT .
THAT S DEFINITELY A PROBLEM .
UH TOO OFTEN I THINK THEY ARE NOT .
UHHUH .
AND UH WHEN YOU WHEN YOU ARE SELECTING A JURY AND YOU ARE DOING IT PARTIALLY IF IF NOT ENTIRELY ON THE BASIS OF WHICH COLOR REPRESENTATION .
YOU HAVE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THAT IS A MATTER OF CONCERN TO ME TOO .
UH I THINK THAT UH IN SUCH CASES UH THEY ARE NOT REALLY LOOKING FOR UNBIASED PEOPLE BUT RATHER FOR BIASED .
UHHUH .
UH NOW I HAPPEN TO KNOW SEVERAL JUDGES AND THERE IS ONE THAT I WOULD FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE BUT HAS ME DOING SENTENCING WITHOUT THE JURY .
I WOULD FEEL A LITTLE BIT UNEASY ABOUT .
UHHUH .
BUT THE OTHER TWO .
I FEEL UH WOULD GIVE EITHER YOU KNOW THE PLAINTIFF OR FOR THE DEFENDANT .
THE .
THE FULL BENEFIT OF THE LAW .
UHHUH .
AND I GUESS THAT S WHAT .
I AM CONCERNED WITH .
YEAH YEAH .
I GUESS I I DEFINITELY AGREE WITH YOU BUT SIN THE WELL WHAT .
I DO NT LIKE ABOUT UH SENTENCE THE JURY DOING THE SENTENCING .
UHHUH .
IN THAT I THINK IT BECOMES A LOT LESS THE THE SAME CRIME GETS UNEQUAL SENTENCES .
THIS IS VERY TRUE .
I UH I THINK THERE IS MORE OF AN ABILITY OF YOU KNOW YOU KNOW FOR SELECTING A JURY TWO DIFFERENT JURIES .
THAT WOULD MOST OF THE TIME COME UP WITH THE SAME IDEA UH THE SAME IDEA VERSUS YOU KNOW WHETHER HE IS GUILTY .
UHHUH .
OR INNOCENT .
UHHUH .
BUT I THINK I THINK THERE WOULD BE A LARGE VARIATION IN IN TRYING TO GAGE THE .
THE SEVERITY OF THE CRIME AND AN APPROPRIATE PUNISHMENT AND HAVE THAT THAT MEASURE STICK ACROSS THE BOARD .
YEAH AND YOU DO SEE SUCH UNEVEN SENTENCING .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW EVIDENCE OF IT IN THE NEWSPAPERS AND SUCH I MEAN .
UHHUH .
WHERE UH IT WOULD APPEAR THE CRIMES WERE VERY SIMILAR BUT ONE INDIVIDUAL GOT TWENTYFIVE YEARS AND THE OTHER ONE WAS SENTENCED TO LIFE .
SO .
UHHUH .
UH .
OF COURSE .
A LOT OF THAT S ALSO THE ABILITY OF OF THE DEFENDANT TO UH GET A GOOD LAWYER .
IS NT THAT THE TRUTH .
UHHUH .
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN IS IT UH OH GOODNESS MY MIND HAS GONE BLANK .
IT S UH OTHELLO .
YOU KNOW WHERE HE SAYS KILL ALL THE LAWYERS .
EVERY NOW AND THEN ONE IS TEMPTED TO SEE WHAT WHAT .
YEAH I AGREE .
BUT I IT S TAKEN ME .
A LONG TIME TO UNDERSTAND THAT UH LAWYERS ARE CONCERNED WITH THE LAW AND NOT WITH JUSTICE .
UHHUH .
AS WE THINK OF YOU KNOW AS AS .
UHHUH .
NOVICES TEND TO THINK THAT UH ATTORNEYS CARE ABOUT JUSTICE .
OH YEAH I I AGREE WITH IT YEAH .
THEY WILL ADMIT TO YOU THAT THEY CAN DO NT HAVE THE BENEFIT OF BEING ABLE TO YOU KNOW OF OF LETTING ALLOWING THEMSELVES TO BELIEVE THEIR CLIENTS .
THAT ARE GUILTY .
UHHUH .
IT S MORE OF THE GAME PLAN OF HOW DO THEY CONVINCE THE JUDGE OR JURY THROUGH ARGUMENT .
AND .
THAT THE .
THEY ARE VERY EFFECTIVE TOO .
UHHUH .
UH EVEN I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED UH JUST SLI SLIGHTLY IN A CASE WHERE I KNOW THE PERSON IS GUILTY .
UHHUH .
BUT UH HIS ATTORNEYS GOTTEN HIM OFF .
UHHUH .
UH THE CITY HAS DROPPED THEIR CHARGES AGAINST HIM BECAUSE THEIR THE ATTORNEY HAS PRESENTED ENOUGH EVIDENCE OF DOUBT TO CONVINCE THE JUDGE .
SO I DO NT KNOW .
YEAH .
UH THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF THE SUBJECT BUT ONE ONE THING THAT I REALLY DISLIKE UH ALSO THAT S THAT S NEW IS THE UH IS THAT I HAVE HEARD THAT THERE ARE FEDERAL SENTENCES .
AN INTERESTING TOPIC .
YES .

YEAH AND THEY RE NOT THAT EXPENSIVE .
NO THEY RE NOT .
YEAH .
THEY RE PROBABLY MUMBLEX .
MAINLY BECAUSE EVERYONE MAKES THEM YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
YOU CAN TAKE YOUR CHOICE OF HOW EXPENSIVE YOU WANT IT TO BE .
YEAH AND WE WE DO A LOT OF UH DRIVING WE DO A LOT OF TRAVELING .
UHHUH .
BY CAR AND SO THAT S THE ONLY TIME THAT THE THAT THE UH CONVERSION VAN CAME IN HANDY BUT IT REALLY DID NT CAUSE OUR OUR KIDS ARE STILL LITTLE .
UHHUH .
SO UH THAT WAS THE ONLY TIME WE REALLY NEEDED IT OTHER THAN THAT IT GOT TERRIBLE MILEAGE AND .
YEAH YEAH MINIVANS D DO PRETTY WELL .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW TWENTY TWENTY TWENTYFIVE MILES PER GALLON OR MORE .
YEAH .
SOME OF THEM PROBABLY EVEN DO THIRTY .
YEAH .
THE UH YEAH THERE THERE S SOME OTHER CARS I D LIKE BUT I U U I WOULD NEVER BE WILLING TO SEND QUITE THAT MUCH MONEY FOR UH LIKE UH UH I LL DROOL OVER THEM .
WELL ANYWAY I UH I UH OH YEAH .
I DID FORGET TO ASK YOU .
WHAT IS YOUR NAME BY THE WAY .
UH I M ANN .
OH YOU RE ANN .
HI .
BUT UH ANYWAY I UH LOT OF LOT OF INTERESTING PROCEDURAL THINGS I THINK WOULD BE A GOOD BE A GOOD CHANGE IF WE RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THE SUBJECT T TONIGHT WHICH IN SOME .
I GUESS CRIMINAL COURTS .
THE .
CRIMINAL COURTS .
YES .
YEAH .
TH THE ONE OF WHICH WAS UH SOMETHING SOMETHING .
THAT S BEEN GOING ON BECAUSE OF THE RODNEY KING TRIAL HERE IN TOWN AND THAT IS UH AND THAT IS THE EXCLUSION OF JURORS BECAUSE OF OR IN SPITE OF THEIR RACE .
UH .
OH REALLY .
YEAH .
WELL THEY THEY UH THE THE PEOPLE .
THAT MUMBLEX THE UH THE JURY .
THAT S TRYING UH THE OFFICERS IN THAT CASE .
UHHUH .
IS IS AN ALL WHITE PANEL .
AND THERE S BEEN A LOT MADE IN THE LOCAL PAPERS OF THAT .
I SEE .
FACT .
I CA NT I M A LITTLE SURPRISED THEY DID NT GET A CHANGE OF VENUE ON THAT ONE .
THEY HAVE .
THEY HAVE .
THEY MOVED IT UP TO THE COUNTY NORTH OF HERE .
OH .
UM IT S IN VENTURA AND THERE S THERE S STILL QUITE A BIT OF PUBLICITY OBVIOUSLY AND IT S KIND OF IT S KIND OF DEBATABLE WHETHER YOU COULD GET A FAIR TRIAL ALMOST ANYWHERE BECAUSE THAT UH THAT .
WELL THAT VIDEOTAPE WAS JUST HORRIBLE .
YEAH .
IT WAS EVERYWHERE .
YES .
SO YOU KNOW AND I I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND SOMEONE UH FIND A PANEL .
THAT WOULD BE NOT HAVE SEEN IT AND AND KNOWN OF WHAT WAS GOING ON .
OH I AGREE WITH YOU BUT I CA NT IMAGINE THAT THEY WOULD DO AN ALL WHITE JURY WITHOUT HAVING SOME SORT OF OF DISCRIMINATION OR OR YOU KNOW UH APPEAL ON NOT HAVING A JURY OF HIS PEERS AND ALL OF THAT KIND OF STUFF .
EXACTLY .
YOU KNOW UM THE .
YOU KNOW I I M KIND OF TORN ON THIS ISSUE .
IT .
S LIKE THEY RE SAYING WELL ON THE ONE HAND .
THEY RE NOT HE S NOT GETTING A JURY OF HIS PEERS .
WHICH IS IN SOME WAYS I THINK TRUE .
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IT S IT S ALSO SAYING THAT WHITE JURORS ARE NOT GOING TO ARE NOT GOING TO CONVICT .
RIGHT .
UH YOU KNOW THEY RE NOT GOING TO DO THEIR JOB .
WHICH IS THE WHOLE THE WHOLE POINT OF BEING ON A JURY IS TO CONVICT OR OR OR UH LET GO BASED ON WHETHER .
EXACTLY .
OR NOT THE PERSON WHETHER OR NOT THE EVIDENCE SAYS .
BASED ON FACT .
RIGHT .
THAT THERE S ENOUGH .
HOW INTERESTING .
OH .
SO WHAT S THE PREVAILING THOUGHT WITHIN THE COMMUNITY .
UM .
I MEAN YOU KNOW WHAT .
THE NEWS MEDIA IS GOING TO MAKE OF IT BUT WHAT ABOUT THE COMMUNITY .
THEY WELL I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON WHO .
YOU TALK TO .
I HAVE NT TALKED TO UH I HAVE NT TALKED TO A WHOLE LOT OF BLACK PEOPLE ON IT BUT I I RATHER IMAGINE THERE S THERE S SOME SNICKERING ABOUT IT .
AND A LOT OF THE USUALLY FATALISTIC UH HERE WE GO AGAIN FOLKS .
UHHUH .
KIND OF STUFF .
OH MY GOODNESS .
THAT CA NT BE GOOD FOR LOS ANGELES EITHER .
NO NO .
I YOU KNOW ON ON ON ONE HAND .
YOU KNOW ON THE ONE HAND .
YOU ALMOST HOPE THAT THEY CONVICT THEM BECAUSE IT S SM THEY HAVE THAT VERY STRONG PIECE OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE SHOWING .
OH EXACTLY .
THESE PEOPLE BEATING THE HECK OUT OF THIS GUY .
UM .
UNFORTUNATELY THAT KIND OF THING IS NOT LIMITED TO A BIG CITY LIKE LOS ANGELES .
YOU RE GOING TO HAVE IT JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE .
UHHUH .
THERE .
WELL .
BUT THAT S THAT S INTERESTING .
YEAH .
UM .
WHAT ABOUT THE JUDGE .
WHO S HEARING THE CASE .
IS HE GOING TO BE IMPARTIAL .
IS HE GOING TO .
BE A GO A GOOD ADJUDICATOR .
I DO NT KNOW .
YOU KNOW AND AND AGAIN THERE S SOMETHING ELSE THA YOU KNOW THERE WAS A UH SOMETHING ELSE ALONG THOSE LINES .
THERE WAS A GIRL OUT HERE NAMED LATAUSHA HARLINS .
I DO NT KNOW IF IT S IT S GOT IT S GOT AS MUCH NOTORIETY BUT IT S RATHER ALMOST AS INFAMOUS HERE AS IT WAS AS IT WAS WITH UH THE RODNEY KING PROBLEM .
UM A GIRL WALKED INTO A KOREAN OWNED STORE AND UH THEY SHE HAD A DISPUTE BLACK GIRL .
UHHUH .
SHE SHE HAD SOME KIND OF A DISPUTE OVER SOME ORANGE JUICE WITH THE WITH THE OWNER OF THE STORE .
THE OWNER OF THE STORE POPPED HER .
OH REALLY .
YEAH .
AND AND OH OF COURSE THEY YOU KNOW THE CRIMINAL CASE WENT UP AND AND THE JUDGE GAVE THE WOMAN .
WHO SHOT HER SHOT THE GIRL .
A UH UH PRACTICALLY A SUSPENDED SENTENCE .
I MEAN IT WAS .
OH MY GOODNESS .
IT WAS JUST SHE GAVE HER .
NO TIME IN JAIL YOU KNOW ALL OF THESE THINGS AND THEN OH THERE S WE HAVE THESE WE HAVE PEOPLE WONDERING AROUND TO WITH PETITIONS TRYING TO GET THE JUDGE .
TO GET THAT JUDGE RECALLED I WOULD THINK .
YEAH .
YEAH .
HUH .
THAT S ALMOST WHEN YOU .
KIND OF WISH THAT THERE WHERE STANDARDIZED SENTENCES .
YEAH .
IT WOULD MAKE IT WOULD MAKE LIFE EASIER .
IT WOULD .
YEAH .
UH .
BUT .
YOU WOULD KNOW THE WHOLE WORLD WOULD KNOW WHAT .
YOU WERE FACING .
AND THEN IT S A MATTER OF OF DECIDING .
OKAY .
UH SO WHAT DO YOU THINK UH ABOUT PUTTING THE ELDERLY IN A NURSING HOME .
WELL I THINK THAT IT IT VARIES ON ON THE INDIVIDUAL BASIS .
HUH .
UH SOMETIMES IT IS THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE .
UHHUH .
UH YOU DO NOT HAVE UH UH FAMILY AVAILABLE OR FAMILY .
THAT S UH YOU MAY NOT EVEN HAVE FAMILY .
THAT IS UH UH IN YOU KNOW WHO ARE AROUND .
THAT S TRUE .
YEAH .
SO SOMETIMES IT S NOT AN ALTERNATIVE .
HUH .
AND I THINK UH BUT I THINK ALSO SOMETIMES IT CAN BE UH A BENEFIT IF IT S FOR A SHORT TIME .
SOMETIMES IN A NURSING HOME .
UHHUH .
UH ESPECIALLY IF IF IT S AFTER AN ACUTE ILLNESS .
TO GET OVER A OR TO REHAB AFTER UH AN ILLNESS .
THAT S TRUE .
I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT .
YEAH .
SOMETIMES YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THE NURSING HOMES ARE GOOD FOR UH JUST SHORT PERIODS OF TIME .
THAT S TRUE UNTIL THEY GET OVER THAT HUMP .
UHHUH .
OF WHATEVER .
IT IS THEY RE DEALING WITH .
BECAUSE TOO OFTEN THE ACUTE HOSPITALS WILL ARE SENDING THEM OUT MUCH FASTER THAN WHAT .
THEY RE .
YES .
REALLY ABLE TO .
THEY REALLY ARE .
THEY DO NT LIKE TO KEEP THEM .
SO .
LONGER THAN A WEEK .
SO THERE IS SOME GOOD TO IT .
YEAH .
UH SOMETIMES TOO IT S USED AS A DUMB JOB .
YOU KNOW THE FAM .
WHAT DO YOU MEAN .
WELL THE FAMILIES DO NOT NECESSARILY UH KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THEM AND THEY DO NT WANT TO TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY SO THEY WILL PUT THEM IN A NURSING HOME .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
SO YOU SEE UH THERE S BOTH .
SIDES TO IT TOO .
WHAT DO YOU THINK .
YEAH AND IT DEPENDS ON HOW HOW SICK THE PERSON IS TOO .
WHAT .
YOU RE CAPABLE OF LIKE IF YOU HAVE A FAMILY TO TAKE CARE OF YOU KNOW OF YOUR OWN .
YEAH .
YEAH UH I WOULD PERSONALLY LIKE IT IF MY PARENTS WERE TO GET ILL I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE CARE OF THEM AT HOME AND IF I HAD THE MONEY WITH SOME HELP .
THAT S NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE .
THAT S TRUE .
BUT UH TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY I D LIKE TO DO IT UNTIL IT GETS IMPOSSIBLE .
I THINK THAT S ALSO WHERE YOU RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE .
WHO ARE GOING TO IT S THERE S NOT A CHOICE IT S .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE IT S NOT ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE EVEN TO .
UHHUH .
PUT THEM IN A NURSING HOME .
YEAH .
SO THAT THAT OPTION SOMETIMES IS NOT AVAILABLE IF THEY DO NOT HAVE THE UH EITHER MEDICARE OR INSURANCE TO COVER IT .
THAT S TRUE .
YEAH .
SO .
BUT I THINK NURSING HOMES CAN BE GOOD .
IT JUST DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND .
THEY ARE .
YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO CHECK THEM OUT AHEAD OF TIME .
YEAH AND THEN THERE S ALSO SOME .
THAT ARE SET UP FOR SPECIALTIES .
UHHUH .
UH I KNOW SOME .
UNFORTUNATELY SOME ELDERLY HAVE TO GO TO OR HAVE I GUESS IT S ALZHEIMER S OR WHERE .
UHHUH .
THEY WONDER OR OR UH CONFUSED OR HAVE SOME MENTAL PROBLEM .
YEAH THAT THEY RE .
AND YOU NEED A SPECIAL NURSING HOME FOR THAT .
YOU NEED ONE .
THAT HAS A UNIT .
THAT S LOCKED WHERE THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO GET OUT AND ROAM AROUND .
YEAH .
AND YOU NEED PEOPLE .
WHO ARE TRAINED FOR THAT TYPE .
RIGHT .
OF PROBLEM .
WHO KNOW WHAT .
THEY RE DOING WITH THAT .
YEAH SO SO THERE .
S DIFFERENT TYPES OF NURSING HOMES I THINK .
YEAH WELL MY UH GRANDMOTHER S NOT REALLY IN A NURSING HOME BUT A RETIREMENT HOME .
THAT ALSO HAS A NURSING HOME SORT OF ATTACHED TO IT .
AND SHE REALLY LIKED THE IDEA OF OF MOVING THERE .
SHE S NOT ILL YET .
UHHUH .
BUT UH SHE WORKED THERE AS A VOLUNTEER FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS AND THEN SHE DECIDED THAT UH SHE S EIGHTY FIVE YEARS OLD THAT EVENTUALLY YOU KNOW SHE .
SHE DOES NT WANT HER FAMILY TAKING CARE OF HER AND BEING A BURDEN .
SHE S VERY INDEPENDENT .
SO SHE S IN THIS NURSING HOME .
IT S OUT IN THE COUNTRY AND UH SHE REALLY ENJOYS IT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE SHE DOES NT HAVE TO WASH DISHES OR COOK .
GIVES HER .
A LITTLE BIT OF HER OWN INDEPENDENCE .
UHHUH .
BUT SHE STILL HAS UH A SECURITY THERE .
RIGHT .
SOME SUPPORT .
AND THEN THERE S ALSO UH SORT OF A WING FOR THOSE PEOPLE .
THAT DO GET SICK AND WHAT .
I LIKE ABOUT IT AND I THINK SHE LIKES ABOUT IT IS THAT SHE KNOWS EVERYBODY .
THERE NOW AND THEN SO IF SHE EVER DOES BECOME ILL UH IT WILL BE LIKE FAMILY AROUND HER .
THAT S RIGHT AND I .
YEAH .
I VE SEEN SOME OF THEM LIKE THAT TOO AND ALSO THEY HAVE A LOT OF UH ACTIVITIES GOING ON FOR THE ONES .
UHHUH .
WHO ARE MORE ACTIVE .
YEAH .
SH .
SO IT S NOT SORT OF LIKE UH UH .
UHHUH .
A SICK PLACE .
NO SHE LOVES IT .
SHE HAS A GREAT SOCIAL LIFE AND SHE TRAVELS AND UH IT S IN IN THE VERY IN THE MOUNTAINS AND IT S BEAUTIFUL AND UH I I HOPE THAT I HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHEN I GET OLDER .
YEAH I I THINK I THINK THE UH .
UHHUH .
I THINK THAT THE DECISION .
THAT NEEDS TO BE MADE THOUGH ON NURSING HOME HAS TO BE A JOINT ONE BETWEEN THE UH ELDERLY .
UHHUH .
UH PERSON .
WHO S GOING IN AND THE FAMILY .
THAT S GOING TO BE UH EFFEC EFFECTED BY IT .
OH DEFINITELY IT S .
AND UH YOU KNOW SOMETIMES IT CAN THOSE CHOI THOSE CHOICES CAN BE MADE IN ADVANCE AND SOMETIMES .
RIGHT .
THE CHOICES BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE ILLNESS WHEN THEY RE .
STEVE UH WITH THE ELECTION YEAR AND WHATNOT COMING UP DO YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO CUT TAXES RAISE THEM OR OR OR WHAT DO YOU THINK .
WELL THAT S THAT S A REALLY HARD QUESTION .
I DO KNOW THAT UH POLITICIANS ALWAYS TALKING OUT OF BOTH .
SIDES OF THEIR MOUTHS .
UH I LET S EXAMPLE UH OUR FRIEND THE PRESIDENT RIGHT NOW SAYS NO NEW TAXES WE SHOULD AND ESPECIALLY IF ANYTHING BE CUTTING TAXES NOW BECAUSE OF THE RECESSION AND AT THE SAME TIME THE BUDGET .
HE SENT TO CONGRESS HAS TAX AND FEE INCREASES SO UH I KNOW THE POLITICIANS UH ARE NT ARE NT STRAIGHTFORWARD .
NOW I IN TERMS OF ECONOMICS I M NOT IT S HARD HARD TO CALL .
IT REALLY IS .
UHHUH .
SEE I NEVER THOUGHT REALLY IT S UH I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT THAT THAT THE THE QUESTION REALLY HAD TO DO WHETHER OR NOT WE RE PAYING TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE .
I I ALWAYS THAT THE THE REAL QUESTION WAS IS ARE WE GETTING A REASONABLE RETURN ON ON INVESTMENT .
FOR INSTANCE LIKE SOCIAL SECURITY TAX OR SOC UH I MEAN THAT S THAT S TAX .
WE RE PAYING MONEY AND AND SUPPOSEDLY THIS MONEY IS GOING INTO SOME KIND OF FUND SO THAT WHEN IT COMES OUR TURN TO RETIRE THE MONEY WILL BE THERE FOR US .
RIGHT .
SO THAT S YEAH YOU KNOW WHEN I WHEN I SEE THAT MONEY TAKEN OUT OF MY PAYCHECK .
EACH EACH WEEK I OR EACH EVERY OTHER WEEK I I REALLY THINK THAT MONEY S HISTORY AND .
YES UH .
YOU KNOW SO AS FAR AS RETURN INVESTMENT THAT S NOT THAT S NOTHING AND WE RE NOT EVEN GOING TO GET THE EXACT SAME NUMBER OF DOLLARS BACK .
UH SOMEONE WAS TELLING ME THAT THERE IS A UH UH THERE S STILL AN OFFICE IN UH YOU KNOW STAFFED WITH WITH PEOPLE THERE AND IN D C .
THAT ARE RESEARCHING TO FIND A CURE FOR POLIO WHICH I MAY BE WRONG BUT I BELIEVE THAT THE CURE FOR POLIO IS ALREADY FOUNDED BUT BUT SUPPOSEDLY ONCE YOU HAVE AN OFFICE IN D C OR YOU KNOW AND AND STAFF .
IT WITH PEOPLE IT S REALLY TOUGH TO CLOSE IT DOWN AND AND THEY JUST HAVE NT YET .
WELL YEAH I M NOT EXACTLY SURE UH ABOUT POLIO IN PARTICULAR .
I KNOW WE HAVE A POLIO VACCINE COME WILL PREVENT SOMEBODY FROM GETTING POLIO .
UHHUH .
I M NOT SURE IF WE KNOW WHAT TO DO IN TERMS OF CURING SOME .
WHO HAS ALREADY GOTTEN POLIO .
WELL THAT MIGHT BE THE DIFFERENCE .
I DO NT KNOW .
UH THE OTHER THING THAT UH I REMEMBER SEEING ON T V LATELY IS UH HAD TO DO WITH IT S LIKE SEVENTYFIVE PERCENT OF THE HISTORICAL SITES IN AMERICA ARE IN THE HOME DISTRICTS OF VERY POWERFUL PEOPLE POLITICALLY .
RIGHT .
THAT THAT HISTOR FOR SOME REASON HISTORICAL SITES WITH YOU KNOW THE THE FULL FEDERAL MONEY AND EVERYTHING SEEM TO APPEAR AS AS ALMOST AS LIKE POLITICAL FAVORS TO TO VERY STRONG POLITICIANS .
YEAH IT S IT S IT S FUNNY BECAUSE UH IT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT BUSH IS TRYING REALLY HARD TO GET AHOLD OF IS THE LINE ITEM VETO WHERE UH YOU KNOW CONGRESS IS ABLE TO ATTACH ALL KINDS OF UH FUNNY AMENDMENTS FOR INDIVIDUAL UH C CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS .
UHHUH .
TO THE TO THE MAIN BUDGET PROPOSALS AND THE POOR PRESIDENT HAS HAS TO UH EITHER ACCEPT OR REJECT THE WHOLE THING .
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU UH YOU THINK THAT THAT WE D BE ABLE TO SAVE SOME MONEY BY UH .
OH .
PASSING THE LINE ITEM VETO .
I I THINK THE LINE ITEM VETO IS NOT NOT IS NOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING ASSUMING THAT THE UH THE THE PRESIDENT UH USES IT TO GET RID OF UH THIS KIND OF WASTE .
ON THE OTHER HAND UH IT IT ASSUMES THAT YOU HAVE LOTS OF CONFIDENCE IN YOUR PRESIDENT NOT TO VETO IMPORTANT THINGS .
YEAH .
UH AND JUST TO GET RID OF THE UNIMPORTANT THINGS .
AND WHENEVER THERE S THAT KIND OF SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENT THERE S ALWAYS GOING TO BE A DISPUTE .
UHHUH .
AS TO UH WHERE THE EXA WHERE THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN WASTE AND AND NECESSITY IS .
SO I M NOT I M NOT SURE THAT THAT THAT WILL HELP SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS BUT THERE DEFINITELY IS IS A PROBLEM WITH UH I FORGOT THERE S A POLITICAL TERM FOR THIS STUFF PORK BARREL OR SOMETHING .
YEAH .
UH .
PORK BARREL POLITICS .
PORK BARREL POLITICS .
THE THE THERE HAS TO BE SOME WAY TO DO IT .
I KNOW STATE GOVERNORS USUALLY HAVE LINE ITEM VETOS AND UH I LIVED IN MASSACHUSETTS FOR A WHILE AND UH WHEN DUKAKIS VETOED CERTAIN THINGS THERE WAS A BIG UPROAR AND WAS NT NECESSARILY SO POPULAR .
YEAH BUT MASSACHUSETTS WAS NT WHEN DUKAKIS WAS THERE ANYWAY WAS NT IN THAT GREAT SHAPE FINANCIALLY .
D AT LEAST AT THE END .
UHHUH .
I MEAN I DO NT KNOW I .
YEAH I I THEY WERE VERY GOOD AT FIRST THEY WERE IN VERY GOOD FINANCIALS AT FIRST AND UH THAT S PART OF THE REASON .
HE BECAME A NOMINEE IS BECAUSE THINGS WENT SO WELL .
AND THEN OF COURSE THE BOTTOM FELL OUT .
IT .
S UH I MEAN IT S IT S TOUGH .
I MEAN THERE S THERE S TWO WAYS YOU CAN KIND OF GO TO GET OUT OF TOUGH FINANCIAL SITUATIONS .
I GUESS YOU CAN LIKE RAISE TAXES AND THEN CREATE LIKE JOB PROGRAMS AND WHATNOT OR YOU CAN HOPE THAT IF PEOPLE KEEP THEIR MONEY THAT THEY LL SPEND MORE AND CREATE JOBS AND AND WHATNOT .
AND SPARE THE ECONOMY .
YEAH IT S REALLY IT S A HARD BALANCE .
IT IT DEFINITELY IS .
EVEN NOT FOR GOVERNMENT EVEN JUST SAY FOR A SMALL BUSINESS .
UH I KNOW SOME .
AND YOU SAY YOU HAVE SOME STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT UH THE ISSUE .
UH YES I DO AS FAR AS UH AS FAR AS UH AS FAR AS IMMIGRATION AS A WHOLE GOES .
UHHUH .
I THINK THAT UH WE SIMPLY MUST START ACCEPTING EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD .
UHHUH .
UH I THERE JUST IS NOT GOING TO BE ROOM FOR ALL OF US .
WE DO NT HAVE JOBS NOW .
I I THINK UH I THINK WHEN WE COME TO A TIME OF RECESSION THAT IT S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT THAT WE SHUT OUR DOORS AT THAT TIME .
UH I HOPE YOU RE ONE OF THE EMPLOYED RIGHT NOW .
UHHUH .
I AM ONE OF THE UNEMPLOYED RIGHT NOW .
I WAS A SYSTEMS ANALYSIS AND PROGRAMMER FOR AN OIL COMPANY AND UH I APPLIED FOR ONE SET OF JOBS WITH A COMPANY HERE IN DALLAS THAT THEY HAD TWO HUNDRED OPENINGS BUT THEY HAD TWO THOUSAND APPLICATIONS .
YEAH .
AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF FOREIGNERS UH HERE YOU KNOW DOING MY LINE OF WORK .
UHHUH .
AND OF COURSE I M NOT PERFECTLY HAPPY ABOUT NOT HAVING A JOB .
RIGHT .
SO HOW DO YOU FEEL .
WELL I M A LITTLE BIT AMBIVALENT .
THE PROBLEM WITH UH AND I THINK ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH IMMIGRATION POLICY IS LIKE ANY OTHER POLITICAL PROBLEM IS THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT WILLING TO DISCUSS IT UH IN IN TERMS OF WHAT UH REALLY IS DRIVING IT .
THEY RE NOT WILLING TO TELL THE TRUTH .
THE SAME WAY WITH UH ISSUES OF UH RACE AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
I MEAN RIGHT NOW UH I BELIEVE THERE ARE TWO POLICIES .
THAT UH THAT THE GOVERNMENT USES TO MODULATE IMMIGRATION .
THREE ACTUALLY .
ONE IS AT THE HIGH END UH THEY ALWAYS WANT TO BE ABLE TO UH DO SOME BRAIN DRAINING .
THEY ALWAYS LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ATTRACT THE UH EINSTEINS OR THE PROFESSOR CHOU OR YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
THEY D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GET THE TOP PEOPLE IN ANY FIELD AND SO THEY CAN ALMOST ALWAYS FIND ROOM FOR SOMEONE LIKE THAT .
AT THE BOTTOM END THEY UH .
ARE ALWAYS WILLING TO UH LET IN CHEAP LABOR IF IT LOWERS THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS IN SOME PARTICULAR AREA AND HAS STRONG SUPPORT FROM THE .
POWERFUL PEOPLE IN THAT AREA .
THOSE ARE TWO THINGS THAT I THINK ARE GOING ON .
ALTHOUGH THEY I I DO NT THINK THE POLITICIANS WOULD TELL YOU .
THAT .
OKAY AND I THINK YOU RE RIGHT IN BOTH .
CASES .
AND THEN THE .
THIRD THING IS UH THE POLITICAL ASPECT OF UH UH LETTING STEAM COME OUT FROM UNDER THE LID IN MEXICO .
THEY CAN NOT CLOSE OFF THE MEXICAN BORDER .
NOT BECAUSE IT S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE BUT BECAUSE THE EXPLOSION .
THAT WOULD TAKE PLACE IN MEXICO WOULD BE UH UH .
WOULD SPILL OVER TO THIS COUNTRY SO THEY KEEP ALLOWING UH THE PRESSURE COOKER TO LET OFF STEAM .
AND I THINK PROBABLY IT S PRETTY IMPORTANT RIGHT THERE .
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT HAITIAN IMMIGRATION .
UH THAT S ONE OF THE FEW THINGS I GUESS I FOUND MYSELF IN AGREEMENT WITH PAT BUCHANAN .
I THINK THEY RE A VERY DIFFICULT GROUP TO INTEGRATE INTO UH SOCIETY .
THEY RE VERY DIFFICULT UH GROUP TO FIND JOBS AND UH AND UH PLACES FOR .
AND SO UH UH I DO NT DENY THAT WE MAY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN CAUSING THE PROBLEM THAT UH IN THAT THEY RE PRETTY MISERABLE WHERE THEY ARE .
BUT I M NOT TO SYMPATHETIC ABOUT UH LETTING LARGE NUMBERS OF HAITIANS IN .
ACTUALLY ACTUALLY I FEEL THAT IF WE ACCEPTED THESE PEOPLE THAT WE WOULD EVENTUALLY HAVE ALMOST THE TOTAL POPULATION HERE .
YEAH .
AND IT WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH POLITICAL SITUATIONS .
IT WOULD HAVE TO DO WITH POVERTY .
RIGHT .
BUT IF YOU LET THEM YEAH .
IF YOU LET THEM IN A MILLION AT A TIME IT WOULD NT MAKE THAT YOU KNOW IT WOULD NT MAKE THAT BIG A BULGE IN THE POPULATION .
BUT .
OH MY GOSH .
PO POLITICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY .
HAVE YOU BEEN HAVE YOU BEEN TO SOUTHERN FLORIDA .
YEAH WELL I KNOW ABOUT IT .
UH I MEAN IT S IT IS NOW WITH HAITIANS .
THE WAY .
IT WAS WITH CUBANS UH TWENTY YEARS AGO .
WELL I MEAN AND THE TWO OF THEM TOGETHER .
I MEAN WE CAN IT S JUST AS WELL YOU KNOW IT S HARDLY AMERICA ANYMORE .
ON THE OTHER HAND YOU KNOW THE IRONIC THING ABOUT THIS IS THAT THERE S NOBODY MORE FULL OF THE ENTREPRENEURIAL AMERICAN SPIRIT THAN OUR FIRST GENERATION IMMIGRANT .
SO THERE S UH THERE S A LOT TO BE SAID FOR HAVING A STEADY STREAM OF PEOPLE .
WHO KNOW HOW IT IS SOMEPLACE ELSE COMING IN .
BUT THERE S SOME DIFFERENCES IN THE IMMIGRANTS .
THAT THAT WE RE GETTING NOW .
WELL .
RIGHT .
I PARTICULARLY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION .
SURE .
I THINK .
PROBABLY YOUR A GREAT DEAL OF WHAT .
YOU SAY IS TRUE ABOUT THE LEGALS .
RIGHT .
BUT UH .
THE MAJORITY OF THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION .
WE RE GETTING NOW THEY DO NOT COME HERE TO BLEND INTO AMERICA .
UH THEY THEY DO NT BOTHER TO LEARN OUR LANGUAGE AND UH FIRST OF ALL TH THEY I M SORRY THIS I REALLY FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT THIS .
UHHUH .
WE SEND A LOT OF MONEY TO MEXICO .
UHHUH .
OKAY .
GO AHEAD .
UH WELL YOU KNOW UH I THINK PUBLIC SERVICE IS A WORTHY THING AND AS A MATTER OF FACT .
THERE ARE A LOT OF PROGRAMS UH SUCH AS PEACE CORPS .
THAT PROMOTE THAT .
UHHUH .
PROBABLY THE MOST POPULAR ONE BUT UH ONE .
THAT IS NOT TYPICALLY RECOGNIZED AS SUCH IS THE BOY SCOUTS .
HUH .
UH I KNOW THAT F BECAUSE MY SON IS A A SCOUT NOW AND UH IS THINKING ABOUT HIS EAGLE AND UH IN ORDER TO GET EAGLE YOU HAVE TO HAVE MERIT BADGES IN UH CITIZENSHIP IN THE COMMUNITY .
RIGHT .
CITIZENSHIP IN THE NATION CITIZENSHIP IN THE WORLD AND YOU HAVE TO DO A PUBLIC SERVICE PROJECT .
UHHUH .
UH IN WHICH LEADERSHIP IS THE KEY ELEMENT .
I UH I THINK THE QUESTION IS POSED SOMEWHAT STRANGELY BECAUSE UH IT S TALKING ABOUT A REQUIREMENT FOR .
UHHUH .
PUBLIC SERVICE AND OF COURSE PE THE PEACE CORPS THE BOY SCOUTS IS A O IS A VOLUNTARY ACTIVITY .
RIGHT .
UH .
I I THINK THAT MIGHT BE TALKING REFERRING TO UH SOMETHING KIND OF UH ALTERNATIVE TO THE DRAFT YOU KNOW .
EITHER YOU HAVE UH MILITARY SERVICE OR SOME SORT OF ALTERNATIVE NONMILITARY SERVICE FOR A FEW YEARS .
RIGHT OF COURSE UH UH MILITARY SERVICE FALLS UNDER THE CATEGORY UH OF A PUBLIC SERVICE .
RIGHT RIGHT .
AND SO UH ONE OF THE THINGS .
THAT WOULD FULFILL THE AT LEAST THE NOMINAL UH QUALIFICATIONS SET FORTH IN THE CHARGE IS MILITARY SERVICE OR DRAFT .
HUH .
RIGHT RIGHT .
UH BUT I AGREE WITH YOU THAT PROBABLY IS NOT WHAT WAS COMPREHENDED .
THERE ARE OTHER .
WELL I .
THINGS SUCH AS CIVIL SERVICE .
UHHUH .
UH WHICH .
MANY PEOPLE UH ARE LIFELONG EMPLOYEES OF .
RIGHT .
BUT I SUSPECT THAT WAS NOT WHAT .
THEY HAD IN MIND EITHER .
MORE .
YEAH .
OF A VOLUNTARY KIND OF THING OR UH .
YEAH YEAH I I FOR FOR YEARS .
THERE HAS BEEN AN IDEA BATTED AROUND OF HAVING SOME SORT OF ALTERNATIVE UH PUBLIC SERVICE FOR UH YOUNG PEOPLE TO GO INTO UH AFTER HIGH SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
UH KIND OF IN LIEU OF THE DRAFT FOR FOR PEOPLE .
WHO DO NT UH WHO YOU KNOW ARE CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS OR DO NT OTHERWISE WANT E E TO BE IN THE MILITARY YOU KNOW .
SAY OKAY WELL YOU CAN GO INTO THE MILITARY OR YOU CAN DO THIS OTHER THING FOR ONE OR TWO YEARS TO KIND OF SERVE THE COMMUNITY AND AND LEARN ABOUT THINGS .
AND I IT S INTERESTING BECAUSE I I M NOT A PARTICULAR FAN OF THE MILITARY BUT I HAVE SEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE A LOT OF YOUNG GUYS GO IN THAT DO NT HAVE REALLY A CLUE AS TO WHAT .
THEY WANT TO DO WITH THEIR LIVES AND ARE NT TERRIBLY DISCIPLINED YOU KNOW EVEN JUST PERSONAL DISCIPLINE ABOUT WHAT .
THEY WANT TO DO AND THEY COME OUT AND THEY THEY AT LEAST HAVE NOW THEY HAVE AT LEAST .
SOME MARGINALLY MARKETABLE SKILLS AND MORE DISCIPLINE .
AND THEY HAVE UH YOU KNOW IN IN SOME CASES THEY HAVE A GREATER SELFESTEEM BECAUSE THEY CAN SAY THEY CAN SEE THAT YOU KNOW IF I DO SOMETHING OR SUB SUBMIT MY OWN WILL TO THE WILL OF THE SARGENT OR WHATEVER AT LEAST FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME I CAN ACCOMPLISH A LOT AND IT IT S A GOOD LESSON FOR A LOT OF YOUNG MEN TO LEARN .
THAT THEY DO NT NEED TO BE YOU KNOW COWBOYS .
THEY DO NT NEED TO BE OUT THERE AND UH YOU KNOW CONSTANTLY FLAUNTING THEIR EGO TO GET THINGS ACCOMPLISHED .
AND YOU KNOW FOR SOME FOR SOME YOUNG MEN THAT S GOOD .
FOR ME IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LOUSY I IDEA UH BECAUSE .
WHY .
I I DID HAVE TH THE PERSONAL DISCIPLINE .
AND I WENT .
WHY IS THAT .
TO COLLEGE FOR FOUR YEARS AND GOT OUT YOU KNOW SO .
BUT UH YOU KNOW FOR SOME PEOPLE .
THAT S GOOD .
I I DO NT PARTICULAR LIKE THE FACT THAT IT S THE MILITARY YOU KNOW MUMBLEX AND THE WHOLE POINT OF THE MILITARY IS TO KILL PEOPLE ESSENTIALLY .
AS AS AN INSTRUMENT OF U S POLICY .
OH NO NO NO .
IT S TO DEFEND THE NATION AGAINST EXTERNAL EVILS .
WELL THAT S ONE VIEW .
AND AND YOU KNOW AND THAT THAT S ANOTHER DEBATE .
BUT UH IT S UH .
WELL IT DEPENDS ON WHETHER YOU WHETHER WE FIGURE THAT WE HAVE THAT WE HAVE A DEFENSE ORIENTED MILITARY OR .
UHHUH .
AN AGGRESSIVE AGGRESSION ORIENTED MILITARY .
RIGHT RIGHT AND WELL IT S IT IT SEEMS PRETTY AGGRE AGGRESSIVE ORIENTED I MEAN YOU YOU LOOK AT THE LAST MIS MILITARY ACTION .
WHICH WAS IN THE PERSIAN GULF AND WAS NT ANYWHERE NEAR THE UNITED STATES AND IT WAS UH YOU KNOW IT WAS DEFINITELY A PROJECTION OF U S POWER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLOBE SO AT AT ANY RATE THIS IS GETTING OFF THE TOPIC BUT I MY MY POINT WAS THAT THERE IS FOR PEOPLE .
WHO DO NT WANT TO DO THE MILITARY SERVICE THERE IT WOULD BE NEAT IF THERE WERE AN ALTERNATIVE .
THAT COULD INSTILL THE SAME SORT OF PERSONAL DISCIPLINE AND SENSE OF PURPOSE AND UH SENSE OF COMMUNITY THAT THE BOY SCOUTS .
OKAY UH WELL WE JUST GOT OUR INCOME TAX RETURN AND I M PERFECTLY HAPPY WHAT ABOUT YOU .
WELL LET S SEE I HAVE NT GOT MINE YET BECAUSE MY PARENTS ARE GETTING ALL THAT STUFF AT UH AT HOME .
UHHUH .
IN THE BAY AREA .
UHHUH .
SO I M NOT SURE HOW MUCH I M GETTING BACK BUT I M PRETTY SURE I SHOULD GET BACK A LITTLE BIT SINCE MUMBLEX STUDENT SO .
YEAH .
IT S NOT TOO MUCH .
YEAH .
NOT TOO BAD THOUGH .
BUT AS FAR AS WRITING CHECKS OUT AND PAYING TAXES I THINK IT S PRETTY HIGH BUT I I M YOU KNOW I I GUESS IT S WHERE WE HAVE TO BE WHERE IT WE HAVE TO KEEP RAISING THEM FOR TO KEEP SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THAT WE HAVE AND .
YEAH IT IT S ONE OF THOSE NECESSITIES OF LIFE THAT WE ALL HAVE TO YOU KNOW PAY TAXES BUT ALTHOUGH IT IS KIND OF A PAIN SOMETIMES THOUGH .
IT S JUST SCARY THOUGH ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW HIGH ARE THE TAXES GOING TO BE WHEN MY CHILDREN ARE MY AGE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THAT THAT S THAT S SCARY TOO .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE IT S NOT ANYTHING LIKE THE WAY IT WAS WHEN I WAS YOUNG AND SMALL AND A CHILD SO YOU KNOW THAT THAT S A SCARY PART TOO THAT YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT .
YEAH AND AND .
LIKE AS TIME GOES ON YOU KNOW THINGS GET MORE EXPENSIVE AND BECAUSE WE WERE MUMBLEX INCREASINGLY COMPLEX SOCIETY THAT .
UHHUH .
DAY BY DAY THINGS GET MORE UH THINGS GET MORE EXPENSIVE AS WELL AS MORE COMPLEX .
YEAH .
AND YOU KNOW TAXES ARE ONE OF THE WAYS TO HELP PAY FOR A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT ARE NEEDED IN THIS SOCIETY .
YEAH .
I MEAN EVERYTHING FROM YOU KNOW FROM MEDICARE TO UH TO SOCIAL SECURITY TO UH TO FEEDING THE H TO UH TO YOU KNOW FEEDING THE HOMELESS TO MAINTAINING PRISONS TO MAINTAINING POLICES OR FIRE DEPARTMENTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND IT S NOW THERE S MORE AND MORE THINGS THAT NEED ATTENDING TO AND THAT SORT OF THING AND YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
IT S IT S BECOMING A LARGER RESPONSIBILITY BUT SOMEONE HAS TO PAY FOR IT AND THAT S US .
YEAH AND THEN YOU FIND OUT ABOUT ALL THESE THINGS ABOUT ARE YOUR TAXES YOU KNOW TAXPAYERS ARE IS YOUR MONEY GOING TO WHERE YOU WANT IT TO GO AND THERE S GOING TO A SPECIAL THIS WEEK I I CA NT I CA NT IF IT S TWENTY TWENTY OR ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE UH I THINK IT S ONE OF THE LOCAL NEWS I THINK THEY RE HAVING A DOCUMENTARY SOMETHING ABOUT THAT ABOUT THEIR TRYING TO CATCH SOME PEOPLE THAT NOT SPENDING YOUR TAX MONIES RIGHT AND FRAUD AND THAT KIND OF THING YOU KNOW AND THAT S KIND OF SCARY TOO .
UHHUH .
AND UH SO THAT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE I WANTED TO SEE THAT PROGRAM .
YEAH AND AND EVEN EVEN TODAY IT S LIKE THE MUMBLEX AMOUNT OF TAXES THAT YOU KNOW WE RE PAYING FOR BUT YOU D THINK THAT WE RE STILL IN THAT THIS THIS UH DEFICIT STATE THAT WE RE STILL NOT ABLE TO PAY OFF THINGS JUST BECAUSE .
OH I KNOW .
THE BUDGET S NOT BIG ENOUGH AS IT IS .
YEAH .
AND .
MAKES YOU WONDER WHEN THERE S YOU KNOW COUNTRIES OUT THERE THAT HAVE YOU KNOW TAX RATES OF LIKE CLOSE TO FIFTY PERCENT OR HIGHER .
YOU KNOW IT S LIKE FIFTY PERCENT OF EVERYTHING YOU MAKE IS ALREADY GONE BEFORE YOU EVEN GET IT .
UHHUH .
AND THAT THAT S KIND OF A SCARY THOUGHT I HOPE IT DOES NT COME DOWN TO THAT .
YEAH .
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THEY ALSO WHILE THOSE COUNTRIES THAT HAVE HIGH TAXES ALSO HAVE THINGS LIKE UH SOCIALIZED MEDICINE THINGS LIKE THAT TOO WHICH ARE NICE FRINGE BENEFITS OF IT SO EVERYONE HAS EVERYONE HAS THE ACCESS TO MEDICAL FACILITIES AS WELL AS THE DOCTORS THAT SORT OF THING .
UHHUH .
AND IT S GOOD BUT IT S IT S THE PRICE THEY PAY .
YEAH .
I MEAN IT CAN BE ARGUED ONE WAY OR ANOTHER WHETHER ECONOMICALLY IT S ACTUALLY GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY OR GOOD FOR ANY GIVEN COUNTRY TO HAVE THAT BECAUSE THOSE COUNTRIES TEND TO BE UH AS FAR AS CASH FLOW A LOT UH HAVE BE TEND TO HAVE A MUCH SLOWER CASH FLOW .
UHHUH .
AND DO NT GENERATE A LARGER A A LARGE AMOUNT OF REVENUE BECAUSE THERE S SO LITTLE UH CURRENCY FLOW THROUGH OUT THE ECONOMIC SYSTEM .
HUH WELL YOU SURE DO KNOW A L A LOT .
WELL JUST KEEPING UP WITH THE TIMES THAT S ALL .
YEAH YEAH .
AS AS IT TURNS OUT YOU KNOW IT S ONE OF THOSE ONE OF THOSE INTERESTS YOU KNOW I KIND OF LIKE TO KEEP UP ON BECAUSE WELL IT S NICE TO KNOW THAT WHEN I M ACTUALLY YOU KNOW I DO START WORKING THAT I LIKE TO KNOW WHERE MY TAX DOLLARS ARE GOING TOO .
UHHUH .
MUMBLEX WORK HARD TO GET YOU KNOW I LIKE TO KNOW WHERE IT S GOING TO .
YEAH YEAH THAT S TRUE .
UHHUH .
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THESE ITEMS THAT ARE GOING TO BE UH TAXED EVEN MORE LIKE UH TOBACCO AND THAT KIND OF THING .
I THINK IN A IN A WAY IT S GOOD IN A WAY IT S NOT UH BUT I THINK IN GENERAL IT S PROBABLY GOOD I MEAN A LOT OF THINGS LIKE TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL AND THINGS LIKE THAT HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST UH HAVE BEEN NOT TAXED BECAUSE THERE S BEEN SUCH A LARGE LOBBY AGAINST THEM AGAINST .
UHHUH .
THE TAXES FOR THEM SPONSORED BY THE ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO COMPANIES .
UHHUH .
AND IT S THINGS LIKE TOBACCO ARE UH THEY RE THEY RE A PROVEN HEALTH HAZARD TO SMOKERS .
YEAH .
AS WELL AS NONSMOKERS .
RIGHT .
AND IT S AS FAR AS THE SAFETY THING IN LIKE IN SAN LUIS OBISPO FOR EXAMPLE THERE S AN ORDNANCE WHICH STATES THAT UH THERE S NO SMOKING IN ANY PUBLIC AREAS AND SO IF YOU WALK INTO ANY RESTAURANT OR ANY HOTEL THERE S NO SMOKING ALLOWED ANYWHERE .
OH REALLY .
OKAY .
OKAY WELL MARK OUR SITUATION IS THAT WE DO HAVE A DAUGHTER .
THAT IS UH IN THE SITUATION OF CHOOSING COLLEGE .
UHHUH .
SHE S ACTUALLY AT BIBLE COLLEGE FOR THIS CURRENT YEAR .
UHHUH .
AND UH I GUESS UH FIRST AND FOREMOST IT REALLY IT S A QUESTION OF WHAT .
THE STUDENT WANTS TO HAVE IN THE WAY OF A CAREER AND THEN UH UH WHICH COLLEGES OR UNIVERSITIES CAN BEST OFFER THAT PROGRAM AND THEN IT COMES DOWN TO THE DOLLAR .
YOU HAVE TO UH IT S WHETHER OR NOT YOU RE A RESIDENT FOR THAT JURISDICTION OR .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW IT DOES IT COMES DOWN TO UH .
UHHUH .
TRYING TO COME WITH A TRADE OFF OF THE COSTS .
UHHUH .
UH WHAT DO YOU FEEL ABOUT COME OF THE THINGS .
THAT NEED TO .
DAMN IT I AGREE WITH PRETTY MUCH WITH EVERYTHING .
YOU VE SAID .
UH THE ONE THE ONE THING THAT I YOU KNOW I D ADVISE ANY PARENT UH YOU KNOW OR ANY OR ANY PERSON LOOKING FOR A COLLEGE UH IS THAT I THINK I THINK YOU KNOW IT S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY VISIT THE COLLEGE AND ACTUALLY TRY AND GET AWAY FROM YOU KNOW THE GUIDED TOUR OF THE COLLEGE AND TRY AND TALK TO THE YOU KNOW ACTUAL STUDENTS THERE BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY RE JUST UH IN MY EXPERIENCE I VE TALKED TO PEOPLE AT OTHER COLLEGES UH THAT YOU KNOW THE THE THE WAY THE YOU KNOW THE THE THE LIFESTYLE PICTURED IN THE CAT CATALOGS IS NT ALWAYS THE WHOLE STORY .
NO Y THE THE COLLEGE THE THE CATALOGS ARE SALES MATERIAL .
UHHUH .
IT DOES NT MATTER .
UHHUH .
WHETHER YOU KNOW THEY RE THEY RE SELLING SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
AND UH AND TRUE IT UH REALLY IS HELPFUL IF A PARENT AND THE STUDENT CAN GET THERE AND SEE .
UHHUH .
THE REAL CHARACTER OF THE SCHOOL AND THE REAL LIFE EXPERIENCES OF THE SCHOOL .
UH I GUESS THERE S A DIFFERENCE IN HERE THE AT LEAST .
THE UNIVERSITY HERE IN SASKATOON IS PRIMARILY UH OFF CAMPUS RESIDENT STUDENTS .
LIKE THEY JUST LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY .
UHHUH .
UH YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES PARTICULARLY AS THEY GET TO BE A LITTLE BIT ON THE SMALLER SIDE WHERE DORMITORY LIFE IS UH IS RIGHT ON CAMPUS AS WELL .
UHHUH .
AND THAT YOU KNOW THAT CHANGES THE CHARACTER .
UHHUH .
OF IT QUITE A BIT .
YEAH I I GO TO GEORGIA TECH .
WHICH IS YOU KNOW PRIMARILY AN ENGINEERING SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
AND UH YOU KNOW I THINK I REALLY DO MISS THE FACT YOU KNOW THAT IT S NOT A UNIVERSITY THAT THERE S THERE S NOT THE THE YOU KNOW IT TENDS TO BE A VERY CONSERVATIVE SCHOOL AND THERE AND THERE DOES NT SEEM TO BE THE DIVERSITY OF VIEWS THAT A LOT OF YOU KNOW UNIVERSITIES WILL WILL HAVE .
YEAH .
UH I GUESS WE RE HERE THIS IS THE UNIVERSITY .
THAT HAS FOR YEARS HAD THE THE CAR THAT UH WILL TRAVEL THE FARTHEST ON UH ON A SMALL QUANTITY OF GAS OUR ENGINEERING STUDENTS .
UHHUH .
UH IN COMPETITIONS AND THAT S THE KIND OF THING THAT ALSO YOU SEE UH IF YOU CAN SEE THE KINDS OF ACHIEVEMENTS .
THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY STUDENTS AS WELL AS GRADUATES .
UHHUH .
CAN GIVE YOU .
IDEA OF THE CHARACTER OF THE SCHOOL .
UH WHETHER YOU YOU KNOW IN ONE SENSE WHETHER YOU VE GOT A SPIRIT OF INNOVATION AND EXCELLENCE OR WHETHER YOU VE GOT A A SPIRIT OF SOMEWHAT UNKIND BUT .
UHHUH .
PRODUCING GRADUATES .
YEAH .
UH YOU KNOW AS SORT OF SOME DEVELOPMENT AND SOME TRAINING UH LIKE IT S EASY ENOUGH TO CRANK OUT GRADUATES BUT TO REALLY CHALLENGE THEM .
UHHUH .
AND UH AND THAT CAN VARY BETWEEN COLLEGES AND FACULTIES EVEN AS TO HOW YOU KNOW WHAT .
THE ATTITUDE TOWARDS ACHIEVEMENT IS .
UHHUH .
UH DO YOU UH HAVE ANYONE THAT YOU RE SERIOUSLY NEEDING TO UH FEED INFORMATION TO .
I SUPPOSE IF YOU RE ACTUALLY AT GEORGIA TECH AS A STUDENT YOU RE A WAYS AWAY FROM THAT .
YEAH UH I DO NT REALLY KNOW OF ANYONE .
THAT S LIKE LOOK THAT S LOOKING FOR COLLEGES NOW YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF UH PEOPLE S YOUNGER BROTHERS AND SISTERS .
THEN THE ONLY ADVISE PASSED DOWN IS DO NT GO TO GEORGIA TECH .
UH BUT UH NO ACTUA ACTUALLY I M I M I M MORE INTERESTED IN IN IN CHOOSING THE RIGHT J JOB WHEN YOU GRADUATE .
RIGHT .
TYPE INFORMATION .
WELL THAT S THAT S ONE OF THE REALLY A VALID POINT THAT PEOPLE NEED .
UHHUH .
TO CONSIDER AS WELL .
UHHUH .
UH YOU KNOW TO GOING TO COLLEGE UNIVERSITY IS GOING TO TAKE FOUR TO EIGHT YEARS DEPENDING ON THE .
PROGRAM .
P PA PROGRAMS PERSON S INVOLVED IN AND AFTER THAT YOU HAVE TO BE OUT IN THE REAL WORLD AND HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT YOURSELF .
UHHUH .
AND IF YOU GO IN AN AREA THAT THERE IS JUST NOT MUCH OF A JOB MARKET .
UHUH .
JEEZ IF THAT S .
UHHUH LIKE A FINE ARTS EDUCATION I .
RIGHT .
BEST TRAINING IN THE WORLD IS NOT GOING TO F PUT FOOD ON YOUR TABLE .
UHHUH .
BUT UH .
OKAY WELL UH JUST BRIEFLY UH I WORKED IN A NURSING HOME SO I KIND OF KNOW FROM WAY BACK UH HOW THINGS USED TO BE RUN AND I THINK THERE HAS BEEN DEFINITE CHANGES OF NURSING HOMES BUT I THINK UH IF I HAD TO PERSONALLY PUT ONE OF MY PARENTS IN A NURSING HOME THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE PRETTY BAD OFF TO WHERE I COULD NT TAKE CARE OF THEM AT ALL IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW I WOULD CERTAINLY IF THEY RE FORGETTING THINGS OR WHATEVER I D PREFER TO HAVE THEM AT HOME OR HAVE THEM IN WHAT THEY CALL NOW HOME CARE .
UHHUH .
WHERE SOMEBODY COMES IN AND THEY COOK MEALS AND THEY CLEAN THEIR HOUSE FOR THEM THAT KIND OF THING SO THEY STILL HAVE THEIR OWN INDEPENDENCE AND NOT RELIABLE YOU KNOW THEY DO NT HAVE TO BE IN A NURSING HOME SITUATION BUT UH I DO NT THINK THE NURSING HOMES WHEN I WAS WORKING IN THEM WERE VERY MUCH UNDERSTAFFED VERY MUCH UH IN NEED OF GOOD PERSONNEL UH I THINK THE PATIENTS WERE NT GIVEN THE QUALITY OF CARE THAT I WOULD NT HAVE YOU KNOW I LOOK AT IT AND SAY THANK GOD I GOT OUT OF THAT KIND OF SITUATION BUT .
YEAH .
THEY THEY WERE NOT GIVEN THE TIME AND THEY WERE NOT GIVEN THE MONEY BASICALLY TO STAFF APPROPRIATELY PEOPLE TO HELP .
UHHUH .
AND I CAN REMEMBER LIFTING A PATIENT ALL BY MYSELF SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT ANOTHER PERSON TO HELP IT S EITHER LE LEAVE THE PATIENT IN BED ALL DAY LONG OR GET THEM UP AND I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO GET THEM UP THAN TO LEAVE THEM IN BED ALL DAY BUT UH UH SO I THINK NURSING HOMES ARE HAVE CHANGED I M NOT QUITE SURE BUT HOPEFULLY THEY HAVE .
YEAH WEL TH I GUESS I HAVE NT HAD THAT MUCH EXPERIENCE I VE ONLY SEEN LIKE MY GREAT GRANDPARENTS IN A NURSING HOME .
UHHUH .
BUT .
YEAH .
I HAVE AN AUNT WHO LIVED ON HER OWN UNTIL SHE WAS WELL IN HER NINETIES .
SURE .
AND THEN SHE SHE GOT SICK AND SHE ENDED UP IN NURSING HOME .
UHHUH .
AND MY PARENTS WENT TO VISIT HER AND IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE THE NUR IT SEEMED LIKE THE NURSING HOME DID NT WANT TO DEAL WI HER ANYMORE .
SURE .
AND SO THEY GAVE HER DRUGS TO KEEP HER ASLEEP .
YEAH I I THINK THAT S THAT CAN HAPPEN AND I THINK IN THE NURSING HOME THAT I WORKED FOR I WAS NT QUITE SURE OF IT BUT I M SURE THAT SOME OF THE PATIENTS WERE UH GIVEN MEDICATION TO KEEP THEM IN UH QUIET AND AND .
NICE SEDATIVE STATE .
YEAH YEAH AND THEY WOULD JUST LAY ALL DAY LONG AND UH THE ONES THA THEY ALSO PUT MENTALLY ILL PATIENTS IN THE SAME THEY WERE NOT ON THE SAME YOU KNOW WARD BUT THEY THEY WERE IN THE SAME NURSING HOME SO THAT THESE MENTALLY ILL PATIENTS COULD WALK INTO WHERE THE OTHER UH OLDER PEOPLE THAT WERE IN THERE FOR REASONS OF UH YOU KNOW AGE UH THE MENTALLY ILL PATIENTS COULD WALK RIGHT IN INTO THE ROOMS OR DO WHATEVER THEY WANTED TO BASICALLY BECAUSE IF YOU WERE NT THERE TO WATCH THEM AND KEEP THEM IN THEIR OWN WING THEY COULD THEY HAD FREEDOM TO JUST WALK AROUND AND A LOT OF THEM WERE I THINK THERE WAS A COUPLE THAT WERE SCHIZOPHRENIC AND I REMEMBER ONE TIME WATCHING ONE OF THE UH SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENTS ACTUALLY GO OUT ON I DO NT KNOW WHAT THEY CALL IT A BINGE OR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO SAY IT .
UHHUH .
SHE GRABBED A HOLD OF THIS AND IT WAS KIND OF FUNNY WHEN I LOOKED BACK AT IT BUT I MEAN I REMEMBER THE PATIENT GETTING VERY UPSET THAT WOMAN ACTUALLY PULLED UH THE OTHER PERSON S HAIR I MEAN SHE JUST CAME UP RIGHT BEHIND HIM AND PULLED HIS HAIR YOU KNOW AND IT WAS A GUY THAT WAS JUST REALLY UPSET I MEAN HE SAID WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU THINK YOU RE DOING YOU KNOW AND I LAUGHED AT IT THEN BUT THEN I M THINKING GOD YOU KNOW IF I HAD TO PUT MY PARENTS IN THAT NURSING HOME I WOULD NT WANT THEM THERE SO .
YEAH .
I THINK THERE S LAWS NOW THAT KIND OF PROTECT THAT NURSING HOMES EITHER HAVE TO KEEP THE MENTALLY ILL TOTALLY AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE AND NOT IN THE SAME TYPE OF FACILITIES EVEN THOUGH THEY RE AGING MENTALLY ILL THEY ARE STILL MENTALLY ILL AND A LOT OF THESE OLDER PEOPLE HAVE THEIR YOU KNOW THEY RE NOT INSANE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT THEY DO NT HAVE THESE TENDENCIES TO TO LASH OUT .
TO BE VIOLENT .
BUT SEEING THAT KIND OF MADE ME THINK TWICE ABOUT JEEZ I WOULD NT PUT MY MOTHER FATHER IN THAT NURSING HOME AT ALL .
WAS THIS IN A BIG TOWN OR A LITTLE TOWN .
A SMALL TOWN .
OH REALLY .
YEAH YEAH .
BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THE SMALL TOWN NURSING HOMES THERE S A .
I DO NT KNOW .
LOT MORE PERSONAL ATTENTION .
I DO NT KNOW I I KIND OF LOOK AT IT THIS WAY I THINK IF YOU HAVE A BIG CITY AREA I THINK THERE S MORE PEOPLE TO KEEP WATCH ON IT .
UHHUH YOU HAVE .
AND .
MORE OPTIONS .
YEAH YEAH AND YOU HAVE MORE COMPETITION AND I THINK NURSING HOMES HAVE TO BE BETTER THAN WHEN THERE S ONE NURSING HOME FOR A WHOLE COMMUNITY AND THIS IS BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTYSEVEN THAT I WORKED THERE .
UHHUH .
AND I LOOK BACK AT IT AND SAY JEEZ YOU KNOW I IT WOULD HAVE TO BE AWFULLY BAD FOR ME TO PUT MY PARENTS IN THERE BUT MY GRANDMOTHER UH LATER ON GOT CANCER AND UH COULD NO LONGER WELL ACTUALLY SHE .
OKAY I M HERE .
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT PUBLIC SCHOOLS .
WELL OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE ARE REALLY POOR I FEEL .
UHHUH .
UH I M NOT SURE WHERE GEORGIA RANKS IN THE NATION BUT UH WE RE TOWARD THE BOTTOM .
YEAH .
AND UH THERE S A LOT OF THINGS THAT I SEE THAT ARE SO OBVIOUSLY WRONG .
UHHUH .
THAT YOU WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE EASY TO CORRECT .
RIGHT .
BUT THE SYSTEM DOES NT ALLOW FOR THE CORRECTIONS .
UHHUH .
HOW ABOUT YOU .
WELL THAT S INTERESTING .
I HAVE A SISTER .
WHO USED TO LIVE IN KENNESAW GEORGIA .
OH YES .
AND UH SHE HAS A YOUNG BOY .
ACTUALLY HAS TWO BOYS NOW BUT ONLY HAD ONE WHEN SHE WAS THERE .
AND SHE COMPLAINED QUITE A BIT ABOUT THEIR SCHOOL SYSTEM THERE .
YES .
AND .
AND COBB COUNTY IS BETTER THAN THE COUNTY .
I M IN .
RIGHT .
SHE WAS IN COBB COUNTY .
RIGHT .
I M I CA NT REALLY SAY MUCH ABOUT THE SCHOOLS UP HERE .
I REALLY DO NT COME FROM HERE .
UHHUH .
I M ONLY UP HERE TEMPORARILY ON AN INTERNSHIP BUT .
OKAY .
UH I LIVE IN ORLANDO FLORIDA USUALLY .
AND THE SCHOOLS DOWN THERE FROM WHAT .
I KNOW ARE NOT BAD .
THEY RE PRETTY GOOD .
WELL THAT S GREAT .
BUT I KNOW THAT IN SOME I KNOW IN A LOT OF RURAL AREAS THEY RE NOT THAT GOOD .
UHHUH .
FOR EXAMPLE I HAVE A BROTHER IN NORTH CAROLINA AND HE SAYS THE SCHOOLS THERE ARE ARE INCREDIBLY BAD .
UH JUST TERRIBLE .
WELL I FEEL THAT WE RE WAY BEHIND .
UH I HAVE A SON .
THAT IS IN THE FOURTH GRADE .
HUH .
AND UH THEY HAVE JUST NOW TAKEN UP DIVISION .
WOW .
YEAH .
AND MUMBLEX .
THAT IS SLOW .
UH I E MY HUSBAND AND I GO TO THE STORE AND WE BUY THESE MATH BOOKS AND FRACTIONS AND MULTIPLICATION DIVISION THINGS AND I FEEL LIKE UH THERE ARE SEVERAL AREAS THAT WE RE JUST REALLY REALLY SLOW IN .
UHHUH .
AND UH I DO NT BLAME THE TEACHERS AS MUCH AS I BLAME THE SYSTEM .
IT IS .
WHAT DO YOU THINK S WRONG TO CAUSE THAT .
WELL WELL FOR ONE THING .
THERE S NOT ENOUGH MONEY IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM .
AND THE MONEY .
THEY DO HAVE THEY RE NOT THEY DO NOT USE IT WISELY .
YEAH .
UH SHE MY SON S TEACHER HAS TWENTYSEVEN STUDENTS .
UHHUH .
AND THAT S CERTAINLY IS A LOT OF STUDENTS FOR ONE PERSON TO DEAL .
YEAH .
WITH ON AN .
EVERY DAY BASIS .
UH .
PERHAPS .
BUT MORE THAN THAT I DO NT THINK THAT THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO COMMAND THE ATTENTION OF THE CHILDREN .
YEAH .
AND WHEN YOU HAVE TWO KIDS IN THAT CLASS .
THAT CONSTANTLY KEEPS CA THE CLASS IN AN UPROAR AND YOU RE NOT AT LIBERTY .
YEAH .
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT OTHER THAN GIVE THEM ON CAMPUS ISOLATION OR SEND THEM TO THE PRINCIPAL S OFFICE .
IT .
YEAH THAT S THAT S ONE THING .
I WORRY ABOUT MUMBLEX .
IT YOU KNOW IT CAN IT CAN REALLY BE BAD .
UH ALSO I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF UH HISPANICS .
THERE YOU GO UHHUH .
AND WE HAVE A LOT OF UH THE COUNTY .
I AM I M IN THE MINORITIES ARE MOSTLY HISPANIC .
YEAH .
PROBABLY QUITE A FEW BLACK PEOPLE UP THERE AND AND .
NO .
WE RE FROM A COUNTY WE RE FROM THE COUNTY .
THEY MARCHED IN .
WE RE IN FORSYTH COUNTY .
OH IS THAT RIGHT .
YES AND WE AND THERE S VERY VERY FEW BLACKS .
OH OKAY .
UH SO SO THAT S UH I I HATE TO SAY UH IT S NOT A PROBLEM UH BECAUSE I HATE TO FEEL LIKE THEY ARE A PROBLEM ALTHOUGH THEY ARE .
YEAH BUT YOU KNOW IT IT S YOU DO NT WANT TO SEEM RACIST OR PREJUDICE OR WHATEVER BUT THEN AGAIN .
BUT IT IS A PROBLEM .
YEAH THERE IS NO DENYING THAT THAT .
UH ESPECIALLY IN THE INNER SCHOOLS INNER CITY .
SURE YOU KNOW .
TEACHERS YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THAT TEACHERS HAVE TO SLOW THINGS DOWN FOR PEOPLE .
WHO DO NT UNDERSTAND ESPECIALLY IF THERE S NOT A VERY WELL DEVELOPED SPECIAL EDUCATION PROGRAM AT THE SCHOOL .
WELL AND YOU CA NT PUT ALL THE CHILDREN IN SPECIAL EDUCATION .
THAT S RIGHT YOU CA NT DO THAT .
UH AND IF THE PARENTS DO NOT CARE ENOUGH TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN WHETHER THE HOMEWORK IS DONE .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW .
SEE I GREW UP IN NEBRASKA .
UHHUH .
AND THE SCHOOL THAT I WENT TO THERE WAS FANTASTIC .
IT I I REALLY CONSIDER MYSELF VERY VERY LUCKY .
UH WE HAD A SCHOOL .
THAT HAD CLASSES PROBABLY ABOUT THE SAME SIZE .
YOU RE TALKING TWENTYSEVEN THIRTY KIDS TO SC TO A CLASS .
YEAH .
BUT .
BUT YOUR TEACHER HAD CONTROL .
YEAH .
WE ZIPPED RIGHT ALONG YOU KNOW .
I I .
UHHUH .
WAS I WAS DOING MATHEMATICS FRACTIONS AND DIVISION AND MULTIPLICATION BY THE THIRD GRADE EASILY .
YEAH .
I I .
UH .
BELIEVE I WAS TOO .
UHHUH .
BUT YOU RE RIGHT YOU KNOW .
WITH ALL THIS DO NT HURT THE KIDS AND DO NT ABUSE THEIR RIGHTS YOU VE ALSO TAKEN .
UHHUH .
SOMETHING AWAY FROM THE DISCIPLINE I THINK .
UH WELL IT IT REALLY IS A CONCERN OF MINE BECAUSE IF WE COULD AFFORD IT MY SON WOULD BE IN PRIVATE SCHOOL .
YEAH .
WE JUST CAN NOT AFFORD IT .
RIGHT .
I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU IF THERE IF THAT WAS AN OPTION .
UH IF .
UH GUY UH SOME OF MY THINGS I I D LIKE TO HAVE A SHORT WORK WEEK .
OH OKAY .
YOU KNOW AND AND WE NEED YOU KNOW BETTER HEALTH INSURANCE AND YOU KNOW CAU .
OKAY WE CAN START OFF THERE .
LET S JUST GET STARTED .
OKAY .
IF YOU DO NT WANT TO YOU KNOW UH TALK ABOUT IT NOW AND THEN .
OKAY .
BE BORED WHEN WE GET TO IT .
OKAY SO I JUST PRESS ONE THEN RIGHT .
RIGHT .
OKAY READY .
YEP .
OKAY .
SO SO YOU THINK UH I THINK THAT A SHORT WORK WEEK IS REAL NICE .
UH I HAVE A THIRTYSEVEN HOUR WORK WEEK .
HOW ABOUT YOU .
WELL WELL RIGHT NOW I I M JUST A STUDENT .
I ONLY WORK PART TIME BUT I VE WORK IN THE JOB FORCE BEFORE .
UHHUH .
AND FORTY HOURS IS JUST TOO LONG .
YOU JUST DO NT HAVE ANY TIME TO DO ANYTHING .
IT SEEMS LIKE SATURDAY YOU GET GET OFF BUT SUNDAY YOU RE GETTING READY FOR MONDAY .
AND IF WE GET HAVE A .
UHHUH .
IF WE COULD HAVE A THIRTYTWO HOUR WORK WEEK WITH THAT HAPPEN IS THAT FOR EVERY FOUR PEOPLE WE COULD GIVE ANOTHER JOB .
RIGHT .
AND THEN THAT WAY .
EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE A THREE DAY HOLIDAY OKAY .
AND THAT WAY THAT MORE THAT WOULD MAKE A BIGGER MARKET .
WE D HAVE UH MORE RECREATION .
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TIME TO DO IT .
THERE WOULD BE LESS OF A STRESS LEVEL .
WE D HAVE WE D HAVE LESS CRIME .
WE D HAVE TO WE D HAVE TO BUILD LESS PRISONS YOU KNOW LESS POLICE FORCE .
YEAH IT .
ALL MAKES SENSE TO ME .
ALTHOUGH THERE MAY BE MORE CRIME .
I MEAN IF PEOPLE HAVE MORE LEISURE TIME .
IT S NOT CLEAR .
AND THAT .
IT IT THAT S THAT S A POSSIBILITY .
YEAH .
ONE ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THEY RE FACING NOW A LOT OF PEOPLE NOW IS THAT THE HEALTH INSURANCE IS THAT THE SMALL BUSINESS CA NT CA NT OFFER HEALTH INSURANCE .
UHHUH .
AND IT IT S TOO COSTLY AND WHAT WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THAT THEY RE ON A POLICY WHERE THEY HAVE X AMOUNT OF USERS IN IT OKAY .
SO THEY GET A SPECIFIC RATE .
WELL WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT IF PEOPLE START BECOMING HAVING CHRONIC ILLNESS AND AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHAT HAPPENED AND WHERE THEY REALLY HAVE TO SPEND OUT A LOT OF MONEY .
RIGHT .
FOR ONE PARTICULAR IT S CALLED A .
A GROUP WELL WHAT WILL WELL WHAT HAPPENS THEN IS THAT THEY CANCEL BECAUSE THEY JUST CA NT CANCEL AN INDIVIDUAL .
SO THEY THEY HAVE TO CANCEL JUST LIKE LIFE INSURANCE .
THEY HAVE TO CANCEL EVERYTHING .
UHHUH .
SO WHAT .
THEY DO IS THAT THAT THEY CANCEL THE INSURANCE AND THEN ALL THE PEOPLE DO NT HAVE ANY INSURANCE COVERAGE .
RIGHT .
SO .
BUT I M I M YOU KNOW I M I M SATISFIED WITH MY JOB .
I M I M AN ENGINEERING STUDENT .
RIGHT .
AND I WORK FOR MY INSTRUCTOR AND I M I M NOT A TYPICAL STUDENT .
I M I M OLDER .
I M I M IN MY THIRTIES OKAY .
YEAH .
AND SO I HAVE A LOT OF JOB EXPERIENCE AND MY INSTRUCTOR THRIVES ON THAT BECAUSE HE CAN JUST TELL ME .
WHAT .
HE WANTS AND HE CAN GIVE ME .
ACCESS AND TELL ME .
WHAT TO DO AND JUST TURN ME LOOSE .
YEAH .
BUT IN IN THE SAME TOKEN IT S A VERY REALLY ENJOYABLE FOR ME BECAUSE I DO NT HAVE TO HAVE YOU KNOW NOBODY BREATHING DOWN MY BACK AND .
UHHUH .
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I I REALLY HATE ABOUT JOBS .
I DO NT I DO NT LIKE BOSSES .
THAT THAT YOU KNOW WANT TO YELL AT YOU AND YOU KNOW ARE DOWN ON YOUR BACK AND ALL THIS AND THAT .
I I JUST REALLY CA NT DEAL WITH THAT SO .
YEAH .
WHAT KIND OF WHAT KIND OF JOBS HAVE YOU DONE .

UHHUH .
UH I MY JOB HAS MOST OF THE BENEFITS I WANT .

OH WELL SEE I M GETTING SO MANY CALLS TO TEXAS .
THIS IS THE VERY FIRST ONE .
I VE I VE TALKED TO .
OH WELL GREAT .
YEAH I VE BEEN DOING IT FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS AND UH NO MY .
UHHUH .
NO MY .
OKAY WHAT WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE OR YOU WANT SALARY TOO PLUS WHAT WHAT S MOST IMPORTANT TO YOU .
WELL AS FAR AS TANGIBLE BENEFITS GO I WOULD SAY THAT UH HEALTH INSURANCE OF ALL FORMS IS PROBABLY MY NEXT MOST IMPORTANT CONCERN .
RIGHT .
I FEEL THAT A COMPANY THAT CAN PROVIDE GOOD HEALTH BENEFITS SUCH AS HEALTH CARE DENTAL AND VISION .
UHHUH .
AS WELL AS GOOD LONGTERM AND SHORTTERM DISABILITY PLANS UH GOES A LONG WAY TOWARD SATISFYING MY NEEDS .
UHHUH WELL I LL TELL YOU I THINK THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I VE UH I M NOT WORKING RIGHT AT THE MOMENT BUT THE COMPANY THAT I DID WORK FOR EXCUSE ME I HAD HEALTH BENEFITS YOU KNOW DENTAL VISION ALL THAT PENSION PLAN UH NOW I DO NT HAVE THAT ALTHOUGH I DO HAVE A PENSION THAT I M DRAWING FROM THEM WHICH THANK GOD I HAD .
RIGHT .
BUT UH MAN I THINK THOSE MEDICAL BENEFITS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT UH .
YOU YOU REALLY DO NT REALIZE HOW IMPORTANT THEY ARE UNTIL YOU FIND YOURSELF ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE WITHOUT THEM AND HAVING TO COVER YOUR OWN MEDICAL AND UH YOU CAN QUICKLY SEE WHERE THEY BECOME A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR YOUR COMPENSATION PACKAGE .
RIGHT UH I SHOULD KNOCK ON WOOD I HAVE NT YOU KNOW HAD ANY SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS OR ANYTHING I VE ONLY PROBABLY BEEN TO THE DOCTOR A COUPLE OF TIMES SINCE I LEFT WORK AND IT WAS ONLY FOR A COLD YOU KNOW AND THEY CA NT REALLY DO ANYTHING FOR YOU ANYHOW SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL NOT EVEN GO .
YEAH THEY LOOK AT YOU SAY WELL YOU RE STILL BREATHING SO UH .
YEAH RIGHT OH YOU VE GOT A COLD GO HOME AND TAKE UH LIQUIDS AND UH REST .
YEAH .
BUT .
UH THAT IS DEFINITELY THE MOST IMPORTANT UH PENSION I GUESS IS NEXT UH THANK GOD THAT I HAD ONE I DO NT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SALARY EMPLOYEES WHEN UH THE COMPANY WENT BANKRUPT BUT I WAS UNION SO MINE WAS BEING PUT INTO A LIKE A TRUST FUND YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
SO BUT I DO NT KNOW IF THEY EVER GOT ANYTHING OR IF THEY LOST ALL OF THEIRS OR .
I SUSPECT THAT IT JUST DISAPPEARED .
YEAH THAT S WHAT I WAS THINKING TOO I REALLY FEEL SORRY FOR ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT SPENT ALL THAT TIME THERE YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
SO WHERE WHAT COMPANY DO YOU WORK FOR .
UH I WORK FOR A LITTLE STARTUP COMPANY HERE IN PITTSBURGH CALLED TRANS ARK UH .
UM UHHUH .
HAVE YOU HEARD OF THEM .
NO .
THEY WE DO UH DISTRIBUTIVE SYSTEM SOFTWARE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
FOR UNIX BASED WORKSTATIONS .
UHHUH .
SO .
NO I I WORKED FOR A TRUCKING COMPANY P I E NATION WIDE YOU PROBABLY HEARD OF THAT .
AH YES YES IN FACT MY MOM DRIVES TRUCKS SO .
OH DOES SHE REALLY .
YES .
OH HOW ABOUT THAT .
SO YEAH I SEE UH AFTER THE MERGER UH YOU SEE A LOT OF RYDER PIE STUFF ON THE ROAD .
WELL YOU DID .
SO DID DID RYDER GET OUT OF THE BUSINESS IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED OR .
WELL RYDER AND P I E WENT TOGETHER .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW AND THEN THEN THAT ENDED IT .
HUH SO THAT THE MERGER PRETTY MUCH ENDED THE WHOLE THING .
IT REALLY DID IT S IT STARTED I THINK A LITTLE BIT BEFORE THAT BUT THAT WHEN P I E AND AND RYDER WENT TOGETHER WHY THAT WAS DOWNHILL FROM THEN ON YOU KNOW .
YEAH AND THE THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LEAVE A JOB YOU CAN CONTINUE YOUR BENEFITS FOR SOME FINITE PERIOD OF TIME .
RIGHT .
BUT WHEN WHEN THE COMPANY GOES BANKRUPT I MEAN THE THEY RE JUST CUT OFF COMPLETELY AND YOU RE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OWN .
RIGHT .
AND AND THAT S EXCEEDINGLY EXPENSIVE .
YES IT WAS OVER THREE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS A MONTH IF WE WANTED TO CONTINUE OUR OWN BENEFITS WE COULD DO THAT FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS .
RIGHT .
BUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS A MONTH GOD THAT S TERRIBLE .
IT S DEFINITELY EXCESSIVE .
YOU KNOW SO BUT ANYHOW UH AND JOBS ARE NT THAT HARD TO FIND TO GET ANOTHER ONE THAT DOES PAY YOUR BENEFITS YOU KNOW .
TRUE .
AND A LOT OF THEM THAT IF YOU DO GET A JOB THEY DO NT PAY BENEFITS .
YEAH THEY RE STARTING TO TO CUT BACK ESPECIALLY STARTUPS I KNOW HERE AT TRANS ARK WE GET UH WE GET HEALTH CARE AND THAT S IT .
UHHUH .
I MEAN THERE S NO DENTAL OR VISION .
UHHUH .
AND THE THE SHORTTERM DISABILITY POLICY IS IS A NINETY DAY POLICY AND THERE IS NO LONGTERM DISABILITY POLICY .
HUH .
SO YOU KNOW AT LEAST IN THE CASE OF THIS PARTICULAR COMPANY THEY TEND TO SCRIMP A LITTLE BIT THERE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND YOU KNOW OF COURSE THEY CAN USE THE EXCUSE WELL WE RE STARTUP .
YEAH RIGHT BUT YOU KNOW WHAT S HAPPENING IS THE DISABILITY PLAN YOU KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE ARE LYING ABOUT THEIR THINGS GOD THERE S BEEN BIG ARTICLES IN THE PAPER ABOUT THAT UH YOU KNOW THEY CLAIM A BACK INJURY AND THEN SOMEONE GOES OUT AND SPIES ON THEM AND THEY RE LIFTING REFRIGERATORS INTO TRUCKS AND .
RIGHT .
AND EVERYTHING ELSE YOU KNOW SO I DO NT KNOW WHAT S HAPPENING AND WHAT S GOING TO HAPPEN BUT UH .
WELL THAT CERTAINLY DOES NT HELP MATTERS ANY I MEAN YOU YOU GET PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO PUT THEIR NECK ON THE LINE TO GET YOU YOU KNOW THESE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS .
OKAY .
HOW DO YOU KEEP UP WITH CURRENT EVENTS .

AND WE DID THAT PRETTY SUCCESSFULLY FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS AND THEN WE STARTED BORROWING FROM ONE ENVELOPE TO PUT IT IN THE OTHER ENVELOPE AND IN ABOUT TWO MONTHS WE WERE BACK TO DOING THE SAME THING .
WE ALWAYS DO .
HUH .
THE UH I HAD A PARTTIME JOB AROUND OH GOSH FIFTEEN YEARS AGO SEVENTYSIX .
AND UH UH THIS WAS A SORT OF A CAREER SHIFT AT THE TIME AND SO I WAS WILLING TO TAKE A HALF TIME JOB TO DO THAT .
AND I ACTUALLY DID MY BANK ACCOUNT WOULD UH I D I I KEPT BOUNCING CHECKS JUST AT THE END OF THE MONTH BUT I I HAD MISCALCULATED .
I WELL I DID NT KEEP A BALANCE .
IT .
S .
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS .
I NEVER HAD TO IN THE PAST .
I ALWAYS KEPT PLENTY OF MONEY IN MY CHECKING ACCOUNT BUT WHEN YOU RE ONLY EARNING HALF THE SALARY .
EVEN THOUGH I WAS NT SPENDING MUCH MONEY I SOMETIMES I SOMETIMES WOULD JUST THINGS WOULD GET TO TIGHT .
UH AND SOMETIMES WHAT .
I WOULD DO IS KEEP A PIECE OF PAPER IN MY WALLET AND EVERY TIME .
I UH I SPENT MONEY I MEAN CASH MOSTLY I WOULD UH WRITE IT DOWN .
UHHUH .
SO I COULD SEE AT THE END OF A MONTH HOW MUCH I SPENT ON FOOD SO I COULD DO BETTER PLANNING .
UHHUH .
BUT I WOULD FORGET TO WRITE THE THINGS DOWN AND IT THAT I I DO NT KNOW IF I EVER WENT AS FAR AS THREE MONTHS OR NOT I I IN KEEPING THAT KIND OF DATA .
I CERTAINLY HAVE NT DONE THAT IN SIXTEEN YEARS OR WHATEVER .
I EVEN FIND NOW LIKE WITH THE AUTOMATIC TELLERS I LL GO TAKE MONEY OUT OF THAT .
YEAH .
AND THEN I FORGET TO TAKE THAT OUT OF MY CHECKING ACCOUNT .
UHHUH .
AND UH .
YEAH .
SO I I I LEAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A SLUSH FUND IN MY CHECKING ACCOUNT AND I FIGURE THAT SO THE BALANCE SHOWING IN THE CHECKING ACCOUNT IS ALWAYS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT THAT WHAT S REALLY THERE .
UHHUH .
AND I FIGURE THAT GIVES ME .
ROOM FOR THE MISTAKES I MAKE .
UHHUH .
THE UH I I I HAVE TO SAY THAT LET S SEE AT THIS POINT ON I DO NT RUN OUT OF MONEY .
UH AND IT UH A AND I DO NT I MEAN SOMEDAY IF I WERE TO GET REMARRIED I MIGHT WANT TO BUY A HOUSE .
WHICH REQUIRES LOTS OF MONEY .
WHICH .
I DO NT HAVE AND I I I THINK MY STRATEGY IF IF I MAY I I IS TO IS TO NOT SPEND MONEY .
I MEAN I DO NT HAVE EXPENSIVE TASTES .
I DO NT GO OUT .
I MEAN I BUY A CAR WELL THE LAST CAR .
I GOT RID OF I D HAD IT WAS NINETEEN YEARS OLD .
YEAH .
PE PEOPLE WERE EMBARRASSED FOR ME .
I MEAN IT WAS IT WAS A GOOD CAR AND .
BUT IT WAS STILL RUNNING .
OH IT WAS GREAT .
MY MY MECHANICS LOVED IT BECAUSE IT WAS AN OLD IT WAS A SIXTYFIVE BUICK AND IT JUST WOULD NT STOP .
UH AND IT I I JUST DID NT FEEL THE NEED FOR A NEW CAR .
IT IS NT LIKE I COULD NT AFFORD ONE .
UHHUH .
UH AND NOW I MEAN I I DO NT UH I TEND TO EAT EXPENSIVE FOOD .
I MEAN I DO NT MIND BUYING A GOOD STEAK BUT FOR ME I ONLY DO THAT EVERY WEEK OR WITHOUT EVEN .
I MEAN MAYBE ONCE A MONTH .
YEAH .
I MEAN YOU BUY A A TENDERLOIN STEAK IT COSTS OUTRAGEOUS LIKE TWELVE DOLLARS .
A POUND .
YOU BUY A A LESS THAN HALF A POUND SO IT S SIX OR SEVEN DOLLARS .
TO ME I REALIZE IF YOU HAVE EIGHT KIDS YOU RE NOT GOING TO RUN OUT AND DO THAT .
NOT VERY OFTEN .
BUT BUT I M JUST I M JUST SAYING AS A SINGLE PERSON THAT S THAT S A DROP IN THE BUCKET .
AND SO IF YOU RE EXTRAVAGANT ON HOW YOU BUY FOOD IT DOES NT ADD UP .
IF YOU RE BUYING I MEAN IF YOU RE NOT GOING TO SUPER EXPENSIVE RESTAURANTS WHICH .
I DO NT CARE TO GO TO .
THAT S RIGHT .
SO SO THAT S I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS I DO NT NEED TO BUDGET IS THAT I DO NT HAVE I DO NT I DO NT HAVE TO HOLD MYSELF BACK FROM BUYING THAT EXPENSIVE THING BECAUSE I CA NT AFFORD IT BECAUSE I M NOT INTERESTED IN THAT EXPENSIVE THING .
A LOT OF .
YOU WANT TO GO FIRST .
NO YOU CAN START .
OKAY .
UH ONE OF THE THINGS THEY TALKED ABOUT WAS UH DID WE D WH WHAT DO WE THINK ABOUT A JUDGE MAKING THE DECISION .
UHHUH .
AND I REALLY DO NT AGREE WITH THAT .
I THINK THAT THE TRIAL BY JURY IS BETTER UH YOU KNOW THAN E HAVING A UNANIMOUS DECISION RATHER THAN TO HAVE ONE PERSON BE RESPONSIBLE .
I DO NT THINK THAT THEY COULD BE OBJECTIVE IN EVERY CASE EVERY TIME .
RIGHT .
YO YOU KNOW WHAT .
I MEAN .
RIGHT .
THERE S THERE TH THIS TOPIC IS KIND OF MUTE .
UH .
YEAH .
THERE THERE S NO WAY .
WE WE COULD NT SURVIVE IN A SY IN A JUROR SYST IN A TRIAL SYSTEM WITHOUT A JURY .
RIGHT .
UH ONE MAN CAN NEVER BE ONE MAN ONE WOMAN CAN NEVER BE OBJECTIONABLE IN EVERY CASE .
THAT S IT .
UH EVERY PERSON HAS THEIR OPINIONS AND THAT S WHY JURY SELECTION IS OFTEN VERY DIFFICULT .
UH .
WELL I I FEEL THE OTHER THING TOO UH THEY WERE SAYING UH YOU KNOW WHAT .
NEW WAYS COULD Y COULD IT YOU YOU KNOW CHANGE THE SYSTEM .
I I REALLY THINK THAT UH WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME UH GOING THROUGH APPEAL AFTER APPEAL AFTER APPEAL AFTER APPEAL .
I MEAN I IF YOU GO TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND ESPECIALLY IF A PERSON HAS CONFESSED .
IF THEY HAVE BEEN CAUGHT YOU KNOW POINT BLANK IN THE CRIME .
RIGHT .
THERE S UH NO QUESTION .
IT S BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT .
YOU KNOW ALL THESE THINGS .
I MEAN YOU KNOW .
WE VE GONE THROUGH THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN .
RIGHT .
THEY SHOULD NT ALLOW AN APPEAL .
AND IT CAN GO ON FOR TEN TWENTY .
YEARS .
YEP .
I I THINK THIS IS A LITTLE RIDICULOUS .
UHHUH .
I THINK THE ONLY PEOPLE .
WHO BENEFIT FROM THAT ARE THE LAWYERS .
OH THAT S RIGHT .
I WORK FOR A LAW FIRM MUMBLEX .
I I M SERIOUS .
AND I THINK THAT THE LAWYERS HAVE CAUSED A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS THA THAT EXIST IN THE S IN THE CRIMINAL SYSTEM TODAY .
WITH PLEA BARGAINING .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW IF SOMEONE IS ILL .
WELL PLEA BAR PLEA BARGAINING IS A DIFFERENT STORY .
WELL .
PLEA BARGAINING IS SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT .
THAT THAT ACTUALLY PREVENTS TRIALS .
OR AT LEAST SPEEDS .
THEM UP .
WELL I KNOW .
THAT S MUMBLEX WHAT .
I M SAYING .
BUT I THINK A LOT OF ALL OF THE WHOLE CRIMINAL SYSTEM IS MESSED UP IN IN THAT REGARD .
I MEAN YOU KNOW PEOPLE .
WHO COMMIT UH CRIMES THAT THEY I DO NT KNOW HOW IT WORKS EXACTLY BUT .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW THEY GET LESSER SENTENCES AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE JAILS ARE FULL OF PEOPLE YOU KNOW UH .
RIGHT .
AND THAT THEY HAVE TO DO SOMETHING .
BUT I THINK THAT THE REASON .
THEY ARE FULL IS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IT .
HUH .
YO YOU KNOW WHAT .
I M SAYING .
THAT W WE DO NT HAVE UH WELL A LOT OF STATES DO NT HAVE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT .
RIGHT .
AND UH .
WE DO .
I I THINK THEY SHOULD .
I AND I THINK IF A PERSON IS GUILTY OF TAKING SOMEONE .
S LIFE AND LIKE YOU SAY IT S IT S THERE S NO DOUBT WHATSOEVER .
LIKE DRUNK DRIVERS .
THAT KILL PEOPLE AND UH YOU KNOW ALL .
RIGHT .
THEY THEY RE CAUGHT DEAD TO RIGHTS .
I I JUST THINK THAT THAT S THEY VE THEY VE TAKEN A LIFE AND IF THEY SHOULD PAY FOR IT WITH THEIR LIFE .
RIGHT .
WHEN YOU RE SAYING AS FAR AS THE APPEAL UH PROCEDURE WAS CONCERNED .
YEAH .
WE JUST HAVE THE CASE I M I M SURE YOU VE PROBABLY HEARD OF MARION BERRY .
UHHUH .
UH HIS F LAST APPEAL WAS WAS DENIED TWO DAYS BEFORE HIS SENTENCE WAS UP .
OH REALLY .
SO I MEAN HIS APPEAL WAS DENIED AND TWO DAYS LATER HE GOT OUT OF JAIL .
IT UH .
FOR COCAINE POSSESSION .
YEAH .
BUT UH THAT WAS ABSURD .
THERE IS NEVER THERE WAS NO REASON .
I KNOW THAT THAT MUMBLEX .
THE APPEAL PROCESS SHOULD HAVE DRAGGED ON THAT LONG FOR A SIX MONTH SENTENCE .
UHHUH .
AND I DO NT KNOW .
UH WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO CHANGE IT .
TO MAKE IT BETTER .
WELL UH THE THE ONLY I CAN I WA YOU KNOW THE APPEAL PROCEDURE IS THE ONLY THING .
I CAN POSSIBLY THINK OF .
UH A LIKE I SAID AS FAR AS REMOVING OF THE JURY AND HAVING THE JUDGE SENTENCE THAT S ABSURD .
THERE S NO WAY .
THAT COULD WORK .
OH YEAH .
I I I DO NT AGREE WITH THAT AT ALL .
UH BUT .
IMAGINE THE GUILT .
THAT PERSON WOULD HAVE .
I MEAN MUMBLEX .
OH EXACTLY .
BURNED OUT .
THERE S .
EXACTLY .
THERE S NO POSSIBLE WAY THAT YOU COULD UH YOU KNOW FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF .
RIGHT .
IF YOU HAD TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT DAY AFTER DAY .
NO ONE WOULD WANT THE JOB .
NO .
NOT REALLY .
UH AND YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID THE YOU KNOW EVERYONE HAS THEIR OPINIONS ABOUT EVERY CASE .
WELL W DO YOU THINK PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE A TRIAL IS THEY RE CAUGHT DEAD TO RIGHTS LIKE .
OH YEAH .
I I FEEL THAT EVERYONE IS EVERYONE IS UH ENTITLED TO A TRIAL BY JURY .
THAT THAT THAT RIGHT S .
I MEAN SUPPOSING I COME UP TO YOU AND I JUST POINT BLANK KILL YOU .
WELL I MEAN WERE THERE WITNESSES .
IN OTHER WORDS YOU RE SAYING THAT W YOU HAVE TO FIND OUT WHETHER IT S PREMEDITATED OR .
RIGHT .
WHAT .
THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE .
RIGHT .
THAT YOU CA NT YOU CA NT REMOVE THE JURY REGARDLESS OF THE CASE .
YEAH .
I MEAN YOU COULD HAVE FIFTY PEOPLE IN AUDIENCE WATCHING .
YEAH .
A MURDER TAKE PLACE AND YOU YOU D STILL THERE S STILL MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES .
WELL I I .
OKAY .
UH GENERALLY I GET UH YOU KNOW MOST OF MY NEWS UH IN THE YOU KNOW WEEKLY MAGAZINES LIKE TIME NEWSWEEK AND AND UH U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT .
WITH WITH OCCASIONAL SMATTERINGS OF OF UH YOU KNOW THE WALL STREET JOURNAL AND OF COURSE THE LOCAL PAPER .
UHHUH .
BUT UH MY MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS I REALLY DO NT ENOUGH TIME TO TO LOOK AT THE ARTICLES .
EVERY DAY AND AND GO THROUGH A PAPER YOU KNOW EXHAUST THE DETAILS .
SO THAT S WHY I CONCENTRATE ON WEEKLY MAGAZINES .
DO YOU THINK THAT THE WEEKLY MAGAZINES PROVIDE YOU WITH AS MUCH DETAIL INFORMATION AS YOU D LIKE .
WELL YES .
I I WELL I I DO NT THINK I HAVE THE TIME TO REALLY BECOME A STUDENT IN EVERY ARTICLE .
UHHUH .
AND AND SO I I I LIKE THE WEEKLY MAGAZINES UH BECAUSE I IT GIVES ME YOU KNOW THE HIGH POINTS OF WHAT S GOING ON .
UHHUH .
UH BUT MANY TIMES UH YOU KNOW THE THE LOCAL UH THE LOCAL NEWS KIND OF SUFFERS YOU KNOW .
BUT HERE I AM YOU KNOW CHEEK BY JOWL WITH OUR NATION S CAPITAL AND .
OH THAT S RIGHT .
YOU RE VERY CLOSE ACTUALLY .

UH YOU KNOW I DO NT REALLY FEEL AS THOUGH I VE A GOTTEN SUFFICIENT UH YOU KNOW DOSE OF NEWS .
THAT WAY .
YEAH .
A LOT OF MY INFORMATION COMES FROM SEVERAL SOURCES .
PROBABLY PRETTY HIGH UP ON THE LIST IS NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO .
UHHUH .
UH WHICH .
I LIKE .
YES .
UH I I THINK IT S FAIRLY OBJECTIVE AND I ALWAYS LIKE THE LETTERS THAT THEY READ WHICH TEND TO ACCUSE THEM OF BEING TOO LIBERAL AND TOO CONSERVATIVE .
AND WHILE THERE S AN INHERENT UH FILTERING PROCESS GOING ON JUST BY THE LETTERS THEY CHOOSE TO READ UH I ALWAYS FIGURE IT S A GOOD THING WHEN ANY GIVEN GROUP IS BEING ACCUSED BY EACH SIDE OF UH FAVORING THE OTHER SIDE .
THAT S THAT S POTENTIAL INDICATION OF BALANCE .
AND GENERALLY I REALLY DO BELIEVE THEY ARE PRETTY BALANCED .
UH I ALSO READ TIME MAGAZINE AND WE GET ONE OF THE DAILY NEWSPAPERS AROUND HERE WHERE WE GO THROUGH VARIOUS SECTIONS OF THE UH VARIOUS UH OF THE ARTICLES AND THE FRONT SECTION AND UH .
WELL THE MERCURY AND THE AND THE AND THE CHRONICLE ARE THE ONLY THINGS .
THAT ARE REALLY CAN .
OH .
STAND UP THERE .
OH YOU .
ST DID YOU USE TO LIVE AROUND HERE .
UH REDWOOD CITY .
I USE TO WORK AT ANTEKS .
OH OKAY .
OH YEAH OKAY .
I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THAT IS .
ANTEKS AMDAHL AND PLACES LIKE THAT .
YEAH WE WE GET THE MERCURY .
WHICH .
I GENERALLY THINK IS ACTUALLY A PRETTY GOOD NEWSPAPER .
YEAH .
A THE NEWSPAPER .
I REALLY BEEN IMPRESSED WITH IT WHEN I VE READ IT AT TIMES I AT WELL THE LOS ANGELES TIMES .
UHHUH .
WHICH .
I VE FOUND TO BE A UH A VERY GOOD QUALITY UH NEWSPAPER AND I LIKE A LOT OF THE ARTICLES THERE .
TH THE OTHER THING WHEN YOU SAID WE DO NT HAVE CABLE T V SO BUT THE OTHER THING THAT YOU REFERRED TO THAT ALWAYS SOUNDS REALLY INTERESTING TO ME IS IS CALLED C SPAN .
YES .
I I VE I ENJOY SEE THEY HAVE UH WE HAVE TWO THE BOTH C SPANS HERE .
BUT BUT .
BOTH .
REALLY THE TH ON THE PUBLIC T V YOU KNOW MACNEIL LEHRER .
UHHUH .
IS ONE IS AN HOUR S PROGRAM THAT I ALWAYS IF IF I WATCH ANY NEWS PROGRAM IT WILL BE MACNEIL LEHRER .
UHHUH .
AND AND OCCASIONALLY C SPAN .
I I LIKE A I SAW THE UH THE UH THE THE TAPES .
THAT WERE THAT WERE RUN OF MARION BERRY S DRUG BUST WAS THE WHOLE THING WAS WAS RUN ON THAT AND .
OH I NEVER SAY THAT .
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN INTERESTING .
AND AND A ALSO THEY HAVE THE UH THE UH UH PARLIAMENT S QUESTION AND ANSWER PERIOD .
IT .
YEAH .
I I THINK THAT S ALWAYS FASCINATING .
I WISH I WISH WE HAD SOMETHING .
WHEN WH WHEN IT .
FIRST UH YOU KNOW WHEN IT FIRST TUNED IN ON THAT I YOU KNOW IT S ONE .
THAT S I THINK IT WAS SOMEBODY WAS JUST SCARCELY JUST JUST RIPPING THE HELL OUT OF SOMEO ANOTHER PERSON .
AND I AND EVERYBODY WAS YOU KNOW MAKING NOISE IN THE BACKGROUND .
AND THEN .
BUT IT S USUALLY THE PRIME MINISTER RIGHT .
YEAH .
HERE S THIS DUDE IN A WIG .
THATCHER MAJOR .
AND I SAID TO MYSELF IT S ANOTHER MONTY PYTHON THAT I DID NT KNOW ABOUT .
AND THEN AND THEN UP JUMPS MARGARET THATCHER OFF HER GREEN BENCH AND I SAID OH IT S PARLIAMENT .
WHICH COULD BE ANOTHER MUMBLEX OF MONTY PYTHON .
YEAH .
SO I I THOUGHT TO MYSELF I CA NT WAIT .
I M GOING OVER TO TO BRITAIN IN MID YOU KNOW IN MIDMAY .
I I I M GOING TO UH YOU KNOW A YOU KNOW APR APPROACH MY UH YOU KNOW THIS IS HOW I DISCOVERED YOU KNOW THE QUE THE PRIME MINISTER S YOU KNOW QUESTION AND ANSWER PERIOD YOU KNOW .
P .
I I HAVE SEEN THAT AND UH A ASIDE FROM THE LEVEL OF WIT .
WHICH IS MUCH HIGHER THAN GENERALLY IN AMERICAN POLITICS UH WHICH .
I REALLY ENJOY .
I REALLY LIKE THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO ASK HARD REAL QUESTIONS I THINK .
AND IT S UNLIKE THE FAIRLY CONTROLLED UH PRESS CONFERENCES THAT PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES HAVE HERE WHERE THEY THEY ALWAYS SEEM .
YEAH .
WELL UH PREFERRED BENEFITS UH I WORKED FOR A LARGE CORPORATION IN THE PAST AND I THINK LARGE CORPORATIONS CAN GIVE BETTER BENEFITS THAN SMALL CORPORATIONS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW I M WORKING FOR A VERY SMALL CORPORATION WHERE THE OWNER IS RIGHT THERE AND UH THERE IS A LOT OF PROFIT THAT S COMING IN BUT WHEN IT COMES TO UH SMALL CORPORATIONS THEY SEEM TO POCKET IT A LITTLE BIT QUICK QUICKLY OR WHATEVER OR HOWEVER YOU WANT TO SAY IT AND UH THE BENEFITS ARE NT AS GREAT WHEN I WORKED FOR A BIG CORPORATION BECAUSE THE BIG CORPORATIONS SEEM TO LOOK AT ITS EMPLOYEES AND SAY OKAY WE VE GOT THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY LET S PUT INTO THIS PLAN THIS PLAN YOU GOT FOUR OH ONE K PLANS YOU HAVE UH BETTER VACATION PLANS UH YOU HAVE JUST IN GENERAL MATERNITY LEAVE PLANS .
UHHUH .
THA THAT KIND OF THING BIG CORPORATIONS ARE ABLE TO DO THAT VERSUS SMALL CORPORATIONS UH YOU KNOW THEY JUST DO NT HAVE THE MONEY OR JUST FEEL THAT THERE IS NT THE NEED FOR IT SO I VE WORKED FOR BOTH BIG AND SMALL SO I VE HAD A CHANCE TO KIND OF TAKE A LOOK AT UH THE PROS AND CONS OF BOTH .
RIGHT WELL I VE WORKED FOR UH WELL I WORKED FOR H AND R BLOCK HERE IN MASSACHUSETTS .
SURE .
FOR AWHILE .
UHHUH .
AND THE ONLY THEY EVEN HATE TO GIVE OUT UNEMPLOYMENT .
SURE UHHUH .
AT THE END OF TAX SEASON BECAUSE .
HUH .
THEY YOU KNOW THEY RE FAIRLY EVEN THOUGH THEY RE A LARGE SCALE COMPANY THEY RE VERY .
SURE .
THE OFFICES THE INDIVIDUAL OFFICES ARE VERY SMALL .
UHHUH .
AND NOW I WORK FOR THE FRAMINGHAM SCHOOL TEA SYSTEM BECAUSE I M A TEACHER .
UHHUH SURE .
AND UH WE HAVE MUCH BETTER BENEFITS YOU KNOW IN THE SYSTEM .
UHHUH .
WE HAVE A GOOD PENSION PLAN UH LET ME SEE WE HAVE A PROFIT SHARING PLAN TO A DEGREE .
THAT S PRETTY GOOD FOR YOU KNOW BEING A A SCHOOL DISTRICT TYPE PROGRAM .
RIGHT AND WE HAVE THE EYE GLASSES THE HEALTH CARE .
UHHUH .
AND THE WHOLE KIT AND CABOODLE BECAUSE WHAT .
WOW .
THEY DID IS THEY THREW ALL THE TOWN EMPLOYEES IN TOGETHER .
THAT S EXTREMELY GOOD MUMBLEX .
YEAH MUMBLEX .
LIKE THE SMALL CORPORATION THAT I WORK FOR THERE S NO PENSION PLAN .
REALLY .
THERE S NO TYPE OF UH SAVINGS OF ANY SORT THAT THE COMPANY WILL REIMBURSE YOU FOR THERE S REALLY I THINK YOU RE ALLOWED SO MANY TIMES UH I THINK TWO OR THREE DAYS A W A YEAR IT S NOT ACCUMULATIVE TYPE OF SICK LEAVE .
OH .
UH YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE THAT SO I VE BEEN LOOKING AT BIG CORPORATIONS AND SAYING THE BIG CORPORATION THAT I VE WORKED FOR IN THE PAST HAD THE PENSION PLANS HAD THE BIG HEALTH HEALTH CARE UH YOU HAD YOUR INSURANCE AND YOU DID NT HAVE TO PAY IN AS MUCH AS IF YOU GO TO A A VERY SMALL PLACE UH THEY DO NT HAVE AS GOOD AS INSURANCE PACKAGES AS BIG CORPORATIONS AND .
RIGHT THE ONLY TROUBLE WE VE HAD HERE IN MASSACHUSETTS IS THE TOWN AND STATE EMPLOYEES .
UHHUH .
HAVE RUN INTO PROBLEMS ESPECIALLY THE RETIRED ONES MY FATHER S RETIRED FROM THE TOWN OF FRAMINGHAM .
SURE .
AND HE SAID THAT THEY HAVE NT GOTTEN A A COST OF LIVING RAISE .
NO .
IN OVER .
YEAH .
FIVE YEARS .
YEAH YEAH .
AND HE SAID THAT S THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY STINKS AS FAR AS BEING RETIRED AND .
UHHUH .
BUT I HEAR THAT BILL IS IN THE SENATE RIGHT NOW AND IT S HOPEFULLY .
SURE SURE .
WILL GO THROUGH .
YEAH YEAH .
BUT UH YOU KNOW I THINK THE SCHOOLS ARE AT WHERE THE SCHOOLS IS NT JUST THE SCHOOL SYSTEM .
UHHUH .
AND NOT JUST THE TEACHERS THEY TOOK IN THE WHOLE TOWN PLUS ALL YOU KNOW .
IS IT A UNION .
UH WE HAVE THE TEACHERS UNION .
UHHUH .
WHICH HELPS OUT A LOT BUT THE TOWN OF FRAMINGHAM PAYS THE BENEFITS AND .
OH THAT S PRETTY GOOD .
THAT S ALL THE TOWN WORKERS WATER AND SEWER .
UHHUH .
AND WHERE IT S A VERY LARGE TOWN IT S ACTUALLY SHOULD BE A CITY BUT THEY KEPT IT A TOWN .
SURE .
UH WHERE IT S EXTREMELY LARGE THEY WERE ABLE TO OFFER A LITTLE BIT MORE WHICH WAS .
YEAH .
REALLY GREAT BECAUSE WE DO NT HAVE TO PAY A MAYOR .
UHHUH YEAH YEAH I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN AND THAT S TRUE I MEAN YO I IT DOES END UP BEING QUITE A BIT WHEN YOU HAVE TO HIRE SOMEBODY FOR THAT POSITION SURE YEAH .
RIGHT BECAUSE OF MOST OF OUR YOU KNOW THE TOWN EMPLOYEES AS FAR AS UH ELECTORAL POSITIONS ARE PARTTIME .
UHHUH .
SO IT WORKS OUT GOOD BECAUSE WE .
SURE .
REAP THE BENEFITS OF IT .
UHHUH .
AND UH BUT AS FAR AS SHOPPING FOR A JOB I D RATHER SHOP FOR THE BENEFITS THAN THE SALARY .
WELL THAT S IT YOU KNOW AND AND I VE KIND OF LOOKED AROUND UH AT THAT UH TOO BECAUSE UH SALARY WISE I DO NT THINK I M MAKING AS MUCH WITH A BIG CORPORATION BECAUSE I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT BIG CORPS OR LARGE I M TALKING LIKE HUGH COMPANIES LIKE THREE M UH I M UH HONEYWELL UH TEXAS INSTRUMENTS .
RIGHT .
I KNOW PEOPLE THAT ARE THAT HAVE VACATION TIMES AND BENE BENEFITS THAT I WOULD NT EVEN DREAM OF IN A SMALL CORPORATION YOU BRING IT UP TO THE OWNER AND IT S LIKE COME ON YOU KNOW PARTLY IT S BECAUSE THE OWNER WANTS TO KEEP GETTING RICHER AND RICHER .
RIGHT .
AND AND OF COURSE WHEN IT S A SMALL CORPORATION IT ALSO WANTS TO EXPAND SO THAT MONEY IS SPENT .
DO YOU HAVE ANY .
YES WE DO HAVE A PET WE HAVE A A DOG THAT WE GOT FROM THE UH WELL WE CALL IT THE S P C A IT S THE UH AN FROM AN ANIMAL SHELTER .
UHHUH .
UH HE D COME IN THERE AS A STRAY .
ALL RIGHT .
UH HE S A POMERANIAN AND SHELTIE CROSS .
YEAH .
UH WELL HE WAS VERY WELL TRAINED WHEN WE GOT HIM UH HE S .
OH THAT S GOOD YOU DO NT OFTEN FIND THAT I DO NT THINK .
NO UH WE SUSPECT THAT HE WAS HURT IN AN ACCIDENT YOU KNOW GOT AWAY FROM SOMEBODY TRAVELING THROUGH AND HURT IN AN ACCIDENT .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE A DOG THAT LOOKS AS GOOD AS HE DOES AND IS TRAINED AS WELL IS SOMEONE THAT HAS LOST HIM AND NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LOCATE HIM .
UHHUH .
AND UH IF THEY WERE LOCAL PEOPLE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND HIM .
SURE THERE S A OKAY UH THAT S INTERESTING YEAH THE ONLY PET THAT I VE HAD UH I M A I M A DOCTORAL STUDENT RIGHT NOW .
UHHUH .
AND IN MY IN MY EARLIER DAYS AS A STUDENT I KIND OF TIME SHARED ON A DOG WITH A A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE AND UH IT WAS AN AMAZING DOG IT REALLY WAS THEY HAD HE HAD GOTTEN IT FROM THE POUND AND UH IT IT S A SPANISH POINTER NAMED DOMINO .
OH YEAH .
KIND OF LOOKS LIKE A DOM A DALMATIAN .
UHHUH .
AND WE TRAINED IT FROM A PUP AND BASICALLY IT RIGHT NOW IT IT S FULLY TRAINED AND IT CAN DO A LOT OF THINGS IT WILL GET BEER FOR YOU OUT OF THE FRIDGE AND IT WILL GET THE NEWSPAPER AND DO ALL KINDS OF STUFF SO IT S REALLY IT S IT S KIND OF A SHOW PIECE ANY MORE AND WHENEVER ANYBODY COMES OVER WE ALL HAVE TO SHOW HIM DOMINO YOU KNOW .
OH I THINK SO .
YEAH IT S UH SHE S BEEN A REAL GOOD A REAL GOOD DOG AND UH JUST IT S KIND OF A SHAME THAT I M I M GO I M AWAY FROM IT NOW I I J I ACTUALLY LIVE IN FLORIDA .
UHHUH .
BUT I M ON AN INTERNSHIP UP HERE FOR A YEAR AND THEN I GO BACK DOWN BUT UH YEAH DOMINO S A REAL GOOD DOG .
YEAH .
UH WHAT UH POSSESSED YOU TO GET THE DOG .
WELL I GUESS IN ONE SENSE WE FELT THAT IT IT S NICE TO HAVE A DOG EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE YOU KNOW COMPLICATIONS COME WITH IT .
YEAH .
AND THEN WITH OUR CHILDREN UH AT THE TIME THEY WERE OH GRADE FIVE AND AND GRADE EIGHT SO .
UHHUH .
IT WAS AN AGE WHERE IT WAS UH WE THOUGHT IT WAS BE GOOD FOR THEM TO HAVE THE DISCIPLINE THAT GOES WITH WITH HAVING A PET .
SURE .
UH .
SURE LEARN A BIT LEARN A LITTLE BIT OF DISCIPLINE AND HOW TO CARE FOR IT AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
YEAH RIGHT .
THAT S GOOD THAT KIND OF BUILDS SOME .
SO .
CHARACTER A LITTLE BIT .
WELL THAT S THE IDEA I THINK THE REALITY OF IT IS THAT THEY PERHAPS UH IT DEPENDS ON THE .
ON EVERYONE S DISCIPLINE .
UHHUH .
AND UH FROM THAT ASPECT I M SHORT ON THE DISCIPLINE BECAUSE I DO NT UH ENFORCE THAT THE KIDS LOOK AFTER THE DOG AND UH WE VE HAD HIM ABOUT FOUR YEARS NOW .
UHHUH .
UH BUT I THINK IT DOES IT IT YOU KNOW IT S NECESSARY THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE DISCIPLINE TO LOOK AFTER THE ANIMAL PROPERLY UH .
YEAH THAT S SOMETHING THAT S IMPORTANT FOR SURE .
YEAH .
I THINK UH DO YOU LIVE IN A IN A IN A FAIRLY RURAL PART OF THE UH .
UH .
MUMBLEX OR .
ACTUALLY NO WE LIVE IN A IN AN AREA THAT S OH PROBABLY ABOUT TWO AND A HALF MILES FROM THE UNIVERSITY .
OH I SEE .
UH WE LIVE RIGHT MIGHT SAY WE LIVE RIGHT IN UH IN THE MIDDLE OF A RESIDENTIAL AREA .
UM .
AND UH SO THAT IS NOT AS GOOD UH YOU KNOW THIS DOG BEING A SMALL DOG IT S UH MORE YOU MORE ACCEPTABLE .
YEAH .
BUT AGAIN .
IT S NOT THAT BIG OF A PROBLEM WITH DOMINO SHE WAS FULL GROWN I WOULD ESTIMATE SEVENTY POUNDS .
YEAH .
AND YOU KNOW WE LIVED IN OVIEDO WHICH IS A SMALL TOWN IT S A SUBURB OF ORLANDO .
UHHUH .
BUT THERE S NOT THERE WAS NT A LOT OF ROOM FOR HER TO RUN AROUND AND SHE WAS A DOG THAT LOVED TO RUN SO THAT WAS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM I SAW AND I THINK THAT S ONE OF THE UH THE ISSUES PEOPLE NEED TO THINK ABOUT BEFORE THEY GET A DOG IS YOU KNOW DO YOU HAVE THE ROOM FOR THIS DOG TO RUN AROUND OR S YOU KNOW I GUESS YOU CA NT REALLY SAY FOR CATS ME AND CATS DO NT GET ALONG TOO WELL UH BUT YOU KNOW THAT WHOLE SPACE ISSUE I THINK IS REAL IMPORTANT .
YEAH IT S UH THAT S ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS IT S LIKE UH THERE S A LOT TO BE GAINED FROM A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ANIMAL BUT THE SAME TIME ONE HAS TO RECOGNIZE THE REALITY OF PHYSICAL REQUIREMENTS OF .
RIGHT .
OF THE ANIMAL .
YEAH THAT THAT .
AND THE LARGER THEY ARE THE MORE ROOM THEY NEED TO EXERCISE .
SURE AND THAT S ALL PART OF Y OF KEEPING YOUR PART OF THE RELATIONSHIP .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW SHOWING THE MATURITY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO RECOGNIZE THOSE UH THOSE ISSUES .
WELL .
YOU KNOW AND ALSO THE WHOLE WHOLE THING WITH NOISE MY MOTHER OH SHE FREAKS OUT BECAUSE SHE S GOT NEIGHBORS THAT HAVE DOGS THAT DO NT TRAIN THEM .
UHHUH .
AND YOU KNOW WE H WE HAD A NEIGHBOR IN NEBRASKA WHEN WE LIVED THERE THAT HAD UH BRITTANY SPANIELS AND THEY RE VERY HIGH STRUNG ANIMALS TO BEGIN WITH BUT UH .
SO LET S TALK ABOUT THE UH WONDERFUL ABUSES IN THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA OF PERSONAL PROPERTY TAXES WHEREBY YOU CAN PURCHASE SOMETHING MAIL ORDER AND AFTER THE FACT THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA CAN FIND OUT ABOUT IT AND SEND YOU .
A BILL FOR THE SALES TAX APPROPRIATE TO THAT ITEM THAT YOU PURCHASED AS WELL AS INTEREST AND PENALTIES FROM THE TIME THAT YOU BOUGHT IT .
WHAT DO YOU THINK .
IS PENNSYLVANIA KIND OF OUT OF LINE THERE .
WELL ACTUALLY I DO NT THINK THEY RE OUT OF LINE .
DE DEVIL S ADVOCATE POSSIBLY BUT IT YOU ARE TRYING TO AVOID PAYING TAXES AND WHE WHETHER OR NOT YOU AGREE WITH THAT LAW I YOU RE STILL CIRCUMVENTING IT .
YOU ARE LEGAL IN IN YOUR CIRCUMVENTION OF THAT LAW .
WHAT WHAT IF YOU RE NOT DOING IT IN ORDER TO CIRCUMVENT THE LAW THOUGH .
I MEAN WHAT IF YOU DO NT EVEN REALIZE THAT YOU RE SUBJECT TO PAYING UH INCOME TAX ON SOMETHING THAT YOU PURCHASE MAIL ORDER .
REALLY I I I DO NT THINK THAT S A VALID ARGUMENT .
I THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE QUITE AWARE THEY RE NOT PAYING THAT SIX PERCENT SALES TAX .
UM S S NATURALLY SOME SOME THINGS YOU JUST CA NT FIND IN YOUR LOCAL KMART OR OR UH BRYN MAWR STEREO DEALER .
UH BUT TH TH TH THEN WHY NOT PAY PAY THE SALES TAX MUMBLEX .
CORPORATIONS HAVE TO WHY SHOULD AN INDIVIDUAL JUST BECAUSE IT S JUST BECAUSE THE STATE CA NT REALLY FIND OUT ABOUT IT BE ABLE TO AVOID PAYING SALES TAX .
WELL I MEAN IT SEEMS TO ME THAT GENERALLY AT LEAST IN MY OWN EXPERIENCE WHEN I PURCHASE SOMETHING MAIL ORDER IT S NOT TO CIRCUMVENT PAYING SALES TAX TO THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA .
IT .
S BECAUSE I M SORRY THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA .
YES .
UH IT S BECAUSE I I CA NT FIND THE ITEM THAT I WANT AT A COMPETITIVE PRICE ANYWHERE IN MY LOCAL AREA .
SO I GO OUTSIDE THE AREA FOR THAT .
AND I THINK THAT IT S NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY TO POLICE MYSELF AND PAY PENNSYLVANIA .
WHAT .
THEY BELIEVE THEY ARE OWED EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW THE REVENUE STREAM WENT TO ANOTHER STATE .
I DO NT I DO NT THINK THAT THAT S MY RESPONSIBILITY AS A AS A CONSCIENTIOUS CONSUMER .
I I LL AGREE IT IT S NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY BUT B IS IT ALSO LEGAL .
FOR YOU TO DO THAT .
W W FR FROM WHAT .
I UNDERSTAND FROM V V VARIOUS NET READINGS I I IT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO TRY TO LEGISLATE A MORE AGGRESSIVE ENFORCEMENT OF STATE TAX SCHEMES UH IN INTO PLACE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS .
IT IS IT IS A LOST REVENUE STREAM RIGHT NOW AND STATES C CAN USE ALL THE REVENUE .
THEY CAN GET .
WITH SOME WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT D DO YOUR ARGUMENTS STILL APPLY .
WELL I THINK THAT IF IF POLICY IS ESTABLISHED AND IF A MECHANISM IS PUT INTO PLACE TO PROMOTE THE COLLECTION OF TAXES IN THIS FASHION THEN I DO NT ARGUE WITH IT .
BECAUSE IT S NOT A BURDEN ON THE CONSUMER TO REMEMBER THAT OH I BOUGHT THIS OUT OF STATE .
I NEED TO XEROX THE RECEIPT AND MAKE OUT A CHECK FOR SIX PERCENT AND SEND IT TO PENNSYLVANIA .
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT BUSINESSES DO AT THE PRESENT .
RIGHT .
BUT THE POINT IS IS THAT BUSINESSES DO THAT .
THE BUSINESS THAT YOU PURCHASE THE THING FROM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR COLLECTING THE APPROPRIATE SALES TAX AND FORWARDING IT TO THE STATE IN QUESTION .
THAT S A COST OF DOING BUSINESS .
THE BURDEN .
AND I I .
SHOULD NT BE PLACED ON THE CONSUMER .
I WAS ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT BUSINESSES PURCHASING SOMETHING MAIL ORDER AND THEN HAVING HAVING TO PAY SALES TAX ON IT .
UH .
THAT S MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE WAY UH THE WAY .
IT WORKS .
USUALLY THE THE PERSON ORDERING DOES NT PAY .
BUT THE ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT WILL UH SUCK UP ALL THE BILLS AT THE END OF THE MONTH AND REALIZE HOW MUCH THEY HAVE TO PAY .
AND THERE R THERE ARE S SOME SUBSTANTIAL NASTY PENALTIES UM IF YOU IF BUSINESSES TRY TO AVOID THAT .
UH DO YOU MEAN BUSINESSES FROM THE POINT OF VIEW AS OF OF SELLING THINGS TO A CONSUMER AND .
I MUMBLEX .
THEN BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SALES TAX .
NO .
BUSINESSES UH .
OR PURCHASING .
IF PURCHASING THINGS MAIL ORDER IF IF I M A COMPUTER CONSULTING FIRM AND I SEE THESE THIS GREAT DEAL ON FORTYSIX MOTHER BOARDS UH FROM FROM SAY UTAH .
UM I I MIGHT BUY THE MOTHER BOARDS FROM UTAH BUT THEN STILL HAVE TO PAY PENNSYLVANIA SALES TAX .
MY A ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT WILL AT THE END OF THE MONTH .
I THINK THAT I I I THINK THAT S THE WAY THINGS WORK IN PENNSYLVANIA .
AND I KNOW THEY WORK THAT WAY IN UH SAY HERE IN D C .
YEAH .
SEE I M UNFAMILIAR WITH THAT BECAUSE I DO NT I NEVER SEE THAT END OF THE BUSINESS .
YEAH .
SO MY ONLY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF A CONSUMER .
UH BUT IF THAT S THE CASE IF THE BUSINESS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR POLICING THEMSELVES THEN I THINK SOME WELL DEFINED MECHANISMS NEED TO BE IN PLACE SO THAT UH THE OPPORTUNITY F TO FORGET THAT YOU OWE SALES TAX FOR SOMETHING UH CAN BE AVOIDED .
THAT S TRUE .
I I A R A BIG HOLE DOES EXIST RIGHT NOW UH IN THAT CONSUMERS CAN JUST SAY OH I I FORGOT THAT .
THERE THERE IS NO WELL DEFINED MECHANISM AT ALL AND AND THAT IT IS A .
A L LOSS .
I I THINK IS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL TRY TO ESTABLISH A MECHANISM JU JUST TO DO JUST THAT IN OR IN ORDER TO GAIN THE REVENUE .
THAT S BEING LOST .
UH I MEAN I I DO NT KNOW IF I AGREE WITH THAT .
BUT IT BUT .
UH I DO NT KNOW MY PERSONAL PERCEPTION OF GOVERNMENT AND UH THE WAY THINGS ARE AT THIS CURRENT TIME IS THAT NOBODY CAN REALLY BE TRUSTED AND I DO NT FEEL THAT TOO MANY OF THE CANDIDATES ARE OUT THERE TO UH BE SELFSERVING TO THE COMMUNITY I THINK THAT THEY HAVE THEIR OWN UH WISHES TO UH BE IN THE LIMELIGHT AND TO KIND OF SAY HEY YOU KNOW I M A PUBLIC OFFICIAL I DO NT HAVE TO DO UH CERTAIN THINGS AND THEY JUST STAND OUT MORE INVOLVING THEMSELVES MORE AND MORE WITH POLITICS BUT IT S REALLY AFTER ALL THE THINGS THAT I VE SEEN IN THE LAST TEN YEARS ABOUT GOVERNMENT AND NOW THE OVERDRAFTS UH OF CHECKS UH BEFORE THAT IT WAS THE WONDERFUL UH ESCAPADE THAT THEY HAD WITH UH THE NEW UH OH GOD CHIEF OF UH WELL SUPREME COURT I M TRYING TO THINK OF HIS NAME AND UH WHAT THEY PUT UH HIM THROUGH IN REGARDS TO .
THOMAS .
YEAH THOMAS .
UHHUH .
THE SEX SEXUAL HARASSMENT THAT KIND OF THING AND JUST TO SEE OUR GOVERNMENT REACT TO THAT AND THEN JUST LITTLE THINGS THAT HAVE ADDED UP WHERE PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN VACATIONS ON TAXPAYERS MONIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT I I JUST THINK IT S VERY CORRUPT AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY NEED TO START WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE EXTREMELY POOR .
AND SEND THEM INTO GOVERNMENT VERSUS PEOPLE THAT ARE RICH BUT IT S ALWAYS THE RICH PERSON THAT GETS INTO GOVERNMENT THAT HAS THE MONEY TO ADVERTISE THE MONEY TO D TO DO THIS THERE S NO MORE ABE ABRAHAM LINCOLNS OUT THERE UH THAT CAN GET INTO GOVERNMENT EVEN IF THEY WERE POOR SO I KNOW THAT S MY PERSONAL VIEWPOINT OF THINGS .
DOES NT WISCONSIN HAVE A UH STATE UH MEDICARE PROGRAM OR HEALTH PROGRAM .
NOW THEY JUST UH THEY VE ALREADY PUT THROUGH THE HEALTH BILL YES IT JUST WENT THROUGH AND IT WAS PASSED AND THAT IS GOING TO BE A HEAVIER TAX BURDEN ON A LOT OF THE TAXPLA TAXPAYERS AND A LITTLE BIT MORE ON TO THE MEDICAL UH I DO NT KNOW IF THAT WAS DONE OUT OF JUST LET S BE THE FIRST STATE TO DO IT OR IF IT WAS DONE REALLY FOR THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE YOU KNOW WHAT I M SAYING IT IT S RIGHT NOW EVERY LITTLE STATE AROUND HERE IS THINKING ABOUT OH WE NEED TO REFORM THE HEALTH UH SYSTEM AND OF COURSE THEY THINK UH WISCONSIN OUR NEIGH OR MINNESOTA OUR NEIGHBOR PASSED A STATE LAW THE HEALTH BILL AND IT S KIND OF LIKE WE RE THE FIRST TO DO IT SO I DO NT KNOW IF IT S DONE BECAUSE WE RE WE WANT TO BE STANDING OUT AS BEING INNOVATIVE IN THE HEALTH SYSTEM OR WHETHER IT WAS DONE FOR UH YOU KNOW A REAL GOOD PURPOSE TO HELP PEOPLE THAT CA NT AFFORD UH HEALTH INSURANCE THAT KIND OF THING .
RIGHT WELL I I THINK THE ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS THAT UH WE SEE IN GOVERNMENT TODAY IS A REFLECTION OF SOCIETY IN AND OF ITSELF .
UHHUH OH SURE .
AND THAT IS UH UH WE BECOME SO DEBT RIDDEN AND CREDIT ORIENTED .
OH SURE .
INSTEAD OF UH CASH AND CARRY OR DEBT FREE .
UHHUH .
AND THEREFORE UH THAT PUTS A LOT OF UNDUE PRESSURE ON MUNICIPALITIES STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS .
IT IT SURE DOES AND .
MUMBLEX .
I THINK IT IT IS REFLECTING LIKE YOU SAID I THINK SOCIETY AS A WHOLE UH YOU CA NT EXPECT UH WHEN WE HAVE T V S AND WE HAVE THINGS THAT ARE KIND OF BOMBARDED AT US FOR UH YOU KNOW IMMORALITY AND THIS AND THIS AND THIS THAT WE CAN EXPECT SOMEBODY TO COME OFF THAT S GOING TO BE CLEAN TOTALLY CLEAN .
RIGHT .
AND COME INTO GOVERNMENT UH BUT DOWN THE LINE IT DOES HURT I MEAN WHEN SOMEBODY S CORRUPT AND SOMEBODY S DOING SOMETHING IT S UH YOU KNOW IT DOES HURT T EACH INDIVIDUAL OF THE SOCIETY WHEN YOU FIND OUT THAT SOMEBODY S DONE SOMETHING OR THE OVERDRAFT POLICY OR YOU KNOW THE OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE OCCURRED SO UH .
WELL WHAT IS SEE THE THING IS IS WHEN A LOT OF THINGS BECOME ACCEPTABLE PRACTICE .
UHHUH .
UH IT S HARD TO DISCERN THE BOR WHAT HAS BECOME MUDDY AS TO WHAT IS ETHICAL AND WHAT IS NOT ETHICAL AND THEN .
EXACTLY .
SOMEONE BLOWS THE WHISTLE AND SAYS OH THIS IS NOT ETHICAL AND YES I DID IT TOO .
YEAH .
WELL THAT S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS IN GOVERNMENT ALL THE TIME THEY BLOW THE WHISTLE ON EACH OTHER OH I HEAR THAT YOU RE DOING THIS I VE DONE IT BUT OH BOY AND IT S NOT GOING TO GET OUT EX YEAH E EXACTLY IT S UH THERE S NO .
YEAH WE JUST HAD .
SECRETS IN THE GOVERNMENT UH .
UH .
I DO NT THINK ANYMORE .
RIGHT THE MAYOR OF DALLAS IS UH BARTLETT STEVE BARTLETT .
UHHUH .
HE ALSO UH WAS A CONGRESSMAN .
UHHUH .
UH TO THE UH TO CONGRESS .
UHHUH .
AND HE HAD BEEN IN THAT POSITION FOR YEARS .
SURE .
AND UH HE WAS ELECTED MAYOR OF DALLAS .
UHHUH .
OVERWHELMINGLY .
UHHUH .
HOWEVER IF THE VOTE WAS TAKEN TODAY THE WHOLE THING MIGHT CHANGE BECAUSE HE WAS PART OF THAT UH CHECK KITING SCAM .
OH SURE I THINK I I DO NT THINK UH .
SO HOW DO YOU GET MOST OF YOUR CURRENT EVENT INFORMATION .
WELL MUMBLEX SEE I M GOING TO SCHOOL RIGHT NOW AND UH .
UHHUH .
WHILE I M WORKING I DO NT GET A I DO NT GET A CHANCE TO READ THE PAPER .
A LOT AND I DO NT WATCH T V AS MUCH REALLY EITHER BECAUSE UH MY FREE TIME IS KIND OF AND I DO LIKE TO DO OTHER STUFF WITH IT .
RIGHT .
WHILE I M AT WORK SOMETIMES I ON THE COMPUTER NETWORK .
UHHUH .
UM I READ THE NEWS SOMETIMES AND THAT S KIND OF HELPFUL .
I WOULD IMAGINE GOING TO COLLEGE THOUGH YOUR PROFESSORS AND DIFFERENT THINGS YOU KEEP UP ON WHAT S GOING ON .
THAT S TRUE I MEAN MY ROOMMATES AND STUFF YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
PEOPLE AROUND ME TALK ABOUT IT .
AND THE PEOPLE I WORK WITH ARE PRETTY YOU KNOW UP UPTODATE ON THAT KIND OF STUFF SO .
RIGHT .
WELL I M A HOUSEWIFE I HAVE THREE KIDS AND SO .
UHHUH .
UM I GET MOST OF MY INFORMATION PROBABLY THROUGH JUST THE NEWS AT SIX OCLOCK .
YEAH .
AND THEN UM TALKING WITH PEOPLE AND JUST HEARING WHAT S GOING ON .
MUMBLEX .
DO YOU WATCH DO YOU WATCH THE NETWORK LIKE MAJOR NETWORK NEWS OR DO YOU WATCH LIKE .
JUST THE REGULAR CHANNEL .
THE MACNEIL LEHRER HOUR .
JUST CHANNEL EIGHT .
OH REALLY .
THAT S OUR CHANNEL HERE THAT S THE UM EYEWITNESS NEWS .
UHHUH .
SO .
OH CH SEE CHANNEL WHERE I AM CHANNEL EIGHT S UM LIKE PUBLIC T V SO IT S KIND OF DIFFERENT .
OH UHHUH .
YEAH .
I THINK I THINK THE UH I THINK A LOT OF THE COMMENTATORS ON LIKE THE MAJOR NETWORKS LIKE RIGHT IT S KIND OF APPROPRIATE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF THE ELECTION STUFF GOING ON BUT UM IT SEEMS THAT UM THEY .
KIND OF GET TO THROW THEIR OPINIONS INTO HOW THEY YOU KNOW REPORT ON THE NEWS .
RIGHT .
AND I THINK EVEN IN THE ELECTIONS THEY CHOOSE WHO .
THEY RE GOING TO FOLLOW AND WHO .
THEY RE NOT AND BASICALLY .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW IF A CANDIDATE CAN GET THEM TO FOLLOW THEN THE NEWS WILL YOU KNOW KIND OF PUBLICIZE HIS NAME .
YEAH EXACTLY .
I DO NT THINK THAT THE WAY .
I GET THE NEWS IS THE RIGHT WAY TO GET IT .
I THINK YOU GET A VERY LOPSIDED PICTURE OF WHAT S GOING ON .
UHHUH BECAUSE THEY CAN THEY CAN ONLY REPORT ON I MEAN THEY GIVE EACH CANDIDATE PERHAPS YOU KNOW TEN SECOND BLURBS IN WHICH TO YOU KNOW TO SAY YOU YOU JUST CA NT GET A FULL PICTURE OF YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
THEIR MESSAGE UNLESS YOU HAVE TIME TO SIT DOWN AND R AND PROBABLY READ SOMETHING ON IT .
RIGHT .
AND THE NEWS TOO IT JUST DOES NT UM COVER THAT MANY STORIES I MEAN IT JUST COVERS YOUR BASIC YOU KNOW VIOLENT CRIMES .
YEAH .
AND YOU KNOW AND AND YOUR CA CATASTROPHES WITH WEATHER AND STUFF BUT OTHER THAN THAT YOU REALLY DO NT KNOW WHAT S GOING ON .
YEAH .
UM I WILL READ OUR CURRENT LETTERS .
THAT COME OUT ON ELECTIONS AND I GUESS I DO READ THAT AND I DO STUDY WHO S RUNNING IN OUR AREA AND I DO STUDY WHAT S GOING ON IN THE ECONOMY .
IT YOU KNOW AND I GUESS I DO READ OTHER MAGAZINES UM TOO TO GET MY INFORMATION .
WHAT KIND OF SEE I SUBSCRIBE TO LIKE SCIENCE NEWS AND THAT S THAT S REAL GOOD BECAUSE IT GIVES LIKE A BRIEF SUMMARY OF OR LIKE THE UPDATES LIKE OF WHAT S GOING ON IN SCIENCE WITHOUT GETTING INTO A LOT OF DETAIL .
THAT WOULD YOU KNOW BOG ME DOWN THAT I WOULD NT KNOW ABOUT .
RIGHT .
BUT OTHER THAN THAT I DO NT REALLY READ I DO NT I DO NT REALLY SUBSCRIBE TO ANYTHING ELSE .
I USED TO READ EVERY MONTH .
A READER S DIGEST .
UHHUH .
BUT UM NOW I GUESS I JUST HAVE FRIENDS .
THAT CLIP ARTICLES OR IF I YOU KNOW AM INTERESTED IN SOMETHING OF COURSE DURING THE W WHEN WE WERE IN WAR I READ UP ON THAT JUST A LITTLE IN THE NEWSPAPER .
OH YEAH .
TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON .
BUT A LOT OF THE TIMES I YOU KNOW I WISH I HAD THE TIME TO READ ALL THE STORIES IN THE NEWSPAPER BUT I JUST CA NT SEEM TO FIND THE TIME .
YEAH .
IF THEY PUT IT OUT IN A VIDEO OR ON .
NOT A VIDEO BUT A CASSETTE TAPE OR SOMETHING WHERE YOU COULD JUST LISTEN TO IT .
YEAH .
I WOULD DO THAT WHILE I WAS DOING OTHER THINGS .
BUT .
WELL I REMEMBER BACK DURING THE UH DURING THE WAR EVERYONE HERE AT WORK ALWAYS HAD THE RADIO OR THE T V ON BECAUSE THAT THEY WERE GOING CONSTANTLY WITH THAT STUFF .
RIGHT .
BUT UH .
WELL I UM THEY EVEN DID A STORY ON OUR NEWS HERE IN TEXAS ON WHAT PEOPLE WANTED TO SEE MORE OF AND PEOPLE SAID THAT THEY WANTED TO SEE MORE ON OUTSIDE OF TEXAS NEWS .
YOU KNOW WE JUST DO NT WANT TO HEAR EVERY NIGHT .
ALL THE KILLINGS .
THAT WENT ON HERE IN DALLAS .
YEAH .
THAT WE WANT TO HEAR WHAT S GOING ON WITH THE ECONOMY WHAT S BEING DONE TO HELP IT WHAT S GOING ON IN OTHER COUNTRIES WHAT S YOU KNOW JUST MORE INFORMATION .
IF THEY REPORTED EVERY IF THEY REPORTED EVERY VIOLENT CRIME IN ATLANTA .
IT WOULD TAKE IT WOULD PROBABLY TAKE THE WHOLE NEWS HOUR .
YEAH .
BUT UH .
WELL I GUESS WE LL GET PRETTY GOOD NEWS COVERAGE IN A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN YOU HOST THE UH SUMMER OLYMPICS .
OH YEAH THAT S THEY START ALREADY THEY RE HAVING LIKE UM IN THE NEWSPAPER .
THEY HAVE A SECTION I THINK EVERY NOW AND THEN ON THE OLYMPICS YOU KNOW AND THEY VE GOT LIKE A COUNTDOWN IT .
S LIKE SIXTEEN HUNDRED DAYS OR SOMETHING .
I KNOW WE RE TRYING TO GET TICKETS TO IT RIGHT NOW .
OH REALLY .
YEAH .
THAT S GOING TO BE CRAZY THAT TIME OF YEAR HERE .
BUT UH .
YEAH .
I CA NT BELIEVE I MEAN THEY RE THEY RE STRETCHING OUT THE OLYMPIC NEWS FOR THAT MUCH COVERAGE OVER I GUESS PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT .
ALSO BIG IN THE NEWS RIGHT NOW IS THE BRAVES BECAUSE THEY RE UH THEY RE IN YOU KNOW TR SPRING TRAINING OR WHATEVER .
RIGHT RIGHT .
AND THEY DID SO WELL LAST YEAR .
YEAH THEY SPENT A LOT OF TIME THAT S ANOTHER THING THEY SPEND A LONG TIME ON SPORTS AND I THINK THAT UM THAT S FINE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE TIME SPENT ON OTHER THINGS .
YEAH .
BUT .
IT SEEMS LIKE I DO NT KNOW THEY WAY THEY DO THE NEWSCASTS I WISH THEY THEY .
KIND OF SEPARATED IT YOU KNOW IF YOU WANTED TO WATCH ONE THING .
YOU COULD TURN TO SOME CHANNEL FOR IT BUT I DO NT HAVE CABLE .
DO YOU EVER THINK THAT THERE S A CRIME .
THAT S JUST SO HEINOUS AND SO BAD THAT THE PERSON .
WHO COMMITS THIS CRIME JUST DOES NT DESERVE TO LIVE ANYMORE .
THAT S A GOOD QUESTION .
UH THERE WOULD BE A POINT THERE WAS A POINT WHERE I WOULD HAVE SAID NO THAT NO ONE WOULD DESERVE TO DIE FOR FOR A CRIME THAT HE COMMITTED .
BUT UH SINCE I VE BECOME A PARENT AND SINCE I VE SEEN UH THINGS LIKE JEFFREY DAHLMER I REALLY HAVE TO QUESTION THAT .
I REALLY UH I I CA NT CONCEIVE OF SOMEONE BEING THAT BRUTAL TO THAT MANY OTHER PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
AND UH TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHAT WOULD BE A SUITABLE PUNISHMENT .
UH .
OF THE STATEMENTS MADE BY PEOPLE AGAINST THE THE DEATH PENALTY UM I I LIKE THE STATEMENT MADE BY CUOMO .
CUOMO I BELIEVE IS UM HE S HE S GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK BUT UH HE S UH AGAINST THE DEATH PENALTY .
BUT UM HE SAID THAT HE WOULD HE WOULD WANT TO TO SERIOUSLY HURT OR IF NOT KILL SOMEONE IF IF THEY DID SOMETHING TO HIS WIFE .
AND THAT S BUT BUT EVEN EVEN IN THAT CIRCUMSTAN IN THAT UH UH SITUATION .
HE WOULD B HE WOULD HOPE THAT THERE WOULD BE PEOPLE AROUND HIM .
WHO WOULD UH KEEP HIM FROM DOING THE DOING THE THINGS .
OH IT S A UH IT S A QUESTION OF YOUR YOUR GUT REACTIONS TO SOMETHING LIKE THAT VERSUS AN INTELLIGENT REASON RESPONSE .
RIGHT EXACTLY .
UH A AND THAT WAS THE THING THAT UH KILLED DUKAKIS BACK UH FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN SOMEONE ASKED HIM .
A SIMILAR QUESTION AND HE HE THOUGHT FOR A SECOND AND GAVE A THOUGHTFUL WELL REASONED REPLY WHEN UH PEOPLE WANTED TO SEE IF HE WAS GOING TO GO FOR AN EMOTION .
UHHUH .
UH A GUT LEVEL REACTION .
AND I THINK THAT THE PEOPLE .
WHO ARE STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF THE DEATH PENALTY ARE REALLY WORKING FROM THAT GUT LEVEL .
UH YOU KNOW WHETHER IT BE A BIBLICAL FORCE UH YOU KNOW THE EYE FOR AN EYE A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH A LIFE FOR A KNIFE LIFE TYPE LOGIC OR JUST UH UH SOME SORT OF ANGER AT PUTTING PEOP PUTTING UH MURDERERS UP IN FEDERAL PENS FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIFE UH WHILE WE FOOT THE BILL .
YEAH .
I THINK PEOPLE ARE ARE WORKING AT THAT FROM MORE OF A UH A GUT REACTION THAN A A REASON HUMANE ONE .
SEE I DO NT THINK THE DECISIONS .
THAT ARE GOING TO BE MADE ON DEA ON THE DEATH PENALTY UNTIL WE DECIDE WHAT .
OUR PRISON SYSTEM IS INTENDED TO DO .
ARE THEY .
REFORMATORIES WHERE WE RE TRYING TO TAKE PEOPLE .
WHO CA NT SURVIVE OR OR THAT THAT ARE NT CONFORMING ENOUGH TO SOCIETY SO THAT THAT WE WORK WELL TOGETHER .
OR ARE THEY IS IT .
A PENAL INSTITUTION .
IS IT IS IS IT DESIGNED FOR PUNISHMENT .
UM THE DEATH PENALTY SURELY FITS IN WELL WITH UH IN A PENAL SITUATION WHERE YOU RE TRYING TO PUNISHMENT .
UH PERHAPS NOT IN THE MANNER THAT WE DO IT BUT BUT IT IN IN THEORY .
IT FITS IN .
IN REFORMA SYSTEM IN A REFORMATORY I MEAN IF YOU IF YOU PUT SOMEONE TO DEATH .
YOU OBVIOUSLY .
CA NT REFORM THEM .
THAT S TRUE .
SO .
UH TH THE OTHER ARGUMENT IS THAT THE DEATH PENALTY IS A DETERRENT AND I REALLY DO NT UH AGREE WITH THAT .
I DO NT THINK ANYONE .
WHO WOULD COMMIT A UH A CRIME .
THAT WOULD GET THEM .
THE DEATH PENALTY WOULD STOP AT THE MOMENT AND SAY WELL I WAS ABOUT TO KILL AND DISMEMBER THIS PERSON BUT OH IF THEY CATCH ME .
THEY RE GOING TO KILL ME SO I BETTER NOT DO IT .
I I JUST .
YEAH .
DO NT THINK THAT UH THAT IT WORKS THAT WAY .
I DO NT THINK IT S DONE .
I DO NT THINK WE RUN IT AS A DETERRENT .
I MEAN PEOPLE SAY THAT BUT I MEAN IF IT WAS REALLY A DETERRENT I MEAN I THINK LIKE HORSE THIEVES IN THE OLD WEST YOU KNOW THEY SAW OTHER HORSE THIEVES HANGING BY THE NECKS .
UHHUH .
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE .
AND IF WE REALLY W IF IT WAS REALLY SERIOUSLY GOING TO BE A D DETERRENT I WOULD THINK THAT IT WOULD BE PUBLIC .
I MEAN I DO NT THINK IT WOULD BE THIS PRIVATE THING BECAUSE NOBODY EVER NOBODY EVER SEES IT .
IF SOMEONE EVER IF YOU KNOW LIKE SAY SOME YOUNG KIDS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
THAT MIGHT BE INCLINED MORE TOWARDS A LIFE OF CRIME HAD TO SIT AND WATCH AND AND SEE A GUY BURN OR OR YOU KNOW SOMETHING OR SHOT BY A FIRING SQUAD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
I WOULD THINK YOU D MAKE A BIGGER IMPACT ON THEIR LIFE RATHER THAN YOU KNOW TELLING THEM THAT THERE S THERE .
S PROTESTORS OUT HERE AT THE YOU KNOW .
WELL I I DO NT KNOW IF THAT WOULD REALLY WORK THAT WAY OR NOT .
UH THERE S A LOT OF VIOLENCE .
ACTUALLY I VE BEEN INVOLVED IN ELECTRONICS .
A LONG TIME .
UH IN COMPUTERS AND I HAVE REALLY RESISTED THE IMPULSE TO GET ONE FOR THE HOME .
OH YEAH .
UH UP UNTIL I GUESS MAYBE ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO I GOT ONE FOR MY SON .
A A MACINTOSH .
UHHUH .
UH L C .
IT S A REAL EASY TO USE COLOR UH COMPUTER AND I GOT A VERY NICE PRINTER .
THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT AND HE USES IT FOR HIS SCHOOL WORK .
UHHUH .
WELL I VE I M CURRENTLY IN SCHOOL SO I I VE HAD AN .
I B M CLONE I GUESS FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS NOW WHICH .
I VE BEEN TRYING CONTINUALLY UPGRADING I GUESS .
AND UH I VE FOUND I VE FOUND THAT I PRETTY MUCH BECOME ADDICTED TO IT AND I CA NT REALLY I VE FOUND THAT MOST OF HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS MUMBLEX REALLY REQUIRE SOME SORT OF COMPUTER UH SIMULATION OR ANALYSIS SO .
HUH .
IT IT S PR VERY ESSENTIAL FOR ME .
SCHOOLS HAVE THEM UH BUT LOT OF TIMES SO DIFFICULT TO GET ON THEM AT SCHOOL .
IT S VERY EASY IT S MUCH MORE CONVENIENT TO HAVE ONE AT HOME .
WHERE YOU GOING TO SCHOOL .
AT GEORGIA TECH .
I SEE .
YEAH SO .
IN ENGINEERING .
YES ACTUALLY .
SO THAT EXPLAINS WHA ALL THE UH COMPUTER ASSIGNMENTS .
YEAH IT UH .
WELL DO YOU USE YOUR P C FOR THINGS OTHER THAN EXPLICIT COMPUTER WORK .
UM SURE .
I HAVE SOME GAMES OF COURSE WHICH .
I PLAY ON THERE AND UH UH I HAVE A PROGRAM .
WHICH ALLOWS ME TO ACCESS .
A UH WEATHER DATA BANK SO I CAN LIKE CHECK UP ON THE WEATHER AROUND THE COUNTRY OR WHATEVER .
WHICH IS A HOBBY .
SO IT PROVIDES OTHER MEANS OTHER THAN JUST STRICT UH YOU KNOW COMPUTATIONS AND SO ON SO .
HAVE YOU DO YOU HAVE A COMPUTER FOR YOURSELF AT HOME .
NO .

THAT WORD PROCESSING IS A BIG MARKET FOR .
OH YEAH .
HOME COMPUTING .
YEAH .
THA .
AT WO AT WORK UH I M A TECHNOLOGIST UH AND I IN THE PAST HAVE DONE A GREAT DEAL OF OF UH SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT JUST THROUGH UH SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMING .

YEAH .
IT S I I UH I HAVE MODEM MUMBLEX NIGHT COMPUTER SO I CAN LOG INTO THE SYS THE UH NETWORK AT GEORGIA TECH AND ACCESS MY ACCOUNT THROUGH THERE WHICH IS WHICH CAN BE USEFUL .
BUT UH YEAH THAT S THAT AND WORD PROCESSING IS WHILE I TEND TO I MEAN OBVIOUSLY I DO MOST OF MY ALMOST ALL OF MY REPORT WRITING ON ON MY COMPUTER UH WHETHER IT S TERM PAPERS OR EVEN SOME SMALLER HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS .
UHHUH .
SO IT S IT S REALLY BECOME I DO NT KNOW REALLY BECOME MY MAINSTAY .
I GUESS .
I CA NT EVEN REMEMBER ACTUALLY I DO NT THINK I VE EVER USED A TYPEWRITER IN IN MY LIFE TO DO A A TO DO A REPORT .
BECAUSE MY FAMILY WHEN I WAS GROWING UP WE GOT A BASIC COMPUTER .
T R S EIGHTY WHEN THEY FIRST CAME OUT .
UHHUH .

IT MUST HAVE BEEN JUST SO MUCH SO MUCH WORK .
YEAH .
IT UH WELL YOU KNOW IT S JUST IT WAS JUST A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WORLD THEN .
YEAH .
SO UH MUMBLEX SO YO YOU USED YOUR SON S MACINTOSH THEN .
DO YOU DO YOU FIND IT DO YOU LIKE THAT KIND OF COMPUTER .
I LIKE IT YEAH .
I LIKE IT FROM A DISTANCE REALLY .
I I SEE THE PACKAGES ON IT UH THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND IT S NICE .
I REALLY DO NT USE IT .
MYSELF .
UHHUH .
UH I WHEN I COME HOME FROM WORK I I LIKE TO STAY FAR AWAY FROM .
YEAH .
COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONIC THINGS .
HUH .
UH SO I LET MY SON DO IT AND .
YEAH .
UH OF COURSE YOU KNOW THERE S UH THERE S AN INTELLECTUAL EVOLUTION TAKING PLACE WHERE IT S SORT OF A JOKE BUT IT S REALLY TRUE THE OLDTIMERS EVEN THE PEOPLE .
WHO ARE TECHNOLOGISTS DO NT KNOW HOW TO OPERATE THESE ELECTRONIC THINGS LIKE V C R S AND WHATNOT AND THE KIDS THEY JUST TAKE TO IT LIKE CANDY .
YEAH .
WELL I IF IF IF THE INTERFACE IS THERE SO THAT IT S LIKE FUN TO USE AND THE CHALLENGE .
WENDY I GUESS WE GET TO TALK ABOUT BUDGETS TONIGHT OR LACK OF BUDGETS IF UH IF THAT MAY BE THE CASE .

EVERY DAY FOR ONE .
I ALSO READ ONE OR TWO PAPERS .
A DAY AND I M A I M PRETTY MUCH A NEWS JUNKIE AND I TUNE IN TO C N N .
A LOT .
OH WOW .
SO WHEN YOU SAY THE MORNING NEWS OR EVENING NEWS OR NATIONAL NEWS IS WHEN .
UH EVERY EVENING AT SIX THIRTY I BELIEVE I WATCH THE NATIONAL NEWS .
OH OKAY .
WELL I WOULD PROBABLY BE A JUNKIE OR S WATCH C N N .
A LOT BUT I DO NT UH I DO NT UH SUBSCRIBE TO CABLE .

I JUST DONATE TO THAT .
UHHUH AS OPPOSED TO PAYING FOR CABLE .
YEAH I TAKE AWAY A UH ADDICTION .
OH SOMETHING .
YEAH .
WELL I .
UH OVERALL I I THE QUALITY OF THE NEWS .
YOU GET O OFF OF MOST UH SOURCES I WOULD SAY IS PRETTY LOW .
IT S USUALLY YOU GET PRETTY INCOMPLETE COVERAGE AND THAT S ONE OF THE REASONS WHERE I WHY I TRY AND GET AS MANY SOURCES AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE IF YOU HEAR THE SAME STORY FROM THREE DIFFERENT SOURCES THEN YOU GET A MUCH CLEARER PICTURE OF OF WHAT IS GOING ON .
YOU WOULD HOPE BUT STILL YOU KNOW HARD TO SAY .
OH .
THAT WHAT .
YOU VE HEARD IS WHAT REALLY IS .
WHAT WHAT UH NEWSPAPERS DO YOU READ .
WELL I READ UH THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER AND I ALSO TRY AND READ ONE OF THE UH MAJOR DAILIES LIKE THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE OR THE NEW YORK TIMES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
FOR A WHILE .
THERE .
I I I UH SUBSCRIBED TO NEW YORK TIMES A ACTUALLY A COUPLE OF NEWSPAPERS BECAUSE UH YOU KNOW MY FIANCE WELL SHE WAS UNEMPLOYED FOR A WHILE SO SHE YOU KNOW REALLY NEEDED TO LOOK AT THE THE WANT HELP WANTED ADS .
UHHUH .
AND SO OFTEN THEY THEY TR THE NEWSPAPERS ARE TRYING TO COMPETE WITH A LOT OF OTHER SOURCES OF NEWSPAPE UH NEWS .
RIGHT .
AND I DO NT KNOW NEW YORK TIMES IS OKAY BUT UH AND WHEN YOU READ A LOT OF THIS STUFF THE THE QUALITY OF THE WRITING HAS DEFINITELY GONE DOWN IN THE LAST TEN YEARS OR SO BUT .
UHHUH .
UH I MEAN THEY THEY SAY IT S LIKE THE SIXTH GRADE READING LEVEL BUT .
RIGHT .
I SWEAR IT S AT LEAST SECOND OR THIRD GRADE .
SOMETIMES .
PRETTY LOW .
BUT I DO NT KNOW UH I THINK IF YOU LISTEN TO LIKE N P R OR SOMETHING LIKE .
RIGHT I I REALLY LIKE N P R .
A LOT .
THAT S PRETTY GOOD .
UH AND I LIKE LISTENING TO THAT ON ON UH WHEN I GET A CHANCE WHEN I M IN THE CAR .
A LONG ENOUGH TIME TO TO LISTEN TO IT BECAUSE I .
RIGHT YEAH I MISS N P R .
A LOT ALSO .
I REALLY LIKE THEM BECAUSE THEY GIVE UH INSTEAD OF BEING AS YOUR NEWSPAPER OR YOUR T V NEWS WHERE YOU GET A FIVE MINUTE BLURB OR A TEN PARAGRAPH BLURB THEY GO REALLY IN DEPTH ON TOPICS .
WHICH .
I THINK IS GOOD .
UH .
AND THEY ALSO THEIR EDITORIAL STAND POINT SEEMS TO BE A LOT BETTER THAN SAY YOUR MAJOR NETWORK NEWS AND THAT KIND OF THING .
WELL MCNEIL NEIL AND LEHRER I GUESS HE S LEAVING ONE OF THEM IS LEAVING .
UHHUH .
UH THEY RE THEY RE PRETTY GOOD TOO .
UH I GUESS A YEAR AGO YOU RE PROBABLY WATCHING C N N .

YEAH THAT WAS BUT THEN YOU ALSO HAVE THINGS WHERE YOU UH WHERE THEY BROADCAST THE CLARENCE THOMAS HEARINGS BASICALLY THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THEM .
WHICH .
I THOUGHT WAS R REALLY GOOD .
OH YEAH THE N P R DOING THAT YEAH I KNOW I HAD UH SOME VISITOR AND HE WAS JUST IN JUST I DO NT KNOW FIXATED ON THAT YOU KNOW JUST LISTENED TO IT .
UHUH .
CONSTANTLY .
UH AND I GUESS THAT S GOOD WHEN IT S LIVE IF YOU IF YOU LL REALLY WANT THAT BUT THAT S NOT REALLY PROVIDING YOU .
NEWS .
RIGHT .
IT S IT S MORE LIKE A MEDIA EVENT RATHER THAN .
WELL BUT THE .
REPORTING .
BUT THE NE NEWS NEWS THAT YOU WOULD GET FROM ANY OTHER SOURCE IS BEING GENERATED FROM THAT EVENT WHICH IS SOMETHING .
THAT S GOOD ALSO ABOUT C SPAN .
WHICH .
I I TUNE INTO EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE .
OH REALLY .
THAT S KIND OF BORING TO ME I THINK .
YEAH IT IT IS REALLY KIND OF BORING BUT YOU KNOW THAT S IF IF YOU DO NT WATCH IT THERE THEN YOU RE GOING TO HEAR SOMEBODY ELSE S CANNED UH REPORT SOMEBODY ELSE S VIEW ABOUT IT AND THAT S WHAT .
YOU RE SUPPOSED YOU RE SUPPOSED TO IF YOU WATCH THE NEWS YOU RE GOING YOUR OPINION IS GOING TO BE FORMED ABOUT ON WHAT .
SOMEBODY ELSE THOUGHT ABOUT IT .
YEAH .
AS OPPOSED TO ACTUALLY WATCHING IT .
YOURSELF AND FORMING YOUR OWN PINION OPINION WHICH .
I HAVE NT WOULD BE MUCH MORE IN FAVOR OF FORMING MY OWN OPINION AS OPPOSED TO FOLLOWING SOMEONE ELSE S .
YEAH I GUESS THAT S TRUE .
BUT ONE OF THE WAYS THAT I GET INFORMATION IS UH EVERY DAY WHEN I LOG IN ON THE COMPUTER .
I SUBSCRIBE TO THIS THIS THING IT S FREE INSIDE THE COMPANY IT S CALLED INTELLECT AND AND THEY BASICALLY UH TYPE OUT ABSTRACTS .
WHICH ARE REALLY LITERALLY I VE I VE ACTUALLY READ THE ACTUAL ARTICLES THEY RE PRETTY G .
I GUESS I GUESS BY WHAT .
YOU SAID YOU RE YOU DO NT FEEL YOU RE UH PRIVACY HAS BEEN INVA INVADED ANYTIME RECENTLY .
NO NOT REALLY .
UH U TH UH TH THE ONLY THING .
THAT ANNOYS ME IS WHEN UH PEOPLE CALL AND THEY UH YOU HAVE SOLICITATION CALLS .
UHHUH .
THAT S THE ONLY THING .
THAT BOTHERS ME .
THAT S NOT REALLY INVADING MY PRIVACY .
RIGHT .
UH DO YOU FEEL THAT YOURS IS INVADED .
UH NO I WOULD NT CALL IT INVADING MY PRIVACY BY ANY MEANS .
UH YOU KNOW I WOULD THERE THERE S A LOT OF TIMES THOUGH UH YOU GET THOSE CALLS AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU RE SITTING AT HOME WANTING TO RELAX OR OR WHATNOT AND YOU KNOW NEXT THING .
YOU KNOW UH SOMEONE CALLS AND WANTS TO SELL YOU .
THIS OR THAT AND IT S REAL HARD TO TO TELL THEM YOU KNOW THAT YOU RE NOT INTERESTED .
OR YOU DO TELL THEM .
YOU RE NOT INTERESTED AND THEY STILL KEEP ASKING YOU YOU KNOW AND KEEP BADGERING YOU ABOUT IT AND THAT AGGRAVATES ME .
BUT I DO NT KNOW THAT YOU COULD CALL THAT INVADING OF INVADING MY PRIVACY BECAUSE YOU KNOW IF WE DO NT WANT THAT TO HAPPEN ALL .
WE HAVE TO DO IS JUST CALL THE PHONE COMPANY AND SAY LOOK YOU KNOW I WANT MY NAME UNLISTED OR WANT MY YOU KNOW .
BUT BUT THAT DOES NT WORK .
IT DOES NT .
UH NO BECAUSE THEY A LOT OF TIMES THEY DIAL SEQUENTIALLY .
THEY GET YOUR NAME FROM UH IF YOU ENTER ANY TYPE OF CONTEST OR ANYTHING .
UHHUH .
UH YOU KNOW YOU ENTER A SWEEPSTAKE IN THE LOCAL DEPARTMENT STORE FOR A SHOPPING SPREE OR SOMETHING YOU PUT YOUR PHONE NUMBER ON THERE THEY PASS YOUR PHONE NUMBER ON TO ANOTHER COMPANY .
OH .
UH OR YOU UH OR OR LIKE THE NEWSPAPERS THEY JUST DIAL RANDOMLY OR S AND STUFF .
THEY EVEN CALL THE NEWSPAPERS HERE EVEN CALL PEOPLE .
WHO ALREADY SUBSCRIBE .
AND UH WHILE I WAS SUBSCRIBING TO THE PAPER I GOT SO UPSET AT THEM THAT THEY .
UHHUH .
YOU CALL ME .
ONE MORE TIME I M GOING TO STOP SUBSCRIBING .
AND THE LO LOCAL LOCAL PAPERS MUMBLEX ASK THEM TO REMOVE YOUR NA NUMBER FROM THEIR LIST AND UH YEAH YOU CALL UP THEIR REGULAR DURING REGULAR HOURS THEIR UH THEY HAVE A SPECIAL DEPARTMENT THEY LL TAKE YOUR NUMBERS OUT OF THEIR LISTS .
UHHUH .
UH BUT THE UH ORLANDO PAPER UH YEAH THEY THEY REFUSED TO TAKE IT OFF OF THE LISTS AND THEY CALL EVERY MONTH .
HUH .
AND WHEN YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE PHONE NUMBER YOU GET A CALL ON EACH NUMBER .
YOU HAVE .
GOOD GRIEF .
WELL LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THIS .
HERE S SOMETHING .
THAT UH HAS BEEN KIND OF CONCERNING ME LATELY .
MY FIANCE RECEIVED A BILL FROM A A LORD AND TAYLOR COMPANY .
UH YOU KNOW THEY RE A THEY RE A DEPARTMENT STORE .
UHHUH .
SHE RECEIVED A BILL FROM THEM UH THAT SHE HAD VISITED SOME STO AND AND I THINK IT WAS THERE IN FLORIDA MAYBE IT WAS IN MIAMI .
THAT UH SHE HAD VISITED A STORE THERE AND UH THEY HAD THIS BILL UH THAT SHE HAD BOUGHT SUCH AND SUCH AMOUNT OF MERCHANDISE UH OVER TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS WORTH OF MERCHANDISE .
UHHUH .
UH AND THE DATE THAT THAT SHE SUPPOSEDLY MADE THIS PURCHASE SHE WAS IN DENVER WITH ME FOR THANKSGIVING .
UHHUH .
UH AND APPARENTLY WHAT HAD HAPPENED IS SOMEONE USED HER SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER .
UHHUH .
UH AND AND I VE I VE HEARD RECENTLY THAT UH UH THAT THIS IS A COMMON OCCURRENCE WHERE PEOPLE ARE USING S YOU KNOW THEY USE JOE BLOW S SO UH SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER UH AND CAN UH POTENTIALLY RUIN SOMEONE .
S CREDIT .
UHHUH .
IF YOU KNOW A PERSON S SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AND THEIR MAILING ADDRESS I AND THEIR MOTHER S MAIDEN NAME .
UH YOU CAN BASICALLY BECOME THAT UH PERSON .
HUH .
UH IF THE PURCHASE WAS MADE MAIL ORDER THEY SHOULD HAVE A RECORD OF WHERE IT WAS SHIPPED TO .
UHHUH .
AND SINCE IT .
WAS NT SHIPPED TO HER ADDRESS SHE COULD PROVE YOU KNOW THAT IT WAS NT HER .
UH IF IT WAS SOME .
YOU KNOW COMING INTO THE STORE AND STUFF THEN SHE WOULD HA WHOEVER MADE THE PURCHASE WOULD HAVE HAD FIND SOME KIND OF UH YOU KNOW DOCUMENT .
YEAH .
AND UH WH THE SIGNATURE UH THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE YOU .
A COPY WITH THAT SIGNATURE AND IF THEY CA NT PROVIDE A SIGNATURE YOU KNOW THEY LL HAVE TO EAT THE CHARGE .
YEAH .
WELL Y .
BUT IF THE PERS HAS YOU KNOW THEIR SOCIAL S HER SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER I D BE REAL CONCERNED THAT THEY UH THAT SHE S NOT UH BLACKLIST ON UH TEL WHAT IS IT IT S TELECREDIT OR SOMETHING .
YEAH .
UH BECAUSE SHE WO NT BE ABLE TO CASH CHECKS BECAUSE MOST PLACES VERIFY THROUGH THERE .
SHE PROBABLY WO NT BE AB ABLE TO OPEN A CHECKING ACCOUNT OR ANYTHING WITHOUT A LOT OF HASSLE .
YEAH .
WELL WE GOT IT CLEARED UP EVENTUALLY .
WHAT HAPPENED UH .
UH WHY DO NT YOU GO AHEAD FIRST .
OKAY UH SHORT TERM UH IT WORKS OUT PRETTY WELL BECAUSE WE HAVE JUST ENOUGH TO COVER EXPENSES WITH A LITTLE LEFT OVER SO BUDGETING IN THE SHORT TERM IS NT TOO MUCH OF AN ISSUE BECAUSE THERE S NOT THAT MUCH UH .
SURE .
EXTRA TO GO AROUND UH LONG TERM IS SOMETHING WE RE STARTING TO THINK ABOUT BECAUSE OUR OLDER CHILD WILL BE READY FOR COLLEGE IN ABOUT UH GEE SHE S EIGHT NOW SO I GUESS ABOUT TEN YEARS .
UHHUH .
GOOD HEAVENS SO WE RE WE RE STARTING TO THINK ABOUT LONG TERM CONSIDERATIONS COLLEGE AND RETIREMENT BUT WITH NOT A WHOLE LOT OF DISCRETIONARY MONEY IT S KIND OF HARD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT .
SURE .
HOW ABOUT YOU .
THAT S KIND OF UH TO WHAT WE RE DOING IS BUDGETING YOU KNOW MONTH TO MONTH IS UH KIND OF TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION WHAT THE BILLS ARE AND WHAT S EXTRA SO THAT S KIND OF HOW WE DO IT UH FROM MONTH TO MONTH DEPENDING ON WHAT INSURANCE IS DUE OR WHATEVER .
UHHUH .
UH LONG TERM THAT S A LITTLE BIT EASIER FOR US BECAUSE UH WITH OUR JOBS WE CAN TAKE OUT EXTRA MONEY TOWARDS SAVINGS FOUR OH ONE K PLANS .
UHHUH .
UH THAT KIND OF YOU KNOW RETIREMENT PLANS THAT KIND OF STUFF SO WE CAN KIND OF PUT ASIDE SOME MONEY THAT ACTUALLY IS BETTER FOR US NOT TO SEE .
RIGHT .
VERSUS WHEN IT S ON THE PAYCHECK AND YOU HAVE TO TRY AND TAKE OUT SOME OF THAT MONEY YOU ALWAYS FIND SOMETHING A LITTLE EXTRA THAT YOU D LIKE TO GET THAT MONTH SO UH LONG TERM PROBABLY IS A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN SHORT TERM SIMPLY BECAUSE UH IT S AUTOMATICALLY TAKEN OUT SO UH THAT WORKS OUT MUCH BETTER FOR US SO THAT S KIND OF HOW WE DO IT ANYWAY BUT .
AND THE OLD UH IF YOU CA NT SEE IT THEN YOU CA NT SPEND IT UH IDEA .
E EXACTLY AND IF YOU CA NT TOUCH IT YOU CA NT SPEND IT EITHER SO THAT KIND OF WORKS OUT WHERE YOU GET INTO UH SOME PLANS THAT YOU KNOW YOU TOUCH IT YOU RE GOING TO GET A PENALTY THAT KIND OF THING SO IT LEADS YOU TO KIND OF SAY WELL I M NOT GOING TO TAKE IT OUT I M GOING TO KEEP IT AND UH KEEP IT IN THERE AND LET IT GROW SO THAT SOMEWAY MAYBE FOR RETIREMENT YOU RE GOING TO HAVE THAT MONEY .
LEFT LET S HOPE ANYWAY SO .
RIGHT .
YOU LL HAVE THAT SO THAT S KIND OF HOW WE DO IT BUT OURS IS MORE LIKE MONTH TO MONTH TOO UH SHORT TERM IS TO GET THINGS GOING SO ANYWAY OTHER THAN THAT UH IS KIND OF HOW WE DO IT SO I DO NT .
UHHUH .
KNOW IF WE RE OUR TIME IS UP OR WHAT .
UH THEY LL UH .
THEY LL LET US KNOW .
YEAH EXACTLY WE WE ACTUALLY DO HAVE SOME MONEY IN A FOUR OH ONE K I JUST .
UHHUH .
WISH I COULD AFFORD TO UH PUT MORE AWAY EACH WEEK BECAUSE I AGREE THAT IT S A AN EXCELLENT WAY .
OH DEFINITELY DEFINITELY AND UH IT GROWS UH IT IT SEEMS LIKE AT FIRST YOU RE NOT GOING TO SEE A BIG RETURN BUT AS THE YEARS GO ON IF YOU RE WITH THE COMPANY FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME THEN IT GETS MUCH BETTER AND UH .
SO YOU KNOW YOU JUST HAVE TO KIND OF LOOK AT IT THAT WAY AND THERE S OTHER SAVINGS PLANS OR OTHER THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO AUTOMATIC YOU KNOW DEPOSIT FROM CHECKS TO WHERE YOU DO NT SEE IT .
RIGHT .
AND UH YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHATEVER IS IN OUR CHECKING ACCOUNT IS BASICALLY JUST ABOUT WHAT GETS SPENT .
YEAH .
IT S PUT INTO OUR SAVINGS ACCOUNT AND WE DO NT SEE IT THEN IT WORKS OUT TO WHERE YOU KNOW YOU DO NT LOOK AT IT YOU JUST LOOK AT THE CHECKING ACCOUNT .
AND SAY THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE FOR MONEY AND THAT S IT SO .
YEAH CHECKING ACCOUNT S A VERY DANGEROUS PLACE FOR MONEY TO BE I M CONVINCED .
YEAH IT IT S EASY BECAUSE YOU DO SPEND IT THAT S FOR SURE LIKE I SAID YOU KNOW YOU KIND OF LOOK AT IT UH YOU BETTER HAVE SOME OTHER WAY OF UH SAVINGS OTHERWISE UH CHECKING ACCOUNTS ARE NT THE BEST FOR YOU KNOW LONG TERM TYPE OF PLANNING SO AND YOU DO NT GET A GOOD RETURN ON IT ANYWAY SO OTHER .
YEAH I GUESS THERE OTHER THAN THINGS LIKE THE STOCK MARKET OR MUTUAL FUNDS THERE S REALLY NOT MUCH OF A RETURN ON ANYTHING THESE DAYS .
EXACTLY RIGHT NOW YEAH IT S A BAD TIME YOU KNOW .
YEAH THE INTEREST IS SO LOW I MEAN IT IT S NICE FOR PEOPLE BUYING HOMES BUT .
UHHUH .
FOR OLDER PEOPLE WHO HAVE MONEY .
UHHUH .
IN C D S OR WHATEVER IT MUST BE AWFULLY HARD TO SEE RATES GO DOWN TO THREE AND A HALF PERCENT OR WHATEVER .
EXACTLY EXACTLY YOU KNOW WE HAVE SOME INLAWS UH THAT UH HAD THEIRS IN SOME MONEY MARKET CERTIFICATES AND OTHER THINGS AND UH KIND OF TOOK THEM OUT OF THAT BECAUSE THEY GOT SO LOW BUT UH YEAH IT S IT DROPS SO YOUR BETTER BET IS TO UH TRY TO GET IN WITH SOMETHING WITH YOUR CORPORATION IF THEY HAVE SOME KIND OF UH SAVINGS PLANS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO WHERE THEY KIND OF MATCH THE PERCENTAGE OR WHATEVER SO OR SOME KIND OF PROFIT SHARING SO .
YEAH I M I M WITH A SMALL COMPANY NOW AND I HOPE THAT UH IF WE RE SUCCESSFUL THAT THEY LL GO IN FOR SOME SORT OF PROFIT SHARING .
SURE .
THAT LL BE VERY NICE .
YEAH THAT S GREAT YEAH OKAY .
WELL I GUESS WE RE KIND OF RUNNING OUT OF STEAM ON THIS TOPIC HERE .
YEAH EXACTLY .
OKAY .
WHAT IS YOUR UH COMMUNITY UH CURRENTLY DOING WITH REGARD TO RECYCLING .
UH BASICALLY THEY RE JUST UH HAVING VARIOUS RECYCLING UH BINS UH LOCATED FOR UH TRASH PICKUP .
UHHUH .
WELL THAT S MORE THAN WE HAVE UP HERE IN MASSACHUSETTS .
SOME SOME LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE VERY ACTIVE IN THAT UH IN THAT RESPECT AND THEY DO HAVE BINS SET UP .
BUT I LIVE IN A A METROPOLITAN AREA AND UH THEY RE NOT UH TOO INCLINED TO DO SOMETHING AS AGGRESSIVE AS THAT .
WELL HERE THEY AND UH LIVE IN AN APARTMENT COMPLEX .
UHHUH .
AND THEY ONLY HAVE ONE SET OF RECYCLING BINS ONE OR TWO SETS AS OPPOSED TO A SET AT EACH OF THE DUMPSTERS .
SO A LOT OF THE PEOPLE .
WHO LIVE UP FRONT DO NT BOTHER TO RECYCLE BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT S TOO FAR TO CARRY THE STUFF TO THE OTHER BINS .
I I KNOW A LOT I THINK A LOT OF UH THE THE ISSUES WITH REGARD TO RECYCLING ARE THAT UH PEOPLE HAVE TO BE MOTIVATED TO DO TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT DOES TAKE EXTRA EFFORT .
WHETHER AND AND I THINK THAT AND I KNOW MASSACHUSETTS HAS A BOTTLE BILL WAS PASSED AND WE HAVE HAD A BOTTLE BILL FOR QUITE A FEW YEARS NOW AND THE MAJORITY OF THE INCENTIVE IN RECYCLING BOTTLES PROBABLY BELIEVE IT OR NOT IS JUST TO GET THE EXTRA NICKEL AT THE UH THE STORE AND NOT UH THAT S THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE THAT I KNOW OF ANYWAYS .
WHERE PEOPLE ARE NT REALLY YOU KNOW ECO CONSCIOUS .
IT S JUST THE FACT THAT IT S SOMETHING .
THEY HAVE TO DO .
AND I M NOT GOING TO THROW A BOTTLE AWAY IT S LIKE THROWING A NICKEL AWAY .
THAT TYPE OF THING .
RIGHT .
THEY .
BUT UH PEOPLE NEED TO BE MORE CONSCIOUS OF IT .
TH HERE THEY RE TRYING TO PUSH THROUGH A BILL AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE AGAINST IT .
AND IT S GOING TO CREATE A LOT MORE WORK FOR THE UH THE STORES .
THAT SELL YOU KNOW SODAS AND STUFF .
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO IMPLEMENT A REFUND ON CANS AND ON PLASTIC BOTTLES AND EVERYTHING .
YEAH .
MUMBLEX .
IT DID NT IT IT TOOK AWHILE FOR THAT BILL TO BE PASSED UP HERE AS FAR AS RECYCLING BOTTLES AND CANS .
UH AND AND MATTER OF FACT I THINK IT TOOK LIKE THREE TRIES T FOR IT TO GO THROUGH .
BUT AND IT S BEEN PRETTY SUCCESSFUL AND PEOPLE NOTICE IT AS FAR AS UH HIGHWAYS BEING UH YOU KNOW PEOPLE WOULD DR HAVE A DRINK OF SODA INSTEAD OF THROWING OUT THE WINDOW THEY THEY KEEP THE BOTTLE SO IT S IT S BEEN A ECOLOGICALLY SOUND POLICY AND YOU KNOW AS AS FAR AS RECYCLING YOUR BOTTLES IN TERMS OF TRASH AND SO FORTH .
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT S RECYCLING REUSABLE MATERIALS BACK INTO UH MANUFACTURING .
AND THAT S THE BIG THING I THINK THAT TH THEY TRY TO PROMOTE .
RIGHT .
I THINK HERE IF THEY UH INSTEAD OF JUST YOU KNOW REQUIRING THAT YOU PUT PUT OUT THE TRASH AND STUFF IF THEY COULD GET SOME KIND OF REBATE THOSE PEOPLE .
WHO DO PUT THE STUFF OUT UH YOU KNOW AND SEPARATE IT HAVE LOWER COLLECTION FEE OR SOMETHING MAY .
YEAH THAT S A GOOD IDEA .
ENCOURAGE .
YEAH .
PEOPLE TO SEPARATE .
TH THERE DEFINITELY HAS TO BE A MOTIVATION FACTOR AND I KNOW THAT AT W WHERE I WORK I WORK FOR A DEFENSE CONTRACTOR .
AND THERE S A BIG PUSH ON FOR RECYCLING UH PAPER MATERIALS YOU KNOW COMPUTER OUTPUT PAPER AND ALSO TO DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF UH STYROFOAM USAGE BECAUSE OF THE UH THE PROCESS INVOLVED IN STYROFOAM AND AND THE WHOLE ECO ISSUE AND THAT .
AND AND THEY RE VERY PROACTIVE AND UH MATTER OF FACT THEY GIVE YOU DISCOUNTS IF YOU USE UH CHINA WEAR RATHER THAN UH STYROFOAM STUFF SO .
SO I I IT .
S INCENTIVES LIKE THAT .
THAT GET PEOPLE PEOPLE MORE CONSCIOUS OF IT .
I THINK THAT S THAT S WHAT .
THEY NEED TO DO .
BE MORE PROACTIVE LIKE THAT .
UH I KNOW UH I BELIEVE IT WAS LAST YEAR THAT THEY ACTUALLY COLLECTED THE OLD PHONE BOOKS .
UH USUALLY HAVE THEM COME FROM MUMBLEX .
YOU KNOW PROJECTS TO COLLECT OLD ONES .
USUALLY JUST GET DUMPED OUT WITH THE TRASH .
AND PHONE BOOKS ARE A LARGE VOLUME OF ANNUAL TRASH .
YEAH .
THEY THEY JUST MATTER OF FACT THAT THAT REMINDED ME OF AN ARTICLE .
I SAW IN THE PA THE LOCAL SCHOOLS YOU COULD SEND YOUR PHONE BOOK TO YOUR UH TO WITH YOUR KID TO SCHOOL AND WHAT .
THEY LL DO IS THEY LL RECYCLE IT .
BECAUSE THERE WAS AN ARTICLE OR A STORY DONE AWHILE AGO THAT UH TRASH UH THE TELEPHONE BOOKS ARE THE TYPE OF THING .
THAT DO NT BREAK DOWN OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME .
A GUY WENT TO A D A LANDFILL DUG DOWN FIVE FEET AND AND PULLED UP A PHONE BOOK FROM LIKE NINETEEN SIXTY BECAUSE THEY DO NT THEY DO NT DEGRADE OVER SUCH A PERIOD OF TIME .
WELL PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH RECYCLING THEM IN THE PAST HAS BEEN THE COVERS ARE MADE WITH A CLAY BASED PAPER .
YEAH .
THEY CONTAIN THE GLUE AND STUFF AND THEY USED TO HAVE TO TAKE OUT ALL THE UH PAGES AND THEN CUT THE SPINE OFF TO BE ABLE TO RECYCLE THEM .
YEAH .
NOW I THINK THEY VE COME UP WITH SOME WAY OF UH PULLING THE GLUE OUT .
YEAH .
OKAY .
OH SO .
OKAY .
I M NOT AS ASHAMED TO CLAIM THEM .
THIS YEAR AS I HAVE BEEN SO .
WELL IT LET S PUT IT .
THIS WAY .
WE VE GOT THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS UP HERE SO .
OH YEAH .
RIGHT .
WELL .
THEY VE HAD SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS .
REALLY .
YEAH .
WHY .
UM WELL UH PARTLY DUE TO OWNERSHIP .
YOU KNOW UH VICTOR KIAM OWNED THE UH THE PATRIOTS .
UHHUH .
UH FOR A PERIOD OF A NUMBER OF YEARS AND HE ALWAYS HAD THIS UH THIS WONDERFUL QUALITY OF C BEING ABLE TO PUT HIS FOOT IN HIS MOUTH .
EVERY TIME .
HE WENT TO SAY SOMETHING AND UH THEY VE HAD SOME FINANCIAL PROBLEMS WITH THE TEAM AND SO FORTH .
AND IT RECENTLY WAS SOLD TO UH SOME OTHER PEOPLE SO HOPEFULLY THIS OWNERSHIP CAN SET UP NEW DIRECTION AND UH KEEP UH THE PATRIOTS IN THE NEW ENGLAND AREA ANYWAYS .
YEAH .
WELL IT WILL BE FUN FOR YOU TO WATCH UP THERE ANYWAY .
OH YEAH .
TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS NOW YOU .
I VE BEEN TO A COUPLE I VE BEEN TO A FEW GAMES BEFORE .
UHHUH .
NOW YOU YOU RE YOU RE FROM TEXAS .
RIGHT .
SO YOU VE GOT TWO FOOTBALL TEAMS DOWN THERE .
WELL IT DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU RE FROM IN TEXAS .
I LIVE RIGHT BY DALLAS .
UHHUH .
SO WE HAVE ONE FOOTBALL TEAM .
OH I SEE .
AS FAR AS WE RE CONCERNED .
THAT S HOW IT IS .
THERE S THAT TYPE OF SEGREGATION HUH .
IT S DIVIDED YEAH .
WOW .
IT REALLY IS SO WE VE GOT OUR COWBOYS HERE AND .
UHHUH .
AND UH I DO NT THINK ANYBODY ROOTS DIFFERENTLY BUT .
DO YOU .
I HAVE A BOYFRIEND .
THAT LIVES IN FRESNO AND HE IS FOR THE L THE UH RAIDERS .
UHHUH .
L .
A RAIDERS SO .
DO YOU FOLLOW PROFESSIONAL SPORTS AT ALL .
WELL I JUST STARTED TO THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF THESE SILLY RAIDERS .
THAT DID NT DO VERY WELL .
BUT I VE BEEN TRYING MORE THIS YEAR .
I THINK I KNOW A LITTLE MORE THAN I USE TO .
YEAH .
I NEVER KNEW VERY MUCH AT ALL SO I M TRYING .
WELL IT S A GOOD PAST TIME YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
PARTICULARLY FOOTBALL .
THEY SAY UH I FOOTBALL ATTRACTS MORE MEN BECAUSE OF THE YOU KNOW Y THE YOU SEE THE THE PHYSICAL AGGRESSION ON THE FIELD AND SUPPOSEDLY PSYCHOLOGISTS SAY THAT UH THAT UH MEN TAKE OUT THEIR FRUSTRATIONS BY WATCHING FOOTBALL AND YOU KNOW THEY GET TOGETHER WITH A BUNCH OF GUYS AND THEY UH UH AND THEY HAVE A GOOD TIME AND EVERYTHING AND THAT S SUPPOSE TO BE SOME OF THE UH THE MALE BONDING AND THE AND THE UH THE MALE INSTINCTS I GUESS OR SOMETHING ABOUT THE UH .
SO I SHOULD NT EVEN TRY TO DO IT HUH .
WELL NO .
IT IT S GOOD AS IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF UH OF A CONTEST .
YES .
I THINK THAT UH I PERSONALLY LIKE HOCKEY BETTER BECAUSE IT HAS CONTACT IT S A CONTACT SPORT .
IT HAS THE SPEED .
RIGHT .
AND THE HAND EYE COORDINATION AND IT TAKES A CERTAIN SKILL TO PLAY HOCKEY .
NOT EVERYBODY CAN PLAY HOCKEY .
YEAH .
SO WE AND THAT S WE RE A BIG HOCKEY AREA UP HERE I BET UP HERE IN NEW ENGLAND AS WELL .
REALLY .
AS YOU KNOW IN IN THE MINNESOTA AREA BUT .
I DO NT EVEN THINK WE HAVE THAT IN TEXAS .
WHAT HOCKEY .
WE MIGHT .

I MEAN NO YOU PROBABLY KNOW I DO NT KNOW .
NO THERE S NO HOCKEY THERE S NO .
NOBODY TALKS ABOUT IT SO I DO NT THINK WE DO .
THERE S NO PROFESSIONAL HOCKEY TEAMS IN IN TEXAS MUMBLEX .
NO UHHUH .
AND WE HAVE A SOCCER TEAM .
THAT COMES AND GOES .
WE DO NT EVEN HAVE THAT VERY MUCH SO .
YEAH .
I THINK THOUGH THAT PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL .
UHHUH .

KIND OF ANNOYS ME WHEN PEOPLE JUST LAY IN FRONT OF A T V AND WATCH ALL THIS STUFF .
I THINK IT S AN .
EXCUSE TO DO NOTHING AND I I CAN SEE WHAT .
YOU RE SAYING ABOUT THE MALE BONDING AND THE .
YEAH .
GUYS GET TOGETHER AND THAT S KIND OF COOL .
THAT S FUN YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
BUT IT CAN GET REALLY OVERDONE .
NOW HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO A PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL GAME .
YEAH I HAVE .

WE WE TALKED OUR WIVES THERE S ABOUT SIX OR EIGHT GUYS THAT WE USE TO GO OUT FOR THESE GAMES .
AND UH WE TALKED OUR WIVES INTO GOING WITH US .
ONE TIME AND THEY HAD A REAL GOOD TIME AND IT WAS BASICALLY FOR THE SOCIAL ATMOSPHERE .
RIGHT .
AND THAT S THE THING YOU KNOW .
YOU GO YOU KNOW THREE OR FOUR HOURS BEFORE THE GAME .
YOU GO SET UP .
WE SET A TABLE UP WE DO SOME COOKING SOME BARBECUEING HAVE A FEW DRINKS .
YEAH .
AND THEN GO IN AND SEE THE GAME AND SEE THE PATRIOTS LOSE AND THEN GO HOME AND EAT DRINK SOME MORE .
BUT BUT THAT WHOLE IT IT S NOT SO MUCH SURE THE CONTEST .

YEP .
AND I YOU KNOW I DID NT I STILL DO NT KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT FOOTBALL OBVIOUSLY .
BUT I STILL HAD A GOOD TIME .

OKAY UH LET ME SEE UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE NOT MUCH INTO RECYCLING .
UHHUH .
WE DO NT WE DO NT DO ENOUGH I KNOW WE DO NT SO UH ALTHOUGH LATELY I VE BEEN UH A FRIEND OF MINE THAT I SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH DOES RECYCLE QUITE A BIT AND IT S IT S IT S UH INTERESTING TO WATCH SOME OF THE THINGS THAT SHE DOES AND THEN SHE S ALMOST HAD AN IMPACT ON ME UH WHERE SHE DOES NT SAY ANYTHING TO ME WHEN SHE COMES TO MY HOUSE BUT I CAN KIND OF TELL IT BOTHERS HER SO .
JUST UNCONSCIOUSLY I VE I VE STOPPED BUYING A LOT OF UH UH PAPER PLATES AND PAPER CUPS AND I DO NT DO THAT ANYMORE I DO NT KNOW WHY I JUST DO NT I JUST JUST FROM SOCIALIZING WITH HER SO .
HOW DO YOU HOW UH IS RECYCLING DONE IN YOUR COMMUNITY IS .
IT REALLY IT THERE S NOT A WHOLE LOT THERE REALLY IS NT UH I KNOW IN MY MOTHER S NEIGHBORHOOD IN SAN ANTONIO EACH EACH HOUSE HAS THEY RE THEY RE GIVEN THREE BASKETS .
UHHUH .

RIGHT .
AND EACH UH HOME DOES PARTICIPATE BUT WE REALLY DO NT HAVE ANYTHING UH CLOSE IN THIS AREA THAT THAT DO ANYTHING AND AND SOME OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT DO THE RESIDENTS ARE HAVING TO PAY TO PARTICIPATE IN IT .

RIGHT OVER HERE THEY UH HAVE SEVERAL PRIVATE COMPANIES THAT YOU CAN TAKE UH RECYCLED .
MATERIALS TO BUT UH IF YOU WANT TO TAKE THEM ALL TO ONE PLACE THEY HAVE UH THE FIRST SATURDAY OF EVERY MONTH THEY HAVE CERTAIN PLACES THAT YOU CAN DROP THEM OFF THAT S WHAT I DO UH AND I I RECYCLE ALUMINUM GLASS UH NEWSPAPERS .
YEAH THAT S GOOD .
SO IT S NICE TO HAVE YOU KNOW ONE PLACE THAT YOU CAN TAKE THEM ALL TO INSTEAD OF DRIVING THE GLASS TO ONE PLACE AND .
YEAH YEAH THAT S ANOTHER THING YOU HAVE TO .
RIGHT .
GO TO DIFFERENT PLACES TO DO THAT .
RIGHT SO IT S SO THAT S NICE IT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE REALLY NICE IF THEY UH CAME TO THE HOUSE TO PICK IT UP AND THEY JUST WERE TALKING ABOUT A BILL IN TUCSON ABOUT THAT BUT UH UH IT DID NT GO THROUGH .
UHHUH BUT I HEARD THAT MOST HOMES THAT DO PARTICIPATE IN THAT ARE HAVING TO PAY A MONTHLY FEE TO DO THAT WHICH UH I DO NT KNOW IT JUST DOES NT MAKE SENSE TO ME .
RIGHT I GUESS WHAT THEY WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT HERE WAS UH WAS REDUCING THE GARBAGE COLLECTION IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT UP .

RIGHT .
YOU KNOW WHEN THEY ANSWER THE COMPANY I THINK IT LL MAKE IT A LOT EASIER .
RIGHT .
AND THEY D RUN INTO LESS PROBLEMS .

UHHUH .
AND IT IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING OUT SO .
YEAH I THINK IT S IT S WHAT THEY RE BASICALLY TRYING TO DO I DO NT KNOW UP HERE IN MASSACHUSETTS ANYHOW WHAT THEY RE BASICALLY TRYING TO DO IS UH OH GOSH UH ANY PEOPLE WHO HAD DI TESTED POSITIVELY GETTING THEM INTO A DRUG PROGRAM .
YEAH .
OR REHAB PROGRAM .
RIGHT .
AND UH ANYBODY WHO UH GEE IS YOU KNOW DI DOES NT ACCEPT THE REHAB PROGRAM THEN THEY RE MORE OR LESS GETTING LAID OFF .

I I THINK THAT S REALLY HARD TO BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU NEVER KNOW I DO NT KNOW IT THAT S A IT S REALLY WEIRD ISSUE I M SORT OF .
YEAH .
ON THE FENCE ABOUT IT .
YEAH .
BUT I YOU KNOW THAT THAT S WHAT S THEY RE COMING ACROSS AS IS SOME OF THE COMPANIES ANYHOW OH WE CAN GET YOU INTO A DRUG PROGRAM BUT THEN YOU WEAR THAT STIGMA .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
WHERE UH LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING WELL I ONLY SMOKED A JOINT LAST NIGHT I DO NT HAVE ANY PROBLEMS YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YEAH .
THEN I KIND OF HEAR IT GOES INTO LIKE UH THIS IS JUST SOMETHING I VE HEARD THAT IT KIND OF GOES INTO LIKE UH JUST YOUR OFF THE COUNTER MEDICATION THAT YOU COULD BE TAKING FOR A COLD THAT IT KIND OF AFFECTS THAT TOO .
RIGHT ANYTHING WITH AN A YOU KNOW IF YOU DRINK A LOT OF CAFFEINE OR .

YEAH SOMEBODY WAS SAYING TELLING ME IF YOU DRINK IT IN .
YOU KNOW AN AWFUL LOT OF CAFFEINE THAT THAT CAN SHOW UP AS A POSITIVE TEST .
UM .
I KNOW I M AN EPILEPTIC SO I D PROBABLY TEST POSITIVE AND .
YEAH SEE THINGS LIKE THAT SO .
AND THEN I D HAVE A HECK OF A TIME EXPLAINING WHAT DRUG IS IN MY SYSTEM YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
AND A LOT OF TIMES THOSE ARE THE THINGS I DO NT LIKE TO DISCLOSE TO AN EMPLOYER BECAUSE THEN THEY DO NT WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOU .
RIGHT RIGHT UHHUH .
YOU KNOW IT S VERY PERSONAL I WOULD NT WANT TO HAVE IT DISCLOSED BECAUSE .
SEE THAT S .
THEN I D ALWAYS WONDER IF THEY FIRED ME YOU KNOW WHY DID YOU FIRE ME .
YEAH THAT S WHERE I KIND OF GET INTO CAUSE IT KIND OF GETS INTO YOUR PERSONAL LIFE YOU KNOW AND .
UHHUH .
MUMBLEX WHA WHAT S KIND OF NEXT .
YEAH IT IT HITS ME AS THE ORWELL THING BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING .
THE WHAT .
ORWELL .
HUH .
AND YOU KNOW HIS BOOK BRIG BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING .
OH .
YOU KNOW YOU RE BEING CONTROLLED .
YEAH .
THAT TYPE OF DEAL AND I SH I DO NT REALLY YOU KNOW I DO NT KNOW SEEMS AWFUL STRANGE I D HATE TO HAVE TO IF I HAD MY CHOICE BETWEEN A COMPANY THAT DID TESTING AND A COMPANY WHO DID NT .
RIGHT .
I D PROBABLY TAKE THE COMPANY WHO DID NT .
YEAH .
BECAUSE I FEEL THERE D BE MORE TRUST IN THE EMPLOYEE .
RIGHT .
BUT I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THEY NEED IT WITH ALL THE YOU KNOW TRAIN ACCIDENTS AND EVERYTHING ELSE .
SO DO YOU THINK THEY LL KIND OF PUSH INTO THE TEACHING FIELD EVENTUALLY I KIND OF THINK THEY WILL .
I THINK THEY WILL TOO BECAUSE UH YOU KNOW IT S JUST GOING TO FOLLOW .
YEAH .
I DO NT KNOW I WE HAVE NT HAD ANY OF IT IN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM SO UH YOU KNOW .
YEAH WE HAVE NT EITHER .
HOPEFULLY WE WO NT .
YEAH BUT I I I JUST KIND OF THINK IT S HEADING THAT WAY THOUGH YOU KNOW IT S JUST BECAUSE IT S JUST HITTING TO CLOSE TO HOME WITH THE KIDS AND STUFF AND I JUST .
RIGHT .
I JUST KIND OF THINK IT S GOING TO EVENTUALLY HEAD THAT WAY .
WELL AND EVENTUALLY IT S GOING TO BE NOT ONLY THE TEA YOU KNOW THE KIDS ARE .
YEAH .
GOING TO BE UNDER SCRUTINY IT S GOING TO BE THE TEACHERS .
RIGHT .
AND IF THEY CAN TEST THE TEACHERS THAT GIVES THEM THE FULL RIGHT TO TEST THE KIDS .
RIGHT .
AND THEN THEY YOU KNOW CAUGHT EVERYBODY .
YEAH .
OKAY UH MANDATORY SERVICE YEAH I DO NT THINK IT S A GOOD IDEA UH BECAUSE WE D HAVE TO CHANGE THE CONSTITUTION TO TO UH ALLOW UH INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE UH IN SERVICE TO THE GOVERNMENT AND I M NOT SURE THAT WE COULD .
DO THAT IN SUCH A WAY THAT WE COULD AVOID WINDING UP A SLAVE STATE .
UHHUH .
IT S I LIKE THE .
AND .
IDEA .
IN WHAT WAY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT .
WELL I LIKE THE IDEA OF VOLUNTEER VOLUNTARY SUPPORT .
RIGHT .
I MEAN THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO AH SAY THAT ANYONE WHO DOES THAT UH GETS CERTAIN BENEFITS THAT WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE TO SOMEONE WHO DID NT DO IT BUT TO USE FORCE UH REALLY SETS US A A I I ESSENTIALLY SAYS THAT YOUR BODY THERE S A TITLE TO YOUR BODY AND THAT TITLE BELONGS TO THE GOVERNMENT .
MUMBLEX .
AND YOU ARE NOT A FREE AMERICAN .
YEAH .
CITIZEN .
RIGHT .
THE IDEA ITSELF OF SERVICE IS GOOD AND WHEN SOMEONE IS SAY OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND NOT SURE ABOUT COLLEGE OR OUT OF COLLEGE AND NOT READY TO GO INTO A CAREER AND THEY RE NOT COMMITTED TO HUGE AMOUNTS OF DEBT THAT S THE BEST TIME TO BE ABLE TO DO WORK THAT DOES NT PAY VERY WELL .
SEE I YEAH AND I ALSO THOUGHT THAT UH THAT WOULD INTERFERE WITH WITH COLLEGE WORK .
YEAH UNLESS IT WERE TIED .
AND THEY DID NT .
DIRECTLY .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW IF SOMEONE WERE STUDYING SOMETHING MUMBLEX TAKE SOMETHING OBSCURE SOMEBODY WAS STUDYING ECONOMICS THE STATE DEPARTMENT COULD OFFER TO SEND THEM TO THE SOVIET UNION FOR TWO YEARS TO TEACH THEM HOW TO RUN THEIR COUNTRY .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
AS AN EXTREME EXAMPLE RIGHT .
YEAH .
BUT IN REALITY I THINK WHAT YOU WOULD WIND UP WITH IS A POLITICAL FOOTBALL WHERE THEY WOULD SEE ALL THESE BODY COUNTS THAT THEY CAN USE TO FOR THEIR OWN WILL AND I JUST DO NT THINK IT WOULD WORK .
WHEN DO THEY ASSUME THIS IS GOING TO BE PROPOSED OR MANDATORY OR WHEN WHEN WHAT WHAT YEAR ARE THEY LOOKING AT .
WELL THEY RE NOT IT S BEEN SUGGESTED .
UHHUH .
AND IT S SORT OF A TOPIC OF DEBATE .
EVERY TIME IT COMES UP IT GETS VOTED DOWN THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PROMILITARY OPPOSE BECAUSE THEY DO NT WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THE MILITARY INTO SOMETHING ELSE .
YEAH .
AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PROCONSTITUTION OPPOSE IT ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD NT EVEN HAVE THE RIGHT TO ENFORCE YOU TO JOIN THE MILITARY UNLESS .
YEAH .
THE UNITED STATES IS ACTUALLY UNDER ATTACK .
RIGHT RIGHT .
SO MOSTLY IT S JUST KIND OF ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT GOES AWAY .
YEAH .
AH THEY VE GOT A NOISY LINE .
I THOUGHT THAT WAS YOUR LINE .
YEAH WELL IT S SOMEWHERE BETWEEN HERE AND THERE .
UH WHAT AGE GROUP I ARE ARE THEY LOOKING AT .
UH OH EIGHTEEN THE DRAFT AGE .
EIGHTEEN .
YEAH .
YEAH THAT SEEMS NORMALLY THAT WOULD INTERFERE WITH COLLEGE I WOULD THINK .
WAIT A YEAH LET ME SEE IF I CAN GET ON A CLEANER LINE IF IT S MY LINE UH .
I MOVED MAYBE THAT IS THAT S PART OF IT .
YEAH IT IS MY LINE I WAS ON A RADIO PHONE .
OH .
ALL RIGHT THAT S BETTER YEAH NOW THEIR THEY THEY FIGURE THAT THEY CAN DRAFT YOU AT EIGHTEEN THEY USUALLY DO DRAFT YOU AT NINETEEN AND THAT S THE .
AGE THEY RE LOOKING AT .
OH UM .
AND OF COURSE THEY RE THIS ONE THE WOMEN WOULD BE EQUALLY GRABBED AND THEY RE ALMOST ON THE VERGE OF SAYING THAT YOU IF YOU RE GOING TO DRAFT MEN YOU RE GOING TO HAVE TO DRAFT WOMEN AND YOU RE GOING TO HAVE TO PUT THEM IN FRONT OF THE GUNS JUST THE SAME .
RIGHT .
SO UH IF YOU RE NEAR THAT AGE OR YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WHO IS .
UHHUH .
UH YOU KNOW BE AWARE OF THAT .
YEAH WELL THAT S KIND OF SCARY .
YEAH .
I M NOT NEAR THAT AGE I M WAY OVER IT BUT I .
OH OKAY .
DO HAVE CHILDREN TO THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW .
YEP AND YOU DO NT WANT THEM SENT OFF TO THE MIDDLE EAST TO .
THAT S KIND OF SCARY .
HELP DEFEND BUSH FROM SADDAM AFTER BUSH GETS DONE ARMING HIM .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW WE ONLY FIND OUT ABOUT THAT A YEAR AFTER THE FACT .
YEAH .
SO IT S ANOTHER THING WHEN IN DOUBT DO NT TRUST THE GOVERNMENT AT ALL IT S REALLY REACHED .
OH .
THAT POINT .
UHHUH HUH .
HEY YOU RE IN PEROT COUNTRY I M REALLY THINKING THAT THIS GUY MIGHT BE GOOD FOR US .
I DO TOO .
I VE BEEN I IT SEEMED DANGEROUS I THOUGHT IS THE GUY A CLOSET FASCIST AND THEN I FIND OUT THAT HE HELPED RID THE UNITED STATES OF THE GABLERS .
HE S HE S HELPED OUT IN A LOT OF WAYS YEAH HE S HE S FROM DALLAS OR HE S IN THE DALLAS AREA .
YEAH .
AND UH HE S VERY WELL KNOWN AROUND HERE SO .
OKAY WELL I M IN THE COMPUTER BIZ TOO SO I KNOW HE S WELL KNOWN IN THE INDUSTRY .
UHHUH .
THEY UH I I HAVE HIGH HOPES FOR HIM AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW IF HE COULD GET PEOPLE INTERESTED AND ENCOURAGED AND TO BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS ACTUALLY FOR US THEN I M FOR HIM .
YEAH I I .
I MEAN IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY I M GOING TO VOTE FOR BROWN JUST BECAUSE I KIND OF LIKE BROWN AND HIS ATTITUDE BUT WHEN UH WHEN IT REALLY COMES DOWN IN THE FALL I THINK I KNOW WHERE IT S GOING TO GO .
YEAH YEAH I I THINK HE S GOT A VERY GOOD CHANCE SO THERE S A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE PULLING FOR HIM .
UHHUH .
SO I DO NT KNOW .
YEAH .
WE LL JUST SEE HOW .
YOU KNOW TH .
DID YOU UH YOU WORK IN THE UH COMPUTER BUSINESS IS THAT WHAT YOU SAID .
YEAH I M AN END USER I TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO USE MACINTOSHES AND HOW TO BUY EQUIPMENT AND DESKTOP PUBLISHING MAGAZINE PRODUCTION AND THINGS RELATED TO THAT .

OH YEAH OH THAT S THEIR PROJECT TOO IS NT IT I FOUND ABOUT IT ON THE NETWORK .
MUMBLEX .
I M READY IF YOU ARE .
OKAY UM WH WHERE DO YOU STAND UH ON .
WELL I THINK THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO HAVE THEM ESPECIALLY .
OH .
IF THEY GO HUNTING WHICH MY SON GOES HUNTING HE GOES DEER HUNTING HE GOES DUCK HUNTING UH HE S READ BOOKS ABOUT GUNS SINCE HE WAS .
UHHUH .
LIKE PROBABLY ELEVEN OR TWELVE YEARS OLD .
UHHUH .
AND I JUST THINK THAT UH AS FAR AS THAT S CONCERNED HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE THEM TO GO HUNTING WITH YOU KNOW AS FAR AS .
RIGHT RIGHT .
JUST HAVING HANDGUNS AROUND TO TO HAVE THEM I DO NT BELIEVE THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE HANDGUNS AROUND .
RIGHT YEAH YEAH YEAH I AGREE TOO I UH IT S IT S AS FAR AS THE BAN GOES AND EVERYTHING I DO NT THINK IT S POSSIBLE UH TO COMPLETELY BAN GUNS THERE S JUST TOO MANY .
WELL NO THERE S TOO MANY SPORTS PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT THAT DO DO THESE THINGS .
RIGHT AND I YEAH RIGHT I MEAN YEAH THAT THAT S TRUE AND I MEAN THE THE TECHNOLOGY S NOT THAT HARD I MEAN YOU COULD MAKE A GUN YOU KNOW FROM SIMPLE YOU KNOW YOU KNOW .
YEAH WELL I SUPPOSE YOU COULD UH .
YOU KNOW IF IF YOU REALLY WANTED A GUN YOU YOU COULD MAKE ONE UH .
UHHUH AND I THINK IF THEY WANT ONE THEY RE GOING TO GET ONE .
OH YOU KNOW .
YOU KNOW .
TRUE THAT S TRUE .
THE BAD GUYS ARE YOU KNOW LIKE I SAY IF THEY WANT A GUN THEY RE GOING TO FIND OUT .
UHHUH .
SOMEHOW TO GET ONE .
YEAH YEAH IT S YEAH I MEAN YEAH THERE S THERE S NO WAY TO STOP UH STOP ANYBODY FROM GETTING A GUN UH I THINK THERE SHOULD BE MORE CONTROL AS LIKE UH LIKE MAYBE WAITING PERIODS AND THINGS LIKE THAT YOU KNOW UH .
WELL I AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT BECAUSE I KNOW UH IN FACT I HAD BOUGHT MY SON A RIFLE LIKE FOR A CHRISTMAS PRESENT ONE TIME .
UHHUH .
AND FOR A RIFLE THERE S NO WAITING THERE WAS NT ANYHOW NOW THERE MIGHT BE NOW .
YEAH .
BUT .
UHHUH .
THERE WAS NT ANYTHING FOR YOU KNOW RIFLES AND THINGS LIKE THAT I GUESS .
SURE .
IT WAS JUST HANDGUNS THAT THERE WAS A SOME KIND .
YEAH .
OF A WAITING YOU KNOW TWO WEEKS WHILE THEY CHECKED YOU OUT OR SOMETHING .
RIGHT .
BUT UH MOST OF THESE PEOPLE THAT S GOT THESE GUNS THAT S GOING AROUND YOU KNOW ROBBING PEOPLE AND SHOOTING PEOPLE .
UHHUH YEAH UH I I KNOW MY FRIEND IS UH REALLY INTO GUNS AND UH UH W I WENT A COUPLE OF TIMES WITH HIM TO GUN SHOWS YOU KNOW THAT .
UHHUH .
COME THROUGH TOWN AND EVERYTHING AND I MEAN THEY JUST HAVE I MEAN THEY HAVE ANYTHING YOU D WANT I MEAN .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW YOU KNOW ANYWHERE FROM RIFLES AND SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS AND THERE S I MEAN THERE S NOTHING YOU CAN JUST GO BUY ONE AND TAKE IT HOME AND IT S EASIER THAN GETTING A LIKE A VIDEO MEMBERSHIP CARD AT YOU KNOW A VIDEO STORE .
I SEE NOW I KNOW THEY WERE HAVING A GUN SHOW ABOUT A MONTH AGO AND I WAS JUST WONDERING HOW THAT DID WORK IF SOMEBODY WANTED TO BUY A GUN AT A GUN SHOW .
UH YEAH YEAH YOU JUST GO AND UH BUY THE GUN AND UH .
THERE S NO RESTRICTION THOUGH YOU DO NT HAVE TO WAIT OR NOTHING THEN HUH .
NO WELL EXCEPT FOR THE THE PISTOLS AND TH I M NOT SURE HOW THEY DO THAT I KNOW THEY .
YEAH I WAS JUST CURIOUS YOU KNOW BECAUSE UH .
UHHUH .
I KNOW AT AT THE REGULAR GUN SHOW YOU KNOW GUN SHOP .
UHHUH .
THAT YOU .
THAT YOU DO HAVE TO WAIT FOR PISTOLS LIKE A COUPLE .
RIGHT .
OF WEEKS AND THEN THEY CHECK YOU OUT THEN THEY CALL YOU UP AND YOU H GO PICK IT UP .
YEAH I THINK THAT S .
WHICH I THINK THEY HAVE TO DO ON RIFLES AND THINGS NOW TOO I THINK THERE .
UHHUH .
IS SOME SOMETHING LIKE THAT ANYHOW HERE OUT HERE IN CALIFORNIA I THINK THERE IS NOW .
YEAH YEAH .
BUT .
I M NOT SURE I M NOT REALLY SURE BUT WHAT UH TH THE GUN LAWS IN P PENNSYLVANIA ARE LIKE .
UHHUH NOW WE DO NT HAVE GUNS BECAUSE .
NO .
WE DO NT GO HUNTING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
BUT LIKE I SAY MY SON HE S .
HE S ALWAYS HAD A LIKE I THINK HIS FIRST LITTLE RIFLE THAT WE GOT HIM WAS LIKE HE TWELVE OR THIRTEEN YEARS OLD .
UHHUH .
BUT HE S ALWAYS HE WENT TO THE TO THE SCHOOL TO LEARN HOW TO SHOOT IT HE GOES TO THE PISTOL RANGE AND TH AND THE RIFLE RANGE TO SHOOT THEM HE LIKES TO GO TO THAT UH SHOTGUN THING WHERE YOU SHOOT AT THOSE UH .
OH YEAH THE SKEETS YOU MEAN .
YEAH RIGHT HE LIKES TO DO THAT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW BUT UH .
YEAH .
I DO NT KNOW I THINK THEY SHOULD TRY TO CONTROL IT AND EVERYTHING YOU KNOW BUT AS FAR AS JUST BANNING IT COMPLETELY THERE THAT S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN .
I DO NT YEAH I I DO NT THINK IT CAN HAPPEN EITHER .
UHHUH .
I JUST DO NT I DO NT SEE AND THEN I I THINK UH HAD NT THOUGHT ABOUT THIS BEFORE BUT IF YOU DO THAT IF THEY WOULD UH UH DECIDE TO BAN GUNS IT WOULD JUST OPEN UP A A MARKET YOU KNOW A BLACK MARKET FOR THEM .
YEAH RIGHT RIGHT .
AND SO YOU KNOW THEY THEY WOULD JUST ALL THE PROFITS WOULD GO TO YOU KNOW .
NOW I DO BELIEVE THOUGH LIKE IN CALIFORNIA IF A LITTLE KID GETS A HOLD OF A GUN THAT SOMEONE HAS .
YEAH .
I THINK THEY RE LIABLE NOW FOR THEY .
OH TH .
CAN BE YOU KNOW PUT IN JAIL AND EVERYTHING THE WHOEVER OWNED THE GUN .
OH YEAH THE OWNER S RESPONSIBILITY .
YOU KNOW NOW .
YEAH .
WHEN THEY HAVE KIDS AROUND YOU D THINK THAT THEY WOULD BE LOCKING THEM UP OR YOU KNOW .
YEAH YEAH YOU KNOW THAT S THAT S TRUE UH YOU KNOW I I HAD A FRIEND WHO WAS A UH A POLICEMAN IN A IN A LOCAL BOROUGH JUST A SMALL UH ONE OF THE LITTLE NEIGHBORHOODS YOU KNOW ONE OF THE SMALL TOWNS UH .
UHHUH .
NEAR PITTSBURGH AND UH SHE SAID THA THAT THAT UH YOU KNOW HE USED TO ALWAYS KEEP HIS GUNS LOCKED UP AND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT BUT I MEAN YOU KNOW YOU RE YOU KNOW PEOPLE MAKE YOU KNOW THEY FORGET OR YOU KNOW YOU KNOW KIDS GET IN THE WAY KIDS THE WAY KIDS ARE YOU KNOW I MEAN THEY CAN YOU KNOW .
WELL THEY CAN GET INTO ALMOST ANYTHING ANYMORE .
RIGHT .
WELL JULIE UH ARE YOU IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU D SOON NEED TO DEAL WITH UH SPECIAL CARE FOR ELDERLY .
WELL I DO NT KNOW .
MY GRANDFATHER IS NINETYTWO YEARS OLD .
UHHUH .
AND HE IS STILL LIVING BY HIMSELF .
MY GRANDMOTHER DIED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO .
BUT HE DOES NT WANT TO TO MOVE AWAY .
HE LIVES IN A LITTLE FARMHOUSE ON A FARM .
UHHUH .
AND HE RECENTLY HAD TO HAVE AN OPERATION BUT HE JUST REALLY DOES NT WANT TO GO TO A NURSING HOME .
IS HE ABLE TO UH STILL DO EVERYTHING .
HIMSELF PRETTY WELL .
WELL HE WAS UNTIL THIS OPERATION .
HE HAS ARTHRITIS .
OH YEAH .
AND NOW I DO NT REALLY THINK HE S DOING THAT WELL .
AND MY A LOT OF MY AUNTS AND UNCLES LIVE NEAR HIM .
AND I HAVE ONE AUNT .
THAT REALLY LOOKS AFTER HIM .
A LOT .
YEAH .
BUT UH MY GREATGRANDFATHER WAS PUT IN A NURSING HOME WHEN HE WAS A HUNDRED AND THREE .
UHHUH .
AND UH DIED SIX WEEKS AFTER THEY PUT HIM IN THE HOME .
YEAH .
AND I M SURE THAT KIND OF THING WOULD INFLUENCE YOUR F GRANDFATHER S FEELINGS .
BECAUSE UH I TH YOU KNOW I THINK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE .
IT REALLY IS THE DECISION OF DO THEY STILL HAVE SOME OF THEIR LIFE LEFT .
AND .
UHHUH .
AND FOR FOR I M SURE A LOT OF PEOPLE GOING INTO A NURSING HOME .
IT .
S LIKE SAYING MY LIFE IS OVER AND I M JUST HERE FOR THE REST OF THE STAY .
AND SO I YOU KNOW I GUESS MOST OF THE TIME WHEN I THINK ABOUT SOMEBODY GOING INTO A NURSING HOME IT S MORE A CASE OF WHERE THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO LOOK AFTER THEIR DAYTODAY NEEDS .
YEAH .
UHHUH .
THEY HAVE CAN LOOK AFTER A LOT OF THINGS BUT THERE S SOME OF THE DAYTODAY NEEDS THAT THEY JUST ARE NOT ABLE TO DEAL WITH PHYSICALLY ANYMORE .
UH I KNOW MY NONE OF MY GRANDPARENTS WERE IN A NURSING HOME .
THEY GENERALLY WERE ABLE TO HAVE SOMEONE CARE FOR THEM AT HOME AND THEY DIED .
BUT THEY WERE ALL GOODNESS YOUNGER THAN YOUR GRANDPARENTS .
LIKE THEY WERE IN THEIR EIGHTIES .
THAT TYPE OF THING .
UH BUT I DID UH YOU KNOW I GUESS UH WHEN I THINK NURSING HOME .
I DO THINK OF PEOPLE .
THAT ARE NOT ABLE TO DO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES PHYSICALLY .
UH .
BUT I JUST DO NT THINK THAT NURSING HOMES REALLY DO A VERY GOOD JOB .
AND THAT S THAT S DIFFICULT PART .
BECAUSE I THINK WHAT .
THEY OFTEN GET USED AS IS UH ALMOST LIKE A VERY HIGH LEVEL OR LONGTERM CARE FOR UH SIMILAR TO A HOSPITAL .
UHHUH .
UH I KNOW LIKE HERE IN SASKATCHEWAN WE HAVE OUR HOSPITAL CARE MUMBLEX THE CARE ACTUALLY FOR THE OLDER PEOPLE GRADED IN LEVEL IN FOUR LEVELS .
AND A LEVEL FOUR TYPE OF CARE WOULD BE SOMEONE .
THAT REALLY REQUIRES LONGTERM HOSPITAL CARE .
GENERALLY ARE NOT ABLE TO LOOK AFTER THIS THEMSELVES TO VERY TO A VERY GREAT EXTENT PHYSICALLY .
OFTEN TIMES THEY EVEN HAVE MENTAL DIFFICULTY WITH SENILITY OR ALZHEIMER S DISEASE OR THOSE OR OR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HANDICAPS .
UH YOU KNOW WHERE THEY REALLY REQUIRE TWENTYFOUR HOUR SUPERVISION OF SOME KIND .
EVEN THOUGH .
UHHUH .
IT MAY BE MINIMAL .
AND UH BUT I THINK THAT IT CAN BE HELPFUL IN THAT UH IT GETS PEOPLE .
THE LEVEL OF PHYSICAL CARE THEY NEED .
UH .
BUT I DO NT I MEAN AT LEAST I MEAN I THINK SOME .
NURSING HOMES DO THAT .
BUT I THINK A LOT OF NURSING HOMES REALLY UH ARE GUILTY OF NEGLECT .
YEAH .
I TH AND I THINK IT HAPPENS MORE IN AREAS WHERE IT S UH I GUESS UH A BROAD SOCIAL MEDICAL SYSTEM WHERE UH YOU KNOW THERE S GOVERNMENT MEDICAL CARE AND THAT KIND OF THING .
IF IT S THE LOT WHERE IT S FUNDED BY THE INDIVIDUALS AND AND I GUESS THAT S SORT OF MY LACK OF UNDERSTANDING .
I THINK THAT A MAJORITY OF THE PLACES IN THE U S UH YOU KNOW THERE IS SOME GOVERNMENT AID AVAILABLE BUT THE MAJORITY OF IT IS TO THE AVAILABILITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL TO PAY .
UHHUH .
AND UH IF YOU RE NOT ABLE TO LOOK AFTER YOURSELF THEN YOU HAVE TO RELY .
UH I DO NT KNOW YOUR CAMPING EXPERIENCE IS PROBABLY I DO NT KNOW IF THEY RE SIMILAR TO MINE BUT UH SINCE I VE HAD CHILDREN IT HAS CHANGED A LITTLE BIT .
BUT UH WHEN MY HUSBAND AND I WERE UH CAMPING WE D TAKE THIS DOMED TENT THAT UH IS EASILY COLLAPSIBLE AND UH GO CAMPING AND UH JUST KIND OF ROUGHED IT AS LONG AS THERE WAS A BATHROOM THERE AND SOME CLEAN SHOWERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT THEN IT WAS FINE BUT UH WE D GET UP AT THREE IN THE MORNING AND START ON OUR LITTLE UH ESCAPADE FOR THE DAY AND UH KIND OF UH DO A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS AND THEN STOP WHEN WE WANTED TO BUT UH THAT S KIND OF CHANGED NOW WHEN YOU HAVE A SMALL CHILD BECAUSE THEY DO NT WANT TO GET UP AT THREE IN THE MORNING AND YOU DO NT WANT THEM UP THAT EARLY .
WOULD YOU THEN GO HA HIKING I MEAN WOULD THE CAMPING BE PART OF A LONG HIKE .
OH YEAH YEAH WE DID A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS WE D STOP WHEN WE WANTED TO THAT KIND OF STUFF SO WE KIND OF DID A LITTLE BIT OF HIKING SURE AND A LITTLE BIT OF UH SIGHTSEEING UH DIFFERENT AREAS UH SITTING BACK AT DIFFERENT AREAS AND SPENDING HOURS WE NEVER HAD REALLY A TIME LIMIT WE JUST KIND OF DID WHAT WE WANTED .
UM .
TO DO FOR THAT DAY VERY COMFORTABLE SO .
WERE YOU UP IN IN WISCONSIN OR WOULD YOU GO INTO CAN WHERE WOULD YOU CAMP MUMBLEX .
WELL THERE S UH PLACES IN WISCONSIN THERE S THE APOSTLE ISLANDS UH .
UHHUH .
WHICH ARE IN BAYFIELD WHICH IS A WONDERFUL PLACE AND THEN THERE S ALSO UH WHAT WE FOUND UH IN THE STATE OF UH SOUTH DAKOTA THE BLACK HILLS .
OH YEAH THAT S BEAUTIFUL .
AND WE JUST HAVE THIS UH REALLY GOOD TIME THERE ONE THING IS THEY DO NT HAVE MOSQUITOES AND UH SORRY TO SAY .
AND UH IN WISCONSIN WE DO SO THAT KIND OF PUTS A LITTLE BIT OF A HAMPER ON YOUR UH YOU KNOW IF IF YOU RE GOING TO GO CAMPING WHO WANTS TO DEAL WITH BUGS AND UH .
RIGHT .
WE FOUND THIS ONE AREA THAT DOES NT HAVE MOSQUITOES THEY JUST DO NT HAVE THEM AND IT S JUST WONDERFUL NOT TO BE BUGGED ALL NIGHT LONG WITH A HUMMING MOSQUITO AT YOUR EAR SO .
OH YEAH WELL MOST OF MY CAMPING I HAVE NT DONE MUCH SINCE I WAS A KID .
UHHUH .
BUT UH WE D BASICALLY TAKE THE TENT UP IN THE SIERRAS AND UH USUALLY JUST CAMP NEAR SOME STREAM .
UHHUH .
OR SOME LAKE .
SURE .
AND UH JUST IT WAS NT EVEN A A FULL TENT IT WOULD BE MORE A TARP UH .
SURE .
STRUNG UP BETWEEN TREES AND MY DAD WOULD TAKE UH FOUR KIDS .
UHHUH .
MY BROTHER AND MYSELF AND TWO COUSINS .
SURE .
AND UH WE JUST THOUGHT IT WAS ABSOLUTE HEAVEN .
YEAH YEAH .
UH THERE WAS CERTAINLY NOTHING LIKE A A BATHROOM A SHOWER OR ANYTHING .
NEAR BY IT WAS DIG YOUR OWN HOLE AND UH .
THAT WAS REALLY CALLED ROUGHING IT YEAH .
AND I .
I .
I M NOT SURE I D DO THAT .
ANYMORE YEAH SEE .
THAT ANYMORE BUT IT S IT UH UH ACTUALLY SOME FRIENDS OF MINE AND I ARE PLANNING TO CAMP THIS SUMMER UH FOR FOUR DAYS ALSO .
UHHUH SURE .
GOING FISHING UH .
UHHUH .
AND I HAVE A IDEA IT S GOING TO BE A A LOT MORE EQUIPMENT AND A LOT MORE STUFF THAN .
THAN YOU SURE .
BEFORE .
THAN IT WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER UHHUH .
YEAH BUT .
I IT WITH KIDS THEY DO NT CARE IF THEY TAKE A SHOWER EVERYDAY WITH KIDS THEY DO NT CARE YOU KNOW UH A L ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS BUT AS ADULTS UH IT S LIKE IF I DO NT TAKE A SHOWER EVERY DAY I FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW OOH .
YEAH .
I I JUST DO NT FEEL RIGHT SO THERE S LOTS OF PLACES IF YOU RE GOING TO GO CAMPING K O A S ARE WONDERFUL IT S KIND OF IT S KIND OF THE UH YUPPIE TYPE OF CAMPING BECAUSE THEY HAVE SHOWERS THEY HAVE THINGS FOR KIDS TO DO THEY HAVE SWIMMING POOLS THINGS LIKE THAT IF YOU .
OH MY .
CAN FIND UH SOME REALLY NICE CLEAN UH CAMPGROUNDS VERSUS UH IF YOU GO TO STATE PARKS UH WE HAVE FOUND STATE PARKS NOT THAT THEY RE LACKING BUT UH THEY RE CERTAINLY NOT UP TO A STANDARD OF A K O A WHERE IT S YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT CLEANER YOU VE GOT THE SHOWERS AVAILABLE IT S NOT YOU KNOW IN THE SAME CATEGORY STATE PARKS YOU KNOW YOU GET A LITTLE BIT FEARFUL TOO UH YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE THAT SIMPLY BECAUSE IT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE PATROLLED BUT UH YOU KNOW IT S IT S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BUT SO WE VE ALWAYS KIND OF STAYED WITH A K O A AND THEN UH DID OTHER THINGS BESIDES JUST SIT AT THE CAMPGROUND AT NIGHT THAT S THE ONLY TIME YOU REALLY USE YOUR CAMPGROUND IF YOU RE GOING TO BE GONE ALL DAY LONG WALKING SOMEPLACE OR DOING TOURISM OR WHATEVER .
UHHUH .
UH YOU RE CAMPING REALLY IS JUST FOR LIKE IN THE EVENING TO START THE FIRE TO SIT BACK AND WATCH A FIRE UH TO ENJOY THAT YOU KNOW AND THEN TO GET UP IN THE MORNING AND GET A SHOWER AND GET CLEANED UP THAT KIND OF STUFF SO WE NEVER REALLY SPENT THAT MUCH TIME AT THE CAMPGROUND AS MUCH AS WE DID .
UH WITH REGARD TO UH TO JURY TRIALS .
I YOU KNOW I I REALLY FEEL AS THOUGH UH JURY TRIALS ARE ARE UH WHATEVER SYSTEM HAS BEEN BEEN USED HISTORICALLY IN PARTICULAR JURISDICTION YOU KNOW IS REALLY THE THE ONLY KINDS OF THINGS THAT YOU CAN USE .
BECAUSE THE THE JURISPRUDENCE IS YOU KNOW BASED ON ON UH YOU KNOW ON ACCUMULATED N BODY OF LAW .
AND IF IF YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE YOU CHANGE THAT BODY OF LAW THEN ALL OF SUDDEN THEY THEY START THEY COULD START GOING BACK AND DIGGING UP ALL THESE CASES .
THAT UH THAT WOULD BE HANDLED DIFFERENTLY WERE .
MUMBLEX .
THEY JUDGED BY TODAY S STANDARDS .
SO I I REALLY DO NT THINK IT THEY CAN REALLY DO MUCH OF ANYTHING TO CHANGE IT .
WHAT DO YOU THINK .
UH I I DO NT THINK SO .
POSSIBLY IN THE JURY SELECTION WOULD BE THE ONLY .
JUST FOR EXAMPLE WHAT .
WE RE SEEING IN CALIFORNIA I GUESS .
IT MAKES YOU .
WONDER UH HAD THE JURY BEEN A DIFFERENT GROUP OF PEOPLE .
WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED WITH THAT OUTCOME .
UH AND TH AND THE PROBLEMS .
THAT THAT HAS COME THAT HAS COME FROM THIS DECISION THAT THAT JURY CAME TO AFTER ALL OF US WITNESSED WHAT .
WE DID WITH THE VIDEO TAPE BEATING .
UH JUST MAKES YOU WONDER I GUESS WHETHER OR NOT THEY .
WELL WO NT WELL MAYBE THEY USED A LITTLE BIT .
TOO MUCH FORCE WITH STUFF LIKE THAT BUT THEN .
UHHUH .
THEN YOU KNOW THE DEFENSE LAWYER ADDRESSED EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THOSE BLOWS APPARENTLY AND YOU KNOW THE .
THAT S THAT S BAD .
OTHER TWO GUYS SAT IN THE CAR .
UHHUH .
AND THEY DID NT GET BEAT UP .
NO .

RODNEY GOT BEAT UP BECAUSE HE HE YOU KNOW HE PUR YOU KNOW HE INVOLVED HIMSELF IN SOME SUB SELFDESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR .

EVERYBODY .
OH YES .
SAYS WELL THIS IS THE NINETIES AND THEY RE GOING TO REBUILD AND IT LL BE EVEN BETTER .

THEY THEY RE .
THEY RE ONLY GOING TO SUFFER .
THEY RE GOING TO THAT WHOLE AREA IS GOING TO BE TURNED INTO RESIDENTIAL GHETTO YOU KNOW AND YOU MIGHT EVEN BE ABLE TO TO USE IT FOR FOR A BOMBING TEST SITE YOU KNOW .
T THEY RE ONLY GOING TO SUFFER .
THEY THEY VE DEFEATED THEMSELVES WITH WITH THEIR LOOTING AND VIOLENCE .
UH I UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WERE UPSET BY THE VERDICT JUST BECAUSE EVEN THOSE OF US .
THAT ARE NT BLACK OR UH DO NT LIVE THERE OR WHATEVER WE .
ALL SAW THE SAME THING ON THE ON THE TAPE AND UH .
WELL E EVERYBODY IS SAYING THIS IS GOING TO BE A NEW ERA AND WE RE GOING TO REEXAMINE THIS THING .
HEY THE B THE AVERAGE PERSON IS GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND SAY SUSPICIONS CONFIRMED .
THEY RE A BUNCH OF ANIMALS YOU KNOW .
HOW CAN YOU REALLY DEAL WITH AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOU RE GOING TO LOSE EVERYTHING .
FORTY DEATHS .
I MEAN THERE ARE FORTY PEOPLE .
I KNOW .
THAT ARE DEAD AS A RESULT OF THAT .
YEAH IT S REALLY RIDICULOUS .
AND I M JUST TRYING TO DETERMINE YOU KNOW HOW YOU ADDRESS HOW YOU WEIGH YOU KNOW RODNEY GETTING GETTING THE HELL BEAT OUT OF HIM AGAINST YOU KNOW FORTY DEATHS .
AGAINST FORTY OTHER PEOPLE BEING .
YEAH .

UHHUH .
OF X NUMBER OF BILLION TRILLION DOLLARS .

WE COULD REALLY FOCUS ON BUILDING THE INFRA STRUCTURE OF THE COUNTRY .

YEAH AND .
COLD WAR .
AND THERE S NO WAY THAT WE CAN EVER REALLY RECOVER FROM FROM THE STATE THAT WE RE IN RIGHT NOW UNLESS AT LEAST I FEEL UNLESS WE FOCUS ON THE INFRA STRUCTURE AND I SURELY DO NT HEAR ANYBODY SAYING THAT RIGHT NOW .
UHHUH .
UM YEAH I I AGREE TOTALLY .
UM I MEAN THIS THIS IT JUST SEEMS SO YOU KNOW SO RIDICULOUS THAT IT WAS ALLOWED TO HAPPEN .
UM I I M IN COLLEGE RIGHT NOW AND .

UHHUH .
IT I MEAN I DO NT KNOW I .
I DO NT I DO NT THINK GEORGE BUSH WILL MAKE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAPPY WITH NINETYSEVEN CENTS .
A WEEK .
NO NO NOT AT ALL .
I JUST DO NT THINK IT WAS A WELL THOUGHT OUT INCENTIVE .

WELL MY EXERCISE PROGRAM CONSISTS OF UH YOU KNOW IT S IT S A OPPORTUNITY TO STAY ALIVE REALLY .
HUH .
INSTEAD OF YOU KNOW WASTING MY MY THE YOU KNOW THE TRYING TO EXIST ON THE LATENCY OF MY YOUTH THE GOOD HEALTH OF MY YOUTH .

BUT UH YOU KNOW I I NEED TO I NEED TO REDEDICATE MYSELF TO UH TO DOING THIS AND UH I GOT A PROBLEM UH YOU KNOW EVER SINCE MY KNEE WENT BAD OF GETTING BACK SOLIDLY INTO IT .
I MEAN I VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS .
YEAH .
AND YOU KNOW AND I M I KNOW I M GOING TO GET I KNOW IT S GOING TO BITE ME IN THE ASS AND SO I I REALLY DO NT WANT TO WANT TO UH YOU KNOW BACK OFF ON IT .

IT .
S .
SOMETHING I THINK UH I M YOUNG I SHOULD GET STARTED GETTING INTO SHAPE .
I DO NT WANT TO I WANT I MEAN AT ONE POINT .
IT S GOING TO BE TOO LATE TO DO IT .
MUMBLEX .
WELL NO .
WHEN YOU RE YOUNG .
YOU YOU CAN ABUSE YOUR YOUR ALL YOUR SYSTEMS AND YOU CAN RECOVER .
YEAH .
UH WHEN YOU GET TO BE MY AGE AND YOU START ABUSING YOUR SYSTEMS YOU GET BLOWN AWAY .
HUH .
AND JUST WIND UP HAVING TO KISS YOUR ASS GOODBYE YOU KNOW .
AND UH AND SO THE OBJECT .
OKAY RANDALL UH UH DO YOU HAVE ANY SPECIAL INTEREST IN UH SPACE FLIGHT .
OH YEAH .
EVER SINCE I WAS A YOUNG AND UH USED TO WATCH THE OLD UH APOLLO MISSIONS GOING OFF IN UH CLASSROOM T V S .
UHHUH .
UH I SUSPECT A LOT OF PEOPLE UH UH GOT UH TURNED ON BY WATCHING WATCHING THOSE GO OFF .
UHHUH .
UH VERY EXCITING .
YEAH .
THE UH UH I VE AL I VE ALWAYS UH W WANTED VERY MUCH UH TO UH BE SOMEHOW INVOLVED IN ALL THAT .
UHHUH .
AND UH TO UH MEET AND AND TO SEE SEE IT ACTUALLY HAPPEN .
OF COURSE I VE REALLY WANTED TO ACTUALLY MANAGE TO GET INTO SPACE SOMEDAY .
UHHUH .
BUT UH THAT SEEMS RATHER UNLIKELY AT THIS POINT UNFORTUNATELY .
WHAT DO YOU DO NOW .
UH COMPUTER PROGRAMMER .
OH .
UNFORTUNATELY THAT CAN BE DONE FROM THE GROUND .
YEAH .
TO BAD HUH .
YEAH .
MADE THE WRONG WRONG CAREER CHOICE TO GET UP INTO SPACE .
THE UH UH I USED TO THINK WHEN I WAS WHEN I WAS YOUNGER THAT UH BY THIS TIME .
WE D HAVE LOTS MORE IN STUFF IN SPACE THAN WE DO NOW .
UHHUH UHHUH .
UH FRUSTRATING AT TIMES .
UHHUH .
I DO NT KNOW WHAT .
YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THAT .
WELL UH YO I UH I M KIND OF YOUNG .
I M ONLY TWENTYTWO AND SO UH UH I M NOT YOU KNOW THERE S A LOT .
THAT S HAPPENED IN MY LIFETIME AS FAR AS UH YOU KNOW WITH THE SPACE SHUTTLE AND ALL .
ALTHOUGH PLANS TO UH GO TO OTHER PLANETS HAVE SOMEWHAT BEEN THWARTED IN COMPARISON TO UH THE SIXTIES .
UHHUH .
UH ALTHOUGH I HAVE A I I .
KIND OF WONDER UH IF SOME IF IT WERE POSSIBLE TO MARKET SOME UH FORM OF UH SPACE TECHNOLOGY YOU KNOW TO UH UH TO MAKE IT EQUITABLE IT MIGHT SEVERELY HELP THE ECONOMY YOU KNOW IN THE IN THE UH RESPECT THAT YOU KNOW THERE .
S ENDLESS AMOUNTS OF RESEARCH TO BE DONE .
ENDLESS AMOUNTS OF RESOURCES AND .
YEAH .
AND WHATNOT IT WOULD BE GREAT .
WELL .
IF WE COULD FIND SOME WAY TO TO UH USE THAT TO BOOST THE ECONOMY .
YEAH .
WELL THE UH UH I VE ALWAYS UH FELT THAT UH UH ONE OF THE LONGTERM SOLUTIONS .
THAT AT LEAST A FEW OF OUR PROBLEMS WOULD BE TO HAVE UH SOME SORT OF UH SOLAR POWER SATELLITES UP .
UHHUH .
UH BECAUSE THAT S A UH YOU KNOW IN SINGULARLY RENEWABLE RESOURCE THAT DOES NT DO IT THAT DOES NT REQUIRE UH UH ANY PARTICULARLY NASTY ENVIRONMENT IMPACT .
EXACTLY .
AND YOU CAN JUST GET AS MUCH POWER AS YOU NEED UP THERE .
UHHUH .
IT S JUST A MATTER OF HOW BIG YOU BUILD IT .
UHHUH .
UH AND OF COURSE THE SIDE EFFECTS OF THIS IS THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE UH LUNAR MINING BASES AND SPACE STATIONS AND EASY TRANSPORT INTO SPACE AND NO MUMBLEX THINGS THAT I THINK WE SHOULD BE DOING .
SO THE SIDE EFFECTS OF DOING THAT WHICH .
I THINK WOULD BE GOOD YOU KNOW VERY VERY GOOD FOR AL FOR EVERYONE IN THE LONG RUN IS UH IS IT SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS I D LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN WOULD HAPPEN ALSO SO I M .
RIGHT .
YEAH .
IT SEEMS LIKE UH THERE S SO YOU RE TALKING ABOUT POSITIVE SIDE EFFECTS THEN .
YEAH RIGHT .
OKAY I UNDERSTAND .
RIGHT .
UH .
SURE THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE .
RIGHT .
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS OF COURSE THAT UH THAT REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENT .
UHHUH .
FROM PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY DECIDE THEY WANT TO PUT THINGS LIKE THAT UP THERE .
YEAH .
AND THEY WANT TO DO THE RESEARCH AND .
YEAH .
UH THEY RE ALL .
YOU KNOW NOR THE ONLY COMMITMENTS THAT THEY RE INTERESTED IN MAKING OR EVEN TALKING ABOUT ARE ONES FOR FLASH VALUE LIKE UH THE TRIP TO MARS .
RIGHT EXACTLY .
WHICH IS WOULD WOULD PRODUCE SOME USEFUL SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND SO FORTH BUT THE SAME MONEY COULD PROBABLY BE FAR BETTER SPENT ON UH UH LUNAR BASES AND SOLAR POWER SATELLITE RESEARCH AND YOU KNOW SO FORTH .
UHHUH .
IT IT WOULD DE IT WOULD BE BEING DONE FOR THE UH GLITZ AND SHOW FACTOR .
UHHUH .
TO GET POLITICIAN VOTES INSTEAD OF INSTEAD OF FOR YOU KNOW WE SHOULD EVENTUALLY SEND SOMEONE PEOPLE TO MARS BUT NOT JUST BECAUSE IT S GLITZY TO DO SO .
RIGHT .
WE SHOULD DO IT BECAUSE FOR FOR THE RETURN .
WE GET FOR IT .
UHHUH .
AND UH UNFORTUNATELY THAT S NOT WHAT .
I THINKS HAPPENED .
EXACTLY .
LEAST NOT .
I I WOULD SETTLE FOR THE GLI MUMBLEX FOR THE GLITZ IF THE SIDE EFFECTS WERE USEFUL LIKE THE UH BUT UH .
YEAH .
THE DOWNSIDE OF THAT IS YOU AFTER YOU DO ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE SAY WELL WE DID IT .
RIGHT .
NOW LET S .
NOW WE RE DONE .
NOW WE RE DONE .
NO NEED TO USE THIS ANYMO TO PLAY AROUND WITH THIS SPACE STUFF ANYMORE .
THAT S WHAT HAPPENED WITH APOLLO .
UH .
YEAH I THINK YOU RE RIGHT .
BUT UH I D GIVE ALMOST ANYTHING TO GET INTO SPACE .
I WOULD TOO .
I D I D UH WAS IT .
JOHN DENVER THAT THAT TRIED TO BUY HIS WAY ON TO THE SPACE SHUTTLE .
UH THE QUESTION WAS KIND OF INTERESTING TO ME BECAUSE I WAS JUST TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER A UH LONG TERM FINANCIAL PLAN AND MONTHLY BUDGET .
THE ONLY THING .
I DO NOW IS UH PUT THE DATA INTO QUICKEN .
I DO NT KNOW IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THAT .
YEAH I HAVE SOME FRIENDS OF MINE .
WHO USE QUICKEN AND UH I VE CONSIDERED USING IT ONCE MYSELF BUT I DECIDED THAT THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION .
THAT WOULD HAVE TO GO IN WOULD BE A LOT OF TIME KEEPING THAT UP TO DATE .
UHHUH .
SO I I .
KIND OF GAVE UP ON THE IDEA OF USING QUICKEN AT LEAST FOR NOW .
UM .
I VE FOUND IT S THE ONLY RELIABLE WAY TO KEEP A CHECK BOOK BALANCED ACTUALLY BECAUSE WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS MY WIFE WILL WRITE A FEW CHECKS AND THEN WELL UH UH NOT BOTHER TO TOTAL IT .
UHHUH .
AND THEN IT COMES IN TO DOING ALL THE ARITHMETIC .
SO IT REALLY HELPS WITH THAT .
YEAH WELL IT S SIMILAR PROBLEMS BUT UH WE JUST HAVE THE ONE CHECK BOOK AND WE TRY TO KEEP IT UP TO DATE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND OCCASIONALLY WE WILL GET BEHIND LIKE YOU SAY BUT UH IT DOES NT REALLY SEEM TO BE TOO TOO TIGHT IF WE JUST REMEMBER TO KEEP EVERYTHING UP UP TO DATE AND BALANCED .
UHHUH .
WELL HOW TO YOU HANDLE THAT THE LONG RANGE OR MEDIUM RANGE PLANNING ON FINANCES .
WELL ACTUALLY WE HAVE NT HAD TO .
UH UNTIL JUST RECENTLY .
I GUESS WE VE GOT A A DAUGHTER .
WHO IS EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND ANOTHER ONE ON THE WAY SO .
UHHUH .
WE NEEDED TO START DOING MORE OF THAT JUST FOR UH YOU KNOW SAVING FOR COLLEGE AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
WE TRIED A WAY TRY TO PUT AWAY TWO AND FOUR THOUSAND .
A YEAR JUST FOR THAT .
YEAH .
WELL THAT S PRETTY GOOD IF YOU CAN DO THAT .
I KNOW .
I HAVE A DAUGHTER .
WHO S TEN AND WE HAVE NT REALLY PUT MUCH AWAY FOR HER COLLEGE UP TO THIS POINT BUT UH WE RE TO THE POINT NOW WHERE OUR FINANCIAL INCOME IS ENOUGH THAT WE CAN CONSIDER PUTTING SOME AWAY .
UHHUH .
FOR COLLEGE SO WE ARE GOING TO BE STARTING A REGULAR PAYROLL DEDUCTION .
UM .
IN THE FALL AND THEN THE MONEY THAT I WILL BE MAKING THIS SUMMER .
WE LL BE PUTTING AWAY FOR THE COLLEGE FUND .
UM .
SOUNDS GOOD .
YEAH I GUESS WE RE WE RE JUST AT THE POINT UH MY WIFE WORKED UNTIL WE HAD A FAMILY AND THEN YOU KNOW NOW WE RE JUST GOING ON THE ONE INCOME SO IT S .
UHHUH .
A LOT MORE INTERESTING TRYING TO UH FIND SOME EXTRA PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS IS PROBABLY THE ONLY WAY .
WE WILL BE ABLE TO UH DO IT .
YOU KNOW KIND OF ENFORCE THE SAVINGS .
UHHUH .
BUT UH IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE MUMBLEX .
WELL OUR SITUATION IS JUST A LITTLE BIT KIND OF THE OPPOSITE OF THAT CAUSE MY WIFE WAS NOT WORKING FOR SOME TIME AND WAS GOING TO SCHOOL AND JUST RECENTLY UH TOOK ON A FULL TIME JOB WELL ALMOST FULL TIME .
UM .
SO IT S ONLY RECENTLY THAT WE VE HAD THE MONEY WHERE WE COULD START PUTTING AWAY LARGE SUMS OF IT FOR UH LONG RANGE GOALS LIKE COLLEGE AND SICKNESS AND .
UM .
TRAVEL AND THAT KIND OF THING .
THAT SOUNDS GOOD .
BUT UH UH I WAS JUST CURIOUS WHAT UH PART OF THE COUNTRY .
OH STOCKTON .
OH OKAY .
HOW ABOUT YOU .
UH CINCINNATI ACTUALLY .
I WAS KIND OF WONDERING IF THEY WOULD BE COLLECTING PEOPLE WITH UH THE WESTERN ACCENTS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
I DO NT KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE UH GETTING INVOLVED IN THIS BUT .
UHHUH .
UH WELL THAT S INTERESTING .
I M UH UH ACTUALLY UH I WAS KIND OF INTERESTED IF YOU FOUND OUT ABOUT THE STUDY BY UH READING TELECOM DIGEST OR WAS THERE .
ANOTHER .
UH A COLLEAGUE OF MINE AT UH WORK GOT SOME INFORMATION OVER UH THE COMPUTER NETWORK CALLED INTERNET .
OH OKAY .
YEAH THAT IS HOW I GOT IT AS WELL BUT UH .
AND HE JUST FORWARDED THAT ON TO ME AND UH IT SOUNDED LIKE IT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING PROJECT .
UHHUH .
TO PARTICIPATE IN SO .
I .
YEAH IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT .
SENT BACK MUMBLEX MAIL .
IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THE DATA BASE MUMBLEX SO WELL I GUESS WE RE TALKING ABOUT THE EXPERIMENT .
UHHUH .
UH PROBABLY NEED TO TRY TO GET BACK ON THE TOPIC BUT UH IT S HARD TO TALK ABOUT FINANCES WITHOUT WITHOUT GETTING TO UH DOLLAR FIGURES I GUESS .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW WE COULD TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE LONG RANGE GOALS AND .
WELL WHAT .
OTHER LONG RANGE GOALS DO YOU HAVE BESIDES COLLEGE .
UH WELL I THINK EITHER MY WIFE OR I WOULD LIKE TO PURSUE ADVANCED DEGREES AT SOME POINT .
UHHUH .
UH I GUESS WE WILL HAVE TO FACTOR THAT IN IF WE ARE NOT WORKING FOR EMPLOYERS .
THAT HAPPEN TO FUND THAT .
IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY YEAR MY EMPLOYER JUST GIVES BACK YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT YOUR TUITION REIMBURSEMENT .
UHHUH .
I MEAN THEY USE TO REIMBURSE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT AND NOW IT S UH NOW IT .
S REIMBURSEMENT DEPENDING ON THE GRADE .
YOU GET IN CLASS AND UH IT S A REAL SHAME FROM WHAT .
WE HAD BEFORE UH BECAUSE WE RE .
I DO NT KNOW IF YOU FEEL THE SAME BUT UH WHEN IT COMES TO TELLING KIDS THAT THEY HAVE TO DO UH TWO OR THREE YEARS OF SERVICE INTO SOME KIND OF COMMUNITY I DO NT KNOW IF THAT S APPROPRIATE FOR A GOVERNMENT TO SUGGEST THAT AND SAY YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO DO TWO YEARS OF COMMUNITY SERVICE BEFORE YOU CAN BE A CITIZEN OR YOU KNOW IN THE ASPECT THAT WE RE TELLING KIDS THAT THIS IS WHAT IS SUGGESTED FOR YOU TO DO .
RIGHT .
AND UH I AS FAR AS A HIGH SCHOOL COURSE I COULD SEE IT AS UH MAYBE A SOCIAL UH SOCIOLOGY COURSE .
UHHUH .
TO WHERE A STUDENT WOULD GET CREDITS IF THEY WERE TO BE INVOLVED WITH SOME KIND OF COMMUNITY TYPE OF PROGRAM AND .
UHHUH .
TO ME THAT S FINE TO HAVE A STUDENT DO THAT FOR LIKE FOUR OR EVEN A YEAR .
UHHUH .
BUT TO TELL THEM THAT THEY HAD TO DO TWO YEARS THEREAFTER POST HIGH SCHOOL OF COMMUNITY SERVICE I I M NOT QUITE SURE IF THAT S APPROPRIATE FOR ANYBODY TO BE TELLING SOMEBODY THEY HAVE TO DO .
UM WELL THAT S A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE IT AS A STUDY PROGRAM FOR SCHOOL WHERE IT BE MORE ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS .
UHHUH .
AS OPPOSED TO UH MANDATORY .
EXACTLY .
YEAH A YEAH I KIND OF AGREE WITH THAT UH I DO NT THINK YOU KNOW I IT THEY SHOULD HAVE THEY SHOULD HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS AS ANYONE ELSE .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
IT SHOULD NT BE UH ANYTHING SHOULD NT BE MANDATORY OTHER THAN I GUESS LIKE UH WHEN YOU COME TO PAYING TAXES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT UH OR IF IT S BENEFICIAL IN SOME KIND OF WAY THEN MAYBE .
UHHUH .
UH PEOPLE BE MORE EAGER TO DO IT .
EXACTLY .
YEAH .
AND DOING IT FOR A PURPOSE THAT THEY WANT THE OTHER THING IS THIS I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS ON MANY TIMES WHEN YOU GET THESE UH YOUNG TROUBLED TEENAGERS THAT UH DO NT HAVE LIKE THE PERSPECTIVE OF UH UH OF THE COMMUNITY A SENSE OF COMMUNITY OR PERHAPS THE SENSE THAT THEY MAY HAVE PROBLEMS BUT THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE OUT IN THE COMMUNITY THAT MAY HAVE PROBLEMS THEN I CAN SEE IT AS LIKE MAYBE A PROBATIONARY TYPE OF THING YOU HAVE TO DO SO MUCH AS FAR AS IN .
RIGHT .
COMMUNITY SERVICE NOW IF THEY WERE YOU KNOW TH ABUSIVE TYPE OF SITUATION PERHAPS THEN THEY WOULD HAVE TO WORK WITH THE VICTIMS OF ABUSE .
UHHUH .
OR IF UH THEY DESTROYED SOME PROPERTY AROUND THE UH AREA THEN THEY WOULD HAVE TO DO UH TO RESTORE IT AND PERHAPS UH WORK UH FOR THE COMMUNITY TO BEAUTIFY IT OR WHATEVER BUT .
UHHUH .
I COULD SEE THAT WORKING IN YOU KNOW CASES WHERE IT MIGHT BE YOUNG TEENAGERS GETTING IN TROUBLE WITH LAW AND TEACHING HIM THAT THERE IS A WHOLE COMMUNITY THAT IS EFFECTED WHEN THEY STRIKE OUT AND DO THEIR CRIMES OR WHATEVER AND THAT S I THINK THEY HAVE DONE THAT AND JUDGES HAVE SAID WELL YOU KNOW THIS IS WHAT YOU RE GOING TO GET FOR A YOU KNOW A MISD MISDEMEANOR OR SOMETHING YOU MAY END UP HAVING TO DO SOME KIND OF COMMUNITY SERVICE SO I COULD SEE THAT AS SOMETHING THAT MIGHT OCCUR IN THE COURT SYSTEM FOR THOSE THAT ARE TROUBLED SO .
UHHUH UH THAT S A GOOD IDEA UH I THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE MORE PROGRAMS LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK UH US BEING TAXPAYERS WE PAY FOR UH PEOPLE THAT S IN JAIL OR .
UHHUH .
IN TROUBLE ANYWAY .
SURE WE SURE DO .
SO THEY SHOULD BE PROGRAMS SET UP BY THE GOVERNMENT THAT COULD UTILIZE THOSE FORMS IN DIFFERENT AREAS .
UHHUH .
AND .
YEAH .
I I AGREE WHOLEHEARTEDLY .
YEAH .
YEAH BUT UH THE THING IS IS THAT S NOT ENOUGH OF THAT KIND OF STUFF GOING ON UH .
YEAH .
BECAUSE LIKE YOU SAY IS A LOT OF CRIMES AND STUFF OR MISDEMEANORS .
UHHUH .
SO WHY HAVE SOMEONE IN YEAR JAIL FOR A YEAR OR TWO FOR A MISDEMEANOR AND SOMETIMES YOU KNOW PUTTING THEM IN JAIL DOES NT REALLY HELP .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE THERE S NOTHING IN THERE THAT WOULD REB REHABILITATE RE .
EXACTLY .
REHABILITATE .
YEAH .
REHABILITATE THEM .
UHHUH .
AND THEN WHEN THEY GET OUT THEY BECAUSE THEY HAVE THIS STIGMATISM OF BEING IN JAIL .
AND THERE S A LOT OF ANGER SURE YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY IF THEY HAVE NT WENT THROUGH TREATMENT AND THEY DEALT WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN THE UH SYSTEM OF PRISONS WHICH UH YOU YOU ALWAYS DEAL WITH SOMEBODY THAT S A LITTLE BIT WORSE THAN YOURSELF NEXT TO YOU OR WHATEVER I WOULD SAY THE CRIMES WOULD PROBABLY BE YOU KNOW IF YOU WENT IN FOR A CERTAIN CRIME THERE MIGHT SOMEBODY THAT HAS DONE A CRIME EVEN WORSE THAN WHAT YOU HAVE SO YOU RE DEALING WITH PEOPLE UH THAT MAY UH BE AN INFLUENCE LATER ON AND UH AN ISSUE OF ANGER WOULD BE IS THAT I WENT TO PRISON FOR A YEAR OR TWO BUT I DID NT GET ANY REHABILITATION .
UHHUH .
OR UH YOU KNOW BUT THEN AGAIN THOSE THAT HAVE PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED SOMEBODY UH THAT S EXTREMELY TOUGH TO PUT THEM INTO SOME KIND OF PROGRAM OUT IN .
UHHUH .
THE COMMUNITY IF THEY RE OF A VIOLENT SORT AND TO SAY .
RIGHT .
OKAY UH I HAVE NT BEEN IN THIS SITUATION YET YOU KNOW MY MY PARENTS ARE NOT QUITE AT THAT AGE YET SO I HAVE NT .
THEY RE NOT QUITE ELDERLY HUH .
NO SO I HAVE NT UH REALLY BEEN IN THAT SITUATION ALTHOUGH THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT MY GRANDMOTHER BUT UH .
UHHUH .
BUT THAT S REALLY ABOUT IT HOW ABOUT YOU HAVE YOU BEEN IN THAT SITUATION YET .
UH NOT FOR MY PARENTS BUT I I WAS AROUND UH TWO SETS OF GRANDPARENTS UH QUITE A BIT .
WE WE PUT ONE I PUT ONE GRANDFATHER IN A REST HOME .
UHHUH .
AND THAT KILLED HIM .
DID IT REALLY .
WELL YEAH KIND OF WELL THERE WAS SOME OTHER THINGS INVOLVED BUT IT BEFORE HE WAS REALLY ACTIVE AND THE THERE WAS SOME YOU KNOW HE LOST HIS DRIVERS LICENSE AND I COULD NT GET AROUND AND WAS NT ABLE TO DO SOME THINGS AND SO WE ENDED UP JUST HAVING TO PUT HIM IN A REST HOME .
YEAH .
AND HE JUST KIND OF BECAME A VEGETABLE AND DIED .
OH NO .
SO .
THAT S SAD .
BUT THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO .
YEAH .
THAT WAS UH BACK IN LIKE SEVENTYTHREE .
OH OKAY .
SO UH I THINK THE WAY THEY DID THINGS WERE A LOT DIFFERENT BACK THEN .
I M SURE THEY WERE YEAH .
AND UH MY GRANDMOTHER HIS HIS WIFE .
UHHUH .
UH WE ALSO PUT HER IN A REST HOME SHE WAS IN A REST HOME AND THEN SHE WAS BACK OUT BECAUSE SHE DID NT REALLY NEED TO BE THERE AND UH HAD A PHYSICAL HAD A GOOD PHYSICAL THERAPIST AT THAT PLACE AND .
AH .
THEY WORKED WITH HER AND GOT HER WALKING AND GOT HER TA KIND OF TAKING CARE OF HERSELF AND SO .
YEAH .
SHE WAS ABLE TO COME BACK HOME AND .
OH .
THEN SHE HAD TO GO BACK IN A COUPLE OF TIMES BUT MOSTLY IT WAS JUST BECAUSE SHE KIND OF GAVE UP .
UM .
AND THEY GOT HER GOING AGAIN .
YEAH .
SO I GUESS AS FAR AS LOOKING I SAID AS WHAT YOU RE LOOKING FOR I THINK YOU NEED TO LOOK FOR AN ACTIVE UH AN INTERACTIVE STAFF .
UHHUH .
SOMEBODY WHO IS WILLING TO WORK WITH UH YOU KNOW WORK WITH A PATIENTS AND DO .
YEAH .
DO THINGS WITH THEM AND TREAT THEM TREAT LIKE THEY RE .
AND I M SURE IT S IT S EXPENSIVE YEAH .
IT IT IS .
YEAH .
IT IS EXPENSIVE .
YEAH MY MY GRANDMOTHER IS NOT IN A NURSING HOME BUT SHE S IN A .
UHHUH .
OH THEY RE LIKE UH THEY RE APARTMENTS FOR SENIOR CITIZENS .
OH UHHUH .
AND SHE LOVES THAT BECAUSE THEY ARRANGE ACTIVITIES FOR THEM ALL DAY LONG .
UHHUH .
AND THEN THEY HAVE UH WHERE THE BUS PICKS THEM UP AND TAKES THEM WHERE THEY NEED TO GO AND SHE SHE SHE REALLY DOES LOVE THAT BUT SHE S JUST CONCERNED ABOUT I IN THE FUTURE YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
THAT SHE SHE KNOWS IT S NOT GOING TO BE LIKE THAT ALL THE TIME AND SHE S JUST WONDERING WELL .
WHEN SHE CA NT TAKE CARE OF HERSELF .
WHAT S GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME AND AND I YOU KNOW IT S I GUESS IT S SO NORMAL TO START TO WONDER ABOUT THAT EVEN IF SHE DOES NT NEED THAT BUT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW .
NOW .
SHE S KIND OF ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT WELL WHAT S GOING TO HAPPEN THIS CA NT LAST FOREVER AND SO .
UHHUH DOES SHE HAVE A IS IT LIKE A KITCHENETTE TYPE APARTMENT WHERE SHE CAN FIX HER OWN FOOD IF SHE WANTS TO .
YEAH .
OR SHE CAN GO DOWN TO THE CAFETERIA .
YEAH SHE CAN BUT I I THINK IT IS ALSO CAFETERIA STYLE BECAUSE I I REALLY I I I DOUBT IF SHE RARELY COOKS FOR HERSELF .
UHHUH .
SO UH .
IN FACT I .
BECAUSE I I REMEMBER HER IN HER LETTERS TELLING ME SHE LL GO DOWNSTAIRS FOR COFFEE OR SOMETHING TO EAT SO I M ASSUMING IT S SOMETHING LIKE THAT TOO .
UHHUH .
SO .
YEAH I I REALLY LIKE THAT CONCEPT .
UHHUH .
THEY VE THEY HAVE A FEW OF THOSE WELL QUITE A FEW OF THOSE PLACES LIKE THAT HERE IN UTAH AND YOU KNOW COUPLES CAN YOU KNOW HUSBAND AND WIFE CAN CAN LIVE THERE TOO OR OR WHATEVER I AND AND THEN AND YET THEY HAVE THEIR THEIR FRIENDSHIPS AND RELATIONSHIPS AND THE YOU KNOW OF GETTING TOGETHER AND EATING TOGETHER AND ALL OF THAT .
YEAH YEAH .
I I THINK IT REALLY TAKES UH YOU KNOW LOOKING MORE AT THE PEOPLE THAN EVEN REALLY THE FACILITIES .
UHHUH AND SHE LIVES BY HERSELF TOO SHE SEEMS TO LIKE IT .
UHHUH .
AND UH MY HUSBAND S GRANDMOTHER IS WELL SHE LIVES SHE LIVES IN A HOUSE ON HER OWN AND SHE DOES NT REALLY NEED THE CARE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT SHE HAS HER OWN HOME AND SH SHE S DOING REALLY WELL I M REALLY PROUD OF HER SHE S DOING REALLY WELL SO WE HAVE NT HAD TO DO ANYTHING BUT THEN AGAIN SHE HAS A LOT OF SUPPORT SO .
YEAH .
I MEAN SHE S GOT HER MOTHER IN TOWN TOO AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO .
YES .
HOPEFULLY WE WO NT NEED TO GO THAT ROUTE .
WELL I I THINK THAT THAT S THE THING THAT S A LITTLE BIT SCARY YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT TOUGH ABOUT PUTTING THEM IN A REST HOME IS IT S IT S ALMOST LIKE THAT YOU KNOW THEY SAY PUTTING THEM OUT TO PASTURE AND SOME SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THERE WITH MY GRANDMOTHER WERE REALLY ACTIVE .
YEAH .
THEY THEY WANTED TO DO THINGS THEY DID NT YOU KNOW THEY DID NT WANT TO GO DOWN AND PLAY BINGO OR UH YOU KNOW PLAY WITH THE ORANGES .
OKAY .

ALL THE TIME .
BUT UH UH SHE JUST UH SHE USED TO WORK IN PRE IN THE PRESCHOOL AND AND AND CHILD CARE AND SHE SAYS AFTER WORKING IN THERE AND AND YOU KNOW HERE SHE WAS A PROVIDER BUT YOU KNOW THERE S ONLY SO MUCH ONE PERSON CAN DO .

SHE SAID IT S SO AWFUL .
SHE SAID SHE LL NEVER PUT HER CHILD IN A IN A IN A PRECA IN A P IN A PRESCHOOL .
UHHUH .
I M SURE THERE MUST BE SOME GOOD ONES AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE .
HUH .
BUT IT S REALLY IT S REALLY REALLY VERY DIFFICULT AND .
YEAH .
WHAT DID YOU DO WHEN YOUR KIDS WERE GROWING UP .
WERE .
YOU .
WELL WHEN WHEN THE UH THE FIRST UH TEN YEARS SEE FIRST TEN OR TWELVE YEARS I STAYED HOME .
UHHUH .
AND UH THEN AFTER THAT I I WENT TO WORK .
UHHUH .
AND UH UH UH A COUPLE OF TIMES I JUST UH UH YOU KNOW TH THEN I HAD ONE JOB AND THEN THAT JOB RAN OUT BECAUSE IT WAS KIND OF A GOVERNMENT SEEDED TYPE JOB .
AND THEN AND THEN LIKE ABOUT LATER I I TRIED TO GET THE BABY TO A BABYSITTER .
SUPPOSED TO BE GOOD UH RECOMMENDED PERSON FROM THE CHURCH AND I KNEW HER PERSONALLY .
SHE HAD TWO KIDS OF HER OWN AND EVERYTHING .
BUT I QUIT MY JOB BECAUSE I COULD NT STAND HOW SHE WAS TAKING CARE OF MY CHILD .
UHHUH .
I MEAN FIRST OF ALL UH HER CHILDREN WERE SICK ALL THE TIME .
SO WHEN MY SON STAYED OVER THERE HE GOT SICK .
HE GOT SICK YEAH .
SAME THING SAME THING THAT THE HER KIDS HAD RIGHT .
RIGHT .
WELL .
AND SO UH WE DID NT TAKE HER OVER THERE UNTIL LIKE ABOUT ELEVEN OCLOCK .
THEN HE SHE D TAKE MY SON AND HER DAUGHTER OVER T TO KINDERGARTEN .
BUT S THAT DAY UH I WAS SAYING NOW HE HE S SICK .
AND SHE GOES WELL SHE GOES HE HAS THE SAME THING THAT ALL MY KIDS HAVE .
THAT S WHAT .
HE GOT YOU KNOW .
GOES WELL OKAY SO IT S NOT LIKE HE S GOING TO INFECT HER KIDS .
BUT THEN WHAT HAPPENED WAS IS I SAID UH HE JUST THREW UP AND KINDERGARTEN STARTS AT ELEVEN THIRTY SO SHE SAID WELL SHE LL KEEP HIM .
HOME AND HE LL PROBABLY JUST SLEEP ANYWAY .
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT .
THAT WOMAN SENT HER SENT HIM TO KINDERGARTEN .
SHE SENT HIM TO KINDERGARTEN .
AS SOON AS HE WENT THERE THE TEACHER TOOK ONE LOOK AT HIM AND HE THREW UP AGAIN AND THEY PUT HIM IN THE NURSERY UH THEY PUT HIM IN THE NURSE S OFFICE .
GUESS SO YEAH .
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED WAS IS YOU KNOW THEY GAVE HER .
A CALL BECAUSE THEY KNEW THAT SHE WAS MY BABYSITTER .
CALLED HER AND THEY SAID UH THAT HE S SICK .
WELL SHE .
WAS NT HOME .
HUH .
I MEAN HER ALL HER KIDS WERE SICK BUT SHE .
WAS NT HOME RIGHT .
AND HER AND HER HER DAUGHTER .
THAT WAS IN KINDERGARTEN WITH HIM ALSO DID NOT GO TO SCHOOL BECAUSE SHE WAS SICK .
NOW WHY DID NT HE WHY DID NT SHE KEEP HIM HOME WITH HER .
NO SHE DID NT DO THAT .
SO IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE HE S HE S SUPPOSED TO GET OUT OF UH KINDERGARTEN LIKE ABOUT TWO THIRTY .
AND I HAD TO LEAVE WORK .
IT WAS IT WAS FIVE OCLOCK IN THE EVENING AND I FOUND OUT HE WAS STILL THERE AT SCHOOL .
AND THEY WERE CALLING ME AND THEY SAID SOMEBODY .
S GOT TO PICK HIM UP .
AND I KEPT THINKING THAT SHE WAS GOING TO GET PICKED UP SHE WAS GOING TO PICK HIM UP BECAUSE SHE ONLY LIVES IN LIKE TWO BLOCKS AWAY FROM THE SCHOOL .
I WAS TRYING TO GET MY HUSBAND TO COME AND PICK HIM UP AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF .
AND HE HAD A HUNDRED AND FOUR FEVER .
THEY COULD NT UH GIVE HIM .
ANYTHING BECAUSE THEY RE NOT ALLOWED TO AT SCHOOL AND EVERYTHING .
RIGHT .
I WAS SO FURIOUS .
I I QUIT THAT JOB AND I STAYED HOME FOR AWHILE LONGER .
THEN I WENT AND GOT A UH A JOB IN REAL ESTATE WHERE I CAN KIND OF ADJUST MY TIME .
A LITTLE BIT BETTER .
YEAH A LITTLE MORE FLEXIBILITY .
YOU CAN COME AND GO .
YEAH BUT UH I HAVE NT HAD ANY GOOD REALLY VERY GOOD EXPERIENCE WITH CHILD CARE .
YEAH .
WHEN WHEN OUR KIDS WERE SMALL WE HAD A COUPLE OF UH GOOD GOOD WOMEN .
WHO UH WOULD OFTEN C UH GET THEM TO COME TO THE HOUSE .
OKAY .
UH BEFORE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I HAD A A VERY NARROW VIEW OF OF NURSING HOMES AND IT WAS UH MORE LIKE A FUNERAL HOME .
I ALWAYS JOKED AROUND ABOUT IT BEING A FUNERAL HOME AND NOT REALLY A NURSING HOME .
AND UH THEN I HAD TO DO SOME VOLUNTEER WORK HERE IN TYLER TEXAS AND I WENT TO ONE AND IT JUST HAD A VERY GOOD ACTIVITIES DIRECTOR .
EVERYONE WAS CHEERFUL AND NOW I DO NT HAVE SUCH A BAD VIEW OF NURSING HOMES ANYMORE .
BUT I I CERTAINLY WOULD NT WANT TO SEND MY PARENT UNLESS IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE LAST RE RESORT .
UH I HAVE A SISTER .
THAT IS IN NURSING SCHOOL AND SHE S REAL INTERESTED IN GERIATRICS .
WELL THAT SOUNDS GOOD .
YEAH .
SO UH SHE SHE S REAL INTERESTED IN UH WHAT .
ANN RICHARDS HAS BEEN DOING .
SHE .
S ANN RICHARDS IS REALLY CRACKING DOWN ON UH THE NURSING HOMES AND I DO NT KNOW YOU WOULD NT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT A TEXAS GOVERNOR .
I VE HEARD THE NAME AND THAT S ABOUT ALL IT GOES .
OKAY .
ANN RICHARDS IS OUR GOVERNOR IN TEXAS AND SHE S REALLY CRACKING DOWN ON RESTRICTIONS AND WHAT GOES ON IN NURSING HOMES .
AND UH MY SISTER S REAL INTERESTED IN THAT AND AND GETTING INTO THE TO THAT SIDE OF NURSING .
YEAH .
THAT S ONE PROBLEM WITH THE THE NURSING HOME ENVIRONMENT .
IT THE ELDERLY EVEN OUT OF THE NURSING HOME ARE VERY OPEN TO ABUSE .
RIGHT .
UH YOU KNOW THEY DO NT ALWAYS HAVE THEIR FULL WITS ABOUT THEM .
UHHUH .
THEY RE NOT COMPLETELY UP ON WHAT SHOULD BE GOING ON OR WHAT S NOT GOING ON .
UHHUH .
AND IT CAN BE PRETTY SAD .
I VE GOT A HAD A GRANDMOTHER .
WHO HAD A STROKE .
AND SHE WAS IN A NURSING HOME FOR FOUR OR FIVE YEARS BEFORE SHE DIED .
OH .
AND YOU KNOW IT S THE TYPE OF THING THAT SHE WAS LIVING DOWN IN FLORIDA .
MY IN FAMILIES WAS UP IN MARYLAND .
UHHUH .
AND THE OTHER PART OF HER FAMILY WAS UP IN UH NEW YORK STATE .
RIGHT .
AND YOU KNOW IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR EITHER .
THEM OR MY GRANDFATHER TO TAKE CARE OF HER SINCE SHE WAS UH YOU KNOW COULD NOT DO VERY MUCH FOR HERSELF AFTER THE STROKE .
RIGHT .
AND YOU KNOW THE NURSING HOME WAS THE YOU KNOW BEST FACILITY TO PUT HER IN .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW BESIDES MOVING HER UP WHICH IS NOT A PRACTICAL SOLUTION SINCE BOTH MY PARENTS WORK AND BOTH MY UH AUNTS AND UNCLE WORK .
RIGHT .
WHICH MEANS IT S YOU KNOW VERY DIFFICULT FOR SOME YOU ESSENTIALLY NEED TO HAVE SOMEONE TAKING CARE OF THE PERSON FULLTIME .
RIGHT .
AND YOU KNOW THERE S ALSO A LOT OF MEDICAL PROBLEMS .
THAT CA NT ALWAYS BE COMPLETELY HANDLED IN THE HOME .
RIGHT .
WHICH MAKES IT YOU KNOW IT S A NECESSARY EVIL .
I THINK .
UHHUH .
IT SURE IS .
AND SOME OF THE REALLY NICE ONES .
THAT REALLY TAKE CARE OF THEIR PEOPLE ARE SO EXPENSIVE .
BECAUSE .
YEAH .
CAUSE THEY CAN AFFORD TO HIRE THE PEOPLE .
THAT ARE REALLY GOING TO CARE FOR THE OLDER .
YEAH .
AND YOU KNOW EVEN THERE YOU HAVE TO WATCH OUT FOR YOU KNOW YOU GET ONE PERSON .
WHO S A LITTLE BIT DISHONEST WORKING IN THERE AND YOU KNOW THE ELDERLY SOMETIMES HAVE A LOT OF JEWELRY .
OH YEAH .
AND OTHER STUFF THAT JUST VERY EASILY TENDS TO DISAPPEAR IN THE NURSING HOMES .
RIGHT .
MY GRANDFATHER PASSED AWAY SEVERAL YEARS AGO .
I WAS MUCH YOUNGER .
BUT UH HE WAS IN THE NURSING HOME .
THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS OF HIS LIFE AND SOMEONE VISITED HIM .
EVERY DAY .
MY GRANDMOTHER DID .
BUT UH IF SHE COULD NT SOMEONE VISITED HIM .
EVERY DAY .
IT WAS IN A VERY SMALL TOWN NURSING HOME .
UHHUH .
AND UH PEOPLE DID NT GET PAID MUCH THERE AT ALL .
THEY DID NT CARE ABOUT WHAT WENT ON .
YEAH .
THEY WOULD LET A LET A PATIENT GET A LOT OF BED SORES .
UHHUH .
AND UH THE THE PEOPLE LIVING IN THE NURSING HOME WOULD HAVE ALL KINDS OF NEEDS .
THAT WOULD NT GET MET BECAUSE THEY WERE JUST OLD PEOPLE .
AND THEN THE NURSES AND DOCTORS REALLY DID NT PUT ANY FOR FORTH ANY .
LOVING CARE FOR THEM .
EITHER THAT OR THEY RE JUST SO UNDERSTAFFED THAT THEY CA NT AFFORD .
RIGHT .
TO PUT IN THE UH CARE THAT THEY NEED .
RIGHT .
CAUSE IT S YOU KNOW AN ELDERLY PERSON CAN YOU KNOW IT S LIKE A NEWBORN BABY .
YOU NEED .
UHHUH .
TO HAVE TWENTYFOUR HOUR CARE .
RIGHT .
UH ANSWERING ALL THE NEEDS CAUSE THEY CA NT DO MUCH FOR THEMSELVES AT CERTAIN POINTS .
RIGHT .
AND NURSES GET SO WORN DOWN .
UHHUH .
AND YOU KNOW THERE S A LOT OF NUMBER OF THE ELDERLY ARE VERY YOU KNOW COMPLAINING BECAUSE THEY REMEMBER THE WAY THAT THINGS USED TO BE .
RIGHT .
AND REMEMBER BEING ABLE TO DO THINGS FOR THEMSELVES .
WHICH YOU KNOW THEY NO LONGER CAN .
OH SURE .
AND THEY FEEL .
AND IT VERY VERY HARD FOR THEM TO ACCEPT THAT .
THEY FEEL PRETTY HELPLESS .
WE JUST UH MOVED MY GRANDFATHER INTO NOT A NURSING HOME BUT YOU KNOW A TRANSITIONAL TYPE FACILITY .
IS IT UH LIKE A RETIREMENT CENTER .
MORE OF A RETIREMENT HOME .
HE .
S GOT HIS OWN EFFICIENCY APARTMENT .
UHHUH .
AND THEY PROVIDE ONE MEAL .
A DAY .
UHHUH .
AND YOU KNOW THE REST OF THE HOUSEKEEPING AND OTHER MEALS .
A DAY ARE UP TO HIM .
UHHUH .
BUT THEY DO HAVE YOU KNOW GROUP ACTIVITIES GOING ON .
HOW S HE HANDLING THAT .
UH HE D MUCH RATHER BE LIVING ALONE IN HIS APARTMENT DOWN IN FLORIDA .
UHHUH .
UH YOU KNOW TO MOVE INTO THAT FACILITY .
WE MOVED HIM FROM FLORIDA UP TO MARYLAND AND .
OOH .
IT S IT S A BIT OF A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM WEATHERWISE IF NOTHING ELSE .
OH SURE .
THERE WAS NT ANYTHING LIKE THAT THAT YOU COULD DO IN FLORIDA .
WELL THERE WAS STUFF LIKE THAT IN FLORIDA BUT .
I UH TRY TO STAY AWAY FROM CARS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN TERMS OF .
REPAIR .
ACTUALLY UH THAT IS REALLY A SORE SPOT WITH ME .
I I THINK PERHAPS THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY IS IMPROVING BUT UH LIKE TEN YEARS AGO UH RELIABILITY OF AUTOMOBILES AT LEAST U S AUTOMOBILES WAS PRETTY DISMAL AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT THE UH REPAIR CAPABILITY OF UH SERVICE DEPARTMENTS AND DEALERSHIPS WAS EQUALLY DISMAL .
UHHUH .
AND UH IT SEEMED THAT THE ONLY WAY .
I COULD RELIABLY TAKE CARE OF MY CAR WAS TO REPAIR IT .
MYSELF .
WHICH IS NOT MY CUP OF TEA .
YEAH .
BUT UH I .
SO DO YOU HAVE A CAR .
PARDON .
DO YOU HAVE A CAR .
WELL AT THAT TIME ACTUALLY I HAD A VOLKSWAGEN RABBIT .
UHHUH .
AND UH IT WAS IT WAS A REAL LEMON .
UH SUBSEQUENTLY I GOT A UH BUICK CENTURY AND IT .
WAS NT AS BAD .
UHHUH .
BUT UH LAST YEAR .
I BOUGHT A HONDA ACCORD AND I TAKE IT IN ONCE EVERY SEVENTYFIVE HUNDRED MILES FOR ITS PERIODIC MAINTENANCE AND THAT IS IT .
AND IT S WONDERFUL .
YEAH .
WE USED TO HAVE A HONDA ACCORD AND THEY RE GOOD .
THEY RE REALLY GOOD CARS .
EVERY TIME .
I GET TAKEN TO AN AUTO REPAIR PLACE YOU KNOW EVERY TIME .
I GO I GET TAKEN .
BAD .
HUH .
YOU KNOW .
WOMAN GOES IN AND THEY GO ALL RIGHT WE GOT A SUCKER .
LET S GE SEE HOW MUCH MONEY .
WE CAN GET OUT OF HER YOU KNOW .
HUH .
THAT S WHAT HAPPENS EVERY TIME .
HUH .
UH SO .
SO WHA WHAT DO YOU HAVE .
I HAVE A PONTIAC SIX THOUSAND .
ALL THE MORE REASON TO UH HAVE A A HONDA .
YEAH .
BUT OUR HONDA JUST GOT OLD AND JUST WORE OUT .
IT WAS LET S SEE ELEVEN YEARS OLD AND IT JUST JUST OUT OF IT SO .
D SO YOU BOUGHT A PONTIAC .
NO HUHUH .
MY HU UH EXHUSBAND S THIS IS JUST HAPPENED A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO .
HE .
S MY EXHUSBAND BUT JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO WHEN HE WAS MY HUSBAND UH HIS FATHER GAVE US .
THIS CAR AND EVERYTHING IS WRONG WITH IT .
I MEAN THE POWER STEERING FLUID LEAKS THE OIL LEAKS THE BRAKE FLUID LEAKS YOU KNOW .
NOW THI WHA HOW OLD IS THE CAR .
UH EIGHTYSEVEN .
HUH .
AND HE JUST DOES NT TAKE CARE OF THINGS AND BUT I WAS AWARDED THE CAR SO .
THERE IS A MAN IN MY CHURCH .
THAT IS A MECHANIC AND I CAN TRUST HIM .
SO HE IS TRYING TO GET YOU KNOW THINGS FIXED ON IT .
HUH .
BUT IT S JUST YOU KNOW LEAK LEAK LEAK EVERYWHERE .
BUT UH YOU KNOW I HATE TO GO INTO A A REPAIR PLACE BECAUSE THEY LL TELL ME .
SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH IT AND IT S NOT YOU KNOW AND CHARGE ME TWICE AS MUCH .
THE LAST TIME .
I TOOK IT INTO A REPAIR SHOP THE MAN TOLD ME .
I NEEDED A MASTER CYLINDER .
SO I SAID OKAY .
AND HE CHARGED ME .
A HUNDRED AND THIRTY .
SOMETHING .
DOLLARS AND THEN UH ABOUT A MONTH LATER A MAN WAS LOOKING AT MY CAR AND HE ASKED ME YOU KNOW NOT A MAN NOT A REPAIR MAN BUT JUST A FRIEND AND I WAS TELLING HIM THAT I JUST A NEW MASTER CYLINDER PUT ON AND HE LOOKED AT AND HE SAID THAT S NOT A NEW MASTER CYLINDER .
HUH .
AND I DID NT EVEN KNOW WHAT .
ONE WAS .
AND UH HE SHOWED IT TO ME AND IT WAS OLD RUSTY JUST AWFUL .
IT WAS NO MORE NEW THAN NOTHING .
SO APPARENTLY IT WAS THE SAME ONE .
THAT WAS ON THERE .
UH MORE THAN LIKELY .
APPARENTLY JUST UH RE RE UH PROBABLY FILLED THE THE BRAKE FLUID UP AND THAT WAS IT .
THAT WAS IT PROBABLY .
IT WAS VE I WAS SO IRRITATED .
AND THAT S HAPPENED TO ME MORE THAN ONCE OR TWICE .
JUS JUST JUST ABOUT EVERY TIME .
I VE WENT IN SOMEWHERE .
SO WHAT S THE SOLUTION TO THAT .
I GUESS FIND A REPUTABLE SERVICE .
AND AND YOU .
JU CAN HARDLY FIND ONE YOU KNOW .
HUH .
THE GUY .
THAT S DOING MOST OF MY MY CAR NOW UH GOES TO MY CHURCH AND THAT S THE ONLY REASON YOU KNOW I GO TO HIM .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE I KNOW HIM AND I KNOW HE WILL TELL ME .
THE TRUTH .
BECAUSE HE DOES NT EVEN CHARGE ME FOR FOR DOING IT SO HE S NOT GOING TO YOU KNOW TAKE ME .
RIGHT .
I JUST PAY FOR THE PARTS AND HE DOES IT SO .
WELL THAT S WONDERFUL .
YEAH .
YOU RE LUCKY .
YEAH I AM SO I DO NT KNOW .
I DO NT KNOW WHAT .
THE SOLUTION TO THAT IS BECAUSE THE PLACE WHERE YOU BUY YOUR CAR THEY RE USUALLY THE WORST ONE OF ALL .
WE TOOK OUR HONDA TO THE HONDA DEALERSHIP AND THEY ENDED UP TELLING US .
WE NEEDED A BRAND NEW ENGINE FOR OUR CAR .
OH REALLY .
YEAH .
AND SO IDIOTS AS WE WERE NEITHER ONE OF US KNEW MUCH ABOUT CARS WE YOU KNOW THEY TOLD US .
WE JUST HAD TO HAVE ONE AND WE BOUGHT ONE .
WE DID NT NO MORE NEED NO NEW ENGINE GIVE ME BREAK YOU KNOW .

YEAH I WONDER I MEAN I WONDER WHAT WHAT REALLY IS THE ANSWER .
I MEAN IT SEEMS LIKE OUR OUR THE PRISON SYSTEMS WE CA NT SEEM TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT IT S A REFORM SYSTEM OR PENAL SYSTEM .
YEAH I THINK MOST PEOPLE REGARD IT AS A WAREHOUSE .
YEAH .
WHERE YOU PUT AWAY THE PEOPLE .
THAT ARE SO BAD THAT UH YOU DO NT WANT THEM OUT IN CIRCULATION .
BUT BUT THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT WE WE ONLY HAVE BUT SO MUCH ROOM AND WE WE TRY TO PUT ASIDE IN THE WAREHOUSE AND ALL .
WE DO IS JUST DISPLACE OTHER PEOPLE .
WHICH COME BACK INTO SOCIETY AND .
YEAH .
COMMIT CRIMES AND .
THAT S WHAT .
I HEAR .

SO WE VE TRIED TO GET OUT ONCE A YEAR AND GO ON A ANNIVERSARY CAMP OUT AND WE HAVE GONE UP INTO THE MOUNTAINS AND UH NOT NECESSARILY ROUGHED IT BUT WE HAVE JUST FOUND IT JUST REAL ENJOYABLE TO BE ALONE UP IN THE MOUNTAINS .
WELL THAT S GOOD .

THEY CAMPED IN TENTS AND THIS YEAR .
I BELIEVE THEY WILL BE IN TENTS ALSO .
UHHUH .
COURSE I IMAGINE IT GETS COLD IN PARTS OF UTAH .
UHHUH YEAH .
IT DOES NT GET VERY COLD IN TEXAS .
SO LOTS OF TIMES WE DO NT EVEN TAKE TENTS .
OH IS THAT RIGHT .
WE JUST USE TRAIL TARPS .
OH AND WHAT DOES THAT CONSIST OF .
UH IT S JUST A PIECE OF MATERIAL .
THAT HAS UH THAT HAS A LOT OF PLACES WHERE YOU CAN TIE OFF TO IT .
OH .
AND MAKE IT INTO A TENT .
UHHUH .
UH LIKE A UH THEY RE VERY LIGHT WEIGHT AND WE USE THEM WHEN WE GO BACKPACKING .
SO WE GO BACKPACKING FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MILES THEN UH THEY RE NOT VERY HEAVY SEE .
UHHUH .
SO YOU CARRY THEM WITH YOU AND .
OH .
THEY LL KEEP YOU DRY OR WHATEVER .
YES WELL SEE WHEN WHEN WE GO CAMPING HERE WE HAVE TO TAKE OUR BIG HUGE HEAVY SLEEPING BAGS AND LOTS OF TENTS AND I LIKE TO SLEEP ON THE AIR MATRESSES .
I M NOT MY BONES ARE GETTING SO OLD SO I LIKE TO I LIKE TO SLEEP ON THE MATRESSES .
UHHUH .
UM SO HAVE YOU HAD ANY ADVENTURES ON YOUR CAMPING TRIPS WITH ENCOUNTERS WITH WILD ANIMALS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT .
YE YES IN FACT UH UM LAST MONTH .
WE WENT CAMPING WE SAW A LOT OF DEER .
OH .
UH IN THE MORNING AND THE AFTERNOON .
MY WORD .
JUST DEER EVERYWHERE .
GEE .
UHHUH SO UH BUT IT EVEN THOUGH UH IT .
WAS NT HUNTING SEASON AND WE WERE WITH BOY SCOUTS SO .
UHHUH .
OF COURSE .
WE DO NT UH WANT TO GO HUNTING .
BUT WE GOT TO SEE A LOT OF DEER .
OH .
UM OUT AND ABOUT AND THERE S OF COURSE WE SEE SMALLER ANIMALS ALL THE TIME AND UH ONE THING .
THAT IS A BIG CONCERN IN THE EVENING AT NIGHT UH IS UH MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE FOOD S PUT AWAY AND SO FORTH .
OH .
BECAUSE UH WE HAVE UH ARMADILLOS .
DO YOU KNOW WHAT .
OH .
ARMADILLO IS .
UH THEY RE COVERED LIKE WITH A HEAVY ARMOR .
UHHUH .
TYPE STUFF UHHUH .
AND POSSUMS AND UH RACCOONS .
MY WORD .
AND WE HAVE THOSE CREATURES DOWN HERE THAT THEY LIKE TO UH THEY LIKE TO GO HUNTING FOR A MIDNIGHT SNACK .
UHHUH .
AND SO THAT THAT UH THAT CAN BE A PROBLEM IF YOU DO NT PUT ALL YOUR EQUIPMENT AWAY .
BUT THEY WO NT NECESSARILY ATTACK A HUMAN OR BITE YOU OR ANYTHING .
THEY WILL IF YOU ATTACK THEM .
OH .
BUT MOST TIME .
THEY RUN AWAY FROM YOU .
UHHUH .
IF THEY IF THEY SEE YOU RE UP YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
BUT THEY DO NT HAVE ANY PROBLEM WALKING RIGHT BY YOU IF YOU RE ASLEEP .
OH MY WORD .
SO .
WELL THAT SOUNDS A LITTLE LESS FIERCE THAN BEARS .
WE WE WANT TO .
THINK ABOUT UH TAXES .
WELL I THINK THEY RE A NECESSARY EVIL .
UH I WISH THE GOVERNMENT WOULD OPERATE ON THE SAME PREMISE THAT UH BUSINESSES OPERATE ON AND THAT IS UH .
YOU SPEND WHAT .
YOU HAVE AND .
YOU YOU DO NT SPEND MORE THAN YOU THAN YOU BRING IN .
YEAH I THINK THAT THE GENERAL IDEA IS TO S YOU KNOW SPEND UH DURING A TIME OF RECESSION THAT YOU KNOW FOR THE DEFICIT SPENDING TO HELP PICK UP THE ECONOMY BUT THEY RE RUNNING UNDER THE ASSUMP YOU KNOW THE WAY .
THEY RE RUNNING IT NOW THEY RE H YOU KNOW RUNNING IT UNDER A DEFICIT SPENDING YOU KNOW WHILE WE RE NOT UNDER A RECESSION SO THERE S NEVER ANY SURPLUS COMING IN TO COUNTER THE DEFICIT THAT WE RE RUNNING SO THAT S KIND OF A BASIC THING OF ECONOMICS I GUESS KEEP SPENDING KEEP GOING INTO DEBT YOU RE NOT GOING TO PAYOFF .
WHAT .
YOU OWE BUT SO I GUESS THE THE QUESTION WAS MORE LIKE UH DO YOU GET WHAT .
YOU PAY F YOU KNOW GET WHAT .
YOU PAY FOR .
WELL I IT JUST DEPENDS .
UH UH ROADS ARE VERY EXPENSIVE UH COMMODITY AND SO IS UH UTILITIES THEY SUPPLY AND POLICE AND FIRE DEPARTMENT UH YOU KNOW THEY NEED TO MAKE A LIVING .
YEAH .
THERE S .
SO I THINK FOR FOR FOR MANY YEARS UH WE VE PAID TEACHERS AND POLICE OFFICERS AND FIREMEN .
WHO ARE UH TO A GREAT EXTENT PUBLIC SERVANTS .
UHHUH .
UH WE HAVE NOT PAID THEM REALLY WHAT .
THEY RE WORTH IN WHAT .
THEY CONTRIBUTE TO SOCIETY .
I AGREE WITH THAT .
BUT UH THEN AGAIN UH IT S THE HARD TO JUSTIFY WITH ALL THE WASTEFULNESS OF MONEY THAT THE GOVERNMENT SPENDS ON ALL LEVELS OF OF UH GOVERNMENT INCLUDING MUNICIPALITIES AS WELL AS STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS .
I GUESS I M I M A STUDENT RIGHT NOW AND I DO NT MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY AND SO I I .
KIND OF DO NT PAY A PROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF TAXES TO I GUESS UH COMPARED TO WHAT .
I GET BECAUSE I YOU KNOW ALL MY MY EDUCATION IS STATE SPONSORED .
I GO TO A STATE SPONSORED SCHOOL AND UH MY EDUCATION .
ALL UP THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL AND STUFF SO I GUESS I M KIND OF IN DEBT I I SUPPOSE BECAUSE I DO NT YOU KNOW BEEN PAYING TAXES ALL THAT ALL THAT LONG .
MY PARENTS I GUESS H H HOWEVER HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THAT YOU KNOW FOR THE EDUCATION SIDE OF IT AND EVERYTHING BUT UH I USUALLY END UP GETTING MONEY BACK .
I WILL THIS YEAR ANYWAY FROM A .
UH YOU RE VERY FORTUNATE .
YEAH I AM .
I NEED IT TOO OTHERWISE .
WE JUST TRY NOT TO PAY ANY MORE IN THAN WE HAVE TO UH WE PAY IN A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT .
UH .
UHHUH .
WE DO NT REGRET PAYING TAXES .
WE DO THINK THAT UH SOMETIMES UH WE HAVE A REVERSE OF A REGRESSIVE TAX A PROGRESSIVE TAX .
UHHUH .
AND PROGRESSIVE TAX I THINK UH DOES NOT GIVE PEOPLE INCENTIVE TO MAKE MORE MONEY AND WHAT .
I MEAN BY THAT THE MORE INCOME .
YOU MAKE THE MORE TAX .
YOU PAY .
MORE TAXES YOU PAY .
IT SHOULD BE I THINK A FLAT PERCENTAGE AND UH THAT PERCENTAGE OUGHT TO BE AN EQUITABLE AMOUNT .
UHHUH .
IS NT .
UH LAST YEAR WHEN THEY PASSED THE TAX LAWS FOR THE UH NINETEEN NINETY NINETYONE WHATEVER NINETEEN NINETYONE .
UHHUH .
UH I ADDED UP ALL THE TAXES THAT WE WERE GOING TO PAY ON ALL THESE DIFFERENT SPECIFIC LUXURY ITEMS AND TRAVEL EXPENSES AND .
UHHUH .
EVERYTHING ELSE AND I TOTALED THEM .
ALL UP AND BASICALLY UH WE WERE GOING TO BE PAYING SEVENTY OR EIGHTY PERCENT TAX .
WOW .
NOW THAT WAS THE ASSUMPTION THAT YOU SPENT THAT SAME DOLLAR FOR EVERY FOR EVERY ITEM ON THERE .
UHHUH .
EVEN THOUGH THERE S UH TAXES ON DIFFERENT THINGS .
WELL IS NT .
BUT YOU KNOW THERE S F THERE S A LOT OF TAXES YOU PAY THAT YOU RE NOT EVEN AWARE OF THAT YOU RE PAYING UH LIKE WHEN YOU BUY A TIRE YOU PAY A FEDERAL EXCISE TAX .
UHHUH THERE S A LOT YEAH LOT OF HIDDEN TAXES .
YOU PAY GASOLINE TAXES .
EVERY TIME .
YOU PUMP SOMETHING INTO YOUR YOUR .
UHHUH .
TANK .
THE TAXES THAT PEOPLE DO NT THINK ABOUT THAT YEAH THE THE THE INCOME TAX IS A LOT .
MORE VISIBLE PORTION OF THE TAXES YOU PAY I GUESS .
BUT YOU PROBABLY PAY MORE PERCENTAGE WISE IN OTHER TAXES .
UHHUH .
THERE WAS THAT .
WHICH CAN WAS IT .
JERRY BROWN ONE OF THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES HAD A PROPOSAL FOR DOING AWAY WITH ALL THE THE TAX CODES THEY HAVE NOW AND IMPLEMENTING A F I THINK A FLAT PERCENTAGE SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
YEAH IF YOU .
IMPL IMPLEMENTED A FLAT PERCENTAGE IT WOULD ENCOURAGE PEOPLE UH TO MAKE MORE MONEY AND THE WHAT PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND IN MY OPINION NOW THIS IS JUST MY OPINION OKAY UH IS THAT BUSINESSES CREATE JOBS AND JOBS CREATE INCOME AND INCOME PAYS TAXES .
UHHUH .
AND SO IF THEY PENALIZE BUSINESSES BUSINESS PEOPLE ARE SMART ENOUGH TO SAY HERE S MY BREAK POINT I M NOT GOING TO WORK ANY HARDER .
RIGHT .
AND MAKE ANY MORE OR CREATE ANY MORE JOBS .
EXACTLY .
THAT S BECAUSE .
AND SO .
UNTIL LIKE EIGHT .
BASED ON THAT WHO DO YOU THINK YOU RE TALKING TO YOU RE TALKING TO AN EMPLOYER .
UP UNTIL LIKE EIGHTYFIVE OR SOMETHING WAS THE .
OKAY UM I GUESS IF I HAD TO RATE IT FROM ONE TO TEN I GUESS .
I WOULD RATE IT A FIVE IN THE ASPECT THAT I WOULD NT WANT EVERYBODY TO HAVE GUNS AND I THINK THERE SHOULD BE LIMITATIONS OF LIKE SEMIAUTOMATICS UH THINGS LIKE THAT SHOULD NOT BE JUST GIVEN OUT TO ANYBODY IN FACT YOU KNOW I CA NT IMAGINE ANYBODY HAVING A SEMIAUTOMATIC FOR WHAT PURPOSE UH .
SO I GUESS YOU KNOW BEING THAT I COME FROM A HUNTING FAMILY .
UHHUH .
I D RATHER HAVE SOME RESTRICTIONS PUT ON WEAPONS BUT YET ALLOW HUNTING RIFLES UH THINGS THAT PEOPLE WOULD USE FOR SPORTING TYPE OF UH A ACTIVITY THOSE WOULD BE FINE BUT WHEN YOU GET INTO A A LOT OF THE MORE COMPLEX WEAPONS I WOULD SAY YES WE NEED TO PUT RESTRICTIONS ON THEM .
UH THAT S PRO I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE TO AGREE WITH YOU PRETTY MUCH ALL THE WAY I THINK .
UHHUH .
UH I DEFINITELY THINK THAT THERE SOME THINGS SHOULD NT BE LIMITED LIKE LIKE YOU SAID RIFLES AND .
UHHUH .
UH HUNTING RIFLES AND POSSIBLE HANDGUNS FOR PEOPLE WHO USE THEM TO .
EXACTLY FOR SELFPROTECTION SURE .
RIGHT AND BUT I THINK THE I THINK SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS PEOPLE SAY THEY USE THEM BECAUSE IT FOR SPORT BUT I I PERSONALLY CAN NOT SEE ANY USE FOR THEM .
I CA NT IMAGINE THAT YEAH .
OTHER THAN UH FOR FOR LIKE PEOPLE WHO DISLIKE MUMBLEX HAVE SOME SORT OF CRAZED .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AMBITION TO USE HAVE HIGH POWERED WEAPONS OR SOMETHING .
TO DO MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF KILLING UH .
RIGHT AND .
YEAH .
I MEAN YOU CAN ONLY HOW MUCH DO YOU WA .
THE ONLY THING THAT I CAN SEE IS THE POLICE HAVING IT IN A CASE WHERE SOMEBODY IS UH UH YOU KNOW GOING TO KILL A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE OR UH SOMEBODY THAT S ESCAPING THAT S UH VERY DANGEROUS .
UHHUH .
SEMIAUTOMATIC WOULD ALLOW MORE ROUNDS TO BE PUT OUT TO HOPEFULLY CATCH THE PERSON AND AND UH GET HIM DOWN .
RIGHT .
BUT UH YOU KNOW I I THINK OF MY FAMILY UH THEY RE VERY MUCH INTO SPORTING AND UH YOU KNOW AS FAR AS HUNTING AND ALSO LIKE UH CLAY PIGEONS .
RIGHT .
THINGS LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
SO THEY HAVE MAY HAVE SOME SHOTGUNS THEY MAY HAVE OTHER TYPE OF UH HUNTING TYPE THINGS BUT I FIGURED IF THE IF THE CRIMINALS HAD TO TAKE A HUNTING GUN OUT TO KILL SOMEBODY MORE THAN LIKELY SOMEBODY WOULD SEE IT YOU KNOW WHAT I M SAYING .
RIGHT YEAH .
VERSUS A YOU KNOW A SMALL HANDGUN UH .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
THAT CAN BE YOU KNOW PUT RIGHT IN YOUR COAT POCKET AND NOBODY WOULD SEE IT .
BUT YET YOU CA NT STOP PEOPLE FROM HAVING YOU KNOW A HANDGUN IN THEIR HOME .
RIGHT .
EVEN IF THERE ARE SMALL CHILDREN AROUND THERE S YOU KNOW .
YOU CA NT SAY PEOPLE WITH SMALL CHILDREN CA NT HAVE GUNS .
UHHUH .
AND PEOPLE WITHOUT SMALL CHILDREN THAT MAY HAVE GRANDCHILDREN YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
STILL HAVE THESE GUNS BUT .
RIGHT .
UH I GUESS I I WAS ALWAYS TAUGHT .
NUMBER ONE A GUN IS NT A TOY .
RIGHT .
UH YOU KNOW AND I DO NT KNOW IF THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE IF THE PARENT SETS DOWN TO THEM AND SAY THIS GUN CAN KILL YOU YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
AND DO NT EVER PLAY WITH IT .
RIGHT .
UH SO I DO NT KNOW IF THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE OR WHAT BUT .
WELL I THINK PAR UH IN THAT CA I THINK THAT CASES LIKE THAT IT S DEFINITELY UM I THINK IF YOU RE TO SAY OKAY WE HAVE TO GET RID OF THEM ALL BECAUSE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THEY CAN ONLY THEY ONLY SEEM TO DO BAD IT IT S UH IT S SAYING WE RE T .
THE CRIMINALS WOULD GET THEM I MEAN EVEN IF THEY HAD TO GO ACROSS BORDER TO GET THEM .
RIGHT RIGHT AND PEOPLE WHO PEOPLE WHO HAVE THEM AND ARE RESPONSIBLE WITH THEM ARE ARE ARE BEING PUNISHED AND PEOPLE WHO .
UHHUH .
AND THEY RE SAYING THAT PEOPLE YOU CAN NOT TAKE CARE OF THINGS YOURSELF OR LIKE THAT YOU RE NOT SMART ENOUGH TO TEACH YOUR KIDS HOW TO HOW TO UH MUMBLEX .
HOW TO USE YOU KNOW TO MAKE SURE THE GUNS ARE PUT UP AS SOMETHING AS .
RIGHT .
UH NOT A TOY .
RIGHT .
YEAH BECAUSE WE HAD GUNS ALL OVER OUR HOUSE WHEN WE WERE KIDS .
UHHUH .
AND NOT THAT THEY WERE LAYING ON THE UH COUCH OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT .
RIGHT .
BUT UH I NEVER HAD AN INTEREST IN THEM .
BEING IN THE FACT THAT I KNEW THAT GUNS COULD KILL .
UHHUH .
AND I HAD FOUR BROTHERS AND NEVER MESSED WITH ANY TYPE OF GUNS .
RIGHT .
AND SO IT WAS KIND OF THE IDEA THAT WE KNEW THAT A GUN COULD KILL AND THAT A GUN WAS NT A TOY .
RIGHT .
AND OF COURSE WE WERE QUITE YOUNG AND WE WENT THROUGH .
UH THE NATIONAL RIFLE UH CLUB .
UHHUH .
AND SO WE WERE TAUGHT YOU KNOW KIND OF AT A A GOOD AGE TEN AND ELEVEN AND TWELVE TO SIT DOWN WITH A KID AND SAY OKAY IF YOU RE GOING TO LEARN HOW TO SHOOT A GUN YOU RE GOING TO LEARN HOW TO DO IT CORRECTLY AND YOU RE GOING TO LEARN HOW TO HAVE SAFEGUARDS AND .
UHHUH .
AND KNOW HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF BUT YET HAVE THIS .
TRAINING SO THAT KIDS ARE NT YOU KNOW THEY HAVE TO HAVE A CERTAIN RESPECT FOR IT .
RIGHT WELL I THINK I MEAN WE I GREW UP IN A FAMILY AND AND MY FATHER HAD TWO GUNS .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE HE USED TO HUNT YEARS AGO BUT .
SURE .
HE STOPPED BEFORE REALLY BEFORE I WAS OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER .
UHHUH .
BUT AND I KNEW WE HAD THE GUNS IN THE HOUSE AND TH THE TIME MY FATHER WAS KEEPING THEM JUST FOR PROTECTION AT THE TIME .
SURE YEAH .
BUT WE IT WAS NEVER MY BROTHERS SISTERS NOR I NEVER I MEAN NONE OF US EVER THOUGHT WELL LET S GO LOOK AT THE GUN OR LET S GO GET THE GUN MUMBLEX IT WAS JUST SOMETHING YOU KNEW WAS THERE .
YES .
AND TH IT WAS YOUR FATHER S AND Y YOU THAT WAS NOT SOMETHING YOU D GO AND PLAY PLAYED WITH AT ALL .
YEAH .
AND I THINK MAYBE UH AND THAT S THE TYPE OF THE THING THAT SHOULD BE YOU KNOW STRESSED .
YEAH I THINK SO AN AND I DO NT KNOW IF THE KIDS NOWADAYS ARE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT .
SO UH WHAT THINGS DO YOU CONSIDER AN INVASION OF PRIVACY .
OOH WELL I DO NT KNOW .
WHAT DO YOU THINK .
OH I DO NT KNOW .
I HAD A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT .
I WAS THINKING OF LIKE UH I DO NT KNOW I WAS JU STARTED TO THINK ABOUT ALL THE BIG YOU KNOW DATA BASES THEY HAVE WITH ALL THE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU ON THEM LIKE THE CREDIT REPORTS .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND ALL THOSE YOU KNOW DEMOGRAPHICS STUDIES THAT THEY DO THAT UM YOU KNOW HAVE WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH YOU KNOW STUFF ABOUT ALL THE PURCHASES THAT YOU VE MADE AND EVERYTHING KEPT TRACT SOMEWHERE AND I DO NT KNOW I DO NT KNOW HOW MUCH THE STUFF ACTUALLY WHAT .
THEY ACTUALLY HAVE IN THERE BUT .
HUH .
I KNOW THEY USE THAT I MEAN THEY SELL THOSE .
WELL WHAT ABOUT UH REQUIRED DRUG TESTING UH AS A UH CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT .
YEAH THAT WAS THAT THAT WAS THE OTHER ONE .
I WAS THINKING OF .
I THINK THAT S UH I MEAN I KNOW DRUGS ARE ILLEGAL .
IT .
MUMBLEX THING ACTUALLY .
UH I UH HAVE WORKED AT TEXAS INSTRUMENTS .
HUH .
UHHUH .
AND UH THEY INSTITUTED A DRUG POLICY THERE .
DRUG TESTING POLICY WHERE THEY RANDOMLY WOULD TEST UH EMPLOYEES .
UHHUH .
AND ACTUALLY TO TELL YOU .
THE TRUTH I REALLY DID NOT THINK MUCH ABOUT IT .
I I HAD NT YOU KNOW IT REALLY DID NT RELATE TO ME .
BUT THERE WERE SOME THINGS THAT PEOPLE BROUGHT UP LIKE WELL WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY THEY GET A FALSE POSITIVE YOU KNOW WHAT RECOURSE DO YOU HAVE .
UHHUH .
AND ALSO UH UH THIS IS AGAINST THE LAW FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO DO THIS KIND OF THING THIS KIND OF BIG BROTHER ACTIVITY AND YET UH A LOT OF THESE LARGE CORPORATIONS SUCH AS TEXAS INSTRUMENTS ALTHOUGH THEY DO NT ADMIT TO IT IT S ACTUALLY OH A DRUG TESTING POLICY COMES ABOUT AS A RESULT OF GOVERNMENT PRESSURE .
UHHUH .
SO WHAT .
THAT MEANS IS TO ME THAT REALLY IT S THE GOVERNMENT .
THAT S REQUIRING THIS ALTHOUGH THEY DO NT ACTUALLY E EXECUTE IT .
THEMSELVES IT S REALLY THE GOVERNMENT .
THAT MUMBLEX .
SO IN THAT SENSE IT AT LEAST PHILOSOPHICALLY IT S REALLY BORDERLINE LEGAL .
UHHUH .
WELL I I THINK THE I THINK THAT YOU KNOW A PERSON S COMPETENCE SHOULD BE MORE DETERMINED BY YOU KNOW THEIR ACTIONS AND THEIR BEHAVIOR AND IF THEY RE YOU KNOW IF THEY RE ON SOME KIND OF YOU KNOW CONTOL CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE THEN YOU KNOW IT .
KINDS OF TAKES AWAY FROM THE JOB OF YOU KNOW THE SUPERVISOR OR MANAGER TYPE PERSON YOU KNOW WHO IS ABLE TO EVALUATE THEM .
I THINK THEY SHOULD BE EVALUATED THAT WAY RATHER THAN WITH A YOU KNOW A CHEMICAL YOU KNOW .
WELL WHAT ABOUT THIS UH AIDS EPIDEMIC NOW .
WHERE YOU FIND THAT UH UH YOU KNOW CERTAIN PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY ARE ARE CRIMINAL IN THEIR DISREGARD FOR IT .
THESE PEOPLE .
THAT ARE CARRIERS AND DO NT .
OTHERS .
YEAH AND .
THAT DO NT REVEAL IT .
AND UH OF COURSE THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION IS TO OPERATE ON THEIR BRAIN SO THAT IT DOES NT .
IT UH IT DESTROYS THEIR LIBIDO .
YEAH THA THAT WOULD BE KIND OF AN EXTREME .
NOW UH YOU KNOW IF THEY EVER .
I MEAN I VE HEARD OF THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW MAKING THEM YOU KNOW MARKING THEM SOMEHOW OR YOU KNOW OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR YOU KNOW PUTTING THEM ALL SOMEPLACE LIKE IN A KIND OF .
SO WHAT ABOUT THAT AS AN INVASION OF PRIVACY .
YEAH .
WEL I GUESS IT .
KIND OF BORDERS ON WHERE I MEAN WHAT DO YOU VALUE MORE .
THE INVASION OF UH THE PERSON S PRIVACY OR THE POSSIBLE DANGER TO YOU KNOW OTHER PEOPLE .
SO REALLY IT .
I GETS TO BALANCING UH PERSONAL FREEDOM AGAINST UH THE GENERAL WELFARE .
YEAH .
OF SOCIETY .
I GUESS THAT S ALWA THAT S BEEN THE BIG ROLE OF GOVERNMENT I GUESS .
I MEAN GENERALLY .
WELL IT IT S SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN .
YEAH .
YEAH .
WELL THAT S KIND OF A DIFFICULT ONE TO GO INTO .
I MEAN THAT THAT PARTICULAR CASE .
NO IT .
BECAUSE I MEAN THERE S A LOT OF PEOPLE .
THAT UH I MEAN THEY COULD REQUIRE YOU KNOW OB OBLIGATORY AIDS TESTING FOR EVERYONE BECAUSE I M YOU KNOW THERE S A HUGE PART OF THE POPULATION NOT A HUGE PART BUT A YOU KNOW .
A GROWING PART .
THE AIDS POPULATION .
I GUESS THAT HAVE IT THAT DO NT KNOW THEY DO .
UHHUH .
ARE SPREADING IT .
BUT AGAIN TO REQUIRE YOU KNOW SUCH A TEST AND JUS AND THEN TO MAKE MAKE IT MUMBLEX IS TO SUBJECT THEM TO TO DISCRIMI DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES AND OTHER THINGS .
I DO NT KNOW UH I DO NT KNOW HOW EXACTLY I FEEL ABOUT THAT .
MAYBE CHOP THEIR WEENIES OFF .
I M READY WELL IN ATLANTA GEORGIA YOU PROBABLY HAVE A LOT MORE CRIME THAN WE HAVE HERE IN PATTERSON CALIFORNIA .
OH COULD COULD BE .
UH THIS LITTLE CITY IS ONLY ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE .
HUH .
SO .
YEAH WE IS IS CRIME A PROBLEM THERE MUMBLEX LIKE A MAJOR PROBLEM MINOR PROBLEM OR .
WELL IN PATTERSON THERE S IT S NOT A PROBLEM HERE BUT LIKE UH I LIVED IN OAKLAND UH UNTIL JUST RECENTLY .
UHHUH .
AND UH OAKLAND CALIFORNIA GOD THEY VE HAD LIKE UH SIXTYSEVEN MURDERS SO FAR THIS YEAR COMPARED TO LIKE UH FORTY AT THIS TIME LAST YEAR .
YEAH .
SO IT S REALLY BAD THERE .
YEAH .
AND AND IT S ALL RELATED TO DRUGS IT SEEMS LIKE .
OH YEAH .
IS THAT WHAT IT S THERE TOO .
YEAH I VE ONLY BEEN HERE FOR LIKE UH PROBABLY JUST OVER SIX MONTHS I START I .
UHHUH .
STARTED SCHOOL HERE UH I CAME FROM A SMALLER TOWN IN IN NEW YORK .
UHHUH .
AND CRI THE CITY WAS FAIRLY BIG SIZE OR NOT REAL BIG BUT WE HAD A PROBLEM THERE BUT HERE THERE S JUST NO COMPARISON THAT MUCH MORE CRIME .
UHHUH .
UH EVERY NIGHT THE NEWS IS VERY DEPRESSING BECAUSE IT JUST THEY RUN DOWN THE LIST OF HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE SHOT YOU KNOW DRIVE BY SHOOTINGS OR .
YEAH .
WHATEVER AND IT S IT IT S PRETTY BAD THEY RE THEY RE IT S THINGS HAVE BASICALLY IMPROVED HERE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THEY VE THEY VE ACTUALLY TAKEN STEPS TO TRY TO MAKE IT BETTER BUT IT STILL IT STILL IS A PROBLEM .
YEAH LIKE I DO NT KNOW WHAT THEY CAN DO TO MAKE IT BETTER UNLESS THEY JUST HIRE MORE POLICEMEN .
WELL THAT S THAT SEEMS TO BE WHAT THEY WERE DOING AND IT HAS AND THEY VE STARTED STEPPED UP MORE PATROLS IN CERTAIN AREAS AND IT HAS .
UHHUH .
HAS MADE SOME PLACES SAFER BUT YOU KNOW IT S VERY DIFFICULT I MEAN IF YOU DO NT HAVE AN INFINITE AMOUNT OF MONEY TO TO TRY TO STOP THE PROBLEM ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE WISH YOU COULD .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AS IT IS A IT S DEFINITELY A PROBLEM AND .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THE MORE MORE LESS THAT S DONE ABOUT IT THE MORE IT SEEMS IT TENDS TO SPREAD INTO SMALLER AREAS UNFORTUNATELY .
YEAH WELL I I THINK THAT IF THEY WOULD DO SOMETHING TO THESE PEOPLE THAT THEY DO CATCH INSTEAD OF JUST SLAPPING THEIR LITTLE HANDS .
RIGHT .
AND YOU KNOW THEN MAYBE THOSE OTHER PEOPLE WOULD BE KIND OF SCARED AND THEY WOULD NOT DO THESE BAD THINGS YOU KNOW .
YEAH I THINK I THINK THAT UH IT S UH SEEMS TO BE THAT I DO NT KNOW SOME PEOPLE THEY TE THEY DO SOMETHING YOU KNOW THEY SHOOT SOMEBODY OR WHATEVER THEY GO TO JAIL SENTENCED TO JAIL FOR LIKE THIRTY YEARS THEY RE OUT IN FIVE AND THEY RE BACK ON THE STREET AND THEN THEY SHOOT SOMEONE ELSE AND JUST A A CYCLE AND IT SEEMS SEEMS AS THOUGH THE THE SYSTEM DOES NT CHA TEND TO STOP THEM UNLESS SOMETHING IS DRASTIC IS DONE .
YEAH I JUST DO NT UNDERSTAND OUR OUR LAWS HERE BECAUSE YOU KNOW LIKE IN OTHER COUNTRIES MAN I MEAN THEY RE REALLY A LOT STRICTER THAN WE ARE .
YEAH IT S DEFINITELY TRUE IT SEEMS SEEMS AS THOUGH WE TRY TO PLAY HUMANITARIAN I THINK TO A LITTLE TO MUCH AND MAYBE SOME OF THE PEOPLE DO NT DESERVE THE THE HUMANITARIAN TREATMENT THAT THEY GET .
UHHUH UHHUH .
BUT I DO NT KNOW IT S A DIFFICULT SITUATION I THINK AND SOME SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE BECAUSE I DEFINITELY THINK IT S IT IT REALLY PLAYS REEKS HAVOC WITH YOUR QUALITY OF LIFE WHEN YOU KNOW YOU CAN SEE IT S GOING ON AROUND YOU BUT THEN WHEN ONCE IT FINALLY AFFECTS YOU THEN THEN IT REALLY STARTS TO BOTHER YOU .
UHHUH UHHUH UH .
BUT IT SEEMS I MEAN PEOPLE HAVE MOVED LIKE OUT OF THE CITY BECAUSE THEY WANT TO GET AWAY FROM THE CRIME AND SO THEY TEND TO SPREAD THE CITIES FARTHER AND FARTHER OUT BUT YOU KNOW IT S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE YOU KNOW IT STILL CATCHES UP WITH THEM YOU CA NT REALLY RUN AWAY FROM THE PROBLEM .
YEAH .
AND SOMETHING YOU KNOW SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE BUT JUST THAT TOO MANY PEOPLE ARGUE ABOUT HOW TO FIX IT .
YEAH I KNOW WHEN I LIVED IN OAKLAND IT WAS JUST THAT UH LIKE I DEFINITELY WOULD NT GO INTO CERTAIN AREAS OF OF THE CITY BY MYSELF .
OH SURE .
AND UH AND THEN THEN AGAIN SOME AREAS I WOULD NT GO BY MYSELF AFTER DARK .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
BUT DOWN HERE IN PATTERSON WELL LIKE I SAY IT S SO SMALL .
YEAH .
THAT YOU CAN GO ANYWHERE .
YEAH THAT S GOOD .
BUT JUST UH LIKE TWENTY MILES AWAY SEE IN MODESTO THEY HAVE UH THOSE GANGS AND THINGS OVER THERE .
RIGHT .
AND IT IT S BAD IN SACRAMENTO ALSO THEY HAVE UH DRIVE BY SHOOTINGS IT SEEMS LIKE ALL THE TIME .
YEAH .
SO I DO NT KNOW .
YEAH .
I JUST I JUST DO NT KNOW WHAT WHAT THEY CAN DO YOU KNOW .
YEAH IT S IT S TO BAD BECAUSE IT S UH I MEAN TH JUST EVEN THE RANDOM OCCURRENCES WHERE YOU KNOW IT S UNSAFE FOR A WOMAN JUST TO WALK FROM THE CAR TO THE SOME IN CERTAIN AREAS LIKE FROM THE CAR FROM THEIR CAR TO THE MALL OR SOMETHING AND IT S DANGEROUS .
I KNOW .
AND IT S JUST THAT S JUST RIDICULOUS AND YOU KNOW IT S JUST THAT S JUST NOT RIGHT SOMETHING YOU KNOW .
YEAH I MEAN LIKE EVEN EVEN GOING TO THE GROCERY STORE I KNOW WE VE HAD THIS ONE LADY THAT WAS ATTACKED YOU KNOW .
RIGHT RIGHT .
I MEAN JUST YOU JUST YOU JUST DO NT KNOW WHAT TO DO ANYMORE YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .

THAT S A GOOD WAY TO GET STARTED .
UH I HAVE A A UH REALLY NICE DESK .
A NICER DESK THAN I COULD AFFORD .
WHICH .
I GOT BECAUSE MY SISTER .
WHO WORKED IN A HOSPITAL UH .
UHHUH .
LIBERATED IT AFTER A FIRE AND UH WE STRIPPED IT .

I I UH PUT TOGETHER A A UP ROLLTOP DESK FROM SCRATCH .
OH REALLY .
YOU KNOW A KIT .
OH .
I M JEALOUS .

STILL HAD TO CUT IT AND EVERYTHING BUT .
UHHUH .
IT WAS FUN .
YEAH .
I I DO DO THINGS UH THAT MIGHT BE TOO CRUDE TO BE CALLED WOODWORKING .
I VE BUILT MY OWN DECK AND UH .
UHHUH .
THINGS LIKE THAT .
YEAH .
I I VE DONE THE SAME .
YOU KNOW LIKE THE TRIM AROUND THE HOUSE .
YOU KNOW .
AND UH .
THE BASEBOARDS AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
I DEFINITELY HAVE BEGUN TO ACCUMULATE TOOLS TOO .
MY I UH .
UHHUH .
I PICKED UP A BUNCH OF CRAFTSMAN TOOLS FROM THE FORTIES THAT MY WIFE S FATHER OWNED WHEN HE WAS ALIVE AND SO I DO HAVE A BAND SAW AND A ROUTER AND UH THINGS LIKE THAT OUT IN THE GARAGE .
BUT I CA NT SAY I USE THEM VERY OFTEN .
UM .
YEAH I M LOOKING AT TRYING TO GET A ROUTER RIGHT NOW .
THEY RE HANDY UH THEY .
MUMBLEX .
THEY COME IN HANDY AT THE MOST UNUSUAL TIMES .
PUTTING DOORS IN IS THE TIME WHEN I M UH I BOUGHT MYSELF .
A UH TEMPLATE FOR MAKING MORTICES AND DOORS AND THAT S A WHOLE LOT EASIER THAN DOING IT WITH A CHISEL .
I LL BET .
BUT I VE ALSO I VE ALSO USED THEM FOR BUILDING DRAWERS WHERE YOU UH FOR RABBETING AND UH BECAUSE UH RABBETING ON MY TABLE ON MY UH RADIAL ARM SAW IS A LITTLE BIT UNCERTAIN .
UHHUH .
SO I GOT ONE FOR CHRISTMAS .
A FEW YEARS AGO AND USED IT QUITE A BIT FOR THE FIRST EIGHT MONTHS I HAD IT AND NOW I USE IT TWICE A YEAR MAYBE .
YEAH .
MY BR MY BROTHER S USED IT .
A LOT FOR MAKING DRAWERS .
I DO NT .
THE BIG .
KNOW WHAT WHAT S YOUR OPINION OF WHA WHAT .
A GOOD ROUTER IS LIKE .
YOU KNOW I .
UH I GUESS IT .
BECAUSE HE WAS TELL ME LIKE THE ONES THAT YOU DIAL IN ARE NT ALL THAT GREAT .
THEY VE PLASTIC PARTS AND STUFF .
THE ONES THAT WHAT .
THAT YOU DIAL IN ON THE SIDE .
UH I HAVE NEVER EVEN S I HAVE NEVER EVEN LOOKED AT ONE CLOSELY .
UH THE THE .
UHHUH .
LITTLE USE THAT I VE GOTTEN FROM MY ROUTER I WOULD SAY UH I WOULD SPEND MY MONEY ON THE BITS .
UHHUH .
UH I HAVE A I D GUESS YOU D CALL A MEDIUM QUALITY CRAFTSMAN ROUTER AND THE UH .
HOW STRONG IS IT .
IT S STRONG ENOUGH FOR ANY JOB WHERE YOU DO NT TRY TO TAKE MORE THAN SAY THREEEIGHTHS OF AN INCH AT A TIME .
BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE UH AS WITH ANY ANY TIME .
YOU BUY A A .
DO NT THEY .
TOOL WITH .
UHHUH .
A A AS A AS A PACKAGE .
UHHUH .
THE BITS THAT THEY GIVE YOU ARE LOW END .
SO THE PRICE OF A GOOD SET OF UH CARBIDE STEEL UH BITS IS PROBABLY UH I MEAN A A GOOD SET OF BITS IS PROBABLY GOING TO RUN YOU .
A HUNDRED DOLLARS AND UH UH IF YOU RE GOING TO USE FOR A LIFETIME .
I SUPPOSE IT S WORTH IT .
BECAUSE Y E UH I IMAGINE IF I GO AND SHARPEN THEM .
MYSELF UH THEY WO NT LAST .
AND I VE NEVER HAD THE BITS SHARPENED .
SO .
UHHUH .
THAT S A THING TO CONSIDER IS TO .
THEY THEY REALLY GET HOT DO NT THEY .
YEAH .
AND THEY THEY DULL AFTER AWHILE .
ESPECIALLY I DID SOME CABINETS IN UH ASH AND OAK .
UHHUH .
AND UH THAT THAT WEARS A BIT DOWN .
WE REMODELED AND SAVED A BUNCH OF REALLY NICE ASH CABINETS UH .
UHHUH .
WHICH HAD BEEN IN THE ORIGINAL .
REMODELING OF OUR KITCHEN .
RIGHT .
AND I SAVED THEM AND BUILT AN OVEN CABINET OUT OF ONE AND ANOTHER CABINET OUT OF ANOTHER BY USING THE FACES AND SO FORTH .
AND UH .
ROUTING HARDWOOD WILL UH TAKE THE EDGE OFF A CHEAP BIT PRETTY FAST .
SO .
YEAH .
I VE CUT SOME ONE BY EIGHT OAK BEFORE .
BOY WAS THAT FUN .
RIGHT .
THAT S UH .
BIG SOLID PIECES OF OAK ARE JUST .
AND THEN YOU TAKE THE BLADE TO THE .
TOUGH .
TO GET SHARPENED RIGHT .
WELL THAT WAS YOU KNOW WITH A WITH A CIRCULAR SAW .
UHHUH .
LIKE OH MY GOSH .
RIGHT .
IS THIS GOING TO BE FUN .
YEAH .
WELL I VE USED MINE ON TREATED WOOD AND NOW ALL MY BLADES NEED SHARPENING .
YEAH .
BECAUSE UH TREATED WOOD WILL ALSO CHEW THEM UP .
TREATED WOOD CAN REALLY MAKE YOU SICK TOO .
OKAY ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN WHERE DO YOU STAND AND WHY .
WELL I GUESS I STAND ON UH ON PROBABLY TEN FOR NO UH RESTRICTIONS I UH RECENTLY JUST MOVED TO TEXAS FROM UH SOUTH DAKOTA AND NEBRASKA AND I GUESS IN TERMS OF GUN CONTROL I VE ALWAYS UH BEEN RAISED WITH THE UH IDEA IN THE CONSTITUTION THAT UH CITIZENS HAD A RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS AND I REALIZE THAT PROBABLY WAY BACK WHEN WHEN THE CONSTITUTION WAS WRITTEN IT PROBABLY REGARDED UH MORE UH OF A NATIONAL DEFENSE UH THAN ANYTHING ELSE BUT UH ON THE OTHER HAND TOO UH PEOPLE THEN UH NEEDED TO USE FIREARMS FOR UM SURVIVAL IN TERMS OF UH FOOD .
YES TRUE .
AND UH I WAS RAISED UH YOU KNOW HUNTING ALL THE TIME I LIVED ON THE FARM AND UH YOU KNOW ENJOY HUNTING AND I GUESS I HAVE UH SOME PROBLEMS WITH UH BEING RESTRICTED TO UM OWNING A GUN FOR YOU KNOW HUNTING PURPOSES MAINLY .
RIGHT .
AND UM IT SCARES ME A LITTLE BIT TO THINK THAT THEY WOULD BEGIN RESTRICTING GUN CONTROL TO THE POINT WHERE UM EVENTUALLY WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT RIGHT ANY MORE .
YEAH I CAN I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT I WAS RAISED IN OKLAHOMA AND OF COURSE BEING OKLAHOMAN AND TEXAN UH YEAH THE HUNTING AND EVERYTHING AND I USED TO MUMBLEX THINGS IN MY FATHER AND MY HUSBAND HAVING GUNS AND ALL AND I I DID USED TO BE ALL IN FAVOR OF IT BUT IT S ALL OF A SUDDEN IT S STARTING TO GET REALLY SCARY WITH THESE GANGS YET I THINK I WOULD VOTE A ONE IF I THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE NATION WIDE AND THEY CAN GUARANTEE NO ONE WOULD HAVE A GUN NO CROOKS NOTHING BUT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN THEN I HAVE TO PROBABLY RIGHT UP THERE ABOUT AN EIGHT .
YEAH IT UH MOVING TO THIS AREA OF COURSE IT HAPPENS EVERYWHERE BUT UH I GUESS WE RE PRETTY NAIVE COMING FROM SMALL TOWNS UH IN THE MIDWEST AND THEN UH MOVING TO A LARGER CITY WHERE THERE ARE DRIVEBY SHOOTINGS AND UH THERE SEEMS LIKE KILLING FOR NO REASON AT ALL AND UH .
WELL IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IN THE PAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS IT HAS JUST GOTTEN SO MUCH WORSE THAN IT WAS THERE S ALWAYS BEEN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CRIME IN YOUR YOU KNOW YOUR URBAN AREAS AND I KNOW WE LIVED IN CHICAGO FOR SEVEN YEARS AND OF COURSE IT WAS DEFINITELY THERE SO WHEN WE FIRST MOVED HERE IT WAS NT AS BAD AS THIS IT S YOU KNOW IT S JUST GETTING ALL OF A SUDDEN SO MUCH WORSE I DO NT KNOW WHETHER IT S DUE TO THE DRUGS AND THE UH DRUG KINGS THAT ARE HERE AND JAMAICAN DRUG KINGS COMING IN I DO NT KNOW WHETHER THAT S IT OR STREET GANGS I DO NT KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS I KNOW THAT IT S SCARY AND YET I HATE THE GOVERNMENT CONSTANTLY TELLING ME WHAT I CAN DO AND WHAT I CA NT DO AND THAT S BASICALLY WHAT THE GUN CONTROL WOULD END UP BEING .
I I THINK SO AND AND THERE S ALWAYS THE UH THE UH THE OLD UH SAYING THAT KEEPS COMING UP THAT IF A PERSON WANTS A GUN BAD ENOUGH THEY LL THEY LL GET ONE AND UH AND THEN UH .
WELL IT S VERY TRUE .
YEAH .
IT S NOT THE LAW ABIDING CITIZEN THAT YOU KNOW IS IS DANGEROUS WITH THE GUN IT S THE ONES THAT ARE GOING OUT AND STEALING IT .
YEAH .
AND I SAID I THINK THE ONLY WAY I WOULD BE IN BIG FAVOR OF GUN CONTROL IS IF THEY COULD ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEE THAT NOBODY WOULD HAVE THEM AND I THINK THAT WOULD ALMOST HAVE TO GO WITH ARMIES TOO I MEAN THEY D HAVE TO BE ALMOST WORLDWIDE WHICH WE KNOW WOULD NEVER EVER HAPPEN .
YEAH YEAH THAT S FOR SURE .
BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU SAID OKAY YOU KNOW ARMED FORCES COULD HAVE THEM SOME IDIOT WOULD COME OUT AND SELL IT TO SOMEBODY ON THE STREET TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK .
YEAH AND UH AND YOU KNOW UH I SUPPOSE UH YEARS AGO WAY BACK WHEN UH WHEN UH THEY HAD THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR AND PEOPLE DECIDED THAT THEY UH WERE FED UP WITH THE GOVERNMENT UH AND IF THEY DID NT HAVE A WAY TO UH TO FIGHT BACK THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN BIG TROUBLE .
THAT S VERY TRUE VERY TRUE WHO KNOWS WE MAYBE WANT TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT .
WELL THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING .
I KNOW IF SOMEBODY DOES NT DO SOMETHING .
UH WHAT ABOUT UH WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS THIS UH LAW THAT THEY RE PUTTING INTO EFFECT THAT YOU HAVE TO WAIT X NUMBER OF DAYS BEFORE YOU CAN UH CARRY THE GUN OR BUY YOU KNOW ACTUALLY PURCHASE THE GUN .
WELL YOU KNOW THEY INTRODUCED SOME GUN CONTROL BACK WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER I BELIEVE IN TERMS OF UH EVERY GUN YOU HA BOUGHT HAD TO BE LICENSED I BELIEVE .
YES .
AND UH YOU KNOW THAT DID NT BOTHER ME UH TOO MUCH AND SO I GUESS IT DEPENDS UM IF THERE ARE SOME STATISTICS THAT SHOW THAT UH THAT PEOPLE UH COMMIT CRIMES ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT .
OKAY .
ALL RIGHT .
CAPITAL PUNISHMENT .
OKAY WHAT S YOUR VIEWS ON IT .
UM FOR MYSELF I M PERSONALLY AGAINST IT BUT WE SEEM TO HAVE A DUALITY OF IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE MOST STATES IN THEORY HAVE IT BUT BUT BUT DO NOT USE IT .
CORRECT OKAY WELL I M FOR IT I THINK THERE ARE CERTAIN CRIMES THAT DEFINITELY UH CALL FOR IT I I FEEL LIKE THAT CHILD MOLESTATION AND MURDER I DO NT SEE ANY SENSE IN SOMEONE LIVING THAT DOES THINGS LIKE THAT I I DO NT FEEL LIKE THEY RE A BENEFIT TO SOCIETY IN ANY WAY AND OF COURSE TEXAS HAS IT BUT THEY VERY SELDOM YOU KNOW PUT IT INTO EFFECT SO INSTEAD ALL OF OUR PRISONS ARE FULL OF PEOPLE ON YOU KNOW .
OKAY WELL .
A LOT OF PEOPLE ON DEATH ROW .
UH TEXAS USES IT AS ABOUT AS MUCH AS ANY OTHER STATE .
WELL UH YEAH .
TEXAS IS A BIG STATE .
WHICH IS NOT VERY OFTEN RIGHT .
UM HERE IN MARYLAND TO THE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT LAW PEOPLE ARE SOMETIMES SENTENCED TO CAPITAL PUNISHMENT BUT NO ONE NO ONE HAS ACTUALLY HAS THE SENTENCE CARRIED OUT UH I D CERTAINLY .
WHAT DO THEY DO JUST KEEP THEM ON DEATH ROW .
UHHUH I THINK SO .
FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIFE UHHUH .
I UH MUMBLEX OR AFFAIR NUMBER .
UHHUH .
UH IN FACT I THINK THAT IT IT AFFECTED THE SENTENCE THOUGH CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS AVAILABLE THE SENTENCE OF LIFE WITHOUT POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE UH HAS BECOME A COMMON ONE AND IS BEING BEING USED MUCH MORE .
DO YOU HAVE THE OVERCROWDING IN YOUR PRISONS THAT WE ARE FACING DOWN HERE .
UH I DO NT KNOW THE EXACT NUMBERS BUT BUT YES PRISONS ARE OVERCROWDED .
I KNOW THAT WE HAVE YOU KNOW REALLY IN FACT THEY RE THEY RE RELEASING PEOPLE UH THAT ARE IN THERE FOR YOU KNOW NOT MAJOR CRIMES BUT UH ROBBERIES AND ASSAULT AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND BECAUSE THEY DO NT HAVE ROOM WHICH THEN THEY RE COMING BACK ON THE STREETS AND OF COURSE DOING IT AGAIN AND UM YOU KNOW SO WE RE HAVING PROBLEMS IN IN THAT WAY AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME CASES THAT UH YOU KNOW CAPITAL PUNISHMENT DOES NOT FIT THE CRIME AND THERE ARE EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES ON CERTAIN TYPES UM BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT I M HONESTLY FOR IT .
UM .
UH ALMOST THAT EYE FOR AN EYE AND A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH .
OKAY YOU RE YOU RE CERTAINLY IN THE MAJORITY .
UH AT LEAST IN THIS COUNTRY .
YES .
UH WE ARE I GUESS THE ONLY ONE OF THE MAJOR WESTERN NATIONS CURRENTLY WITH CAPITAL PUNISHMENT .
I KNOW THEY USE IT VERY UM THEY DO NOT HAVE IT IN EUROPE AS I UNDERSTAND .
NO AT LEAST NOT IN WESTERN EUROPE PROBABLY NOT IN EASTERN EUROPE THESE DAYS EITHER UM THERE ARE MANY REASONS FOR IT BUT THEY THEY CERTAINLY HAVE LOWER CRIME RATES AND LOWER MURDER RATES .
YES YOU WONDER WHAT THEIR YOU KNOW HOW THEY MANAGE TO DO THAT .
WELL IN PART IT S UH IT S THE NATURE OF SOCIETIES PERHAPS MORE HOMOGENOUS SOCIETY IN MANY CASES UH ARGUABLY IF ARGUABLY IS BECAUSE OF OF UH OF UH WELFARE STATE BENEFITS THOUGH I TEND TO BE WE TEND TO BE SKEPTICAL .
WELL ENGLAND HAS UH DO NT THEY HAVE A LARGE FAIRLY LARGE WELFARE .
YES OH THERE S NO QUESTION THAT THAT THEY THAT UH YOU KNOW THEY HAVE YOU KNOW ALL KINDS OF CRADLE TO GRAVE UH PROGRAMS WELFARE PROGRAMS PROVIDING FOR EVERYONE SOME WAY I I I HOWEVER THE QUESTION IS IS THAT MAKING THE DIFFERENCE .
OH I I DO NT KNOW BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF WELFARE PROGRAMS AND .
OH .
IF BOTH DO AND THEY TEND TO HAVE LESS CRIME YOU WONDER IF THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT THEN YOU KNOW OR IS IT IN OUR SOCIETY PEOPLE ARE BROUGHT UP OVER HERE THINKING THAT YOU KNOW EVERYBODY OWES THEM SOMETHING .
UM I THINK I THINK THAT IDEA IS EVEN EVEN MORE COMMON IN WESTERN EUROPE .
OH DO YOU .
UHHUH .
WELL THAT S INTERESTING I WOULD NOT HAVE I WOULD NOT HAVE SAID THAT I WOULD HAVE SAID THAT IT WAS MORE PREVALENT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES THAT S AN INTERESTING THEORY I M NOT THAT FAMILIAR YOU KNOW I VE ONLY BEEN OVER THERE A COUPLE OF TIMES AND I M NOT THAT FAMILIAR .
ME TOO .
WITH THAT ALL I KNOW IS THAT FOR INSTANCE WE WERE IN GERMANY IN UH .
MUMBLEX NOT BE A VERY GOOD CONVERSATIONALIST ON FISHING .
I DO NT DO A LOT OF IT .
WELL I DO LOVE TO FISH .
WELL GOOD MAYBE I CAN LEARN SOMETHING .
WELL I DO NT KNOW HOW MUCH YOU CAN LEARN .
I M NOT SO SURE I M GOOD AT IT BUT I DO ENJOY DOING IT .
DO YOU .
YEAH .
WELL IT IS FUN WHAT LITTLE I DO .
OF COURSE I DO NT YOU KNOW I THINK WHEN THEY REFER TO DIFFERENT KINDS OF FISHING I TOLD MY HUSBAND LAST NIGHT WHEN I HAD CALLED AND THEY HAD TOLD ME THAT THIS WAS A TOPIC I SAID WELL I CAN TELL THEM HOW TO FISH WITH A MINNOW OR HOW TO FISH WITH A WORM .
HE SAID I DO NT THINK THAT S THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF FISHING THEY RE TALKING ABOUT .
WELL I HOPE IT IS .
THERE S NOT A WHOLE LOT OF DIFFERENT KINDS .
THAT S ABOUT THE ONLY KIND .
I KNOW HOW TO DO .
I DO NT DO A LOT OF DEEP SEA FISHING I BECAUSE I GET SEASICK BUT .
UHHUH .
WE HAVE A LOT OF LAKES HERE IN THIS AREA .
UHHUH .
AND I DO A LOT OF FISHING FOR UH BASS .
WE HAVE A LOT OF UH UH COUPLE OF LAKES IN OUR AREA .
THAT ARE FIL JUST FILLED WITH GOOD SIZED BASS .
UHHUH .
AND THEN WHEN I GET TIRED OF THEM OUTWITTING ME I FISH FOR CATFISH .
UHHUH .
AND WE USE WORMS AND SHINERS WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH LIKE MINNOWS .
UHHUH .
A LITTLE BIT BIGGER THAN MINNOWS AND THEN I ALSO USE SPINNER BAITS AND PLASTIC WORMS .
UHHUH .
IT .
ALL DEPENDS ON WHAT .
I M FISHING FOR AND THE TIME OF DAY .
WELL IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU DO QUITE A BIT OF IT .
I DO .
UH THERE S A LAKE LIKE MAYBE TWO OR THREE MILES FROM HERE AND .
UHHUH .
IT S VERY CONVENIENT ON AFTERNOONS WHEN I WANT TO JUST GET AWAY AND SIT AND THINK .
FISHING S A GOOD WAY TO DO THAT AND I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS .
WHO LIKE TO GO FISHING .
DO YOU HAVE A BOAT .
NO I DO NT .
I HAVE A FRIEND .
WHO HAS A LITTLE INFLA INFLATABLE RAFT AND WE .
UHHUH .
USE THAT SOMETIMES .
UHHUH .
I WISH I HAD A BOAT BUT I DO NT .
I THINK THE LAKES ARE PROBABLY DIFFERENT IN MICHIGAN THAN THEY ARE IN TEXAS .
THE ONES AROUND HERE ARE SO BIG THAT YOU CAN FISH OFF THE DOCK .
UHHUH .
BUT UNLESS YOU HAVE A BOAT .
YOU CA NT REALLY GET INTO THE WHERE THEY CALL THE GOOD FISHING HOLES YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
THAT S THE SAME WAY HERE IS NT IT .
IS IT .
YOU HAVE TO GET BACK IN THE STICKS IN THE .
UHHUH .
MY INLAWS LIVE ON A LAKE UH A LITTLE BIT EAST OF DALLAS KIND OF IN THE PINEY WOODS AND THE LAKE IS BEAUTIFUL AND I LIKE TO GO OUT AND STAND AT THE END OF THE DOCK AND FISH BUT ACTUALLY CATCHING FISH TO EAT PER SE YOU DO NT REALLY DO MUCH OF THAT RIGHT THERE .
I CATCH A LOT OF LITTLE OLD UH I THINK THEY CALL THEM PERCH .
RIGHT .
AND THEN THE THE UH TURTLES TRY TO EAT UP ALL MY BAIT .
OH .
SO IT S IT S SO CLOSE TO THE DOCK THAT I THINK ALL .
I DO IS FEED THEM .
A LITTLE BIT .
WE DO NT HAVE .
BUT IT S KIND OF FUN .
WE DO NT HAVE A BIG PROBLEM WITH TURTLES BUT WE DO HAVE A AWFUL LOT OF SNAKES IN OUR LAKES .
UM .
AND I .
I WOULD BE AFRAID OF THAT .
WELL I CA NT THINK OF A TIME THAT I VE BEEN FISHING THAT I HAVE NT RUN INTO ONE OR TWO OF THEM .
DO THEY EVER GET ON YOUR HOOK .
NO WE UH OCCASIONALLY I LL CATCH AN EEL .
UHHUH .
ON A ON A HOOK BUT NEVER THE SNAKES .
THEY JUST KIND OF .
ARE THEY .
POISONOUS SNAKES .
UH WE HAVE A LOT OF COTTON MOUTH SO YES THEY ARE DEFINITELY .
UHHUH .
AND THEY LIVE IN LITTLE SHALLOW LITTLE COVES THAT I LIKE TO FISH IN SO I SEEM THEM SWIMMING BY EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE .
YEAH I THINK I D BE A LITTLE BIT AFRAID OF THOSE .
YEAH THEY CAN THEY RE THEY RE CERTAINLY UGLY .
UHHUH .
WE UH SAW A LARGE SNAKE RIGHT OFF THE DOCK THERE AT MY INLAWS PLACE LAST YEAR .
IT WAS PROBABLY FOUR INCHES IN DIAMETER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW .
GREAT BIG SNAKE AND IT OF COURSE IT SCARED THE WOMEN TO DEATH YOU KNOW BUT THE MEN COME OUT AND SAID OH WELL THAT S ONLY A A KING SNAKE IT WO NT REALLY HURT YOU YOU KNOW .

DEFINITELY .
BUT THEY RE SCARY LOOKING .
DO YOU HAVE BASS .

RIGHT .
WELL THAT S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME WAY HERE .
UHHUH .
I .
NOW THEY HAVE A LOT OF BASS TOURNAMENTS .
WELL WE HAVE THOSE .
I DO NT .
UHHUH .
I INEVITABLY IF I ENTER ONE OF THOSE I NEVER CATCH A THING .
OH NO .
I JUST GO OUT THERE AND SIT AND WATCH OTHER PEOPLE DO IT .
UHHUH .
WELL THAT S KIND OF WE VE NEVER ENTERED A TOURNAMENT OR ANYTHING .
WE RE NOT THAT BIG INTO FISHING BUT I SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE YOU KNOW EARLY IN THE MORNING .
THERE LL BE ALL THE BOATS GOING OUT AND THEY LL SAY WELL THERE S A BIG BASS TOURNAMENT .

THAT HAVE YOU KNOW REALLY I GUESS THAT YOU D CALL IT REALLY SPORT FISHING THEY RE REALLY INTO IT TO TRY TO WIN .
YEAH OH DEFINITELY .
MY .
CERTAINLY HERE THEY ARE .
BUT IT IS IT S VERY A VERY .
RELAXING SPORT TO BE ABLE TO JUST BE OUT ON THE WATER AND LOOKING AROUND .
THE PEACE AND CALMNESS IS REALLY RELAXING .
YEAH IT S A GOOD THING TO TAKE A NICE BOOK AND SIT BACK AND READ AND FISH .
UHHUH .
THAT S WHAT .
I DO A LOT .
I VE NEVER TRIED TAKING A BOOK WITH ME .

HELLO .

HI BOY IT TOOK FOREVER TO FIND SOMEBODY .
OH WELL I M GLAD YOU FOUND ME .
GOOD WELL I M MY NAME S GAIL AND I GUESS WE HAVE TO .
TALK ABOUT CREDIT CARDS .
YES MY NAME IS CAROLYN .
OKAY WELL IF YOU RE READY THEN UH .
OKAY I LL JUST LET YOU START .
OKAY I LL PRESS ONE OKAY WELL I M NOT THIS IS KIND OF AN INTERESTING SUBJECT TO COME UP FOR ME BECAUSE CREDIT CARDS ARE MY DOWNFALL I JUST FIND IT SO EASY TO TO CHARGE SOMETHING WHEN I DO NT HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY FOR IT AND I M REALLY TRYING TO GET OUT OF THAT HABIT SO I THINK THEY RE KIND OF DANGEROUS .
I THINK THEY ARE TOO AND UNFORTUNATELY UM WE USE OURS IN WE DO NT USE THEM ALL THE TIME BUT WE USE THEM LIKE AT CHRISTMAS TIME AND THEN IT SEEMS LIKE IT TAKES ALL YEAR TO PAY THEM OFF WHEN YOU USE THEM LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
BUT UM I WOULD LOVE TO JUST TAKE SOME SCISSORS AND CUT THEM IN HALF .
YEAH ME TOO .
I THINK SOMETIMES WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE INTEREST THAT YOU RE PAYING ON THEM UM THAT S WHAT GETS TO BE THE REALLY SCARY PART YOU KNOW IF YOU THINK WHEN IT COMES AROUND TO INCOME TAX TIME AND YOU LOOK AT HOW MUCH MONEY YOU PAID OUT JUST IN INTEREST ALL YEAR YOU COULD REALLY GET A LOT MORE STUFF .
UHHUH .
IF YOU WERE JUST ABLE TO PAY OUTRIGHT FOR IT .
YEAH THAT S TRUE THAT S TRUE SEEMS JUST LIKE OUR SOCIETY IS SO UM PUSHES SO HARD FOR YOU CAN HAVE IT YOU KNOW AND THEN NO INTEREST NO PAYMENTS FOR A YEAR AND STUFF LIKE THIS THEY RE REALLY TRYING TO GET YOU INTO THAT SITUATION BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY VE REALLY GOT YOU .
THAT S RIGHT .
THEN SO .
YEAH ALL I KNOW IS SOME OF MY CREDIT CARDS LIKE UM WE HAVE A SEARS ONE AND WE ALWAYS GET A MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT EVERY YEAR .
UHHUH .
AND IT S JUST EASIER TO SAY YOU KNOW JUST PUT THAT ON MY CREDIT CARD WELL THAT S PROBABLY FOUR OR FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS YOU KNOW THAT GOES ON AT THAT POINT .
UHHUH .
AND THEN IT SEEMS LIKE TAKES FOREVER TO PAY THAT OFF .
IT S FUNNY THAT WE VE GOT A SEARS CARD AND WE BOUGHT A WASHER AND DRYER ON IT FOUR YEARS AGO AND WE STILL OWE I MEAN I I THINK LIKE HALF THE AMOUNT THAT THEY COST IN THE FIRST PLACE .
WOW .
IT S JUST UH YOU KNOW YOU NEVER NEVER GET IT OUT AND NOW THAT S REAL IRRITATING .
IT SURE IS WE EVENTUALLY DID ONE TIME WE JUST BORROWED TOOK A PERSONAL LOAN AND PAID OFF ALL OUR CREDIT CARDS AND THE INTEREST ON THE LOAN WAS CHEAPER .
UHHUH .
THAN IT WAS YOU KNOW TO JUST HAVE THAT WE HAVE NT DONE IT LATELY WE PROBABLY NEED TO DO IT AGAIN .
WELL WE DID YOU KNOW ONE TIME WE WANTED TO BUY A TRUCK A USED TRUCK AND SO WE WENT DOWN TO THE BANK AND THEY SAID SURE WE LL GIVE YOU A PERSONAL LOAN IT WAS ONLY A THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT WE NEEDED .
UHHUH .
FOR THE TRUCK AND THEY SAID SURE THAT S NO PROBLEM BUT YOU KNOW WHY DO NT WE CONSOLIDATE YOUR BILLS AND AT THE TIME WE THOUGHT OH THAT WOULD BE GREAT YOU KNOW WE COULD AND IT S GOING TO BE A LOWER PAYMENT THAN IT WAS FOR ALL OF THEM YOU ONLY HAVE TO WRITE ONE CHECK A MONTH NOT ALL THOSE YOU NEVER MISS ONE OR WHATEVER .
UHHUH .
AND WE DID THAT BUT WE DID NT REALIZE AT THE TIME UNTIL SEVERAL MONTHS LATER THAT WE WE WERE REAL I MEAN THIS WAS FOUR YEA THREE YEARS AGO WE WERE PRETTY YOUNG AND WE WERE JUST KIND OF LIKE WELL I GUESS THAT MEANS THESE CREDIT CARDS ARE CLOSED AND WE DID NT YOU KNOW ABOUT SIX MONTHS LATER WE REALIZED WE COULD USE THEM AND SO WE CHARGED THEM ALL UP AGAIN .
OH NO .
YEAH .
SO THEN WE WERE NOT ONLY PAYING THOSE BILLS REGULAR LIKE WE WERE BEFORE BUT ALSO ADDING THE LOWER PAYMENT FOR ALL OF THEM SO WE WERE PAYING LIKE TWICE UM SO WE DID NT EVER MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN LUCKILY BUT UH WE RE DEFINITELY WORKING ON NOT DOING THAT CREDIT THING WE JUST AS A MATTER OF FACT THIS IT S REAL INTERESTING THE SUBJECTS I GET THEY ALWAYS SEEM TO BE SO PERTINENT BUT WE JUST DISCUSSED THIS LAST NIGHT AT CHURCH TALKING ABOUT DEBT AND THINGS LIKE THAT IT S SO SO ALLURING AND .
UHHUH .
UH SO EASY TO GET UH SOMETIMES .
I KNOW THEY REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU NOT TO GO INTO DEBT FOR ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR MAYBE YOUR HOUSE AND .
UHHUH .
YOUR CAR .
YEAH YEAH .
AND UH IF YOU COULD STICK TO THAT YOU KNOW WE D GET RID OF A LOT OF INDIGESTION AND .
YEAH .
EVERYTHING ELSE .
THAT S TRUE OH I JUST PICKED UP MY DAUGHTER AND SHE WAS EATING A CUPCAKE AND NOW HER CRUMBS ALL OVER .
OH DEAR .
YEAH WHAT A MESS YOU ARE OH SO I DO NT KNOW IF I IF I I JUST FEEL KIND OF MY BIG THING WAS MY HUSBAND REALLY WANTED TO GET RID OF OUR VISA CARD AND I JUST THOUGHT YOU KNOW IF WE EVER HAD SOMETHING GO WRONG WITH OUR REFRIGERATOR OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
AND WE HAD TO HAD TO BUY ONE THEN WE WOULD REALLY NEED THAT AND SO HE SAID OKAY WE LL KEEP IT AND THEN WE WERE NT SMART ENOUGH TO NOT USE IT SO .
YOU KNOW ONE THING YOU MIGHT DO WITH IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT THOUGH IT S JUST LIKE KEEP .
OKAY .
YOUR FAMILY HAVE REUNIONS ON A REGULAR BASIS .
PROBABLY ONCE EVERY FIVE YEARS .
ONCE EVERY FIVE YEARS .

SHE WAS LIKE THE GLUE SO .

WHERE IS HOME FOR YOU .
ORIGINALLY UH I UH WAS BORN IN MISSOURI .

BUT IT IS HARDER FOR EVERYONE TO GET IN GET HOME .
YEAH .
WELL MAYBE THIS YEAR .
YOU CAN FIND A MORE CENTRAL LOCATION .
WELL BUT THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE IN LIKE JUST LIKE HOW YOU SAID IN CLOSE CLOSE QUARTERS .
SO IT IS EASIER FOR US FEW STRAGGLERS TO GO HOME .
OH OKAY .
THEN THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE STILL IN THE MISSOURI AREA .
YEAH .
OKAY .
YOU KNOW OUR FAMILY RIGHT NOW UH THE MOST OF IT THERE IS ONLY A FEW STRAGGLERS UH WITH ANY DISTANCE .

AND YOU KNOW THIS IS THE STANDARD PATTERN .
IT UH EVERYBODY BRINGS THEIR FAVORITE DISH AND SOMEBODY BRINGS THE VOLLEYBALL NET SOMEBODY BRINGS A WHOLE LOT OF ICE FOR THE WATERMELON AND .
WELL UH UH I GUESS PROBABLY THE LAST ONE .
I WENT TO I MET SO MANY PEOPLE THAT I HAD NOT SEEN IN PROBABLY TEN OVER TEN YEARS .
IT WAS LIKE DO NT YOU REMEMBER ME .
AND I AM LIKE NO .
AM .
I RELATED TO YOU .
YEAH .
I KNOW .
YEAH I MARRIED YOUR COUSIN S BROTHER S UNCLE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
DO YOU I MEAN IS THAT SINCE I MEAN DO YOU HAVE THEM .
EVERY YEAR .
UH YEAH EVERY YEAR .
MUMBLEX .
AND UH STILL YOU WIND UP MEETING PEOPLE YOU UH YOU NEVER KNEW YOU WERE RELATED TO .
LET ALONE .
YEAH .
AND .
WELL I THINK THAT IS PROBABLY WHY OUR IS PROBABLY SO INTERESTING IS CAUSE .
WE DO NT HAVE THEM THAT OFTEN .
OH YEAH .
AND THEN WHEN WE DO AND EVERYONE FINALLY DOES GET TOGETHER IT IS LIKE AFTER THE YOU KNOW .
WELL WELL PAT DID YOU VOTE IN THE LAST ELECTION .
MOST ASSUREDLY .
OH YOU DID .
YES MAAM I VE VOTED IN EVERY MAJOR ELECTION SINCE I TURNED TWENTYONE .
OH THAT S GREAT WELL WHY DO YOU THINK .
DO NT ALWAYS .
PEOPLE DO NT .
VOTE FOR SOMEBODY I SOMETIMES VOTE AGAINST SOMEBODY .
THAT MAKES SENSE TOO .
I THINK THAT A LOT OF IT IS UH I KNOW THAT MY LATE HUSBAND WAS SIMPLY INDIFFERENT HE DID NT FEEL LIKE HE HAD ANY SAY THERE WAS TOO MANY PEOPLE TOO MANY OTHER VOTES FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW HE D SAY WELL LOOK YOU AND I SEE DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE FENCE IF I GO VOTE YOU LL CANCEL MY VOTE .
I SAID I SURE WILL .
AND .
HE SAID SO I JUST WO NT VOTE I SAID THEN MINE COUNTS .
THEN DOES .
BECAUSE YOU COULD CANCEL MINE TOO .
YEAH I THINK I THINK THAT S A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST INDIFFERENT I KNOW THAT .
UHHUH .
I VE MOVED AROUND A LOT IN THE PAST UM THREE YEARS I VE HAD THREE DIFFERENT ADDRESSES .
UHHUH .
EACH TIME I CHANGE JURISDICTIONS OR WHATEVER .
SURE .
SO I JUST HAVE NT BECAUSE I MEAN GRADUATE SCHOOL OR WHATEVER SO I HAVE NT KEPT TRACK OF IT I DID WHEN I LIVED STEADILY IN ONE COMMUNITY I ALWAYS I VOTED .
UHHUH .
BUT THIS PAST TIME I DID NT WELL ACTUALLY I VOTED IT FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION BUT THEN I DID NT VOTE .
UHHUH .
UH I GUESS IN THE TWO YEAR FOR UH SOME LEGISLATORS AND THINGS AND .
WELL CHARACTERISTICALLY IN SOME IN THE LOCAL ELECTIONS .
UHHUH .
TYPICALLY THOSE PEOPLE WHO VOTE ARE THOSE WHO FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT AN ISSUE .
RIGHT UHHUH .
IF I DO NOT FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT AN ISSUE THEN I SEE NO REASON TO GO VOTE .
RIGHT YEAH AND THAT S PROBABLY ONE REASON WHY I VOTED IN THE .
UHHUH .
THE LAST ELECTION BUT NOT REALLY THIS ONE .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE THIS ONE REALLY DID NT MATTER THAT MUCH .
UHHUH .
YEAH IT S PROBABLY TRUE .
WELL OF COURSE OF COURSE LISTENING TO GOVERNMENT THE INSTRUCTORS YOU LL FIND OUT THAT EVERYTHING MATTERS .
BUT THEN YOU COULD GO CRAZY WORRYING ABOUT EVERYTHING .
WELL YOU KNOW THEY ALSO SAY THAT MOST PEOPLE VOTE THEIR LOCAL POLITICS THAT THAT LOCAL IS FAR MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN UH NATIONAL .
WELL .
ISSUES .
THAT S THE WAY YOU GET TO NATIONAL .
UHHUH .
AND THAT S THE WAY YOU MAKE CHANGES ABOUT .
RIGHT .
YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD .
OH I DEFINITELY THINK SO .
UH I KNOW THAT I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN PREPARING AND IN IN UH CARRYING OUT A LOT OF THE LOCAL PETITIONS THAT TAKE PLACE .
UHHUH .
EVEN SOMETHING SO SIMPLE AS GETTING A STREET LIGHT IN BETWEEN .
RIGHT .
LIGHTS ON THE END OF THE BLOCK .
UHHUH .
BUT IT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE WHEN IT S THE DIFFERENCE IN HAVING A CHILD RUN OVER .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
IN THE DARK .
YEAH .
AND UH IT TOOK A CLOSE CALL TO WAKE US UP AND CAUSE US TO TAKE .
UHHUH .
THAT KIND OF ACTION AND THAT S COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY IN ANOTHER PARTICULAR CASE THEY WERE TRYING TO PUT IN A UM SENIOR CITIZEN S HOME .
UHHUH .
IN IN AN AREA VERY NEAR OUR NEIGHBORHOOD BUT IF YOU JUST CROSS THAT MAJOR STREET THE CHARACTER OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD CHANGES AND IT S LESS SAVORY .
UHHUH .
OKAY AND THAT I WAS JUST VERY I FELT VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THAT THOSE PEOPLE SIMPLY DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO SAFETY TO SECURITY AND THEY WERE AT RISK .
UHHUH .
AND IT WAS FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE WHO LIVED ALONE AND THEY WERE GOING TO PUT A CLUSTER OF OF HOUSES THERE FOR THEM BUT EVEN CLUSTERING TOGETHER FOR THE ELDERLY DOES NOT ENSURE SAFETY .
NO MOST NOW THAT S TRUE .
AND ALL IT ALL IT DID WAS TO IN MY JUDGMENT MAKE THEM .
PREPARE THEM TO BE .
EASIER TARGETS .
VICTIMS YES .
UHHUH YEAH EASIER TARGETS AND SO WE WE DID GET A PETITION TOGETHER AND WE VERY STRONGLY RESISTED IT AND IT WAS PLACED IN A ACTUALLY IT WAS PLACED CLEAR CLOSER TO MY NEIGHBORHOOD .
UHHUH .
BUT IT WAS ON THE .
RIGHT SIDE .
RIGHT SIDE OF THE STREET .
OF THE TRACKS YEAH .
AND UH IT IT I THINK THAT THEY RE THEY RE MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE THERE .
UHHUH DID THEY .
UH I HAVE NT SEEN TOO MUCH CRIME IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD ALTHOUGH WE HAVE A GOOD CRIME WATCH PROGRAM .
UHHUH .
BUT IT S IT S VERY SERIOUS .
YEAH .
JUST ACROSS THE STREET .
DID UM DID YOU THINK I KNOW THAT TEXAS S LAST GUBERNATORIAL UH ELECTION PROBABLY BROUGHT OUT A LOT OF VOTERS .
WELL .
DID THAT DID THAT SEEM TO BECAUSE THAT RE THAT GOT NATIONAL ATTENTION NATIONAL ATTENTION I GUESS HAVING A WOMAN GOVERNOR .
WELL .
RUNNING AGAINST A MAN AND WHATEVER .
NO I DO NT THINK IT HAD TO DO TO WITH WOMAN RUNNING AGAINST MAN I THINK IT HAD TO DO WITH DIRT RUNNING AGAINST DIRTIER .
UHHUH .
AND THAT S IT .
YEAH .
IT WAS A DIRTY ELECTION PEOPLE WERE CALLING EACH OTHER UH NAMES AND EVERY BIT OF THE TRASH IT WAS A IT WAS A DIRTY CAMPAIGN IT WAS A DIRTY MUD SLINGING CAMPAIGN .
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT S FUNNY UP HERE UH I LIVE I SEE A LOT OF VIRGINIA NEWS .
UHHUH .
AND I GUESS UH SENATOR ROBB AND GOVERNOR WILDER .
UHHUH .
ARE ACTIVE RIGHT HERE AND THEY HAVE SOME TYPE OF WIRE TAPPING PROBLEM .
UHHUH .
GOING ON AND THE PEOPLE IN VIRGINIA ARE COMPLAINING SEE ROBB IS MARRIED TO LYNDA BIRD JOHNSON .
UHHUH .
AND THE PEOPLE IN VIRGINIA ARE COMPLAINING THAT HE IS HE S USING TEXAS POLITICS IN VIRGINIA .
UHHUH .
AND THEY RE REALLY COMPLAINING BIG TIME BECAUSE THEY SAID THAT WE DO NT HAVE THAT TYPE OF TRASHY POLITICS UP HERE LIKE THEY DO IN TEXAS ALL THE TIME .
WELL .
SO YOU YOU GUYS WERE GETTING .
OF COURSE NOW THAT S NOT ALL THE TIME WE VE HAD SOME PRETTY .
YEAH YOU WERE GETTING SLANDERED I THINK .
WE WERE HAVING SOME PRETTY HEALTHY .
UHHUH .
UH CAMPAIGNS THAT WERE BASED ON ISSUES THERE FOR TWO OR THREE OF THE GUBERNATORIAL RACES .
UHHUH .
BUT I HISTORICALLY TEXAS HAS HAD MUD AND MUDDIER CAMPAIGNS .
YEAH .
I MEAN IT S JUST I THINK THAT EVENTUALLY YOU KNOW THE BETTER PEOPLE HAVE SENSIBILITIES AND THEY VOTE ON THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE LEAST LIKELY TO DO DAMAGE UNFORTUNATELY THAT S NOT ALWAYS THE WAY IT SHOULD BE .
UHHUH .
YOU DO NT WANT TO VOTE FOR THE PERSON WHO IS LEAST LIKELY TO DO DAMAGE YOU WANT TO DO THE ONE WHO CAN DO THE MOST GOOD .
DO THE MOST GOOD YEAH THAT S TRUE .
AND UH .
I GUESS THAT S WHY I KNOW THAT UM I M PREVIOUSLY FROM PENNSYLVANIA .
UHHUH .
AND DICK THORNBURG WHO S NOW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL .
UHHUH .
IS GOING TO RUN FOR SENATOR .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE UH JOHN HEINZ A SENATOR FROM PENNSYLVANIA DIED IN AN AIRPLANE CRASH .
UHHUH .
AND I KNOW THAT THEY RE EXPECTING A GIGANTIC TURN OUT TO LANDSLIDE DICK THORNBURG INTO AS INTO THE SENATE .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE THEY DO NT LIKE THE GOVERNO THE GOVERNOR S POLITICAL APPOINTEE OR WHATEVER .
UHHUH .
AND THEY RE ALMOST EXPECTING LANDSLIDE .
UHHUH .
OUT UH TURN OUT RIGHT NOW .
OKAY SO YOU .
FOR FOR THAT ELECTION .
SO YOU SEE THAT S VERY NEGATIVE MOTIVATION .
UHHUH .
IS NT IT .
YEAH .
IS NT THAT TOO BAD WE REALLY COULD USE A LITTLE POSITIVE MOTIVATION .
UHHUH .
HEY WE THINK THIS GUY CAN REALLY MAKE SOME CHANGES AND WE RE GOING TO SUPPORT HIM .
YEAH .
THAT WAS TRUE IN A LOT OF CASES IN IN A COUPLE OF THE OLDER SIXTIES CAMPAIGNS .
UHHUH .
UH .
WHAT IN TEXAS WAS THAT WHEN YOU .
NO I M TALKING ABOUT NATIONAL CAMPAIGNS .
THAT S THAT S TRUE .
YEAH UH EVEN WHEN JOHN KENNEDY WAS ELECTED THERE WERE SO MANY STRIKES AGAINST HIM BUT THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVED HE COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE .
RIGHT .
NOW THAT S NOT TO SAY WHAT HAS TRANSPIRED OR WHAT REALLY WAS I M SAYING .
UHHUH .
THAT S HOW IT WAS PERCEIVED .
THAT S RIGHT THAT S PERCEPTION THAT S TRUE .
AND UH .
BECAUSE THE THOSE WERE BIG POLITICAL THAT WAS A BIG UM TURN OUT .
OH YEAH .
ELECTION .
ABSOLUTELY .
UHHUH .
AND AND IT WAS PEOPLE GOING TO VOTE FOR I THINK MORE THAN THOSE WHO VOTED AGAINST .
UHHUH .
I KNOW I KNOW THAT IN MY OWN UH AREA OF PEOPLE WHOM I KNEW AND HOW THEY WERE GOING TO VOTE THEY DID NT GO TO VOTE AGAINST UH A POLITICIAN AS THEY DID A LITTLE BIT LATER WHEN NIXON WAS RUNNING .
UHHUH .
THEY WENT TO VOTE AGAINST THE LESS OF LESSER OF THE TWO EVILS IN CERTAIN CASES .
YEAH .
BUT I THINK THAT ONE WAS ONE THAT .
UHHUH .
YOU HAD SOME VERY STRONG FEELINGS AMONG PEOPLE AND THEY VOTED THEIR CONVICTIONS .
UHHUH WELL I THINK THAT ALSO HAPPENED WITH RONALD REAGAN .
ABSOLUTELY .
HE WAS .
YOU RE RIGHT .
HE WAS LANDSLIDED IN AND PEOPLE REALLY SAW THAT WAS .
MY NAME S MARY DELL AND I LIVE IN THE DALLAS TEXAS AREA WHERE THERE S A LOT OF POLLUTION .
OKAY AND I M UP IN WISCONSIN .
OH .
UH MY NAME IS TERRY .
UHHUH .
AND UH IN THE SMALL TOWN WE DO NT BUT UH WE RE NOT THAT FAR FROM THE CITY WHERE THERE S TONS OF POLLUTION .
YES .
OKAY I LL GO AHEAD AND START RECORDING THAT .
OKAY .
OKAY UM JUST IN PARTICULAR HERE IN THE TWIN CITIES WE HAVE A LOT OF BIG CORPORATIONS AND UM .
OH .
I M SURE THERE S A LOT OF POLLUTION WE UH BEFORE MOVING TO WISCONSIN LIVED ACROSS FROM WHERE THEY WERE UM GRAVEL PITS .
UHHUH .
AND ALSO WHERE THEY WERE MAKING TAR AND SO WE WOULD OCCASIONALLY IF THE WIND WAS BLOWING THE RIGHT DIRECTION WOULD GET THE SMELL OF TAR AND .
OOH .
IT WOULD UH SMELL THE CONTINUOUS YOU KNEW THAT YOU WERE ALSO BREATHING THAT INTO YOUR LUNGS SO .
RIGHT .
AND IT WAS LIKE MILES AWAY BUT JUST THE IDEA OF HAVING THAT COME ACROSS THE WAY IT DID IN THE WIND .
UHHUH .
KIND OF MADE YOU KNOW THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF POLLUTION AND THAT WAS JUST ONE SMALL CORPORATION THAT WAS DOING THE POLLUTION OF THAT BUT .
UHHUH .
ALSO UM WHERE WE ALSO LIVED TOO IT WAS VERY CLOSE TO A HIGHWAY SO GOT A LOT OF FUMES FROM UH TRUCKS .
UHHUH .
AND CARS AND YOU WOULD LITERALLY SEE THE POLLUTION ON YOUR FURNITURE I MEAN IT WAS .
OH GOSH .
ON YOUR TABLES YOU WOULD DUST EVERY DAY AND IT WAS DIRTY UM TYPE OF DUST I MEAN IT WAS NT THE TYPICAL DUST THAT YOU GET WAY OUT IN THE COUNTRY .
UHHUH .
UM .
UHHUH .
FOR I LIVE IN A SMALL UM TOWN NOW QUITE A WAYS FROM THE TWIN CITIES ABOUT AN HOUR AWAY AND I MAY DUST ONCE A WEEK AND THAT S ALL IT NEEDS VERSUS EVERY DAY WHEN I LIVED IN THE CITY .
HUH .
SO .
I D NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT BEING A CAUSE I HAVE TO DUST A LOT AS WELL .
OH YEAH IT IT COMES RIGHT ON THROUGH .
YEAH .
THROUGH THE SCREENS THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY LIVE IN THE IN THE CITY IS TO CLOSE YOUR WINDOWS AND HAVE AN AIR CLEANER SYSTEM RIGHT IN YOUR HOME .
UHHUH .
THAT WOULD TAKE THE AIR FROM THE OUTSIDE AND CLEAN THE AIR BEFORE IT WOULD GET INTO THE HOUSE .
MY GOODNESS .
AND SO IT WAS QUITE A DIRTY CITY UM IF YOU WERE WELL PROTECTED BY TREES WHICH CATCH A LOT OF THE POLLUTION .
UHHUH .
THEN YOU RE FINE BUT MOST OF THE TIME IN THE CITY YOU HAVE LOTS OF HIGH RISES YOU HAVE LOTS OF OTHER THINGS THAT ARE NOT CATCHING THE POLLUTION AND IT S JUST GOING .
UHHUH .
FOR MILES AND MILES AND MILES AND IT S LANDING SOMEWHERE WITH THE WIND BUT .
THAT S KIND OF THE WAY DALLAS IS WE RE SO FLAT AND OPEN AND I LIVE IN A SUBURB THAT DOES NT HAVE MUCH VEGETATION TREES .
SURE .
IT WAS ALL COTTON FIELDS SO .
SURE .
WE DO NT HAVE THAT ADVANTAGE AND OURS I THINK IS PRIMARILY CARS WHERE WE DO NT CARPOOL LIKE WE SHOULD .
YEAH YEAH .
AN AIRPORT I WORK IN A BUILDING I M NINETEEN FLOORS UP .
UHHUH .
AND I LOOK OUT TOWARD D F W INTERNATIONAL AND THERE S JUST AN AWFUL BROWN HAZE ALL THE TIME .
UHHUH .
AND I CAN IMAGINE IT S EVEN WORSE FOR PEOPLE LIVING OVER NEAR THE AIRPORT .
OH SURE SURE YEAH IT S I MEAN OUR AIR QUALITY UM IN THE TWIN CITIES IS A LOT BETTER THAN WHAT WE VE HEARD ABOUT CALIFORNIA AND .
UHHUH .
MAYBE IN THE OTHER AREAS BUT UM THEY WERE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT THE AIR QUALITY OF TODAY IS THIS YOU KNOW THE OZONE OR WHATEVER AND IT S KIND OF SCARY BECAUSE THE AIR IS SOMETHING WE TAKE FOR GRANTED .
YES .
AND MANY PEOPLE ARE TOO BUSY GETTING TO WORK NOT THINKING ABOUT OKAY I COULD HAVE CARPOOLED WITH A FRIEND EVEN .
UHHUH .
MY HUSBAND WAS UH TALKING TO SOME OF THE GUYS AT WORK NOW HE S UH FIFTEEN MILES AWAY FROM WORK BUT HE WAS TALKING WOULD NT IT BE NICE TO CARPOOL AND THE GUY SAYS WELL IT S TOO CLOSE IT WOULD NT PAY .
UHHUH .
AND SO .
WANT TO MEET MY OWN SCHEDULE .
YEAH AND .
THOSE ARE THE ARGUMENTS WE HEAR .
EX EXACTLY AND SO MY HUSBAND SAYS WELL THAT S FINE YOU KNOW IT WOULD SAVE QUITE A BIT ON THE WEAR AND TEAR ON CARS .
UHHUH .
AND YOU KNOW THE GAS AND NO EVERYBODY HAS THEIR PREFERENCE TO DRIVE BY THEMSELVES OR IF THEY DO THEY THEY DRIVE WITH ONE LITTLE BUDDY UH AT LEAST IT S WITH ONE PERSON .
UHHUH .
BUT MOST OF THE TIME PEOPLE ARE SAYING FORGET IT I DO NT WANT TO CARPOOL IT S TOO MUCH OF A HASSLE IT S TOO MUCH INVOLVEMENT .
BUT WE RE .
BUT YET .
PAYING FOR IT .
YES WE ARE AND I THINK OF MY DAUGHTER AND I M SURE YOU THINK OF YOUR CHILDREN AND YOU KIND OF SAY TO YOURSELF WHAT KIND OF FUTURE WILL THEY HAVE WHEN THEY THINK BACK AND SAY WELL MY PARENTS DID HAVE THE CHOICE TO KIND OF MAKE A DIFFERENCE .
UHHUH .
AND MAYBE PEOPLE ARE TRYING BUT THEY HAVE TO CHANGE ATTITUDES .
AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT S ALREADY SO EVIDENT WITH OUR CHILDREN HAVING A LOT MORE RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS .
UHHUH .
THAN WE HAD GROWING UP .
SURE .
YOU CAN REALLY SEE IT I I HAD A CHANCE TO GO TO BOLIVIA A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND OF COURSE THERE S NO INDUSTRY VERY LITTLE TRASH THEY .
SURE .
THEY DO NT EVEN HAVE THAT MUCH THAT THEY BURN BECAUSE .
SURE .
THEY CONSUME EVERYTHING DOWN .
WELL THEY .
TO THE THREAD AND IT AMAZED ME I I JUST HAD TOTALLY FORGOTTEN HOW .
UH GO AHEAD TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK DO WE GET OUR MONEY S WORTH .
HEY LISTEN IF I HAD MY WAY I WOULD NT PAY MY TAXES NOT WITH THE NOT WITH SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I HEAR THAT OUR TAX MONEY IS GOING FOR SOME LUDICROUS THINGS .
YEAH DID YOU SEE SIXTY MINUTES LAST NIGHT .
NO I DID NOT I .
WELL THEY DID A THING ON THE THIRTYFIVE BILLION DOLLARS WE WASTE EVERY YEAR JUST ON STORING STUFF FOR THE MILITARY WE DO NT NEED AND UH IT S STAGGERING .
WELL HOW DOES THIS GRAB YOU HOW DID THIS GRAB YOU UH THIS I I MEAN I M I M A LADY BUT THIS I HEARD THIS ON A CHRISTIAN PROGRAM AND IT WAS UH ABOUT THE N E A AND THAT S THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR ARTS AND THEY FUND THEY FUNDED THIS THING THIS ACT ON A STAGE AND DID A STUDY ON IT BETWEEN TWO LESBIANS AND TWO HOMOSEXUALS AND WROTE A REPORT ABOUT THAT WITH OUR MONEY .
WELL THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT PEOPLE I THINK GENERAL .
AND THEN IT JUST FROSTS ME TERRIBLY .
WELL I THINK IT S INTERESTING TO LOOK AT UH WHERE THE MONEY GOES AND IT GOES A LOT OF PLACES WHERE IT PROBABLY OUGHT NOT GO AND .
ABSOLUTELY .
AND I DO NT THINK GENERALLY I THINK WHAT S INTERESTING IS THAT WE PROBABLY REPRESENT THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY IN TERMS OF THEIR FEELINGS ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT AND HOW IT SERVES US GIVEN THE EXTRAORDINARILY LARGE SUM OF MONEY THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO OPERATE WITH .
I BELIEVE THAT S TRUE YES .
AND THAT WHAT I THINK IS GOING TO BE REALLY INTERESTING IS WHAT WE DO ABOUT IT I MEAN WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE THE PEOPLE WHO REPRESENT US .
THAT S CORRECT .
I MEAN AND I THINK IT S GOING TO BE REAL INTERESTING TO SEE AND AND THEN FORCE UPON THEM UH .
HEAVY INVOLVEMENT FROM THE PUBLIC .
YEAH RIGHT THAT S .
UHHUH .
Y I THINK THAT S THE ONLY THING THAT S GOING TO CHANGE IT .
YEAH HEAVY INVOLVEMENT FROM THE PUBLIC .
OUR ANGER IS GOING TO HAVE TO TO GIVE .
YEAH .
RISE TO TO MORE ACTIVITY ON OUR PART UH I VE I VE SAID FOR YEARS THAT THERE S FULL EMPLOYMENT FOR THE POLITICALLY ACTIVE AND IN OUR SOCIETY UH THERE S VERY LITTLE FULL EMPLOYMENT MOST PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE GETTING WORSE OFF NOT BETTER OFF .
ABSOLUTELY .
EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE PUBLIC ACCORDING TO BILL MOYERS UH RECENT UH PIECE FOR UH PUBLIC BROADCASTING WHICH BY THE WAY IS A VERY GOOD USE OF GOVERNMENT MONEY I THINK P B S IS WONDERFUL BUT THIS SPECIAL FOCUSED ON THE FACT THAT EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE ARE SEEING THEIR REAL INCOMES AND THUS STANDARDS OF LIVING DECLINE AND TWENTY PERCENT ARE SEEING THEIRS IMPROVE THAT S NOT A FORMULA FOR A BETTER SOCIETY .
NO IT IS NOT IT S LOPSIDED VERY MUCH SO .
AND THE GOVERNMENT REALLY PLAYS A ROLE IN THIS .
UHHUH THAT S RIGHT THEY PULL THE STRINGS .
I MEAN W WELL THEY ARE THE PEOPLE WHOSE STRINGS ARE PULLED AND BY I GUESS POWERFUL INTERE .
RIGHT THE YEAH .
YOU KNOW AND IT S REALLY INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THAT AFFECTS PEOPLE BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY MORE AND MORE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE NOT LIKELY TO REVOLT IN THE WAY THAT PEOPLE USED TO THINK OF OF THE VOTER REVOLTING BUT PEOPLE ARE PRETTY MUCH GETTING THE PICTURE THAT SOME PEOPLE GET TAKEN CARE OF AND OTHERS DO NT AND THEY THINK IT S UNFAIR AND WHEN THEY RECOGNIZE THAT IT S THEIR TAX MONEY THEY RE GOING TO DO MORE ABOUT IT I TH I LL TELL YOU ONE QUICK UH ONE THING VERY INTERESTING C B S AFTER THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS IS GOING TO OPEN UP A TELEPHONE LINE AN EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER AND PEOPLE CAN CALL IN AND SAY WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT WHAT S GOING ON IN THIS COUNTRY .
UHHUH .
THEY EXPECT OPENING IT FOR ONE HOUR .
THAT THEY LL GET THREE .
HUNDRED THOUSAND TELEPHONE CALLS .
I M SURE THEY WILL .
AND I VE THOUGHT FOR YEARS IT WOULD MAKE A LOT OF SENSE TO P CREATE AN EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER FOR VOTERS TO CALL AND AND VENT THEIR FRUSTRATION WITH GOVERNMENT .
UHHUH .
LIKE ONE EIGHT HUNDRED CAPITOL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW Y JUST A NUMBER YOU COULD CALL FROM ANYWHERE ANYTIME I THINK THAT S COMING AND I THINK ONCE ONCE PEOPLE REALLY START TO COMMUNICATE HOW THEY FEEL THINGS ARE GOING TO CHANGE UNTIL THEN I THINK YOU KNOW IT S GOING TO BE REALLY PAINFUL SO THE QUESTION IS HOW SOON ARE WE GOING TO START TO GET OUR MONEY S WORTH AND AS YOU SAID IT S HOW SOON WE GET INVOLVED AND I THINK WE NEED TO CREATE MECHANISMS TO ALLOW US TO GET INVOLVED LIKE ALLOWING US TO CALL A TOLL FREE NUMBER AND SAY HEY LOOK DO IT THIS WAY NOT THAT WAY OR I LIKE THIS OR I DO NT LIKE THAT OR THIS IS HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOUR SPENDING MY MONEY ON ART THAT I DO NT THINK IS ART .
YES I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT HOPEFULLY THAT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE LISTENING TO WHAT OUR COMMENTS ARE TAKE SOME ACTION ON IT .
WELL THAT S THE GOOD THING ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING BECAUSE I THINK MORE AND MORE THE NEWS MEDIA WHICH TAKES A HECK OF A BEATING AND AND DESERVES SOME OF IT IS TELLING US YOU KNOW ABOUT THE PROBLEMS SO THE MORE WE COMMUNICATE HEY LOOK WE WANT A CHANGE HERE BECAUSE YOU KNOW AS IT TURNS OUT WE VE WASTED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY ON OUR DEFENSE SPENDING IN THIS COUNTRY .
OH ABSOLUTELY .
OVER A VERY LONG PERIOD OF TIME .
RIGHT ABSOLUTELY .
UH AND UH .
WE ONLY SEE THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG ONLY .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW THERE S SO MUCH .
YEAH .
OF IT GOING ON THAT IT WOULD REALLY YOU KNOW UH SET US INTO A DEEPER DEPRESSION IF WE KNEW THE WHOLE PICTURE .
WELL YOU MAY BE RIGHT WHAT I THINK IS REALLY GOING TO BE INTERESTING IS TO SEE HOW UH WE AS A SOCIETY DEAL WITH IT AND I AND I THINK IT IS WHAT YOU SAY IT S IT S A .
OKAY .
YES .
FIRST OFF .
SPEAKING OF AIR POLLUTION I M COUGHING MUMBLEX .
UM I M NOT SURE WHAT CONTRIBUTES TO AIR POLLUTION EXACTLY I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT A LOT OF THE HAIR SPRAYS AND THINGS THAT WE USE CAUSE THE AIR POLLUTION .
YEAH IT IT .
IT DOES NT SEEM LIKE BUT I GUESS WHEN YOU THINK OF IT EVERYBODY HAS SOME SORT OF AEROSOL IN THEIR HOME .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW AND IT S KIND OF DANGEROUS .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
UHHUH .
UH I DO NT KNOW WE LIVE UM WELL I M CLOSE TO SALT LAKE .
UHHUH .
AND THERE S MOUNTAINS UH YOU KNOW ALL AROUND BUT SOMETIMES I THINK TEND TO HOLD A LITTLE BIT OF IT IN YOU KNOW .
OH YEAH .
REALLY IT S IT S FAIRLY CLEAN UM I THINK IT S A FAIRLY CLEAN CITY COMPARED TO SOME BUT YOU KNOW HOW QUITE A .
BUT YOU THINK THE MOUNTAINS AND THE ARE KIND OF A BARRIER .
YEAH .
OH MUMBLEX .
I THINK SOMETIMES IT SEEMS TO BE BUT .
THAT S AN INTERESTING THOUGHT .
BUT UH ANYWAY I DO NT KNOW I KNOW THERE S A LOT OF PLANTS HERE WHEN I DRIVE DOWN .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW ALONG THE JUST ALONG THE FREEWAY THERE S A LOT OF PLANTS THAT THEY RE BURNING THINGS AND .
HERE IN TEXAS I KNOW A LOT OF THE PRETTY MUCH EVERY PLACE HERE IS RELATIVELY FLAT AND SO I WOULD THINK THAT THAT WOULD PROBABLY CONTRIBUTE TO US NOT HAVING THAT BIG OF A LIKE A SMOG PROBLEM OR .
OH UHHUH .
SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
YEAH WE WE HAVE A REAL FOG PROBLEM UM .
UM .
THE LAST FEW YEARS JUST IN THROUGH DECEMBER AND JANUARY IT IT REALLY IS FOGGY AND AND SEEMS TO JUST UM IT S KIND OF LIKE IT IT JUST STAYS FOR A MONTH .

UHHUH .
MUMBLEX AND DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT .
YEAH THAT S THAT S WHAT I SEE BURNING A LOT I M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT THEY RE BURNING I KNOW UHHUH THERE ARE SOME OIL COMPANIES AND I M SURE THAT THAT CONTRIBUTES A LOT .
UHHUH .
JUST THE BURNING OF THE CHE .

WELL I GUESS THERE ARE SOME PLACES UH IN THE NORTH IN PARTICULAR THAT UH HAVE A REAL DEFINITE WAY OF ENCOURAGING YOU TO RECYCLE BECAUSE THEY CHARGE YOU LET S SEE THEY CHARGE YOU FOR YOUR GARBAGE PICK UP BY THE WEIGHT .
UH UHHUH .
SO IF YOU RECYCLE THINGS OF COURSE THEN YOU DO NT HAVE ALL THAT WEIGHT IN THERE .

RIGHT .
BECAUSE .
THAT S RIGHT .
ALL THE BULKY THINGS ARE ARE .
YEAH .
BEING TOSSED IN .
YEAH .
WITH THE RECYCLING .
AND UH I DO NT KNOW WHAT .
THEY COULD DO MORE OF EXACTLY AROUND HERE RIGHT NOW OTHER THAN UH WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THEY DO NT RECYCLE .
OH ONE THING .
I THOUGHT ABOUT THE OTHER DAY WERE BATTERIES JUST EVERYDAY REGULAR BATTERIES .

THE LANDFILLS AND YET WHAT .
AM .
I GOING TO DO WHEN I HAVE A COUPLE DOUBLE A BATTERIES TO TOSS OUT .

PROBABLY GOING TO THROW THEM IN YOUR TRASH .
YEAH THAT S WHAT HAPPENS BECAUSE .
WELL THERE ARE PLACES .
THAT TAKE CAR BATTERIES BUT I WONDER IF THEY WOULD TAKE .
YEAH .
I MEAN NOT THAT IT WOULD KIND OF A PAIN TO YOU KNOW DRIVE OVER SOMEWHERE SPECIAL JUST FOR THAT FOR TWO LITTLE TINY BATTERIES BUT .
YEAH YEAH BUT I THINK THE CITY .
ONE COULD POSSIBLY LOOK INTO THAT OR SOMETHING .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
UH IF THEY VE GOT THESE BINS FOR ALL THE OTHER LITTLE ITEMS I M SURE IF P PEOPLE WILL HAVE BATTERIES UH YOU KNOW QUITE OFTEN .
RIGHT THAT S TRUE .
TO TO TOSS OUT .
UH WHEN I WAS HOME THOSE FEW DAYS AROUND THANKSGIVING AND THE UH THE TRUCK CAME BY WELL WE .
ALL RAN OUT TO WATCH IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE D NEVER REALLY SEEN IT .
UHHUH .
PICK UP OUR STUFF AND ONE THING .
I THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING WAS THAT THE DRIVER HAD SOMETHING ON HIS BELT THAT HE UH SCANNED ACROSS THE LITTLE BAR CODE .
OH .
ON OUR BIN .
OH IS THAT RIGHT .
AS SOON AS HE TOOK THE STUFF AND HE JUST PULLED THIS THING KIND OF OUT OF HIS POCKET AND JUST YOU KNOW SCANNED IT SO I DO NT KNOW WHY WHAT .
THAT WAS READING IT FOR .
HUH .
BUT UH .
REGISTERING OUR GARBAGE .
THEY MUST BE TRYING TO KEEP TRACK OF YOU KNOW WHO IS DOING IT OR WHAT I GUESS .
YEAH .
I DO NT KNOW .
ANOTHER .
WOULD NT IT BE NICE IF YOU COULD GET A CREDIT BACK AT THE END OF THE YEAR .
OOH FOR THOSE .
WHO ARE REALLY COOPERATING .
YEAH .
NOW THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE IT .
WELL EXCEPT I KNOW IT WOULD JUST NOT BE COST EFFECTIVE .
THEY VE ALREADY GOT ALL THIS MONEY OUT ON HIRING UH GETTING THE TRUCKS AND HIRING PEOPLE TO WORK THEM .
I M SURE THEY COULD NT AFFORD .
SURE .
THAT .
BUT .
SURE .
UH .
BUT THE GARBAGE UH NOW THERE IS JUST ONE GARBAGE MAN .
THAT COMES .
YEAH .
ON THE TRUCK INSTEAD OF TWO .
OH YEAH .
SO THAT S INTERESTING .
UH ALSO SLIGHTLY OFF THE SUBJECT BUT OUR OUR BIG GREEN GARBAGE THING GOT STOLEN .
OH IT DID .
UHHUH .
GOSH .
AND WE .
C WE CALLED THE CITY AND UH THEY THEY BROUGHT US .
A NEW ONE AND THEY DID NOT CHARGE US .
AND THEY SAID THAT BETWEEN THREE AND FOUR HUNDRED HAVE BEEN STOLEN .
OH MY GOODNESS .
IS NT THAT SAD .
IT IS SAD .
YOU KNOW .
AND JUST .
YOU KNOW THEY PAID FOR THOSE THINGS ANYWAY .
OH AND THEY MUST BE .
OR OUR TAXES DO .
YEAH REALLY EXPENSIVE .
I MEAN OF COURSE WE WERE HOPING WE WERE NT WE WERE NT GOING TO HAVE TO PAY FOR IT YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
BUT I MEAN WHAT WOULD SOMEBODY DO WITH THEM .
ALL RIGHT .
UM SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN THE PUBLIC EDUCATION AND WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT UH .
WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK .
WELL I THAT S FUNNY BECAUSE I JUST UM QUIT MY JOB TO STAY HOME WITH MY KIDS .
OH .
AND UM I WAS A TEACHER FOR SEVEN YEARS IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS SO I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT NOT .
A WHOLE GREAT DEAL .
WELL TELL ME ABOUT IT WHAT ARE .
WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS WITH PUBLIC EDUCATION .
WELL UM THERE THERE S SOME THERE S SEVERAL IT S SUCH A A BROAD YOU KNOW TOPIC THAT Y YOU NEED TO BOIL IT DOWN .
UHHUH .
BUT UM ONE THAT UM I THOUGHT WAS A PROBLEM THAT MUMBLEX I THOUGHT IT WAS A SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT I M NOT SURE IT S BEING TAKEN CARE OF RIGHT NOW UH WAS LIKE BILINGUAL EDUCATION .
UHHUH .
FOR UM DIFFERENT .
UM MINORITY GROUPS AND LIKE ASIANS AND UM UH MEXICAN AMERICANS AND AND JUST PEOPLE IN GENERAL THAT SPEAK OTHER LANGUAGES THAT SOMETIMES COME FROM OTHER COUNTRIES OR COMING FROM DIFFERENT AREAS AND THEY AND IN THIS AREA AND UM AS THE SCHOOL DISTRICT I M NOT SURE HOW TO GO ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT S HARD TO GET ONE TEACHER THAT SPEAKS ALL THESE LANGUAGES .
RIGHT .
AND SO MOST OF THESE CHILDREN ARE PUT IN UM EITHER SPECIAL ED OR A BILINGUAL PROGRAM AND THEN FOR JUST A SMALL AMOUNT OF TIME AND THEN THEY RE INTO THEIR REGULAR CLASSROOMS THE REMAINING OF THE PART OF THE DAY AND SO THE TEACHERS ARE NOT SURE HOW TO TEACH THEM MATH WHEN THEY DO NT READ OR SPEAK ENGLISH .
UHHUH .
AND SO UM A LOT OF THE MONEY IS NT PUT INTO THAT AND SO THESE CHILDREN ARE JUST KIND OF SAT IN THE CORNER AND UM YOU KNOW THERE S ONLY SO LONG YOU CAN DO THAT AND .
RIGHT .
TO ME THAT SEEMED LIKE A BIG PROBLEM IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND A LOT OF THE TEACHERS IT N IT WAS NOT THE TEACHER S FAULT A LOT OF THE TEACHERS WERE JUST NOT GETTING THE BACKBONE OR SUPPORT THAT THEY NEEDED OR THE MATERIALS OR THE EXTRA HELP THAT THEY NEEDED FOR THESE SPECIFIC CHILDREN MUMBLEX .
DO YOU FIND THAT THOSE PARENTS UM I VE SEEN THE SAME THING AND HEARD THE SAME THINGS AND AT THE SAME TIME I VE HEARD THAT IT S EVEN HARDER WHEN BOTH PARENTS ARE REQUIRED TO WORK AND CA NT SPEND YOU KNOW THAT THAT TIME YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
TYPICALLY THE MOTHER WAS AT HOME WITH UH THE CHILDREN AND .
YEAH .
AND AT LEAST COULD KIND OF KEEP UP ON WHAT S GOING ON AND REALLY SOCIETY SORT OF DICTATES THAT UH YOU KNOW BOTH THE PARENTS WORK .
YEAH .
AND UM I KNOW I VE HEARD SOME PEOPLE TALK ABOUT JUST THE FACT THAT EVEN AS FAR BACK AS THE YOU KNOW THE SECOND AND THIRD GRADE UH IF THE KIDS HAD YOU KNOW PROPER READING SKILLS OR LEARNED PROPER READING SKILLS THAT THAT WOULD MAKE A LOT OF DIFFERENCE .
OH YEAH OH DEFINITELY DEFINITELY AND IT AND IT TEACHES LANGUAGE TOO .
YEAH .
WHICH IS REALLY GOOD UM .
WELL I WORK AT A UNIVERSITY AND AND IT S REALLY TOUGH WHEN WE RE UH UH I I UH WORK AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT DALLAS AND .
UHHUH .
UH WE HAVE UH SOME PRETTY SELECTIVE ADMISSIONS REQUIREMENTS FOR INCOMING FRESHMEN .
UHHUH .
AND YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME STUDENTS WHO ARE IN THE TOP TEN PERCENT OF THEIR CLASS EVEN SOME WHO ARE MAYBE YOU KNOW IN THE TOP TEN O OF THEIR CLASS AND THEIR S A T SCORES ARE VERY LOW AND A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH THEIR UH THEIR READING ABILITY YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
THEIR THEIR LANGUAGE AND .
OH DEFINITELY YEAH .
IT UH MAKES IT TOUGH BECAUSE MUMBLEX YOU KNOW WHEN THEY COME IN WITH SCORES THAT LOW THEY MAY BE UH GOOD STUDENTS BUT THEY JUST HAVE NT ACHIEVED TO THEIR FULLEST POTENTIAL AND THEY RE GOING .
YEAH .
TO FAIL UNLESS SOME SORT OF REMEDIAL UH EDUCATION IS GIVEN TO THEM SO .
RIGHT RIGHT .
AND THEN IT THEN IT COMES INTO WELL WHO S SUPPOSED TO GIVE IT TO THEM THE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES OR .
YEAH .
ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO GET THAT BACK IN THE HIGH SCHOOLS AND .
YEAH .
THE JUNIOR HIGHS .
WELL I KNOW RICHARDSON SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS A HAS A WONDERFUL PROGRAM IN THE REMEDIAL READING UM WHERE YOU KNOW .
OF COURSE ALL THE CHILDREN ARE TESTED IN SOME .
TIME MUMBLEX PORTION OF THE YEAR AND AND UH SOME CHILDREN WHO NEED EXTRA HELP ARE PUT INTO THIS UM READING PROGRAM AND IT IS JUST EXCELLENT IT IS .
YEAH .
I WISH THAT ALL THE CHILDREN COULD BE EXPOSED TO THAT PROGRAM YOU KNOW AND I KN I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME PARENTS THAT SAY HOW DO I GET MY KIDS IN THAT AND YET THEY DO NT QUALIFY BUT IT S UNFORTUNATE THAT THEY DO NT QUALIFY BECAUSE I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD BENEFIT FROM THESE PROGRAMS .
YEAH IT SOUNDS LIKE IT .
IT IS EXCELLENT SO .
SO HOW MANY CHILDREN DO YOU HAVE AT HOME .
I HAVE TWO LITTLE ONES AND .
OH .
THAT S WHY I I QUIT MY JOB UH YOU KNOW I VE BEEN TEACHING SINCE THEY WERE GOSH NEWBORNS AND AND IT JUST WAS NT ADDING UP AND YOU KNOW BEING A TEACHER AND YOU SEE ALL THESE PARENTS WHO ARE WORKING AND WORKING AND WORKING AND JUST YOU KNOW DO NT HAVE THE TIME TIME TIME TIME .
YEAH .
IT WAS KIND OF GETTING TO ME WHERE WHERE I M DOING THE SAME THING .
AND SO UM YOU KNOW MY CHILDREN ARE GETTING OLDER AND I WAS MISSING OUT ON A LOT SO I JUST DECIDED TO STAY HOME FOR A WHILE I DO NT KNOW HOW LONG .
WELL THAT S GOOD .
UH I WORK AT T I AND WE HAVE UH OF COURSE STARTED DRUG TESTING UH RANDOM DRUG TESTING HERE AND UH I HAVE NT GOTTEN CALLED YET BUT UH I FEEL THAT IT S PROBABLY PRE IT S PRETTY GOOD IF IF THEY FEEL LIKE THERE IS A VAST MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE AT THE COMPANY DOING DRUGS .
DO THEY FEEL THAT WAY .
UH I THINK THAT THEY THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF DRUG USAGE HERE AT T I BUT I THINK OUR LATEST SAT STATISTIC SAID SOMETHING LIKE NINETYNINE POINT NINE EIGHT PERCENT WERE UH TESTING NEGATIVE ON ALL THE DRU .
UHHUH .
ON ON ALL THE TESTING .
WELL I I THINK IT S A GOOD IDEA JUST BECAUSE I M OPPOSED TO .
UHHUH .
TO THE DRUGS .
I THINK IT CAN CAUSE A LOT OF PROBLEMS EVEN THOUGH THEY THINK THEY CAN HANDLE IT .
UHHUH .
IT .
S UH I DO NT KNOW I DO NT REALLY LIKEN IT TO ALCOHOL BUT YET THAT CAN BE CARRIED TO AN EXTREME TOO .
UHHUH .
SO I THINK IT S A GOOD IDEA AND I THINK JUST THE IDEA THAT YOU KNOW THAT YOU MAY BE TESTED .
RIGHT .
MIGHT KEEP YOU OFF OF THEM OR GET YOU OFF OF THEM BECAUSE YOU RE I DO NT KNOW THAT THEIR JOB WOULD BE AT RISK BECAUSE I THINK THEY MAY PUT THEM INTO SOME SORT OF A PROGRAM TO GET THEM OFF OF DRUGS .
RIGHT .
I WOULD THINK THAT IS THAT HOW THEY DO IT AT T I MAYBE .
THAT .
RIGHT I AT T I IF YOU GET CALLED IN AND YOU TEST POSITIVE FOR DRUGS THEN YOU RE PUT ON A PROGRAM AND UH YOU KNOW YOU GO THROUGH THE PROGRAM AND THEN YOU RE CALLED LIKE SIX MONTHS AFTER YOU COMPLETE THE PRO PROGRAM .
UHHUH .
AND IF YOU TEST POSITIVE THEN YOU RE TERMINATED .
WELL I GUESS I I DRAW A HARD LINE BUT YOU KNOW I WOULD I M I M IN FAVOR OF OF THAT TYPE OF THING .
YEAH UHHUH .
THAT UH YOU YOU HAVE PEOPLE OUT THERE .
THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CERTAIN THINGS .
UHHUH .
AND YOU EXPECT THEM TO DO THEIR JOB AND .
THAT S RIGHT .
IT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT YOU KNOW THAT THEY CA NT DO AS GOOD A JOB UH AS THEY MIGHT DO .
UHHUH .
OH AND OF COURSE .
THEY CAN ALSO CAUSE INJURY TO OTHER PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
IF THEY RE IF THEY RE NOT UH YOU KNOW FULLY FUNCTIONAL MENTALLY WHILE THEY RE DOING THEIR JOB .
THEY COULD CAUSE .
RIGHT AND YOU NEVER KNOW .
YOU KNOW SERIOUS INJURY TO .
THEY COULD JUST GO OFF THE DEEP END .
OTH ANOTHER PEOPLE .
ON ON A ON SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
UH THAT WHATEVER .
UHHUH .
THEY RE TAKING AT THE TIME AND AND IT WOULD BE UH YOU KNOW OUT OF THE QUESTION .
UHHUH .
ALSO I GUESS YOU CAN YOU KNOW GET THE WRONG KIND OF STUFF AND KILL YOURSELF .
THAT S RIGHT .
JUST BY HAVING A WRONG MIX OF OR WATERED DOWN OR .
OH YEAH .
OR WHATEVER ALL KINDS .
I SUB IN THE SCHOOLS .
UHHUH .
SO I VE YOU KNOW HAD A THEY .
SO .
THEY TALK A LOT ABOUT .
RIGHT .
DRUGS THERE AND I THINK IT S GOOD THAT THEY RE TRYING TO START SOME PROGRAMS DOWN IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS .
RIGHT .
BUT YOU KNOW I THINK THEY CAN TEST ALL .
THEY WANT FOR DRUGS YOU KNOW AND .
UHHUH .
IF THEY NEED TO DO THAT AS A CONDITION FOR EMPLOYMENT AND I KNOW MANY OF THEM ARE DOING IT .
I KNOW MY SON HAS HAD TO DO IT FOR BOTH SAM S AND WALMART .
UHHUH .
AND I DO NT KNOW HOW MANY OTHERS ARE DOING THAT AND AND I THINK THAT S GOOD .
OH YES .
BECAUSE .
UHHUH .
SO MANY OF THE KIDS .
THAT ARE ON THEM ARE SORT OF BUMS THAT THEY NEED TO GET THEIR LIFE STRAIGHTENED UP AT .
THAT S RIGHT .
AN EARLY AGE AND UH I DO NT KNOW IT S JUST A PROBLEM .
THAT P NO ONE IS SURE JUST HOW TO HANDLE .
UHHUH .
I THINK .
YOU KNOW I THINK PERSONALLY I M FOR IT .
THERE .
S SEVERAL REASON WHY I I COULD THINK OF RIGHT NOW WHY WE SHOULD NT HAVE IT SUCH AS DRUG TESTING THEY SAY RUNS APPROXIMATELY A THOUSAND DOLLARS .
A PERSON .
EVERY TIME .
YOU DO IT .
REALLY .
AND .
IT .
S THAT HIGH .
YES .
AND OH YEAH IT S VERY EXPENSIVE .
OH .
AND UH .
I DID NT REALIZE .
UHHUH .
IT WAS THAT EXPENSIVE .
IT S NOT LIKE A NORMAL URINALYSIS .
UHHUH .
IT S VERY EXPENSIVE TO RUN THEM .
AND UH I DID NT GET A RAISE .
THIS YEAR BECAUSE NOBODY IN OUR COMPANY GOT A RAISE .
UHHUH .
BUT YET .
JUST LUCKY TO HAVE JOBS .
THEY SPEND ALL THE MONEY ON DRUG TESTING AND IF THEY WERE NT SPENDING ALL THE MONEY ON DRUG TESTING PEOPLE COULD HAVE GOT A RAISE .
SO SEE THERE YOU KNOW THERE S DIFFERENT I DO NT THINK THAT THAT S THAT I THINK THAT S MORE OF A PERSONAL VIEW OF MINE .
UHHUH .
OTHER THAN A A YES SIR WE SHOULD HAVE DRUG TESTING BECAUSE THERE S REALLY A PROBLEM AND I KNOW THAT .
BUT THEN I HAVE OTHER VIEWS TO IT .
I JUST I DID NT THINK IT WAS THAT EXPENSIVE BECAUSE MY SON WAS IN PROBABLY A WEEK AND A HALF PERIOD .
UHHUH .
AND SAM S AND WALMART ARE ARE OWNED BY THE SAME PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
HE TOOK ONE FOR FOR UH WALMART .
UHHUH .
FOR JOB HIRING AND THEN SAM S CALLED HIM AND AND HE TOOK ANOTHER ONE .
RIGHT .
AND I YOU KNOW I DO NT KNOW WHY THEY .
BOTH MADE HIM DO THAT .
UHHUH .
SINCE IT WAS SO CLOSE TOGETHER .
I CAN SEE IF BECAUSE YOU KNOW IF IT S A THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT S A THOUSAND DOLLARS THEY WASTED .
THEIR .
S MIGHT NOT RUN A THOUSAND DOLLARS .
OUR FROM WHAT .
I UNDERSTANDING HERE AT T I THEY RUN CLOSE TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS .
AN EMPLOYEE .
WELL MAYBE THEY RUN I DO NT KNOW YOU KNOW THAT S JUST GUESSING IT .
MAYBE THEY RUN A LOT OF OTHER TESTS OR MAYBE IT S UNDER A HEALTH .
UHHUH .
TYPE PROGRAM THAT IT .
UHHUH .
IT IT WOULD CATCH A LOT OF THINGS .
I I JUST CA NT IMAGINE .
BUT NO FOR ALL THE THE PUB .
THEM SCREENING ALL THESE EMPLOYEES PAYING A THOUSAND DOLLARS TO GET THEM .
OH IT S .
OKAY .
YEAH .
WELL CONSIDERING YOU MOVED HERE FROM CALIFORNIA I GUESS THE RAIN FOR THE PAST FEW WEEKS HAS BEEN DIFFERENT THAN WHAT .

SHE WAS FROM SAINT LOUIS AND SHE HAD THIS FANTASTIC UM FAMILY EFFORT IN IN RECYCLING AND SHE WAS DIVIDING HER COLORED GLASS AND HER PLASTICS .
OH .
AND HER ALUMINUM AND I THOUGHT WOW I MEAN HOW ONE PERSON IS DOING THAT YOU KNOW BUT MY MY THOUGHT WAS IT S A SHAME I MEAN IT S WONDERFUL THAT SHE S DOING IT AND IT BUT WOULD NT IT BE MU MUCH NICER IF WE .

AND YET YOU KNOW AND WE WERE JUST SORT OF TALKING ABOUT IT AT THE TIME .
AND HERE WE ARE YOU KNOW NOW WE RE DOING IT ON A .
DOING IT .
CITY WIDE BASIS IN IN COMMUNITIES .
SO IT S WONDERFUL THAT WE VE COME THAT FAR I THINK BUT .
WHAT DID SHE DO WITH IF IF SHE WAS SHE LIKE A GROUP .
THAT WAS DOING IT .
UM .
OR WAS SHE DOING IT ON HER OWN AND .
I THINK SHE WAS .
WHAT DID SHE DO WITH THE .
I WAS TRYING TO REMEMBER IT SEEMS TO ME THAT SHE WAS DOING IT ON HER OWN AND LIVING IN SAINT LOUIS THERE WERE PLACES WHERE SHE COULD ACTUALLY TAKE HER .
UHHUH .
UH THINGS .
HERSELF UH AND SO IT .
WAS NT YOU KNOW SOMETHING .
THAT WAS BEING PICKED UP OR UM AND I THINK SHE WAS ENCOURAGING OTHER PEOPLE TO DO IT IF THEY WOULD .
BUT I REMEMBER HER SAYING YES I HAVE A TRASH CAN FOR THIS AND A TRASH CAN FOR THAT AND A TRASH CAN FOR THE OTHER THING AND I THOUGHT WOW THAT S THAT IS WONDERFUL THAT SOMEBODY .
MUMBLEX DOES THAT .

RIGHT .
SHE JUST SHE RECYCLES EVERYTHING .
AND I HAVE DONE THE SAME THING .
I RECYCLE LIKE ZIP LOCK BAGS AND .
RIGHT .
THINGS LIKE THAT .
MY KIDS GET THE BIGGEST KICK OUT OF THAT .
ALTHOUGH THEY DO THE SAME THING .
I MEAN THEY .
RIGHT .
I THINK THEY GIVE ME .
A HARD TIME BUT I THINK THEY KNOW THAT THAT S .
THEY VE PICKED UP THE HAB .
IT S THE RIGHT WAY .

I I JUST SOMETIMES WONDER IF OUR MONEY IS BEING USED IN THE BEST WAY .
RIGHT .
UH SOMETIMES WHEN I HEAR WHAT WHAT .
THEY RE EVEN WHAT EVEN WHAT .
THE POLITICIANS ARE MAKING YOU KNOW WHEN THEY RE GETTING A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PLUS BENEFITS AND THAT UH I THINK THAT S JUST A BIT TOO MUCH TO BE PAYING THEM UH AND THAT S ALL TAX MONEY .
WHEN YOU FIGURE OUT HOW MANY POLITICIANS AND EACH ONE GETTING THAT MUCH IT S JUST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS .
THAT S I THINK IS JUST BEING THROWN AWAY .
RIGHT RIGHT .
AND THEN WHEN YOU READ ABOUT THAT THEY RE SPENDING ALL THE MONEY ON YOU KNOW THESE STUDIES .
THAT HAVE NO RELEVANCE WHATSOEVER THAT KIND OF TICKS YOU OFF TOO .
YEAH .
BUT UH SOMEBODY SOMEBODY WAS TELLING ME .
THE OTHER DAY THAT THEY HEARD SOME SENATOR SAY THAT WHAT .
WE RE PAYING IT S NOT THAT WE MIND PAYING TAXES IT S THAT WE RE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR A LOUSY GOVERNMENT .
YEAH .
AND I I I TEND TO AGREE WITH THAT .
YEAH .
I M NOT REALLY INTO WHAT .
THEY RE DOING .

PER SE AND I THINK THERE S JUST TOO MANY TOO MANY LEVELS OF BUREAUCRACY .
I THINK IT CAN BE CAN BE MANAGED BY LESS UH LESS LEVELS .

THAT S MAKING THE LEAST AMOUNT AND .
RIGHT .
UH AND SOMETIMES WE RE RUNNING AROUND THERE .
I SEE THESE THESE UH SUPERVISORS RUNNING AROUND UH HAVING MEETINGS .
I I REALLY DO NT KNOW WHAT .
THEY DO .
RIGHT .
I SOMETIMES WONDER ARE ARE THEY REALLY DOING ANYTHING OR .
RIGHT WELL I THINK WE RE GOING TO SEE A STREAMLINING IN THE GOVERNMENT .
I JUST YOU KNOW I I DO NT KNOW WHAT KIND OF UH I DO NT KNOW WHAT WHAT LEVEL OR WHAT HOW LONG .
IT WILL TAKE FOR YOU KNOW OUR COUNTRY TO START THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL TO START SAYING HEY THIS IS TOO MUCH .
WE RE NOT GOING TO PAY ANY MORE .
YOU KNOW WE RE NOT GOING TO PAY FOR THIS AND YOU RE OUT YOU KNOW .
I THINK WE RE STARTING TO SEE IT .
A LITTLE BIT NOW BUT I THINK UH I DO NT KNOW WHAT WHAT KIND OF INPUT .
WE RE GOING TO GET FROM THE PUBLIC AND HOW THEY RE GOING TO GO ABOUT DOING IT .
BECAUSE I THINK I THINK WE RE JUST GETTING TAXED WAY TOO MUCH .
YEAH .
I MEAN RIGHT NOW WE RE GETTING TAXED PROBABLY PROBABLY AROUND THIRTYFIVE PERCENT OR MORE .
AND THAT S THAT S YOU KNOW THAT S ME NOT MAKING A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY .

YEAH .
WELL I KNOW THEY SAY LIKE WITH REAGAN THEY SAY NO NEW TAXES BUT THEY CHANGED THE UH DEDUCTIONS ON YOU AND THAT JUST RAISES YOUR TAXES YOU KNOW THEY JUST GET IT .
A DIFFERENT WAY .
RIGHT .
SO I MEAN TO ME IT DID UH RAISE MY TAXES .

WELL DID YOU GO TO COLLEGE .
YES I DID .
AND WHERE DID YOU GO .
I WENT TO A SMALL LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGE IN VIRGINIA .
UHHUH .
UH IT WAS SWEEPER COLLEGE OF ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY STUDENTS .
I HAD GONE TO A SMALL SCHOOL GROWING UP UH AND A LOT OF MY FRIENDS WENT TO UNIVERT UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN BUT MY PARENTS WERE RETIRING IN SOUTH CAROLINA WHEN I GRADUATED AND UH WERE LOOKING FOR A SOUTHERN SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
AND UH ALSO U OF M SEEMED OVERWHELMING IN SIZE AND UH WHAT ABOUT YOU .
I WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA .
OH SO YOU RE FROM THE MIDWEST TOO .
I AM UHHUH .
WHERE DO YOU LIVE NOW .
UH I LIVE IN TEXAS NOW .
WHERE ARE YOU .
WELL I M IN TEXAS .
I M IN AUSTIN .
OH UH MY BROTHER S IN AUSTIN .
UH HE LIVES LAKEWAY .
HE UH HAD MOVED UH WE RE IN PLANO .
UHHUH .
AND .
I M FAMILIAR WITH PLANO .
I VISITED ONCE OR TWICE .
OH AUSTIN IS SO PRETTY .
I .
OH I LOVE IT .
REALLY LIKE IT .
I LOVE IT .
I REALLY DO .
AND YOUR DAUGHTER IS GOING TO BE A SOPHOMORE .
THAT S CORRECT .
I HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS BUT MY OLDEST WILL BE WILL BE A SOPHOMORE .
IS UH BECAUSE YOU LIVE IN AUSTIN IS SHE THINKING ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS .
SHE HAS HER HEART SET ON U T .
AND UH YOU KNOW HAVING GONE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA I KNOW WHAT .
A BIG UNIVERSITY IS LIKE .
AND UH ONE THING THAT I DID THIS SUMMER WHICH .
I THOUGHT MIGHT BENEFIT BOTH MY DAUGHTERS IS MY YOUNGEST DAUGHTER GOT INVOLVED IN BAND AND BAYLOR HAS A BAND CAMP .
OH .
SO SHE WENT FOR A WEEK AND IT WAS OVERNIGHT AND THEY LIVED IN THE DORMS .
AND I THOUGHT THIS WOULD EXPOSE BOTH OF THEM TO WHAT .
IT S YOU KNOW LIKE ON A COLL A SMALLER COLLEGE CAMPUS .
AND UH MY OLDEST ONE JUST WAS NT IMPRESSED AT ALL WITH THE IDEA OF A SMALL SCHOOL .
SO UH I I I STILL THINK THE EXPOSURE WAS GOOD .
YES .
THE REASON .
I ASK IF YOU WENT TO COLLEGE IS I THOUGHT WELL YOU KNOW WHAT WERE YOUR SELECTION CRITERIA .
DID YOU BASE IT ON WHAT .
YOU WANTED TO MAJOR IN OR WHAT .
YOU WOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH OR WHAT .
YOU COULD AFFORD OR YOU KNOW THERE S ALL OF THESE AREAS TO LOOK AT IN MAKING THE DECISION .
UHHUH .
THOSE AND THOSE WERE SEVERAL UH THAT WE DID CONSIDER .
UH MY PARENTS UH CERTAINLY DID NT PUSH BUT WANTED ME TO LOOK IN THE SOUTH AND BECAUSE I HAD BEEN IN A SMALL SCHOOL THEY SUGGESTED THAT I PROBABLY I WHEN I SAY SMALL MY GRADUATING CLASS HAD EIGHTEEN IN IT .
OH WOW .
AND SO THEY SUGGESTED THAT I MIGHT WANT A SMALLER SCHOOL BECAUSE I WAS USED TO A LOT OF ONEONONE .
OH DEFINITELY .
UH OR SMALL GROUP SITUATIONS .
AND I DID PICK IT BECAUSE AT THE TIME .
I WAS INTERESTED IN MAJORING IN BIOLOGY AND .
UHHUH .
I ALSO WANTED TO SPEND ONE YEAR STUDYING IN EUROPE .
UH I HAD HAD AN .
A F S STUDENT FROM GERMANY LIVE WITH US OUR SENIOR YEAR .
OH HOW EXCITING .
AND WE JUST THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE A WONDERFUL THING AND I ENDED UP MAJORING IN FRENCH .
ONE OF THE REASONS I PICKED THE SCHOOL WAS BECAUSE THEY HAD A STRONG SCIENCE DEPARTMENT .
THEY ALSO HAD A STRONG LANGUAGE DEPARTMENT AND I D ALWAYS LOVED WORKING WITH CHILDREN .
UH AND I FOUND THAT I COULD NT FIT EVERYTHING IN BUT BECAUSE I HAD HAD A FAIR AMOUNT OF FRENCH GOING IN .
UHHUH .
I WAS ABLE TO DO MY YEAR S STUDY IN FRANCE AND ABLE TO TAKE A LOT OF THE OTHER COURSES THAT INTERESTED ME .
UH AND SO .
OH THAT WAS .
THAT WAS SOME OF BUT .
THAT WORKED OUT VERY WELL FOR YOU .
SEVERAL OF THE THINGS YOU MENTIONED WERE THE THINGS .
THAT UH OUR SON HAS TALKED A LOT ABOUT TEXAS .
A AND M .
HE BUT HE THINKS HE WANTS TO BE A WRITER AND I DO NT THINK THAT .
WELL THEN HE SHOULD COME TO U T .
YES .
UH AND REALLY HIS HIS GRADUATING CLASS WILL PROBABLY BE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO A THOUSAND .
UHHUH .
UH AND SO HE S USED TO A BIGGER SIZE .
LARGE CLASSES .
AND BECAUSE MY BROTHER IS THERE UH HE WOULD HAVE FAMILY CLOSE BY .
SO THERE THERE ARE ADVANTAGES .
UH BUT I ALSO BECAUSE I HAD SO MANY FRIENDS .
WHO DID GO FROM OUR SMALL SCHOOL TO UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN WHICH WAS SO LARGE AND THEY REALLY FELT UH LIKE THEY WERE NUMBERS .
OH I WENT FROM A LARGE HIGH SCHOOL TO A U LARGE UNIVERSITY AND I .
YOU STILL .
DEFINITELY FELT LIKE .
YEAH .
I WAS A NUMBER .
UH I MEAN IT IS A DIFFERENT FEELING .
BUT THAT WAS THAT WAS MY ONLY OPTION .
I I MEAN I JUST REALLY COULD NT LOOK AT ANYTHING ELSE .
THAT WAS THE ONE AND ONLY THING .
I COULD REALLY AFFORD OTHER THAN A JUN YOU KNOW A JUNIOR COLLEGE WHICH .
I DID NT WANT TO DO .
SO THAT S HOW YOU KNOW MY DECISION WAS MADE .
BUT UH .
WELL TH THAT S CERTAINLY UH ESPECIALLY TODAY WITH THE COST OF COLLEGE .
I MEAN THAT IS A A MAJOR UH CONSIDERATION AND I DO FEEL FORTUNATE THAT TEXAS HAS SO MANY GOOD SCHOOLS .
AND .
YES .
EVEN THOUGH BAYLOR UH AND WHEN YOU MENTIONED THAT WE WE HAVE FRIENDS .
WHO HAVE CHILDREN .
THERE .
WHO JUST LOVE IT .
AND FOR A PRIVATE SCHOOL .
IT IS NOT AS EXPENSIVE AS MOST ARE AND IT IS A SMALLER SIZE AND UH I DO FEEL LIKE THERE ARE A LOT OF OPTIONS .
IT S IT S BUT I HAD BEEN HOPING SOME SCHOOLS I KNOW GIVE UH OH EVEN THIS YEAR JAY HAD AN APTITUDE TEST UH .
WHAT WHAT DOES HE HOPES TO BE A WRITER .
YES HE THINKS THAT S .
WHAT .
HE D LIKE TO DO BUT HE S REALLY STRONG IN MATH AND SCIENCE TOO AND .

WHICH .
I THINK IS OKAY BETHANY LET S BE REAL .

AND I DO NT KNOW SHE S TAKEN A LOT OF FRENCH AND SHE MAY END UP DOING SOMETHING WITH THAT .
AND I AM A SINGLE MOM SO I VE BEEN AND I MADE THE MISTAKE OF DROPPING OUT OF COLLEGE TO GET MARRIED .

OKAY WE UH WENT A DIFFERENT WAY WHEN WE WENT LAST CHRISTMAS BECAUSE OF BAD WEATHER AND BECAUSE WE WERE PULLING A LITTLE U HAUL TRAILER BECAUSE WE HAD TO TAKE OUR DOG IN THE CAR THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR LUGGAGE SO WE WENT ALL INTERSTATE WE WENT UP UM THROUGH OKLAHOMA CITY .
UHHUH .
AND THEN UP THROUGH UH KANSAS AND THEN TURNED LEFT AND WENT IN ON I SEVENTY .
OH .
AND IT WOUND UP ONLY TAKING US ABOUT AN EXTRA HOUR IT WAS A LITTLE MORE MILE WISE .
UHHUH .
BUT BECAUSE YOU COULD GO SIXTYFIVE MILES AN HOUR ON THE .
UH WELL I I GUESS IT S A SUBJECT .
I HAVE NT THOUGHT TOO MUCH ABOUT .
UH I DO NT KNOW IF THERE S SO MUCH WRONG WITH THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS UH AS MUCH AS .
WE RE EXPECTING TOO MUCH OUT OF THEM .
UH THAT MIGHT BE A LOT TO DO WITH IT .
I KNOW A LOT OF IT HERE IN MY STATE I M FROM MISSISSIPPI I M NOT SURE WHERE YOU RE FROM .
MINNESOTA WISCONSIN .
MINNESOTA OKAY .
WELL A LOT OF IT IN MISSISSIPPI HERE HAS GOT TO DO WITH FUNDING .
YEAH .
PROBLEMS WITH OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM A LOT OF IT S DUE TO MONEY .
UHHUH .
AND THEY RE TRYING TO SPEND MONEY WHERE WE DO NT HAVE IT AND THERE S A LOT OF THINGS WE NEED THAT WE JUST CA NT AFFORD .
YEAH .
WELL IT S IT IS GETTING VERY EXPENSIVE TO RUN SCHOOLS SO .
WELL IT IS .
THEY VE GOT COMPUTERS NOW THAT YOU GOT TO TRAIN ON .
THERE S JUST .
RIGHT .
SO MUCH UH MORE AND LESS MONEY TO DO IT WITH .
THAT S TRUE .
AND A LOT OF IT LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH UH SALARIES TOO SPEAKING .
RIGHT .
OF MONEY .
YEAH .
CAUSE IF YOU CA NT PAY THE RIGHT PEOPLE YOU KNOW THEY RE NOT TO BE ABLE TO DO THEY RE NOT NOT GOING TO GET THE PEOPLE .
THAT CAN DO A GOOD JOB .
YEAH YEAH .
I I I GUESS THAT IN UH TALKING ON A LOT OF THE THINGS AS FAR AS THE DISCIPLINE IN THE SCHOOLS I I THINK THEY RE EXPECTING SCHOOLS TO DISCIPLINE THE KIDS AND UH I THINK IT SHOULD GO RIGHT BACK TO THE PARENTS .
RIGHT .
IF YOU DO NT TRAIN YOUR KIDS RIGHT THEN .
RIGHT .
I FEEL THE SAME WAY .
A LOT HAS TO DO WITH HOW THE KIDS WERE RAISED AT HOME .
RIGHT YEAH .
AND THEN WHEN THE KIDS GET TO SCHOOL THEY TRY TO TAKE AWAY A LOT OF THINGS THAT THEY CAN DO TO DISCIPLINE THE KIDS .
I MEAN THEY VE SO SEVERELY LIMITED WHAT .
DISCIPLINARY ACTION .
YOU CAN DO .
YEAH YEAH .
I I KNOW WHEN I UH WAS GOING TO SCHOOL IT WAS NT UNCOMMON FOR A TEACHER TO STRIKE A STUDENT .
THAT WAS MISBEHAVING .
EXACTLY .
RIGHT .
I MEAN THEY DO THAT NOW AND THEY COULD PROBABLY LOSE THEIR JOB .
LOSE THEIR JOB AND BIG LAWSUIT AND ALL THAT .
YEAH YEAH .
I FEEL THAT S GOT A LOT TO DO WITH IT .
PEOPLE ARE NT AS AFRAID OF MISBEHAVING AS THEY USED TO BE .
RIGHT RIGHT .
YEAH .
IT SEEMS THAT D BE A SUBJECT THAT I I DO NT HAVE MUCH TO SAY ON .
REALLY .
WE WE VE TALKED SOME ABOUT IT IN MY STATE BECAUSE WE VE HAD A LOT OF UH PROB OUR GOVERNOR .
THAT JUST GOT THROWN OUT OF OFFICE WAS TRYING TO BE REAL BIG ON EDUCATION BUT HE .
WAS NT .
YEAH .
AND A LOT OF HIS PROBLEMS HAD TO DO WITH MONEY MOSTLY .
I KNOW A LOT A LOT OF IF YOU HAVE MORE MONEY .
IT S JUST LOGICAL THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE A BETTER SCHOOL SYSTEM .
UHHUH .
AND UNFORTUNATELY THERE S NOT MANY PLACES TO GET THAT MONEY .
YEAH .
THEN IF YOU DO NT HAVE QUALIFIED TEACHERS IN THE DIFFERENT MUMBLEX I KNOW ONE OF MY PHYSICS PROFESSORS AT COLLEGE HAS ADDRESSED THIS .
THAT MOST OF THE TEACHERS AT THE ELEMENTARY AND HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL ARE NT SCIENTISTS THEY RE TEACHERS .
AND THEY MAY NOT KNOW A LOT ABOUT WHAT .
THEY RE TEACHING .
WHERE THEY MAY HAVE JUST HAD A TEACHING MAJOR AND THEN HAD SOME SOCIAL STUDIES COURSES AND THEY RE TRYING TO TEACH SOCIAL STUDIES .
AND THEY DO NT KNOW A LOT ABOUT THAT .
RIGHT .
WHERE MAYBE A PHYSICS PROFESSOR HE MY PROFESSOR WAS A PHYSICS PROFESSOR AND HE SAID A LOT OF TEACHERS TEACHING PHYSICS TODAY HAVE NO BACKGROUND OF PHYSICS AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL .
SO THEREFORE THEY RE TEACHING FROM A TEACHER S POINT OF VIEW AND NOT FROM A PHYSICIST POINT OF VIEW .
AND THAT CAUSES A LOT OF TROUBLE .
RIGHT .
YEAH .
I DO NT KNOW E E MAYBE THEY SHOULD SIT BACK AND AND KIND OF UH DECIDE ON WHERE THE MONEY S BEST SPENT .
I KNOW IN A LOT OF CASES UH DIFFERENT DISTRICTS LIKE TO HAVE NICE FANCY SCHOOLS .
RIGHT .
AND MAYBE THEY SHOULD BE A LITTLE MORE UH UH CONCERNED WITH PAYING THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO TEACH AND AND BE UH SATISFIED WITH MAYBE A LITTLE OLDER SCHOOL .
EXACTLY .
BECAUSE I MEAN HERE IN THE TOWN .
I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL ONE OF THE THERE WERE FOUR HIGH SCHOOLS IN MY COUNTY ONE OF THE HIGH SCHOOLS WAS BLOWN AWAY BY A TORNADO .
SO WHEN THEY REBUILT THAT SCHOOL THEY HAD A A TOP OF THE LINE HIGH TECH SCHOOL THERE .
UHHUH .
AND THE OTHER SCHOOLS WERE BUILT BACK IN MAYBE THE FIFTIES OR EARLY SIXTIES AND THEN WHEN UH THE EVALUATION COMMITTEES CAME THROUGH THEY PRAISED THE SCHOOL .
THAT HAD BEEN REBUILT WHILE THEY WERE DOWN GRADING ALL THESE OTHER ONES .
TELLING THEM .
WHAT .
THEY NEEDED TO DO TO FIX UP THIS BUILDING AND THIS AND THIS AND THIS AND SO IT .
KIND OF WOULD MAKE YOU THINK THAT WE D ALL BE BETTER OFF IF ALL THE SCHOOLS WERE BLOWN AWAY BY TORNADOES AND WE HAD TO REBUILD THEM .
YEAH .
YEAH .
WELL I I KNOW UH WHERE I CAME FROM .
WE DID NT HAVE A VERY UH RICH COMMUNITY AND UH HIGH SCHOOL THAT I WENT TO WAS VERY OLD AND UH AS FAR AS I KNOW IT S STILL THERE .
THEY VE E EXPANDED ON IT BUT THEY VE NEVER BUILT A NEW ONE AND IT S PROBABLY FIFTY SIXTY YEARS OLD OR OR BETTER AND .
RIGHT .
I DO NT FORESEE THEM UH BUILDING A NEW ONE FOR A LONG TIME BECAUSE THEY CA NT AFFORD IT .
EXACTLY .
OKAY .
UH DO YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD OR .
OH SURE .
UH WELL .
I UH WENT TO SCHOOL AT MADISON FOR TWO YEARS AND THEY ARE REALLY BIG ON WOMEN S RIGHTS .
UHHUH .
AND AND EQUAL TREATMENT .
UHHUH .

BUT UH I M NOT THAT LIBERATED .
I MEAN MY MOM IS KIND OF OLDFASHIONED YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
SO I YOU KNOW YOU PICK UP SOME TRAITS FROM HER AND STUFF .
BUT UH I THINK IT S I THINK IT S INTERESTING AND BETTER FOR WOMEN TO SEE THAT THERE S MORE MORE OF THEM DOING MEN S FIELDS .
I LIKE TO SEE THAT .
AND .
RIGHT .
I DO NT LIKE TO SEE WOMEN YOU KNOW LIKE WAITING ON MEN HAND AND FOOT BUT YOU KNOW I I BELIEVE IN LIKE SHARING AND DOING THINGS FOR EACH OTHER .

SO .
I VE ALWAYS TAUGHT MY MEN .
THAT .
THEY BETTER CLEAN UP WITH THEIR WOMEN AND HELP THEM .
IF THEY DID THAT YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
AND THEY RE THEY RE GOOD ABOUT IT .
BUT IT IS NEAT TO SEE THEM .

RIGHT .
RIGHT AND I M BRIAN .
RIGHT .
JUST A MOMENT OKAY NANCY THEN I GUESS THE TODAY S SUBJECT IS BENEFITS .
RIGHT .
IN THE JOB OTHER THAN SALARY WHAT UH .
UHHUH .
WHAT DO YOU FEEL ARE IMPORTANT TO YOU OR OTHER PEOPLE AS AS CRUCIAL BENEFITS .
WELL I M A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN OTHER PEOPLE BECAUSE I DO NT HAVE BENEFITS WITH MY JOB .
UHHUH .
I M A NURSE AND I .
OH .
WORK I FLOAT .
UHHUH .
SO THAT I HAVE NO BENEFITS EXCEPT HIGHER PAY .
RIGHT .
FOR DOING THAT .
UHHUH .
SO I FIND THAT IT MAKES UP FOR WHAT I PAY FOR INSURANCE AND I I MAKE ENOUGH MONEY BY THE HOUR TO MAKE UP FOR THAT .
TO TO COMPENSATE .
RIGHT .
FOR SOME OF THE BENEFITS .
UHHUH .
OH .
YEAH IT S CHEAPER FOR ME TO BUY INSURANCE BY THE MONTH THAN TO WORK STAFF SOMEPLACE .
YES .
AND THEN I HAVE MY FREEDOM I CAN WORK SEVEN DAYS IN A ROW AND TAKE A WEEK OFF OR WHATEVER I WANT TO DO .
WELL THAT THAT S AN EXCELLENT SO ACTUALLY THAT IS A BENEFIT UH .
WELL IT IS TO ME MOST PEOPLE PREFER THE SECURITY OF NINE TO FIVE .
AND WEEKENDS OFF AND .
YEAH .
KNOWING THAT THEIR INSURANCE IS PAID AND THEIR RETIREMENT AND I M JUST REALLY NOT INTERESTED IN .
RIGHT .
ALL THAT .
RIGHT WELL I GUESS THAT S A GOOD POINT UH .
UHHUH .
I DO BELONG TO A A LARGE CORPORATION OR MY THAT WHERE I M CURRENTLY EMPLOYED AND THERE S UH THERE S SOME DIFFERENT THINGS UH ONE THAT YOU VE ALREADY MENTIONED IS IS HEALTH INSURANCE I THINK THROUGH OUR HEALTH INSURANCE THAT I CAN GET BETTER RATES AS A THROUGH A GROUP PLAN .
RIGHT .
AS OPPOSED TO GOING OUT AND GETTING HEALTH INSURANCE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS BECAUSE I HAD TO DO THAT AT ONE TIME WHEN I WAS NT EMPLOYED WITH A LARGE CORPORATION AND THAT GOT TO BE SOMEWHAT EXPENSIVE SO I .
YEAH .
I THINK ONE OF THE BENEFITS I I SEE IS THE UH IS THE GROUP UH GROUP DISCOUNT .
RIGHT AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE A FAMILY .
YES .
THEN I THINK IT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE .
YES AND THAT S THAT S ONE THING I DO HAVE .
YEAH .
IF I DID NT HAVE A FAMILY I DO NT THINK I WOULD HAVE AS AS A MALE OR AS A AS AN INDIVIDUAL OF IN THIS STAGE OF MY LIFE I DO NT THINK I WOULD HAVE INSURANCE UH OTHER .
RIGHT .
I DO NT THINK I WOULD GO THROUGH THAT EXPENSE ONE OTHER BENEFIT THAT YOU MENTIONED IS THE FLEXIBLE WORK HOURS AND IN MY PREVIOUS JOB I REALLY ENJOYED BECAUSE THEY HAD WHAT WAS CALLED FLEX SCHEDULE WHERE I COULD GO AND I COULD WORK UH NINE HOUR DAYS AND HAVE LIKE FRIDAY ONLY WORK FOUR HOURS .
OH YEAH .
OR I COULD DO UH WORK FOUR DAYS A WEEK AT TEN HOURS A DAY AND HAVE A YOU KNOW THREE W DAY WEEKEND .
RIGHT .
AND MAKE UH MAKE MY JOB FLEXIBLE IN THAT CASE .
COULD YOU CHANGE THAT AS YOU FELT LIKE IT OR DID YOU HAVE TO DO IT THE SAME EVERY WEEK .
WELL BASICALLY YEAH I HAD TO DO THAT UH THE SAME UH FOR ABOUT EVERY QUARTER OF THE YEAR I MEAN .
UHHUH .
UH BECAUSE I WAS IN A IN A POSITION OF MANAGEMENT I HAD RESPONSIBILITIES OVER PEOPLE THAT UH I NEEDED TO MAKE MY SCHEDULE UH SO THAT IF I WAS NOT THERE I WOULD HAVE COVERAGE BY SOME OTHER MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL SO SO I I THINK THAT UH THAT WAS A THAT WAS AN EXCELLENT BENEFIT .
YEAH .
THAT I REALLY ENJOYED AND I DO NT C HAVE THAT IN MY CURRENT OPERATION BUT UH YOU MENTIONED UH FLEXIBLE WORK SCHEDULE AND THAT S THAT S GOOD .
YEAH .
AND UH WHAT OTHER BENEFITS DO YOU THINK ARE IMPORTANT .
OH WELL I GUESS .
RETIREMENT THAT KIND OF THING WHICH I DO NT WORRY MUCH ABOUT SO .
YEAH YEAH THAT S TRUE .
I JUST PREFER TO WORRY ABOUT TODAY PROBABLY NOT A PRACTICAL ATTITUDE BUT THAT S WHO I AM SO .
WELL AND THAT S AN INDIVIDUAL THING .
UHHUH .
YEAH WITH UH WITH OUR CURRENT UH ORGANIZATION WE DO HAVE A NICE RETIREMENT PACKAGE AND ALSO A A NICE THING THAT THAT WE HAVE IN OUR CORPORATION IS A UH IS A PROFIT SHARING PLAN WHERE WE CAN UH PARTICIPATE IN THE THE PROFITS OF THE COMPANY IF WE RE YOU KNOW IF WE VE BEEN THERE A WHILE AND WE RE VESTED UH WHICH MEANS THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE A AN INTEREST UH IN THE COMPANY .
RIGHT .
THAT WE CAN UH GET SOME OF THE BENEFITS OF THE EITHER THE PROFIT HIGH TIMES OR OR IN A SENSE SUFFER DURING THE LOW TIMES AND UH ALSO UH IN ONE OF MY WIFE S UH COMPANIES WHERE SHE WORKED THEY D HAD A REAL NICE PROFIT SHARING PLAN THAT THAT .
OKAY .

UHHUH .
BUT I CAN CARRY AS MUCH IN MY HONDA OR MORE THAN I CAN IN IN THOSE OTHER BIGGER CARS .

UHHUH YOURS IS A FOUR DOOR .
FOUR DOOR YEAH .
UHHUH .
AND VERY VERY COMFORTABLE CAR BIG ROOMY TRUNK .
YEAH .
UH AND UH AND VERY HAPPY WITH IT AND I MUST ADMIT IT S YOU KNOW IF IF IF UH MY ONLY CONSIDERATION WERE WERE YOU KNOW BUYING ANOTHER CAR JUST TO TOOL AROUND TOWN IN AND MAKE YOU KNOW BRIEF TRIPS AND THINGS LIKE THAT I WOULD VERY VERY SERIOUSLY CONSIDER BUYING ONE UH I THINK THEY RE EXTRAORDINARILY RELIABLE CARS .
YES THEY ARE .
UM MY MY REAL CONCERN WITH UH UH WHY I M NOT SURE I WANT TO BUY A HONDA IS BECAUSE I HAVE TO MAKE A KIND OF A A STEADY UM TRIP DOWN THE ROAD ABOUT ONCE A MONTH BECAUSE I M DIVORCED AND I HAVE A DAUGHTER THAT LIVES DOWN IN NORTH CAROLINA .
UM UHHUH .
AND UH I DRIVE .
DOWN INTERSTATE NINETYFIVE AND IT S JUST AN ABSOLUTELY WILD HIGHWAY .
NINETYFIVE IS WILD IN ANY CAR THERE S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT .
YEAH AND .
BECAUSE I I I RUN OVER TO CRYSTAL CITY OR USED TO I M RETIRING THE END OF THIS MONTH .
UHHUH .
BUT I M VERY MUCH AWARE OF THE CRAZY DRIVING THAT GOES ON OVER THERE .
AND YOU WELL YOU VE GOT IT AND UH SO HAVING PRECIOUS CARGO IN THE CAR WITH ME AS YOU CAN WELL IMAGINE IT S VERY HARD FOR ME TO IMAGINE THAT THAT UH A HONDA S GOING TO BE AS SAFE A CAR AS AS THE ONE THAT I VE GOT MY EYE ON WHICH IS A VOLVO .
UHHUH UHHUH .
IN IN FACT QUITE FRANKLY I VE OWNED A VOLVO IN THE PAST AND .
UHHUH .
UH I VE I VE THEY RE EXPENSIVE CARS TO KEEP UP WHEN THEY NEED SERVICE BUT UH I VE FOUND THAT I VE HAD A LOT OF LUCK WITH THEM UH COURSE I M A MECHANICALLY INCLINED KIND OF PERSON AND I ALWAYS WIND UP GETTING UNDER THE HOOD AND FINDING OUT ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW NEED TO BE TAKEN CARE OF AND SO FORTH AND I GUESS THAT S ONE THING THAT THAT RECOMMENDS THE HONDA TO A LOT OF PEOPLE IS IS THERE S JUST VERY LITTLE THAT YOU HAVE TO DO UNDER THE HOOD AND UH .
YES IT JUST JUST SITS THERE AND PURRS AND YOU ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS THE MAIN MAJOR THING OF CHANGING THAT OIL AND THAT FILTER I GET SIX HUNDRED MILES ON A TANK OF GAS .
OH I KNOW IT S REALLY AMAZING .
YEAH .
IT S UH .
BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL MACHINE .
ABSOLUTELY .
INCREDIBLE SO UM YEAH ANYWAY I VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE PRICES OF THESE CARS AND AND SO FORTH AND I THINK THAT IT S IT S VERY SURPRISING SOME OF THESE VERY EXPENSIVE VOLVOS CAN BE GOTTEN FOR A LOT LESS MONEY THAN YOU WOULD THINK IF YOU RE .
IS THAT RIGHT UHHUH .
WILLING TO BUY ONES THAT ARE ABOUT .
THE VINTAGE OF THE CARS THAT YOU AND I CURRENTLY OWN .
UHHUH .
AND UM .
WELL A BRAND NEW VOLVO COSTS WHAT THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS .
WELL CERTAINLY SOME OF THE TOP END ONES YOU CAN STILL GET GET UH EVEN THE THE LOW END WAGONS UM FOR LESS THAN TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS .
UHHUH .
AND UH WE GET YOU KNOW IN THE WASHINGTON AREA OF COURSE BEING AS AFFLUENT AS IT IS THERE ARE LOTS AND LOTS OF VOLVO DEALERSHIPS DOWN HERE .
UM UHHUH .
SO THERE RE LOTS AND LOTS OF THEM AVAILABLE IN THE PAPER AT ANY ANY WEEK AND I SORT OF YOU KNOW SCAN THE PAPER AND LOOK AT THEM AND SO FORTH AND .
YEAH .
SO UM ANYWAY AND THAT S THAT S THE OTHER THING IS THAT I VE I VE NEVER REALLY BEEN TOO TERRIBLY MUCH OF A NEW CAR PERSON I THINK I VE BOUGHT ONE OR TWO NEW CARS IN MY LIFE AND I VE TENDED TO UM TO UH BUY CARS THAT ARE YOU KNOW TWO OR THREE AND SOMETIMES EVEN FOUR AND FIVE OR SIX YEARS OLD THIS HONDA THAT I HAVE I BOUGHT USED AND IN FACT IT HAD AN EXTRAORDINARILY LOW AMOUNT OF MILEAGE ON IT I VE JUST ROLLED SEVENTY THOUSAND MILES AND IT S A SEVENTYFOUR I MEAN AN EIGHTYFOUR SO .

WELL I GUESS IN CASES LIKE THAT YOU KNOW WHERE THE GUY WOULD OBVIOUSLY GO OUT AND DO IT AGAIN .
YEAH .
I MEAN YOU VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING .
YEAH WELL IT S FUNNY BECAUSE WHEN YOU KNOW THEY INTERVIEW YOU BEFORE YOU GO ON THE JURY .
RIGHT .
AND FOR CAPITAL MURDER I WAS INTERVIEWED BY FOUR ATTORNEYS FOR ABOUT FIVE HOURS .
WOW .
AND I THE I WAS THE I THINK THE NINETY EIGHTH PERSON .
THEY D INTERVIEWED .
YOU RE KIDDING .
BUT YOU KNOW AT THE TIME WHEN THE GUY KEPT SAYING COULD YOU EVER CONVICT SOMEONE AND DO YOU THINK YOU D EVER KNOW BEYOND A DOUBT AND I SAID I CA NT IMAGINE I SAID IF I KNEW BEYOND A DOUBT OR IF I FELT BEYOND A DOUBT THAT HE HAD DONE IT YEAH I GUESS I COULD CONVICT HIM BUT I CA NT IMAGINE YOU EVER MAKING ME THAT SURE OF SOMETHING .
RIGHT .
BUT THEY REALLY DID .
IT WAS IT WAS .
REALLY .
REALLY AMAZING .
WELL I GUESS IF THE POLICE CAME OUT AND SAW HIM FIRE THE GUN .
WELL THAT WAS A SUBSEQUENT CASE THAT WE DID NT KNOW ABOUT .
OH REALLY .
AND THOSE JURORS DO NT KNOW ABOUT .
BUT THIS PARTICULAR CASE I MEAN THEY HAD A COMPLETE CONFESSION FROM THE GUY .
OKAY .
WITH A LOT OF THINGS .
THAT THAT THE POLICE HAD NT RELEASED SO NO ONE ELSE WOULD HAVE KNOWN .
OH .
IT WAS IT WAS REALLY PRETTY INTERESTING .
WOW .
WHAT .
EDUCATIONAL .
I GUESS CASES LIKE THAT I DO NT SEE WHY THEY WOULD NT BRING IN THE NEW EVIDENCE FROM THE OTHER CASE .
WELL THEY CA NT THEY CAN I THINK IN THE PUNISHMENT PHASE .
OKAY .
BUT NOT IN THE GUILT OR INNOCENCE BECAUSE HE HAS NT BEEN HE HAS NT BEEN FOUND GUILTY OF IT .
OF THAT CRIME .
RIGHT .
BUT HE WAS FOUND GUILTY OF ANOTH OKAY .
RIGHT SO .
THAT WORKS .
YOU KNOW IT S ALTHOUGH IT S NOT GOING TO TAKE MUCH .
RIGHT .
TO PROVE THAT .
SO .
WELL THEY PUSHING THE DEATH PENALTY .
UH YEAH THIS GUY IS UP FOR THE DEATH PENALTY .
WOW .
UH AND IN TEXAS THERE IS THERE IS A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS YOU HAVE TO ASK UH IN THE PUNISHMENT PHASE .
UH FOR EXAMPLE WAS THE GUY PROVOKED AND WAS THE RESPONSE REASONABLE GIVEN THE PROVOCATION .
AND THERE IS A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS AND JUST DEPENDING ON WHETHER YOU SAY YES OR NO UH YOU YOU CAN GIVE HIM CAPITAL PUNISHMENT AND IF YOU RE UP TO THE POINT WHERE IF HE STILL QUALIFIES FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT THEN YOU CAN LOOK AT MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES .
OKAY .
SO .
SO THERE IS A LOT OF OUTS BUT THE ONLY RESULT IS OTHERWISE HE GETS LIFE IN PRISON .
YEAH AND I M REALLY KIND OF AGAINST LIFE IN PRISON ANYWAY .
YEAH .
BECAUSE IT COSTS SO DOG GONE MUCH .
RIGHT AND AND TO ME I MEAN YOU TAKE AWAY A PERSON S FREEDOM YOU VE TAKEN AWAY MOST OF THEIR LIFE .
THAT S TRUE .
I MEAN IF YOU RE GOING TO PUT HIM IN PRISON FOR LIFE .
YEAH BUT .
WITH NO CHANCE FOR PAROLE .
BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT REALITY .
I MEAN I THINK YOU KNOW NORMALLY THEY THEY MAY GET OUT SO .
THAT S TRUE .
BUT WHAT IS IT WORTH .
I DO NT KNOW .
UHHUH .
PERSONALLY I DO NT KNOW WHICH .
I WOULD PICK IF I HAD A CHOICE FOR MYSELF .
THAT S TRUE .
I MEAN I DO NT KNOW WHETHER I D STAY IN PRISON OR NOT OR .
YEAH SO YOU SAID YOU RE FROM MISSISSIPPI .
YES MAAM .
AND DO THEY HAVE THE DEATH PENALTY THERE .
YES THEY DO .
I THEY VE HAD A A NUMBER OF CASES HERE .
UHHUH .
I MEAN NOT A WHOLE LOT WELL JACKSON I HEARD JUST THE OTHER DAY HAD THEIR SIXTYFIRST MURDER .
THIS YEAR .
UHHUH .
IT WAS LIKE LAST LIKE YEAR .
THEY HAD FORTYNINE SO THAT S GOING UP .
UHHUH .
BUT YEAH THEY HAVE A DEATH PENALTY .
I HEAR OF ONE .
EVERY NOW AND THEN .
UHHUH .
AND I VISITED THE PRISON UP HERE .
UHHUH .
AND AT PARCHMAN AND I VE BEEN I HAVE NT THEY WO NT LET YOU ON DEATH ROW BUT THEY LL LET YOU LOOK DOWN THE HALL .
UM .
YOU CA NT SEE ANY PRISONERS AND AND IT S KIND OF A WEIRD FEELING .
I VE BEEN .
YEAH .
THEY TOOK US AROUND ON A TOUR YOU KNOW AND I WENT GOT TO WALK IN THE GAS CHAMBER .
OOH .
AND IT IS KIND OF A WEIRD FEELING KNOWING YOU RE SITTING THERE SAYING LIKE PEOPLE HAVE DIED HERE .
THAT S RIGHT .
BUT I GUESS JUST GOING UP THERE AND SEEING THE SURROUNDINGS AND STUFF THE PEOPLE UP THERE .
OKAY FOR AS FAR AS UM I WOULD THINK THE PROBABLY THE UH WORST SUBSTANCE THAT S PROBABLY UM OR STARTED TO SAY THE UH WHAT CAUSES THE MOST AIR POLLUTION IS PROBABLY THE CAR .
PROBABLY SO .
AND UH WHETHER OR NOT UM THEY LL EVER GET INTO LIKE HUGE TRANSIT SYSTEMS INTO BIG CITIES WHERE PEOPLE WOULD ALL TRAVEL ON A HIGH SPEED UH TRAIN OR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR .
YEAH IT LL BE HARD TO GET PEOPLE TO GIVE UP THEIR MOBILITY .
YEAH THAT S EXACTLY IT AND THAT S WHAT WE RE FINDING UM HERE WHERE WE RE AT IN MINNEAPOLIS AREA IS THAT PEOPLE DO NT WANT TO CARPOOL .
UHHUH .
THAT THERE ARE INCONVENIENCES TO THAT OR MAYBE YOU DO NT LIKE THE PERSON YOU HAVE TO YOU WOULD WANT TO CARPOOL WITH THAT KIND OF THING SO IT S IT S KIND OF A THING WHERE UH I THINK THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE DO NOT CARPOOL .
I THINK SO TOO I M IN TEXAS .
UHHUH .
AND VERY FEW PEOPLE CARPOOL .
YEAH .
UH THE PEOPLE THAT I KNOW DO NT WANT TO BECAUSE UH THEY NEVER KNOW FOR SURE WHAT TIME THEY RE GOING TO LEAVE THEIR JOB .
EXACTLY .
THEY NEVER KNOW WHEN THEY WANT TO RUN OUT AND DO AN ERRAND AT NOON YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
THEY JUST FEEL THEY NEED THEIR CAR .
OR IF SOMEBODY GETS SICK YEAH OR IF SOMEBODY GETS SICK AND IT S NOT THE OTHER PERSON .
UHHUH .
AND THEY WANT TO GO HOME AND THAT ONE PERSON S GOT THE CAR .
UHHUH .
THEN THEY RE THEY RE STUCK YOU RE .
THAT S RIGHT .
DEFINITELY RIGHT SO .
AND PEOPLE DO NT WANT TO GIVE IT UP .
YES .
BUT NOW I THINK WE VE MADE GREAT STRIDES .
UHHUH .
IN CHANGING A LOT OF THAT BY GOING TO THE UNLEADED GASOLINE AND .
SURE .
AND TO CHANGE THE CAR ITSELF .
SURE THAT HAPPENS QUITE A BIT .
BUT UH YOU KNOW I I DO NT GUESS WE CAN GET AWAY FROM IT A HUNDRED PERCENT .
YES YEAH .
BUT .
THAT S VERY TRUE .
YEAH .
UH OTHER THAN THAT UH I DO NT KNOW .
WELL MY OTHER LINE IS RINGING .
OKAY .
BUT WE RE GOING TO IGNORE IT .
OH OKAY WE LL TRY TO BE REAL QUICK HERE .
I M SORRY FOR THESE BEEPS .
THE OTHER THING THEN IS BECAUSE I DO NT KNOW HOW LONG THEY WANT US TO TALK .
OH CLOSE TO FIVE MINUTES I BELIEVE .
FIVE MINUTES OH OKAY .
AND YOU RE IN MINNEAPOLIS .
MINNEAPOLIS AREA .
WELL IS THE POLLUTION REALLY BAD UP THERE .
UH ACTUALLY NO WE HAVE UH QUITE A BIT UH THE ONLY PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE AND THAT S ALL OVER THE WHOLE WORLD IS OZONE .
UHHUH .
AND OF COURSE HAY FEVER SEASON .
UHHUH .
YOU GET SOME POLLUTANTS SUCH AS THOSE BUT THOSE ARE NATURAL .
YEAH .
UM BUT THERE IS STARTING TO IN MINNEAPOLIS ITSELF BECAUSE OF SO MANY PEOPLE ON THE HIGHWAY THERE IS BECOMING A PROBLEM OF POLLUTION AND .
UHHUH .
THEY JUST PUT IN A STRICT LAW THAT AS OF EVERY YEAR WHEN YOU GET YOUR LICENSE TABS .
UHHUH .
YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOUR CAR INSPECTED .
UHHUH .
TO SEE IF IT S RELEASING ANY UH LEAD INTO THE AIR .
UHHUH .
OR OTHER POLLUTANTS AND IF THAT S THE CASE THEN YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR CAR FIXED .
WELL .
AT LEAST WHERE YOU MUMBLEX .
THAT S THE WAY IT HAS GOTTEN HERE WE HAVE JUST HAD THAT LAW I THINK ABOUT A YEAR MAYBE A YEAR AND A HALF HERE IN TEXAS .
SURE YEAH .
BUT UH I THINK IT S A GOOD IDEA .
YEAH IT S NOT A BAD IDEA .
BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE STILL WANT TO DRIVE THE OLDER CARS .
UHHUH .
WHICH YOU CA NT BLAME THEM FOR THAT .
SURE SURE .
AND UH BUT IF THEY ARE POLLUTING THE AIR THEY NEED DO NEED TO HAVE THEM FIXED .
EXACTLY .
AND YOU KNOW THERE S A BIG MOVE ESPECIALLY IN THE INDUSTRIAL PART IN TEXAS RIGHT NOW OF CONTROLLING THE C F C S .
UHHUH .
THAT THE BIG MANUFACTURING COMPANIES ARE PRODUCING INTO THE AIR .
SURE .
THEY RE HAVING TO CHANGE THE TYPE OF PRODUCTS THEY USE .
UHHUH .
UH THEY CA NT USE LIKE I HAVE A FRIEND THAT S IN THE AIR CONDITIONING HEATING BUSINESS .
UHHUH .
AND THEY HAVE TO PAY A PENALTY FOR EVERY OUNCE OR POUND OF THIS CERTAIN TYPE OF FREON THAT THEY USE IN THE AIR CONDITIONING SYST SYSTEMS .
SURE .
THEREFORE THE INDIVIDUAL EVERY TIME THEY HAVE A SERVICE CALL IF THEY HAVE AN OLD UNIT THAT S STILL USING THIS TWENTYTWO FREON OR WHATEVER .
UHHUH .
IT IS IT COSTS THEM THREE TIMES AS MUCH TO GET IT FIXED .
SURE .
AND UH IF YOU HAVE A NEW HIGH EFFICIENCY SYSTEM THAT USES THE NEW TYPE OF FREONS THAT DO NOT RELEASE AS MANY C F C S INTO THE ATMOSPHERE .
UHHUH .
IT DOES NT COST AS MUCH .
YEAH .
SO EVENTUALLY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GO TO NEWER SYSTEMS YOU KNOW .
SURE .
BUT .
UH THE OTHER THING WHEN YOU RE TALKING ABOUT FREON WITH CARS UH AIR CONDITIONING I M SURE .
UHHUH .
OVER THERE IT S A NECESSITY .
RIGHT .
VERSUS SOMETHING UP HERE WE CAN LIVE WITHOUT IT BUT IT S UNCOMFORTABLE .
UHHUH .
BUT UH THIS YEAR MY HUSBAND RECHARGED OUR FREON BECAUSE IT WAS NEEDED TO BE DONE AND ONE OF THE CANS RELEASED ENTIRE AMOUNT .
UM .
OF FREON INTO THE UH INTO THE AIR BECAUSE HE OPENED IT AND I DO NT KNOW .
UHHUH .
IF THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH IT OR IT HIS DIRECTIONS WERE NT QUITE FULLY INSTRUCTED ONTO THAT AND I WAS THINKING HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE .
IT S PROBABLY HAPPENED TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE .
OH SURE BECAUSE .
UHHUH .
IF YOU TAKE IT INTO A SERVICE STATION .
THEY WANT TO CHARGE YOU FORTY DOLLARS JUST FOR UH FREON WHICH ONLY COSTS YOU ABOUT THREE DOLLARS .
UHHUH .
SO I HAVE THIS FEELING THAT FREON PROBABLY WILL INCREASE IN PRICE BECAUSE IT IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION AND SAY HEY THAT S .
UHHUH .
THAT S RIGHT THERE I THINK IT S LIKE THREE OR FOUR DOLLARS A A CAN .
YEAH .
AND IT TAKES ABOUT FOUR TO FIVE CANS TO FILL UP A AIR CONDITIONING UNIT IN A CAR AND I I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT AND MY HUSBAND EVEN WAS KIND OF WOOZY AFTER THAT BECAUSE I M SURE HE BREATHED IT .
INHALED SO MUCH OF IT UHHUH .
BUT UH YOU THINK ABOUT THAT ALL THE PEOPLE THAT ARE USING FREON AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND .
YEAH WELL OF COURSE IN THE UH I THINK YOU PROBABLY NOTICED IN THE DISCOUNT STORES AND PLACES IN THE HAIR SPRAYS .
UHHUH .
WE RE NOT SEEING AS MANY AEROSOL CANS DOWN HERE .
EXACTLY .

UH WELL SINCE I INITIATED THE CALL I GUESS I LL START OFF FIRST .
UH NUMBER ONE I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM WITH RANDOM TESTING .
UH I SPEND AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME TRAVELING ON THE JOB AND I FEEL I WOULD BE VERY COMFORTABLE IF THEY WOULD DO DRUG TESTING FOR PARTICULARLY AIRLINE PILOTS AND THE SUCH .
I D FEEL MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE THAN I DO NOW BASED ON WHAT .
I VE BEEN HEARING IN THE NEWSPAPERS .
SO I REALLY DO NT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT .
YEAH .
UH I DO NT EITHER .
I UH I VE NEVER I DO NT WORK AT HOME RIGHT NOW .
I STAY HOME WITH MY CHILDREN .
UH BUT MY HUSBAND WORKS AND THEY DO HAVE THAT AT HIS PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT AND NEITHER OF US HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT .
WE VE PARTICULARLY LIKE YOU SAID WITH THE THINGS THAT THE AIRLINES AND AND SUCH .
IT .
S UH IT S A SCARY THING TO KNOW THAT UH YOU JUST DO NT KNOW WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING .
UHHUH .
UH BEFORE THEY GO TO WORK .
SO AND THE THE ADVERTISEMENTS ON TELEVISION LATELY HAVE BEEN SO UH THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY .
YOU KNOW THERE S UH .
YEAH .
JUST ABOUT LIKE TRAIN TR TRAIN WRECKS AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT I FEEL LIKE PROBABLY JUST FOR OUR OWN SAFETY WHEN WE RE TRAVELING AND THINGS .
THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING .
I D LIKE TO KNOW THAT S GOING ON .
YEAH I WELL I HAPPEN TO BE UH MY JOB IS I M SUPERVISOR OF PERSONNEL SAFETY FOR THE WORLD S LARGEST PAINT COMPANY SO I IT S VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO ME WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT DRUG TESTING FOR RANDOM SAMPLING AND TESTING FOR CAUSE THIS TYPE OF THING .
AND EVEN IN OUR FIELD .
WE HAVE PEOPLE .
THAT ARE IN VERY HIGH RISK JOBS AND WE AT THE PRESENT TIME DO NOT HAVE RANDOM TESTING .
UM .
AND I AM PUSHING TOWARDS THAT .
I I HONESTLY FEEL IF PEOPLE HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE THEY SHOULD NT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT .
RIGHT .
AND IF THEY ARE TRYING TO HIDE SOMETHING THEN I HAVE TO KNOW THAT BECAUSE WE RE T WE RE TALKING MAJOR LIABILITIES .
NOT ONLY WITH THEMSELVES BUT WITH OTHER EMPLOYEES .

AND I REALLY YOU KNOW THEY THEY RE TALKING ABOUT SPORTS AND SPORTS PERSONALITIES AND ALL THIS STUFF THAT I I WOULD MUCH MUCH PREFER HAVING DOCTORS AND AIRLINE PILOTS TESTED .
YEAH .
ON A RANDOM BASIS .
I I HAVE A REAL FEAR BUT THAT AT SOME POINT .
SOMETHING S GOING TO HAPPEN .
AND THEY RE SHOWING IT WITH AIDS SO WHY YOU KNOW THEY SH THEY OUGHT TO START DOING SOMETHING WITH THE DRUGS .
SO I REALLY HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH IT .
YEAH .
WELL IT S IT S UNFORTUNATE I THINK THAT EVERYONE DOES NT HAVE THAT OPINION .
UH SOME PEOPLE JUST UH I VE HEARD SOME PEOPLE JUST TALKING IN OUR GROUP OF FRIENDS THAT THEY JUST FEEL IT S AN INVASION OF PRIVACY AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT UH IN THE LONG RUN IT SEEMS TO ME IT S KIND OF LIKE WHAT .

AND UH SO THAT KIND OF THING REALLY KIND OF CONCERNS ME .
WELL THAT SCARES ME BECAUSE IF TH THAT S THE WAY .
THEY ARE I IF I WERE A DENTIST I D WANT TO BE PROTECTED TOO .

UHHUH .
THAT IS BECAUSE WELL AND I WORKED FOR A DENTIST AND THAT S UH YOU KNOW YOU YOU COME IN CONTACT WITH A LOT OF OF BLOOD AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND IT S REAL REAL DANGEROUS .

THAT NIGHT AND THE DOG RODE IN THE CAR AND WE STOPPED ALONG THE WAY AND HAD A BITE TO EAT AND THEY LEFT THE DOG IN THE CAR AND I GUESS WHILE WE WERE INSIDE EATING THUMPER JUST TORE THE HECK OUT OF THE INSIDE OF THE CAR AND UH FINALLY WE MADE IT BACK TO UH TO CARNEY AND .
WELL I GUESS WE RE UH FORCED TO FINALLY TO DO A LOT ABOUT AIR POLLUTION .
I HEAR THAT THE MAJOR AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS ARE LOOKING AT NONPOLLUTING CARS AND LOW POLLUTING FUELS ARE BEING EXPERIMENTED WITH ETHANOL AND OTHER TYPES OF FUELS .
YEAH ONE OF THE THINGS THEY ASKED ME TO ASK YOU WAS WHERE YOU THOUGHT THE MAJOR SOURCE WAS COMING FROM .
I YOU KNOW I ASSUME .
OR SOURCES .
THAT THE MAJOR SOURCES ARE CARS AND FACTORIES .
THAT S WHAT .
BUT I .
I WOULD THINK .
I DO NT KNOW FOR SURE .
I JUST KNOW THAT UM ACID RAIN APPARENTLY IS A BIG PROBLEM IN CANADA FROM WOULD COMES OVER THE BORDER FROM US .
RIGHT .
YEAH I THINK THE AUTOMOBILE DEFINITELY IS AN AREA AND ANY ANY INDUSTRY THAT BURNS YOU KNOW AND THEN I DO NT KNOW ABOUT CHEMICAL POLLUTION .
I M NOT REAL INTO THAT AS FAR AS HOW IT AFFECTS THE AIR .
I KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF CHEMICAL THE INDOOR TYPE POLLUTION .
THEY HAVE OFFICES .
THAT ARE TOO WELL INSULATED .
THEY FOUND PEOPLE ARE GETTING SICK .
YEAH .
BUT I DO NT KNOW IF THAT AFFECTS OUTSIDE .
YOU KNOW I I THINK SEEMS TO THINK SEEMS TO ME .
THAT S WHAT .
THEY WERE ASKING ABOUT WAS OUTSIDE AND THE THING .
I CAN THE ONLY THING .
I CAN THINK OF WOULD BE CARS AND FACTORIES .
YEAH THE SMOKESTACKS OR THE EXHAUST PIPES .
YEAH .
UM I GUESS THERE S BEEN A LOT OF PRESSURE TO UM DO AWAY WITH THE C F C S IN THESE SPRAY BOTTLES .
WHICH .
RIGHT .
HAS BEEN A REAL PROBLEM .
YEAH THAT IS WELL THAT S DESTROYING THE OZONE IS NT IT .
AGAIN I THAT S WHAT .
I HEAR AND AND THERE S THIS BIG DEBATE APPARENTLY ABOUT WHETHER THE OZONE THERE S A HOLE IN THE OZONE OR NOT BUT AT LAST I HEARD IT WAS UH DISCOVERED THAT THE HOLE WAS BIGGER THAN THEY THOUGHT .
YEAH THAT S WH .
INITIALLY .
IT .
S KIND OF SCARY .
WELL IT IS SCARY AND I THINK IT WILL UH CONTINUE TO FORCE US TO CLEAN UP OUR ACT .
YEAH .
LITERALLY AND FIGURATIVELY .
WE VE GOT TO LEARN TO MANAGE WITHOUT DESTROYING THE ENVIRONMENT .
I THINK SOMETHING TOO THAT YOU PROBABLY SEE IN OLDER STATES ALL .
WE WE DO IT DOWN HERE ONCE IN A WHILE .
WE WILL HAVE A COLD SPELL IS WHERE PEOPLE WILL USE THEIR FIREPLACES .
I I I M WONDERING WHETHER IT S GOING TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CA NT .
I THINK IT WILL .
DO THAT .
IN LOS ANGELES THEY RE APPARENTLY GOING TO THEY VE PASSED LAWS .
THAT FOR HABIT FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE USING UH BARBECUES .
UHHUH .
GASOLINE LAWN MOWERS UM AND IT S REALLY BAD IN PLACES LIKE LOS ANGELES AND .
RIGHT .
IT S GOTTEN BAD IN DENVER AND AND UH IT S NOT TOO BAD AROUND HERE ALTHOUGH YOU SEE IT YOU KNOW MORE AND MORE IN THE SKY .
AND PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE REALLY WEDDED TO THEIR UH CARS .
RIGHT .
AND OUR ECONOMY SEEMS TO AND THIS I THINK IS ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS .
YEAH .
IN THIS AREA TOO SINCE YOU KNOW IN TEXAS WE RE SO SPREAD OUT .
YEAH .
WE HAVE TO DRIVE SO FAR BUT I KNOW IN COLORADO I HAVE WITNESSED THAT WHERE IT JUST UH IT JUST STACKS UP AT THE WHEN THE ROCKIES STARTS BUT WE RE EVEN GETTING IT HERE .
WE CAN DRIVE INTO WHEN WE VE BEEN ON VACATION OR SOMETHING DRIVE INTO FORT WORTH OR DALLAS AND YOU CAN TELL IT IN THE MORNINGS TOO .
MY HUSBAND LIKES TO GO OUT AND JOG AND THERE S JUST A BROWN FOG HERE AND WE DO NT EVEN HAVE ANY MOUNTAINS .
THAT ARE .
YEAH .
HOLDING IT IN .
BUT THEY ALSO SAID THAT MORE DENSE THE POPULATION AND THE MORE .
WE CROWD TOGETHER THE WORSE .
IT GETS .
WELL THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE .
I MEAN I I HAD NT THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT WAY BUT IT IT .
YOU DO NT HAVE TO HAVE MOUNTAINS .
THAT ARE STOPPING IT .
YEAH .
AND UH THEY MAKE UH MAKING MORE AND MORE HIGHRISE BUILDINGS AND UH SO YEAH WE CAN COMMENT AND WE DID NT SEE THIS A FEW YEARS AGO .
NO AND I THINK .
IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR HERE .
YEAH AND I THINK THAT THAT MORE AND MORE IT S BECOMING APPARENT TO PEOPLE THAT THE EARTH WHICH INCLUDES ALL THE PEOPLE ON IT AND EVERYTHING .
THAT S GOING ON IT IS A IS AN ORGANISM OF SORTS .
RIGHT .
AND THAT THERE IS A A WHOLE SET OF ORGANIC RELATIONSHIPS THAT IF WE START TO DESTROY ONE PART OF IT IT S GOING TO TELL US ABOUT IT AND UH WE RE GOING TO FEEL IT AND I THINK IT S GOING TO BE REAL INTERESTING AND PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF WHAT IS OBVIOUSLY GOING TO BE A BIG STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN THE ECONOMY .
UHHUH .
UH IN THIS COUNTRY UH WHETHER PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO GET OUT OF THEIR CARS .
YEAH .
AND IN THIS COUNTRY UH THE THE SOLUTION THAT THAT PEOPLE SEEM TO THINK WORK ARE POLITICALLY UNACCEPTABLE .
FOR EXAMPLE .
YEAH .
TAXING PEOPLE HEAVILY FOR USING THEIR CARS .
AND UH I HAVE A LITTLE SPORTS CAR THAT I ENJOY USING AND I KNOW JUST LIKE ANYBODY ELSE HOW MUCH FUN .
IT IS TO DRIVE BUT I THINK UH WE RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SOME FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES AND AND I M I M NOT SURE HOW LONG .
IT S GOING TO TAKE OR WHAT .
IT S GOING TO TAKE BECAUSE THEY KEEP SAYING THAT THE ECONOMY IS GOING TO DEPEND ON HOW MANY CARS AND .
YEAH .
HOUSES WE SELL .
AND IT S A SHAME TOO WHEN YOU DO SEE SOMEBODY DRIVING A BIG CAR JUST ONE PERSON IN THAT .
IT S A LOT OF WASTE BUT .

UH WELL I LIKE TO THINK OF IT AS A HOBBY BUT I I GUESS ALSO PARTLY OUT OF NECESSITY JUST REPAIRING THINGS AROUND THE HOUSE .
UH A FEW YEARS AGO UH WE NEEDED UH THEY NEEDED SOME BOOK SHELVES AND I KIND OF DREW UP SOME SIMPLE PLANS TO MAKE SOME BOOK SHELVES AND UH IT ACTUALLY WORKED PRETTY WELL AND OVER THE YEARS I VE I VE REFINED THOSE PLANS I GOT MYSELF A ROUTER AND I M I M VERY GOOD AT MAKING BOOK SHELVES .
UHHUH .
IT S IT S ALSO A WAY OF RELIEVING STRESS MY WIFE KIND OF LAUGHS .
AT ME THAT ANYTIME I GET STRESSED OUT I JUST GO OUT IN THE GARAGE AND WE VE GOT MORE BOOK SHELVES .
WELL I LL HAVE TO COME AND SEE THEM THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA I YOU KNOW AND THAT S THAT IS RIGHT IT IS OUT OF NECESSITY BECAUSE LOT OF THE THINGS THAT UH WELL WE CA NT BE ABLE TO AFFORD BUT ALSO I I SOMETIMES THINK THAT UH I ENJOY DOING THAT AND I LIKE TO GET OUT AND AND UH TO WORK WITH MY HANDS AND UH SOUNDS LIKE YOU GOT SOME REAL NICE TOOLS TOO DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO DO SOME MORE IF YOU HAD MORE TOOLS AND DIFFERENT TOOLS .
UH WELL YEAH I MEAN LITTLE BY LITTLE I I STARTED OUT WITH JUST BASIC HAND TOOLS AND KIND OF ADDED ON TO THINGS .

DESIGNED A SPACE JUST THE RIGHT SIZE FOR THE T V AND THEN THE THE V C R AND SHELVES ON THE SIDE FOR MY STEREO EQUIPMENT .
RIGHT RIGHT .
AND UH THAT S WORKED PRETTY WELL UH WITH UH WITH THE ROUTER YOU CAN MAKE NICE UH I GUESS DADO JOINTS IS WHAT IT S CALLED .
RIGHT OR YES I YEAH I M .
UH .
AWARE OF THAT .
AND IT S UH .

UH .
SO .
AND UH CASINGS AND SO FORTH THAT ARE THAT ARE REAL NICE SO THAT S THAT S GOOD THAT S GOOD .

RADIAL ARM SAW IS I GUESS WHAT THEY RE CALLED .
UHHUH .
UH IT T SEEMS TO ME THE RADIAL ARM SAW IS IS BETTER WELL IT IT TAKES UP LESS ROOM .
YEAH .
I MEAN YOU YOU SET THE WOOD DOWN AND YOU MOVE THE SAW .
YEAH .
WHEREAS IF YOU RE RIPPING WOOD YOU RE PROBABLY BETTER OFF WITH A A TABLE SAW .
WELL AND WITH A RADIAL ARM SAW IF YOU DO HAVE A A BIG PIECE OF WOOD THAT YOU NEED TO RIP LIKE YOU SAY OR CUT YOU WOULD NT BE ABLE TO DO THAT UH BUT UH YEAH A TABLE SAW DOES TAKE A LOT OF TIME EXCUSE ME A LOT OF SPACE AND IS A PRETTY BIG INVESTMENT .
YEAH .
AND .
UH THAT THAT S PARTLY MY PROBLEM NOW I DO NT HAVE ROOM FOR THIS I UH I WHERE UH WHERE WE LIVED BEFORE UP NORTH UH .

WHO IS IT .
ASK THEM .
LET ME ASK NICOLE .
NICOLE .
LET ME ASK YOU DO YOU THINK THE SOVIET UNION IS A STILL A THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES .
DO YOU KNOW I DO NT KNOW WHAT TO THINK I I UH THE PERSON I AM I WANT TO BELIEVE THAT IT S AN HONEST EFFORT I WANT TO BELIEVE THAT THAT THEY REALLY ARE TRYING TO CHANGE THAT THAT MAYBE THEY ARE HEADED FOR A MORE DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY AND I I WANT TO BELIEVE IT S ALL OKAY .
UHHUH .
BUT THEN THERE S THAT SIDE OF ME THAT SAYS YEAH BUT THEY VE PUT ON FACES BEFORE .
RIGHT .
AND NEVER TO THIS EXTENT THOUGH YOU KNOW SO SO IT S LIKE THERE IS A STRUGGLE WITHIN ME GOING DO DO I BE OPENMINDED AND GIVE THEM THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT WHICH IS KIND OF MY BASIC PERSONALITY YOU KNOW I .
UHHUH .
I TRUST PEOPLE I LL DO THAT OR DO I KEEP ON GOING WELL WE LL WAIT AND SEE .
WELL I THINK THERE S A A STRUGGLE WITHIN THE SOVIET UNION UM I THINK THE PEOPLE ARE ARE JUST FED UP AND I THINK IT S SHOWING AND ALL THE REPUBLIC IS TRYING TO GAIN THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND I THINK UH THAT S MAKING GORBACHEV AND OTHERS REALIZE THAT HEY MAYBE THIS COMMUNIST THING IS NT WORKING .
YEAH THAT S IT S NOT JUST A MERE OR UH WESTERN SOCIETY TELLING YOU I IT S IT DOES NT WORK .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW THEY VE ALWAYS SAID YOU KNOW THE THE SOVIET PEOPLE WERE UNITED WE BELIEVE THIS AND MAYBE THEY ARE SEEING THAT NO NO HEY WE DO NT BELIEVE THIS YOU KNOW .
THAT S RIGHT .
BUT .
I THINK .
IT S STILL YOU KNOW I GUESS I KEEP THAT ONE PART OF ME THAT S LIKE WELL I DO NT KNOW I WANT TO TRUST THEM AND I IT S LIKE I CA NT AND MAYBE IT S BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE VE HAD OUR OWN PROPAGANDA OVER THE YEARS I DO NT KNOW .
WELL THAT THAT COULD BE YOU KNOW WHAT I WE ALWAYS WE THINK OF THE K G B AND WE THINK SUCH BAD THINGS YOU KNOW BUT I WOULD NT DOUBT IF THE SOVIET PEOPLE THINK C I A AND THEY THINK SUCH BAD THINGS YOU KNOW .
AND THEY PROBABLY DO THE SAME THINGS .
EXAC EXACTLY THEY DO .
YOU THINK THE C I A DOES NT SPY I M SURE THEY DO .
OH YEAH THEY DO YOU KNOW .
NOW THE DIFFERENCE IS WE DO NT I I DO NT THINK WE TAKE PEOPLE AND KILL THEM JUST BECAUSE THEY DO NT BELIEVE WHAT WE BELIEVE YOU KNOW I THINK TO THAT EXTENT WE DO NT GO AS FAR BUT I M SURE THEY LIE YOU KNOW .
OH YEAH OH ABSOLUTELY .
SO .
THAT S PART OF THAT PROPAGANDA THING AND I THINK IF WE CAN GET AWAY FROM THAT OR IF WE CAN KEEP THAT OUT OF OUR MINDS OH EXCUSE ME I VE GOT A COLD TODAY .
THAT S ALL RIGHT I HOPE YOU GET BETTER .
THANK YOU UM I THINK IF WE CAN GET THAT PROPAGANDA THING BECAUSE I M SURE BOTH COUNTRIES ARE SEEING SEEING IT YOU KNOW THINKING K G B AND C I A AND ALL THAT BUT UH .
YEAH .
JUST ON AN ECONOMIC POINT OF VIEW IF THE SOVIET UNION DOES NT DO SOMETHING FAST THEY ARE THEY AI NT GOING TO BE ABLE TO FEED THEIR PEOPLE THIS .
YEAH .
THIS WINTER YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
BUT .
THAT S TRUE .
ON THE OTHER HAND I M KIND OF GETTING FED UP WITH UH OUR OWN COUNTRY AND PRESIDENCY UH ALWAYS CONCERNING THEMSELVES WITH OTHER NATIONS PROBLEMS WHEN WE HAVE SO MANY AT HOME YET .
AND I M NOT AGAINST THEM BEING CONCERNED BUT I FEEL LIKE WE OUGHT TO BE SPENDING MAYBE THE SAME TIME AND EFFORT AND AND ENERGY INTO TRYING TO SOLVE OUR OWN OR RESOLVE OUR OWN .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW I MEAN YOU KNOW ANY ANY COUNTRY THAT WANTS TO BE DEMOCRATIC I M ALL FOR HELPING THEM YOU KNOW BECAUSE I I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE UNITED STATES AS THE BIGGEST AND LONGEST SUPPORTER OF THAT TYPE OF GOVERNMENT .
RIGHT .
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I I AGREE I DO NT THINK WE CAN DO IT AND AND JUST YOU KNOW TURN OUR BACKS OR OR BE IGNORANT PER SE TO THE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING HERE .
THAT S RIGHT YOU KNOW WE VE GOT UH WE VE GOT QUITE A FEW DOMESTIC PROBLEMS THAT UH THAT I FEEL WE OUGHT TO BE CONCENTRATING MORE ON I THINK THE PROBLEM IS YOU KNOW ON THE INTERNATIONAL SCOPE MAYBE THE PRESIDENT FEELS THAT UH YOU KNOW FOR LONGTERM RELATIONS WITH ALL THESE COUNTRIES IT S IMPORTANT AND WELL WE LL WE LL ALWAYS HAVE THE UNITED STATES AND YOU KNOW WE NEED TO SOLVE THESE INTERNATIONAL PROBLEMS BUT UM I THINK I HEARD IN THE NEWS ABOUT LAST WEEK SOMETIME THAT UH THE PRESIDENT ENDED UP CANCELING ONE OF HIS INTERNATIONAL TRIPS SO HE COULD SPEND MORE TIME ON DEM ON A DOMESTIC ISSUE BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IS KIND OF GETTING FED UP WITH IT .
YEAH WE WE WE BELIEVE IN WHAT HE S DOING ABROAD BUT BUT LIKE YOU SAID THERE S ISSUES HERE TOO .
RIGHT .
AND BUT I I AM ENCOURAGED BY WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE SOVIET UNION I M ENCOURAGED BY WHAT S HAPPENED IN YOU KNOW THE THE IRON CURTAIN COUNTRIES YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
IN IN THAT BLOCK AND AND I THINK IT S MOVED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I I THINK SOMETIMES PEOPLE EXPECT IT TO HAPPEN OVERNIGHT .
YEP .
YOU KNOW IT S NOT GOING TO .
NO .
IT DID NT HAPPEN HERE OVERNIGHT AND IT DID NT HAPPEN HERE WITHOUT A STRUGGLE .
THAT S RIGHT .
YOU KNOW .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND I I THINK SOMETIMES WE FORGET THAT BUT I I I I HAVE TO SAY YES I M YOU KNOW I M ENCOURAGED BY THE WAY IT S GOING UH .
WELL I .
UH .
THINK UH I THINK IN THE LONG .
ALL RIGHT WELL .
UM SHORT TERM I DO NT THINK ANYTHING S GOING TO BE DONE ABOUT IT .
RIGHT .
OR PROBABLY SHOULD BE DONE ABOUT IT .
UH ARE YOU SAYING YOU DO NT THINK ANYTHING SHOULD BE DONE IN THE SHORT TERM .
UH THE SHORT TERM THE RECESSION IS GETTING GETTING TOP ATTENTION .
YEAH I I THINK THAT YOU RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE .
THE OTHER THING IS IS THAT WE VE GOT THESE UM THESE ALL THESE BANK DEFAULTS GOING ON AND AND SAVINGS AND LOAN DEFAULTS AND AND UH UH .
AND THAT EFFECTIVELY ADDS TO WHETHER IT S OFFICIALLY ON THE BOOKS OR NOT .
RIGHT .
EXACTLY .
UM .
AND THAT S GOT TO BE PAID .
EXACTLY AND AND UH SO THIS CREATES A PRETTY SERIOUS PROBLEM .
THAT S GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE WITH US FOR A WHILE TO COME .
UM I M NOT REALLY UH SURE THAT I EVEN UNDERSTAND WHY THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING FOR INSTANCE TAX REDUCTIONS BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF IF IF THEY RE TALKING ABOUT REDUCING UH THE TAX .
THAT NEEDS TO BE PAID OR THE TAX .
THAT S CURRENTLY BEING PAID THEN THAT CA NT IT SEEMS TO ME .
IT CA NT POSSIBLY YOU KNOW HELP WITH THE THE DEFICIT PICTURE .
IT CAN ONLY HURT THE DEFICIT PICTURE .
YEAH EXACTLY .
UM AND THE THE SEVERITY OF THE DEFICIT PICTURE ALREADY LIMITS THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE OR LIMITS THE DEGREE OF TAX CUTTING YOU CAN DO WITHOUT UH BRINGING ON ON SERIOUS PROBLEMS FOR THE LONGER TERM .
YEAH EXACTLY .
SO THAT THAT THAT S THE CURRENT PREDICAMENT .
YEAH IT .
SEE SEEMS LIKE IT S IT S A KIND OF A CATCH TWENTYTWO .
I MEAN IT S IT S THE UM MY UNDERSTANDING IS WHAT .
THEY RE TRY WHAT WHAT SUPPOSEDLY THEY RE TRYING TO DO BY REDUCING TAXES IS TO KIND OF JUMP START THE ECONOMY THE IDEA BEING THAT IF PEOPLE HAVE TO PAY LESS MONEY IN TAXES THEY LL HAVE MORE MONEY TO SPEND UH AND IF THEY HAVE MORE MONEY TO SPEND THEN THAT WILL BE A SPUR TO PRODUCTIVITY PARTICULARLY COMMERCIAL PRODUCTIVITY UH WHICH IN TURN WILL GENERATE REVENUE .
BUT IT IT SEEMS LIKE LIKE UH IT S SORT OF A UH A SP AN UNENDING SPIRAL AND IT IT IT UH I M I M NOT SURE THAT THERE S ANY REAL GENUINE TRUTH TO THE UH THE IDEA THAT THAT UH THAT DECREASING TAXES PARTICULARLY THE KINDS .
THAT ARE BEING RECOMMENDED BYEBYE THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION AND THINGS LIKE CAPITAL GAINS TAXES AND SO FORTH IS GOING TO UH RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF MONEY YOU KNOW FOR CONSUMERS TO SPEND .
AND UH .
YEAH I M NOT SURE HOW I FEEL ABOUT PAYING ON THE QUEST THE LONG TERM QUESTS THAT TAX CUTS ARE WORTH AT THIS POINT .
IT S PROBABLY A JUDGMENT OF HOW BAD THE RECESSION IS .
YEAH IT UH IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION COULD DO .
WELL WELL FIRST OF ALL .
YOU LOOK TO THE FED TO FIGHT THE RECESSION .
UHHUH .
AS INDEED IT HAS WITH INTEREST RATES .
UHHUH .
I THINK THAT S BEEN A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT .
I THINK WHAT .
THAT S DONE IS IT S IT S IT S HELP KEEP INFLATION FROM UM UH .
WELL AT THE MOMENT .
WE RE DOING VERY WELL ON INFLATION .
YEAH EXACTLY .
THAT S THE SORT OF UPSIDE TO THE DEFICIT .
IT S A SORT OF A PIECE OF LUCK .
THAT S THE UPSIDE TO THE RECESSION .
YEAH UM .
I DO NT KNOW WHAT KIND OF THINGS DO YOU THINK CAN BE DONE IN IN UH IN THE LONG TERM .
MUMBLEX WELL CAN BE DONE OR WILL BE DONE ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS .
UM AT VARIOUS PLACES TO LOOK FOR FOR CUTTING THE BUDGET FIRST OF ALL .
I CONSIDER MORE DEFENSE CUTS THAN ARE ALREADY PLANNED .
SURE .
DEPENDING ON THE WORLD SITUATION .
BUT THERE ARE VARIOUS OTHER AREAS SUCH AS AS FARM SUBSIDIES .
THAT OUGHT TO BE SLASHED .
UH A LOT OF ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS LIKE EDUCATION AID I THINK UH THEY SHOULD PUT A IN THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION TOOK ALL SUCH ENTITLEMENTS TO THE POOR .
UHHUH .
BUT LEFT THEM FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS UH IN THE LONGER TERM UH WE WE WE D DO WELL I THINK TO MAKE TO MAKE UH REDUCTIONS THERE .
ALSO SOMEWHAT MUMBLEX IS TO COLLECT OWED TO THE GOVERNMENT FROM VARIOUS LOAN PROGRAMS THAT PEOPLE HAVE BORROWED .
RIGHT .
I THINK THAT I THINK THAT THAT I AGREE WITH YOU CERTAINLY IN THE SECOND SITUATION AND I THINK CERTAIN ENTITLEMENTS I I M INCLINED TO AGREE WITH YOU TOO .
EDUCATION HAPPENS TO BE ONE PLACE WHERE I THINK THAT WE WOULD FOOLISH TO UM UH .
A LOT OF EDUCATION AID HAS GONE TO SOCALLED TRADE SCHOOLS .
UHHUH .
WHICH ARE SORT OF NOT COLLEGES BUT SCHOOLS .
THAT TEACH YOU TRADES YOU KNOW BEAUTICIAN .
OH I SEE I SEE WHAT .
YOU RE SAYING .
WELL AND OFTEN EXISTS ONLY BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL PROGRAMS THAT THEY CAN TAKE PEOPLE AND TELL THEM .
THEY CAN GET LOANS FOR THEIR FULL TUITION UH AND THE SCHOOL GETS PAID OFF IMMEDIATELY UH .
AND THEN THEY .
AND THEN THEY DO NT PROVIDE VERY MUCH EDUCATION .
AND THEN THE PEOPLE DEFAULT .
YES .
ON THE LOANS .
WELL I WOULD HAVE TO AGREE WITH YOU IF THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE THAT UH AROUND UH AND I I I CA NT CONFESS TO HAVING ANY SUBSTANTIAL KNOWLEDGE OF THAT SORT OF THING BUT BUT TAKING WHAT .
YOU RE SAYING AT FACE VALUE THEN I WOULD HAVE TO AGREE WITH COMPLETELY .
YEAH .
ABOUT THE WEATHER .
OH YES VERY APPROPRIATE I GUESS UH YOU READY FOR THIS .
YEAH .
OKAY JOHN JUST A MOMENT WELL GUESS WHAT WE GET TO TALK ABOUT THE WEATHER .
THE WEATHER IS UH THIS TIME OF YEAR HAS ACTUALLY BEEN KIND OF UNUSUAL I HAVE NT EXPECTED IT TO BE COLDER UNTIL YOU KNOW LIKE WE VE GOTTEN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS .

WELL IT SEEMS LIKE A BIG POLITICS GAME LIKE UP HERE LAST YEAR THE GOVERNOR WAS UP FOR REELECTION SO HE SAID THE BUDGET WAS FINE THE STATE DID NT HAVE ANY MONEY AND THEN RIGHT AFTER HE WON THE ELECTION .
HE SAID WE OWED A LOT OF MONEY SO THEY RAISED ALL OUR TAXES .
AND NOW IT .

WELL ACTUALLY THEY RE GOING TO HERE BECAUSE THEY DID NT HAVE A BUDGET FOR SO LONG SO THEY RAISED THE TAX RATE REAL HIGH FOR THE LAST THREE MONTHS OF THIS YEAR AND THEY RE GOING TO LOWER IT FOR NEXT YEAR .
OH .
I GUESS THEY FIGURE THEY RE GOING TO MAKE UP FOR ALL .
THEY DID NT GET WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD A BUDGET .
I HOPE THEY PUT THAT IN WRITING .
YEAH YEAH THEY SAY THEY RE GOING TO LOWER BUT I LL SEE .
I FEEL LIKE THE MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE ARE SUPPORTING THE NATION AND UH THAT THE RICH ARE NOT PAYING THEIR SHARE AND OF COURSE .
THE POOR CA NT AFFORD IT EITHER BUT UH I REALLY FEEL LIKE AND AND I FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW I M A MIDDLE CLASS PERSON INCOME WISE ANYWAY AND UH I GET TIRED OF SUPPORTING THE WHOLE COUNTRY .
YEAH SO DO I .
I MEAN I M A A MIDDLE CLASS BARELY BUT UH I DO NT THINK THE RICH ARE PAYING MO LESS NOT ENOUGH I THINK THEY RE PAYING TOO MUCH .
YOU THINK THE RICH ARE PAYING TOO MUCH .
YEAH I MEAN IF YOU RE IN THE THE THREE THREE PERCENT BRACKET AND THEY TAKE A THIRD OF YOUR CHECK .
EVERY MONTH WELL THAT S RIDICULOUS .
WHY BOTHER WORKING .
WELL I DO NT KNOW MANY RICH THAT DO NT HAVE ENOUGH TAX BREAKS TO I MEAN I M TALKING ABOUT THE REALLY RICH .
WELL THEY SHOULD JUST TAX EVERYBODY THE SAME AMOUNT .
NO MATTER .
WHAT .
YOU MAKE .
RIGHT .
THAT WOULD BE FAIR .
NOW I LL GO ALONG WITH THAT .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
NO LOOPHOLES OR ANYTHING .
EVERYBODY PAYS TEN PERCENT OR FIFTEEN OR WHATEVER .
RIGHT .
NOW I THINK THAT WOULD BE FAIR .
RIGHT .
AND I YOU KNOW NO NO IFS ANDS AND BUTS YOU KNOW NO BIG ELABORATE LAWS .
THAT SAY UH YOU KNOW CALL FOR A LOT OF ENFORCEMENT OR A LOT OF REVIEW .
IT S JUST YOU KNOW YOU MAKE THIS YOU PAY TEN PERCENT .
IF YOU MAKE A HUNDRED DOLLARS YOU PAY TEN PERCENT IF YOU MAKE A MILLION DOLLARS YOU PAY TEN PERCENT .
YEAH THAT S THE WAY OUR STATE TAX IS HERE .
I THINK IT S PRETTY FAIR .
OUR STATE TAXES ARE SOMEWHAT BASED ON THE FEDERAL .
UHHUH .
AND UH THEY HAVE NOT GOTTEN IT WHERE THE WITHHOLDING IS ACCURATE .
OH .
SO AND AND YOU WITHHOLD NO MATTER .
WHAT .
YOU DO THEY WITHHOLD WHAT .
THEY RE SUPPOSED TO AND AT THE END OF THE YEAR .
IT S NOT ENOUGH .
OH GREAT SO YOU OUGHT TO BE SAVING UP SOME .
EVERY MONTH TO MAKE UP FOR ALL .
WHAT .
THEY SHOULD BE TAKING OUT .
RIGHT SO NOW YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SIGN YOUR WFOUR FORM OR WHATEVER WTWO .
UHHUH .
WHATEVER .
THAT IS THEN THEY ALWAYS SAY DO YOU WANT A EXTRA AMOUNT FOR STATE .
WHICH IS RIDICULOUS BUT IT S BEEN THAT WAY FOR THE LAST PROBABLY TEN YEARS .
YEAH I GUESS YOU HAVE TO CHECK YES OR YOU COME DOWN TO THE END OF THE YEAR AND YOU DO NT HAVE IT TO GIVE IT TO THEM .
RIGHT UNLESS YOU HAVE A LOT OF DEDUCTIONS .
YEAH .
BUT YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF FEDERAL DEDUCTION IT ENDS UP HURTING YOU STATE WISE .
REALLY .
AND YOU END UP OWING YOU KNOW YOU MAY GET NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS BACK FROM FEDERAL AND YOU RE GOING TO OWE FIFTEEN HUNDRED IN STATE .
OUCH .
AND UH IT S IT S JUST RIDICULOUS .
BUT I I DO NT KNOW .
I VE THEY JUST CAME UP WITH A TWENTYFIVE PERCENT INCREASE ON PERSONAL PROPERTY IN IN OKLAHOMA COUNTY AND THAT IS A CHUNK .
YEAH I LL SAY .
I MEAN TWENTYFIVE PERCENT INCREASE .
Y IS .
OKAY WHAT KIND OF CAR ARE YOU GOING TO BUY NEXT .
WELL ONE OF THE CARS I M THINKING ABOUT BUYING NEXT IS UH A NICE SAFE SMALL CAR BUT UM UH THE REASON BEING IS WE JUST PURCHASED A VAN A LITTLE WHILE AGO BECAUSE WE HAVE .
UHHUH .
A BIG FAMILY AND WE USE THAT TO GET BACK AND FORTH AND HAUL KIDS AROUND AND .
UHHUH .
SO FORTH AND WE HAVE ANOTHER FOUR DOOR CAR THAT I DRIVE TO WORK AND I THINK IT D BE MORE ECONOMICAL IF I WERE ABLE TO MUMBLEX A SMALLER CAR .
UHHUH .
AND UH WOULD NT BE WOULD NT COST MUCH WITH GAS .
THAT S TRUE THAT S TRUE .
WHAT WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT .
WELL I M REALLY NOT LOOKING AT ANYTHING FOR A WHILE BUT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU RE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD YOU SEE ALL THESE PRETTY NEW ONES THAT ARE OUT AND YOU THINK OH WELL MAYBE MAYBE I WOULD LIKE A NEW CAR .
OH YEAH .
BUT I THINK I LL BE DRIVING MINE ABOUT TWO OR THREE MORE YEARS ANYWAY .
OH YES OH YES .
BUT UH .
WELL THE COST OF NEW CARS RECENTLY ARE EXTREMELY OUTRAGEOUS FOR THE .
RIGHT THEY ARE .
MUMBLEX .
I SURE DO LIKE THE LOOKS OF THAT NEW MIT MITSUBISHI DIAMANTE .
OH YES OH YES .
THAT IS A PRETTY CAR .
I M UH I REALLY LIKE THE LOOKS ALSO OF THE NEW MAZDA .
UHHUH THAT S PRETTY TOO .
THAT THEY HAVE BUT UM I UH YOU KNOW THE THE COSTS OF A NEW CAR AND THOSE NEW MODELS ARE EXTREMELY OUT OF OUR PRICE RANGE RIGHT NOW .
YEAH THEY GET PRETTY EXPENSIVE .
YES THEY DO .
THE LAST ONE I BOUGHT I BOUGHT A UH WELL IT S A IT S A TOWN CAR BUT IT WAS A DEMO RETURNED .
UHHUH .
AND I GOT IT WITH LIKE YOU KNOW I THINK IT WAS LIKE FOURTEEN THOUSAND MILES ON IT .
RIGHT .
AND NEARLY TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OF LESS THAN WHAT THE LIST PRICE WAS .
WELL YOU CA NT GO WRONG WITH THAT KIND OF OPPORTUNITY .
SO I WAS REALLY PLEASED TO FIND THAT AND I THEN I BOUGHT IT FOR CHEAPER I WAS LOOKING AT A HONDA ACCORD A BRAND NEW ONE .
YES .
AND I BOUGHT THIS UH THE THE LINCOLN TOWN CAR FOR JUST A LITTLE LESS MONEY THAN WHAT I WAS GOING TO BUY THE NEW HONDA ACCORD .
WOW WELL YOU GET A MUCH BIGGER BETTER .
AND THE THING ABOUT IT IS .
COMFORTABLE RIDE .
THEY GIVE YOU THAT TEN UH .
THAT HUNDRED THOUSAND MI MILE FIVE YEAR WARRANTY .
YES .
WHERE IT ONLY COSTS YOU TWENTYFIVE DOLLARS TO HAVE ANYTHING REPAIRED .
WELL THAT S FANTASTIC THAT S REAL REAL GOOD .
SO UH I HAVE REALLY BEEN IMPRESSED I SAID I PROBABLY NEVER BE ABLE .
TO FIND ANOTHER ONE THAT I CAN AFFORD YOU KNOW .
NO DO YOU .
BUT I HAVE LOVED THIS CAR BETTER THAN ANYTHING I VE EVER DRIVEN BECAUSE YOU CAN GO ON THE ROAD AND GET THERE AND YOU RE NOT EVEN TIRED .
VERY COMFORTABLE SMOOTH RIDE HUH .
AND IT GETS LIKE TWENTYSIX MILES TO THE GALLON ON THE ROAD .
OH IT DOES .
IT SURE DOES .
THAT S THAT S UNBELIEVABLE FOR THAT SIZE OF CAR .
I THEY KEPT TELLING ME THAT AND I THOUGHT THEY RE CRAZY .
SO THE WEEK AFTER I GOT IT WELL ACTUALLY BEFORE I SIGNED THE PAPERS ON IT I TOOK IT OVER TO BOOZIER CITY .
YES .
AND IT DID IT .
WOW THAT S GREAT .
BUT IT S UH .
THAT S GREAT THAT KIND OF GAS MILEAGE UH WE RE WE RE KIND OF HOPING FOR ON OUR VAN .
YEAH WELL THAT S KIND OF WHAT WE VE ALWAYS BEEN TOLD YOU KNOW THEY LL DO AND THEN WE HOPE FOR IT AND IT NEVER HAPPENS .
UHHUH .
BUT IT REALLY IT DOES GET GOOD GAS MILEAGE .
WELL THAT S EXCELLENT .
MOST OF THE TIME WHEN I DO NT GO ANYWHERE I CAN DRIVE IT FOR LIKE THREE WEEKS FROM TO AND FROM WORK YOU KNOW AND THEN FILL IT UP SO .
UHHUH DO YOU UH DO DOES IT UH NEED A LOT OF REPAIRS IS IT A VERY RELIABLE KIND OF CAR .
I HAVE NT HAD ANYTHING .
I VE TAKEN IT IN TWICE FOR LIKE JUST REALLY MINOR THINGS AND IT COST ME THE TWENTYFIVE DOLLARS THE UH REALLY SOMETHING REALLY SILLY WHEN WE FIRST GOT IT WE COULD NT GET THE LIGHT THEY HAVE ALL THESE LIGHTS IN THE CAR .
YES .
AND IT HAS THIS FANCY LITTLE LIGHT THAT GIVES YOU A READING LIGHT FOR THE PASSENGERS IN THE BACK SEAT .
YES .
AND WE COULD NT GET THE LIGHT TO TURN OFF .
UM .
AND WE KEPT TRYING YOU KNOW AND WE WENT OUT TO DINNER WITH SOME FRIENDS AND IT STAYED ON ALL NIGHT YOU KNOW .
OH DEAR .
JUST SHINING RIGHT DOWN ON THEM YOU KNOW .
OH DEAR .
AND WE COULD NT GET IT TO TURN OFF AND THE NEXT DAY MY HUSBAND GOES OUT THERE AND HE TRIES TO GET IT OFF WE TURN THE KNOB YOU KNOW IN THE FRONT THAT S SUPPOSED TO TURN THE .
UHHUH .
LIGHTS ON AND OFF AND .
UHHUH .
WE TURNED EVERYTHING WE COULD AND HE TOOK IT IN AND THEY SAID YOU KNOW YOU JUST HAVE TO PRESS THE SWITCH HE SAYS I VE PRESSED EVERY SWITCH IN THAT CAR AND I CA NT GET THE LIGHT OFF .
IT S BROKEN .
YES .
SO THEY TOOK IT IN AND CHARGED US THE TWENTYFIVE DOLLARS AND THEY CALLED AND TOLD US THOUGH THAT ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TURN THE OFF SWITCH AND THEY SHOWED US WHERE THE SWITCH WAS .
THEY CHARGED YOU TWENTYFIVE DOLLARS JUST TO TELL YOU THAT HUH .
THEY THEY THOUGHT THERE WAS REALLY SOMETHING WRONG WITH IT WHEN HE TOLD THEM HE HAD ALREADY DONE THE SWITCH .
UHHUH OH SO THEY PROBABLY WENT THROUGH THE .
BUT HE HAD NT HE HAD NT DONE THE RIGHT ONE .
I SEE .
AND IT S RIGHT ON THE ARM REST IN THE BACK .
UHHUH .
AND WE DID NT KNOW IT WAS THERE .
OH OKAY .
AND THE GUY HIT IT WITH HIS ARM WHEN HE GOT IN THE CAR .
AND FOUND IT RIGHT AWAY .
AND SO WE THOUGHT YOU KNOW THERE THERE WAS IT WAS BROKEN .
UHHUH .
BUT WE VE HAD JUST UH I GUESS IT S BEEN IN TWO TIMES I VE HAD IT THREE YEARS NOW .
YES .
AND UH IT S BEEN IN TWO MAYBE THREE TIMES BUT IT S JUST BEEN REAL MINOR THINGS .
WELL I THINK THAT UH YOU HAVE AN EXCELLENT DEAL THEN AND THE THE COMPANY IS ABLE PROBABLY TO OFFER THAT KIND OF WARRANTY ON THE CAR BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT S SO WELL BUILT THAT THEY DO NT EXPECT ANY KIND OF MAJOR REPAIRS .
THAT S RIGHT .
WHEREAS WITH AN AWFUL LOT OF OTHER LOWER QUALITY CARS YOU WOULD BE GETTING REPAIRS AFTER REPAIR AFTER REPAIR .
UHHUH .
AND THOSE COMPANIES WOULD NT BE ABLE TO AFFORD THAT FOR THAT KIND OF EXTENDED WARRANTY OR WARRANTY AT ALL SO .
THAT S RIGHT BUT IT S REALLY IT S BEEN AN ENJOYABLE CAR LIKE I SAY I LL PROBABLY NEVER BE ABLE TO HAVE ANOTHER ONE BECAUSE I THINK WE BOUGHT IT FOR ABOUT SIXTEEN THOUSAND YOU KNOW .
YES .
AND I SAID I LL NEVER FIND ANOTHER ONE FOR THAT PRICE .
NO NOT AT ALL .
AND THEY KEEP GOING UP SO I LL HAVE TO ENJOY IT .
ALL RIGHT SO UH YOU LIVE IN DALLAS .
YES I LIVE IN DALLAS .

SO TELL ME AB .
YEAH I VE ALWAYS UH BEEN PRETTY LUCKY THE REAL ESTATE OUT HERE S BEEN PRETTY GOOD IT UH THE THE PRICES OF WELL THE PRICES CAME DOWN LAST YEAR WE VE WE HAD SORT OF LIKE A DALLAS SYNDROME .
YEAH .
THE PAST UH UH YEAR AND A HALF PRICES HAVE GONE DOWN WHICH IS TOTALLY NEW FOR NORTHERN VIRGINIA .
UHHUH IT JUST .
IT JUST NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE .
IT S A REAL GOOD .
SO IT S REALLY SURPRISING EVERYBODY ALL THE DEVELOPERS DO NT KNOW WHAT TO DO .
YEAH IT S A GOOD TIME TO BUY .
YEAH .
IF YOU RE IN THE MARKET .
UNFORTUNATE WE RE UH WE ACTUALLY HAVE OUR HOUSE ON THE MARKET BECAUSE WE HAVE TWO KIDS .
UHHUH .
AND WE HAVE A THREE BEDROOM HOUSE AND IT S PRETTY MUCH FILLED UP RIGHT NOW .
OH SO YOU WANT A BIGGER ONE .
YEAH UHHUH GET AN EXTRA BEDROOM OR A BASEMENT RIGHT NOW IT S JUST A A SINGLE LEVEL RAMBLER .
UHHUH ONE THING ABOUT THE HOUSES IN UH IN DALLAS THEY DO NT UH UTILIZE BASEMENTS THE WAY THEY DID IN NEW YORK .
MY PARENTS IN NEW YORK HAD UH A UH THREE FAMILY HOUSE .
UHHUH .
ACTUAL MUMBLEX A .
TWO FAMILY HOUSE WHERE THE THE UM THE DOWNSTAIRS AND THE SECOND FLOOR THEY HAD AND THEN THEY RENTED THE THIRD FLOOR WITH THE WHOLE APARTMENT YOU KNOW .
OH .
AND UH THEY HAD A BASEMENT .
AND THEY YOU KNOW THEY FINISHED THE BASEMENT AND THEY WERE ABLE TO RENT THAT OUT ALSO BUT UH IN DALLAS I I JUST I JUST HAVE NT SEEN BASEMENTS IN HOUSES .
YEAH YEAH .
AND I VE LOOKED AT A LOT OF THEM YOU KNOW .
YEAH A FRIEND OF MINE WAS THINKING ABOUT COMING DOWN THERE AND THAT S WHAT HE SAID WAS THAT YOU KNOW IT JUST WAS NT SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE HAD DOWN THERE .
NO IT S A .
THEY PUT POOLS AND GARAGES ON .
RIGHT .
BUT UH NO BASEMENTS .
I HAVE NT I HAVE NT I HAVE YET TO SEE A BASEMENT IN A HOUSE .
HUH .
AND UH .
MAYBE IT S ALL THE SAND IS THERE A LOT OF SAND IN I ALWAYS THINK IT S LIKE A DESERT I DO NT KNOW MUMBLEX DALLAS ALWAYS .
WELL NO NO NO NO YOU KNOW I DO NT SEE THAT KIND OF SAND HERE UM THERE ARE SOME AREAS THOUGH WHERE WHERE THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH UH THE HOUSES KIND OF SINKING A LITTLE BIT .
UHHUH .
INTO THE TO THE UH OR THE FOUNDATION IS SINKING OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW JUST A LITTLE JUST A LITTLE BIT SOME MORE THAN OTHERS BUT YOU YOU HAVE TO KNOW THE RIGHT SPOT .
TO TO PICK WHERE THAT DOES NT HAPPEN .
YEAH .
AND UH .
WELL OUT HERE WE UM WE LIVE IN WHAT USED TO BE UH LIKE A PRAIRIE OR WHATEVER A NATURAL YOU KNOW NATURAL GRASSLANDS .
UHHUH .
AND UH THEY IT S JUST YOU GO DOWN FOUR INCHES AND YOU GET TO SANDS WELL FOURTEEN INCHES YOU GET TO SANDSTONE .
YEAH .
AND SO ANY PLACE WHERE THEY PUT A BASEMENT IN THEY HAD TO BLAST .
I SEE .
IT S JUST SOLID SANDSTONE .
HUH WHERE DID YOU SAY YOU RE AT COLORADO .
NO VIRGINIA .
VIRGINIA VIRGINIA THAT S RIGHT .
YEAH IT S SORT OF UNUSUAL REALLY MOST OF VIRGINIA IS CLAY .
ANYWHERE NEAR UH VIRGINIA BEACH .
OH YEAH UHHUH YEAH MY UH MY FOLKS USED TO LIVE THERE BACK BEFORE I WAS BORN .
OH .
THEY LIVED THERE .
UHHUH WELL DIFFERENT AREAS IN DALLAS HAVE DIFFERENT KIND IN UH IN TEXAS I LL SAY BECAUSE DOWN IN EAST TEXAS THERE S A LOT OF RED CLAY .
UHHUH .
AND UH IN THE IN THE DALLAS YOU KNOW FORT WORTH CITY AREAS YOU DO NT SEE THAT .
YEAH WELL UH TEXAS IS A BIG STATE SO I IMAGINE THE THE TYPE OF HOUSES AND UH THINGS LIKE THAT ARE TRULY DIFFERENT FROM AREA TO AREA .
YEAH WELL .
BUT UH THAT S THE SAME WAY OUT HERE BECAUSE UM WELL WE FOR EXAMPLE AND WE LIVE FIFTEEN MILES FROM THE BELTWAY THAT SURROUNDS WASHINGTON .
UHHUH .
AND ANYTHING INSTEAD THAT BELTWAY THE HIGHWAY THE REAL ESTATE S FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE EXPENSIVE .
YEAH .
SO YOU KNOW YOU REALLY CA NT AFFORD I I I COULD NEVER AFFORD A HOUSE INSIDE THE BELTWAY THAT S WHY WE CAME OUT HERE THIS IS CALLED THE THE THE COUNTRY YOU KNOW WITH ONLY YOU KNOW MAYBE TWENTY MILES TOTAL FROM D C TWENTYFIVE .
HUH .
FROM THE CITY BUT UM IT S CONSIDERED THE COUNTRY SINCE IT S UH YOU KNOW THAT FAR OUT .
WELL MUMBLEX .
BUT UM YEAH WE LIVE OUT BY DULLES AIRPORT .
I SEE .
YEAH AND UH THAT S ONE OF THE FEW PLACES STILL IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA THEY HAVE TRAILER PARKS THAT ARE DOWN AROUND THE CORNER FROM HERE AND YOU KNOW IT S IT S STILL PRETTY RURAL .
UHHUH .
UH NOT TOO MUCH OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA IS LIKE THAT ANYMORE LAND HAS GOTTEN SO EXPENSIVE THEY JUST CA NT AFFORD TO HAVE LOW INCOME HOUSING LIKE THAT .
SO IS YOUR HOUSE IN AN AREA BY ITSELF I MEAN .
NO WE RE IN A DEVELOPMENT .
IT S NOT CONNECTED TO ANOTHER ONE .
THERE S UH YEAH THERE S ANOTHER ONE HALF AN ACRE AWAY .
OH .
OR A QUARTER ACRE AWAY RATHER .
BUT IT S NOT THEY RE NOT CONNECTED ARE THEY .
OH NO HUHUH YOU HAVE TO UH STAY IN ONE SINGLE FAMILY HOME I SORT OF GOT SPOILED WITH THAT WHEN I WAS GROWING UP .
YEAH .
UH MY FOLKS UM HAD AN APARTMENT FOR A WHILE WHEN WE WERE KIDS BUT UM FOR THE MOST PART I THEY THEY ALWAYS HAD YOU KNOW AND PENNSYLVANIA ALWAYS HAD A SINGLE FAMILY HOME AND SO .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AS SOON AS WE COULD WE WE GOT A SINGLE FAMILY HOME AND THAT S ALL I EVER KNEW GROWING UP .
UHHUH .
SO I STAYED IN A TOWNHOUSE FOR UH TWO YEARS AND THEN UH SAVED UP ENOUGH MONEY TO TO GET A .
I UH SPENT FOUR YEARS AS A UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR .
OH .
AND .
REALLY .
YEAH .
I I SPENT THREE YEARS I M TEACHING IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOL .
OH DO YOU REALLY .
UHHUH .
THAT S GREAT .
I TAUGHT IN UTAH AND UH .
NO KIDDING .
DID YOU .
W .
TEACH IN CALIFORNIA .
I DID .
UHHUH .
I DID UH .
YOU SOUND PRETTY YOUNG FOR A UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR .
WELL I WAS PRETTY YOUNG .
I WAS UH I HAD NEVER INTENDED TO DO IT AND I WAS UH UH GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY AFTER I D STARTED A MANAGEMENT CONSULTING FIRM TO TEACH IN IN UH UH ONE OF THE BUSINESS SCHOOLS IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM .
UHHUH .
AT ANY RATE UH THE TOPIC IS FASCINATING BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS I VE DONE FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS IS UH RESEARCH .
THE PROBLEM FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF UH UH WHAT APPEARS TO BE WORKING BEST AND HOW YOU CAN EXPLAIN IT THEORETICALLY .
UHHUH .
YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH COOPERATIVE LEARNING .
HAVE YOU EVER .
WELL YOU CAN YOU CAN TELL ME .
A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT IT BECAUSE I DO NT THINK WE DID THAT IN UTAH .
WELL THE COOPERATIVE LEARNING IS A TECHNIQUE .
THAT WAS TRIED INITIALLY TO INTEGRATE THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS .
AND UH WHAT WHAT .
IT INVOLVES BASICALLY IS THE USE OF PEER GROUPS AND THE UH TEACHER BECOMES A UH A SORT OF A CONSULTANT RESOURCE PERSON .
UHHUH .
TO THE COOPERATIVE LEARNING UH TO THE LEARNING COOPERATIVES I GUESS THEY RE CALLED .
AND THERE ARE UH SOME FAIRLY SOPHISTICATED APPROACHES .
THAT ARE USED IN THE HIGH SCHOOLS WITH POINT SYSTEMS AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO THAT PEOPLE UH GAIN A COMPETENCE WITH RESPECT TO THE MATERIAL .
UHHUH .
UH I THINK THAT THE COMBINATION OF UH TECHNOLOGY AND TECHNIQUES LIKE THAT TOGETHER WITH MARKETPLACE FORCES WILL BRING ABOUT A REVOLUTION IN THE WAY .
WE LEARN .
UH I THINK THERE IS A DIRECT THREAT TO VESTED INTEREST IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM UH THAT WILL STAND IN THE WAY OF THAT PROGRESS BEING A LITTLE FASTER .
UH SCHOOL SYSTEMS ARE IN TOO MANY STATES DOMINATED BY ADMINISTRATORS .
UHHUH YEAH .
AND UH BOTH .
TEACHERS AND PARENTS UH COMPLAIN ABOUT THE UH UH THE COST AND INEFFECTIVENESS THAT RESULTS .
SO MY FEELING IS THAT UH THE THE PROBLEM IS IS UH SIGNIFICANT .
THERE ARE PLENTY OF GOOD PEOPLE UH AVAILABLE TO UH OFFER PEOPLE EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE BUT THAT WE JUST HAVE TO RE REALLOCATE AND REORGANIZE THE RESOURCES TO DO IT AND UH I THINK CERTAIN TECHNIQUES AND TECHNOLOGIES WILL INFLUENCE ALL OF THAT AS WELL AS RESEARCH UH UH OF THE SORT THAT PEOPLE LIKE ME DO LOOKING AT THEORIES OF BEHAVIOR AND HOW THEY CAN BE USED TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE PARTICULARLY UH ACCELERATE THE THE PACE OF LEARNING .
UHHUH .
AND MY FEELING IS THAT UH THOSE KINDS OF THINGS WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM EVENTUALLY .
I DO NT KNOW WHAT FORM .
IT WILL ULTIMATELY TAKE .
UH UH BUT I THINK THAT THE FUTURE IS PRETTY BRIGHT BECAUSE PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THAT WE RE PAYING AN ENORMOUS PRICE FOR UH INFERIOR QUALITY WHEN THE PEOPLE INVOLVED REALLY ARE NT INFERIOR SO IT MUST BE THE WAY .
WE RE MANAGING THE PROCESS THAT UH .
YEAH I SEE WHAT YEAR SAYING YEAH I TOTALLY AGREE .
I I DO NT I DO NT THINK IT S IT S A MATTER OF OF UH TALENTED PEOPLE TO DO IT A BOTH AS QUOTE UNQUOTE STUDENTS AND AS TEACHERS BUT CLEARLY WHAT S HAPPENED IN THIS COUNTRY IS THE SCHOOL SYSTEM S BEEN ASKED TO ASSUME A GREAT MANY RESPONSIBILITIES .
OH YEAH .
IN THE PAST THIRTY YEARS .
UHHUH .
THAT WERE NT EXISTENT UH YOU MUST SEE KIDS WITH REAL SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS UH IN SOME CASES .
UH COURSE I ALWAYS SEE THE I DO NT KNOW HOW HARD HOW HARD IS IT UH IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM IN IOWA CITY .
IS IT IS IT UH DETERIORATED A LOT .
DO THE PEOPLE SAY ARE THEY PRETTY HAPPY WITH IT OR .
WELL I I HAVE NT TAUGHT IN IOWA BUT I VE TAUGHT IN UTAH AND UH PEOPLE THERE WERE SAYING THAT THE WAY THAT THE SCHOOLS WERE GOING A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE GOING AWAY AND GOING TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS OR ELSE GOING TO HOME WHERE THEY TAUGHT THEIR KIDS AT HOME .
RIGHT .
OR YOU KNOW ANYTHING BUT THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND THE ONES .
THAT DID HAVE YOU KNOW THE KIDS .
EVEN IN UTAH .
YEAH WELL .
WELL UTAH S A PLACE WHERE YOU WOULD NT THINK THAT PROBLEM WOULD BE VERY SEVERE .
WELL UH MAYBE IT WAS THE AREA .
I WAS IN BUT A LOT OF SCHOOLS HAD A LOT OF TRANSIENT UH FAMILIES AND A LOT OF FAMILIES .
WHO WERE ON THE POORER SIDE AND .
YEAH YOU SO YOU SAW A FAIR NUMBER OF TROUBLED KIDS .
YEAH I MEAN LIKE YOU SAID HOW THEY WERE THE SCHOOLS ARE DOING MORE THINGS FOR THE KIDS THEY THOUGHT THAN THEY WERE THIRTY YEARS AGO .
I MEAN THEY WERE THE SCHOOL .

I HAVE GRANDCHILDREN BUT UH HAVE NT REALLY BEEN INTO SELECTING CHILD CARE FOR THEM SO .
OH .
AND IT S BEEN QUITE A FEW YEARS SINCE I VE HAD TO THINK ABOUT THAT .
DO THEY GO TO A DAYCARE CENTER OR DO THEY STAY AT .
NO .
UH M MY DAUGHTER .
THAT HAS THREE STAYS HOME .
OH THAT S NICE .
WITH HER CHILDREN AND ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS HAS ONE BUT AN AUNT KEEPS THE BABY .
OH THAT S NICE .
BUT I WOULD I WOULD NOT REALLY KNOW HOW TO GO ABOUT SELECTING ONE NOWADAYS BUT I WOULD IMAGINE IT S VERY HARD .
I I THINK SO .
I THINK IT S HARD TO FIND A GOOD DAY CARE .
I HAVE WORKED IN ANOTH AT SOME OTHER ONES .
THAT WERE NOT VERY GOOD .
UHHUH .
IN MY OPINION .
BUT THIS .
ONE THAT I M IN NOW IS IS VERY GOOD .
AND ONE OF THE KEY THINGS IS HOW MANY ADULTS ARE THERE IN RATIO TO THE CHILDREN .
UHHUH .
AND LIKE IN PENNSYLVANIA FOR BABIES THAT S WHAT .
I WORK WITH THERE HAS TO BE A ONE TO FOUR RATIO AT THE MOST .
UHHUH .
NO MORE THAN FOUR BABIES PER CARE GIVER .
BUT WE KEEP IT DOWN TO LIKE TWO TO ONE .
OH WELL THAT S GOOD .
YEAH THAT MAKES IT .
A LITTLE EASIER TO DEAL WITH .
I VE ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU KNOW IT WOULD BE REALLY TOUGH .
WHAT IF YOU HAD A FIRE OR SOMETHING WITH BABIES .
OH I KNOW .
WE .
YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ENOUGH YOU KNOW YOU D HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GET THEM .
ALL OUT .
WHAT .
WE DO IS WE HAVE THESE CRIBS IN THE BACK ROOM .
UHHUH .
WHERE THEY SLEEP THAT ARE UM LOW TO THE GROUND AND THEY RE REENFORCED REAL STRONG AND THEY LL SIT FOUR BABIES .
WE WOULD JUST LIE THEM IN THERE AND THEY ROLL REAL WELL AND MANEUVER .
OH WELL THAT S THAT S A .
THAT WILL GET THEM OUT .
I HAD NT THOUGHT ABOUT THAT .
BUT I WAS THINKING OH MY GOSH IF THEY HAD VERY MANY BABIES THEY COULD NT POSSIBLY GET THEM .
ALL OUT .
NO .
BUT YOU COULD PUT THEM IN ONE OF THESE CRIBS AND THEN ROLL THE CRIB OUT I GUESS .
RIGHT .
OH .
RIGHT .
WELL THAT S NEAT .
YEAH THAT S CERTAINLY SOMETHING .
WE HOPE NEVER HAPPENS .
WELL DO MOST OF YOUR DAYCARE WORKERS REALLY CARE ABOUT THE CHILDREN OR IS IT JUST A JOB FOR THEM .
MOST REALLY CARE IN THIS CENTER REALLY CARE .
UH MOST EVERYONE HAS A COLLEGE DEGREE IN LIKE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION .
UHHUH .
AND REALLY THERE S ONLY LIKE EIGHT CHILDREN PER ROOM AND THEN THERE .
S LIKE TWO OR THREE MOSTLY THREE CARE GIVERS IN EACH ROOM .
UHHUH .
AND THAT ENABLES THEM TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH THE CHILDREN .
SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE ALL .
I M DOING IS CHANGING DIAPERS GIVING BOTTLES AND PUTTING BABIES DOWN FOR A NAP .
SO IT S NICE TO BE ABLE TO PLAY WITH THEM AND REALLY GET TO KNOW THEM .
UHHUH .
IT S EASY TO GET ATTACHED TO THEM TOO .
YEAH .
HOW OLD A GROUP HOW OLD ARE THE CHILDREN GO WITH THIS CENTER WHERE YOU WORK .
UM IN MY ROOM .
THEY GO FROM EIGHT WEEKS TO NINE MONTHS .
UHHUH .
AND THROUGHOUT THE CENTER .
IT GOES UP TO LIKE AGE TWELVE .
UHHUH .
SO I HAVE THE REAL REAL YOUNG ONES IN MY ROOM .
YOU VE GOT THE LITTLE BITTY ONES .
UHHUH .
THOSE ARE THE PROBABLY THE BESTES THE BEST GROUP TO HAVE .
THEY RE YOU KNOW THEY RE WONDERFUL .
THEY DO NT COMPLAIN TOO MUCH .
AND THEY RE FUN .
YES .
THEY ARE A LOT OF FUN .
BABIES ARE FUN AND THEY RE NOT QUITE BIG ENOUGH TO BE GETTING INTO EVERYTHING YET SO .
NOT QUITE .
IT S A WHEN THEY START TO CRAWL THEY TRY TO CLIMB UP ON THINGS AND .
UHHUH .
YOU HAVE TO BE REAL CAREFUL ALL THE EVERYTHING IS BABY PROOF .
YOU KNOW ALL THE DOORS HAVE LATCHES AND STUFF SO THEY CA NT GET INTO ANYTHING BUT THEY TRY .
UHHUH .
DO YOU .
BUT YEAH .
THINK THERE S VERY MANY REALLY GOOD DAYCARE CENTERS AROUND YOUR AREA .
IN MY AREA BECAUSE W I LIVE IN A COLLEGE TOWN IN PENN STATE UNIVERSITY .
UHHUH .
SO I THERE IS A LOT OF A LOT OF COLLEGE EDUCATED PEOPLE AND STUFF .
THAT ARE IN THE CENTERS .
THAT REALLY SEEM TO HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT S GOING ON .
UHHUH .
AND UH IN GENERAL THOUGH I VE I VE BEEN REALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH A LOT .
UHHUH .
OF OTHER CENTERS I VE WORKED AT AND IT ALL AND ALL IT S NOT MY CHOICE FOR WHEN WHEN I HAVE CHILDREN BUT BUT SOME PEOPLE DO NT HAVE A CHOICE .
SOMETIMES IT S A HAVE TO .
YES .
I HEAR A LOT OF THE GIRLS I WORK WITH UH CONSTANTLY OH I WISH I COULD FIND SOMEPLACE .
I REALLY FELT GOOD ABOUT .
YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
MOST OF THEM DO NT REALLY FEEL THAT IT S A GREAT PLACE TO LEAVE THEIR KIDS .
THAT IS SAD .
AND IT S REALLY BAD YOU KNOW .
ONE OF THE GIRLS .
SHE WAS LEAVING HERS AT WHERE SHE FELT LIKE WAS A REALLY GOOD PLACE AND THEN THEY CALLED HER .
ONE AFTERNOON AND SAID WELL WE THOUGHT WE D BETTER CALL AND TELL YOU BEFORE YOU GOT OVER HERE .
LACY FELL ASLEEP ON THE BUS AFTER OUR FIELD TRIP TODAY AND WE JUST NOW FOUND HER .
WHAT .
THEY HAD LEFT HER ON THE BUS CLOSED UP ALL AFTERNOON .
OH MY GOD .
AND SO IMMEDIATELY SHE SAYS WELL I CA NT HAVE ANY CONFIDENCE IN THEM ANYMORE IF THEY LL TAKE A GROUP OF KIDS TO THE ZOO OR SOMEWHERE AND THEN COME BACK AND NOT EVEN COUNT THEM AND REALIZE THEY RE ONE SHORT .
OH .
BUT ONE OF THE TEACHERS HAPPENED TO WALK BY AND SEE HER POUNDING ON THE WINDOW TRYING TO GET OUT OF THE BUS .
OH MY GOD .
AND THIS WAS FOUR HOURS LATER YOU KNOW .
OH THAT POOR CHILD .
AND UH SO YOU KNOW I WHAT DO YOU DO .
THAT S AWFUL .
SO SHE HAS SWITCHED TO A DIFFERENT CENTER NOW AND UH .
WELL I .

UHHUH .
AND FROM THAT EXTRACT THE NUMBERS THAT HAVE APPEARED THE MOST .
RIGHT .
I HAVE ANOTHER PROGRAM IN WHICH I CAN LOOK AT THE CYCLICAL UH APPEARANCE OF THESE NUMBERS .
UHHUH .
TO SEE IF THERE S ANYTHING THAT S CONSISTENT ON THAT I HAVE ANOTHER NUMBER THAT ALLOWS ME ANOTHER PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS ME TO ADD ALL THE NUMBERS I WANT AND THEN IT GENERATES A COMPLETE SET OF NUMBERS SO THAT ALL COMBINATIONS ARE COVERED .
UHHUH .
SO THIS IS WHAT I DO MOST OF THE TIME UH .

SO THAT S RIGHT .
THERE S WAS TWINS THERE OR YOU KNOW .

WHAT DO YOU THINK GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE RANGERS .

WHEN WE MOVED DOWN UH I WAS ABLE TO GO TO MY FIRST YOU KNOW BASEBALL GAME AND .
UHHUH .
THOUGHT THIS IS GREAT THIS IS INCREDIBLE .
SO I BECAME A RANGERS FAN .
I DID NT REALLY HAVE ONE IN SOUTH DAKOTA .

UHHUH .
AND UH IT WAS JUST EXCITING YOU KNOW YOU CAN WATCH BASEBALL ON T V AND THEY HIT THE LONG BALL AND IT LOOKS LIKE WOW THEY REALLY HIT THAT BALL .

AND AND THEY LL WEAR THEM .
YES EXACTLY .
ONCE THEY GET OLD ENOUGH TO TALK THEN THEY NO LONGER WILL WEAR THEM .

HOW DO YOU USUALLY FIND A A NEW RESTAURANT .
UH WELL MY HUSBAND S KIND OF THE ETH HE HE S THE ETHNIC FAN .

WE HAVE FOUND UH A NUMBER OF RESTAURANTS EITHER THROUGH D AND THE .
FRIDAY PAPER AND SOMETIMES THE THE OBSERVER .

YEAH .
YOU KNOW I DO NT WANT TO SEE THEM BAN GUNS COMPLETELY BUT I DO NT WANT THEM TO COMPLETELY TURN LOOSE OF THEIR CONTROLS EITHER SO .
YEAH .
WELL I I FEEL THAT ITS UH I THINK THE .
WHAT WAS NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION UH HAD THIS BUMPER STICKER .
A FEW YEARS BACK IF UH ABOUT IF YOU OUTLAW GUNS ONLY OUTLAWS WILL HAVE GUNS THEN .
I BELIEVE THAT .
AND I BELIEVE THAT TOO BECAUSE THE PERSON .
THAT IS WANTING TO .
COMMIT A CRIME IS GOING TO FIND A WAY TO GET A GUM A GU A GUN A KNIFE A A ROCK .
YEAH .
A STICK WHATEVER .
IT IS TO COMMIT A CRIME WITH .
YEAH .
AND IT S THE HONEST CITIZENS LIKE OURSELVES .
THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE ABOUT USE OF GUNS UH WE CAN HANDLE IT BUT THERE S AN ELEMENT .
THAT CA NT .
YEAH AND IT S YOU KNOW IT S GOT TO THE POINT NOW WHERE EVEN OUR OUR POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND OUR D E .
A AGENTS AND EVERYTHING HAVE TO CARRY AUTOMATIC WEAPONS BECAUSE EVERYBODY .
THAT S IN DRUG TRAFET TRAFFICKING HAS GOT THEM .
THEY HAVE GOT THEM OUTGUNNED .
YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
SO .
THERE WAS A .
AN ARTICLE IN THE PAPER JUST THIS WEEK WHERE I THINK IT S UH ONE OF THE GUN COMPANIES I CA NT REMEMBER WHICH WAS DEVELOPING A TEN METAL TEN MILLIMETER AUTOMATIC PISTOL FOR THE F B I .
UM .
WHICH WOULD GIVE THEM ADDITIONAL FIREPOWER .
IT HAD HELD LIKE A FIFTEEN SHOT CLIP .
YEAH .
WHICH UH WOULD BE ABLE TH THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO PUT DOWN ANYTHING .
THAT CAME AT THEM .
YEAH THAT WOULD BE .
BUT YOU FIGURE YOU GOT SOME DRUG GUY OUT THERE .
THAT S GOT AN UZI MACHINE GUN UH .
YEAH THAT S .
A THIRTYEIGHT UH SMITH AND WESSON REVOLVER IS NT GOING TO DO YOU MUCH GOOD .
NO IT S SURE NOT .
HUHUH .
YEAH .
I HAVE LIVED IN UH ILLINOIS AT ONE TIME AND THEY THEY PASSED A UH IT WAS NT REALLY GUN CONTROL BUT IT WAS YOU HAD TO REGISTER AS A GUN OWNER YOU DID NT HAVE TO LIST YOUR GUNS .
YEAH .
BUT YOU HAD TO HAVE THIS CARD IT WAS LIKE A DRIVER S LICENSE CARD THAT YOU HAD TO HAVE IT IN ORDER TO BUY AMMUNITION .
UM .
AND THAT WAS THE FIRST UH THIS WAS TWENTY YEARS AGO .
YEAH .
BUT THEY HAD THAT SO THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO CONTROL IT .
A LITTLE BIT IN THAT RESPECT .
SEE IN CALIFORNIA THEY .
PARDON .
IN CALIFORNIA THEY MAKE YOU REGISTER WHEN YOU BUY AMMUNITION .
YEAH .
UHHUH .
YOU HAVE TO SIGN A YOU KNOW THEY TAKE YOUR NAME AND DRIVER S LICENSE NUMBER HUNTER HUNTING LICENSE NUMBER AND ALL THAT GOOD STUFF .
YEAH .
BEFORE YOU CAN BUY ANY BIG AMMUNITION .
YEAH .
ESPECIALLY FOR HANDGUNS .
YEAH .
NOW RIFLES ARE NT TOO BAD BUT YOU KNOW ANY KIND OF HANDGUN AT ALL .
IF IT WILL FIT IN A HANDGUN AND A RIFLE .
YOU WOULD STILL HAVE TO BUY IT .
YEAH .
OR SIGN UP FOR IT SO .
WE LIVED IN TENNESSEE FOR AWHILE AND I BOUGHT A PISTOL THERE AND THERE WAS A FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD .
YOU HAD TO FILL OUT AN APPLICATION AND .
UHHUH .
GO DOWN TO THE SHERIFF S OFFICE AND GET FINGERPRINTED AND .
GEE .
THEN YOU HAD FIFTEEN DAYS WHILE THEY CHECKED TO SEE IF YOU HAD ANY KIND OF CRIMINAL RECORD BEFORE THAT YOU COULD PICK UP THE GUN .
YOU WERE PURCHASING .
GEE THAT S NOT A BAD IDEA .
NO I THINK THAT UH YOU KNOW A A WAITING PERIOD UH .
YEAH .
CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE BUT AGAIN IT S GOING TO BE THE LAW ABIDING CITIZEN .
THAT S GOING TO COMPLY WITH THAT .
YEAH YEAH IT IS .
SO THERE S I DO NT .
NO .
THINK THERE S ANY WAY TO CONTROL THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT AS FAR AS GUNS IS CONCERNED BECAUSE .
TH THE ONLY WAY .
THEY COULD DO IT .
I THINK WOULD BE TO STIFFEN THE PENALTIES ON ANYBODY USING A GUN .
RIGHT RIGHT .
YOU KNOW I THINK IF WE .
KIND OF STIFFEN THEM UP A LITTLE BIT COURSE I I I FEEL KIND OF WEIRD ABOUT THAT ANYWAY I THINK IF SOMEBODY SHOOTS SOMEBODY THEY OUGHT TO BE SHOT .
YEAH I M .
SO .
WE WE RE GETTING INTO CAPITAL PUNISHMENT NOW .
YEAH BUT YOU KNOW .
BUT I I AGREE WITH YOU .
THERE .
THAT UH .
IT WOULD DEFINITELY BE GUN CONTROL .
YEAH .
THE UH THE AGAIN THE PURPOSE OF GUN CONTROL IS TO CONTROL HOW IT IS BEING USED .
YEAH .
IS WHAT .
THE PURPOSE SHOULD BE .
YEAH .
IT S NOT TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM BUYING A GUN .
THAT NEED ONE FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE LEGAL PURPOSE .
YEAH .
BUT TO KEEP THE GUY .
THAT S ILLEGAL FROM GETTING HIS HANDS ON ONE .
YEAH .
AND I M IN FAVOR OF KEEPING THE THE ILLEGAL GUY FROM GETTING ONE IN HIS HANDS BUT .
MYSELF .
THE LEGAL PERSON OR LAWFUL PERSON SHOULD NOT BE PENALIZED BECAUSE THERE IS THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT .
YEAH .
WELL AND THE THEY RE ACTUALLY A NECESSITY IN LIFE YOU KNOW .
OH YES .
THEY RE NOT YOU KNOW NOT EVERYBODY NEEDS A GUN BUT SOONER OR LATER I NEED ONE .
YOU KNOW WHETHER I M OUT HUNTING OR YOU KNOW I M NEVER HAD TO PROTECT MY LIFE OR .
YEAH .
WELL I DID IN THE SERVICE BUT NOT YOU KNOW NOT ON THE STREET SO I DO NT REALLY NEED ONE IN THE IN THE ASPECTS .
YOU DO NT HAVE TO CARRY ONE IN YOUR CAR OR YOUR UH .

OR YOUR POCKET .
ALL THE TIME .

I DO NT AND I ENJOYED MY GUNS .
YEAH .
I HAVE A GOOD TIME WITH THEM SO .
WELL I KNOW WHAT UH I TOOK MY KIDS OUT AND TAUGHT THEM OUT HOW TO SHOOT A GUN .
MY WIFE .
THE SAME THING UH SHE KNOWS HOW TO SHOOT ANY WEAPON THAT WE HAVE NO NOT THAT I HAVE AN ARSENAL OR ANYTHING .
YEAH .
BUT WE HAVE SEVERAL GUNS AROUND THE HOUSE ONE OF THESE DAYS MY GRANDKIDS PROBABLY .
PROBABLY .
YEAH .
BUT I THINK IT S UH YOU GOT TO HAVE HAVE THE PL LIVING IN DALLAS THERE S NOT THAT MANY PLACES TO GO SHOOT BUT .
NO HUHUH .
UH STILL I THINK THEY OUGHT TO KNOW HOW TO USE ONE AND THAT IT S NOT JUST A TOY AND THAT WHEN IT S NOT LIKE ON T V WHEN SOMEONE GETS SHOT UH THEY GET BACK UP .
IF SOMEONE GETS SHOT WITH A .
YEAH .
REAL GUN .
THEY DO NT GET BACK UP .
YEAH .
I HAD TO EXPLAIN THAT TO MY I VE GOT A SIX YEAR OLD NOW AND HE YOU KNOW I HAVE A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD AND A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD WELL THEY UNDERSTAND NOW .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW I VE TAKEN TIME TO TEACH THEM AND NOW THE YOUNG BOY WANTS TO KNOW AND YOU KNOW LIKE I TOLD HIM YOU RE A LITTLE BIT YOUNG FOR A GUN .
LET ME GO OUT HERE AND YOU KNOW WE WOULD START WITH THE B B GUN DEAL YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
SO HE STARTED WITH THE B B GUN AND SHOT A COUPLE OF HOLES IN A COUPLE OF WINDOWS AND I TOOK IT AWAY FROM HIM I SAID NOW .
YOU KNOW SO HE S LEARNING THE HARD WAY BUT AT LEAST .
IT WAS A B B GUN NOT A TWENTYTWO OR A FOUR TEN OR SOMETHING SO .
I REMEMBER I HAD AN OLD UNCLE UP BY TULSA OKLAHOMA .
THAT TOOK ME OUT AND UH SHOWED ME .
THIS WAS IT WAS NOT MY IT WAS MY MOTHER S UNCLE THIS WAS A GENTLEMAN IN HIS SIXTIES .
UM .
AND HE TOOK ME OUT WITH HIM AND UH SINGLE SHOT TWENTYTWO .
UHHUH .
AND TAUGHT ME HOW TO SHOOT .
WE WENT SQUIRREL HUNTING AND .
ALL RIGHT .
AND UH HE TAUGHT ME HOW TO SHOOT UH A OLD SINGLE SHOT TWENTYTWO AND I WAS PROBABLY ABOUT TWELVE AT THE TIME .
UHHUH .
AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE NEATEST THING AND .
YEAH .
OF COURSE UNCLE SAM TOOK ME OUT TOOK ME HUNTING WITH HIM AND HE LET ME SHOOT AND SHOWED ME HOW .
ALL RIGHT .
I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY ON ANY OF US .
GUN OWNERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WHOEVER IS AROUND US IS AT LEAST SAFE AND KNOWS HOW TO USE ONE .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW I DO NT WANT TO GET OUT THERE DEER HUNTING AND HAVE SOME GUY BLOW ME AWAY SO .
OH YEAH .
WELL THAT S ABOUT ALL .
I WE AGREED PRETTY WELL ON THIS I THINK .
YEAH I THINK SO .
OKAY .
WELL IT S BEEN REAL NICE TALKING WITH YOU .
ALL RIGHT HAVE A GOOD ONE .
OKAY BYE .
BYEBYE .
OKAY .
I VE GOT A YOU KNOW I HAVE A REAL GOOD METHOD OF STARTING TO GET THE BUDGET BALANCING AND THEN THAT S GET HALF OF THE GOVERNMENT RID OF THE HALF OF THE GOVERNMENT PAYROLL .
I THINK THAT WOULD PROBABLY UH BE VERY POSSIBLE .
AND AND WE REALLY WOULD NT FEEL IT IN OUR SERVICES .
NOT ALL I YOU KNOW I DO NT KNOW IF YOU VE EVER BEEN TO WASHINGTON D C .
YES I HAVE .
UH YOU YOU VE SEEN THAT WHICH WAS ON THERE AND THE OFFICES AND IN LIGHT OF THESE UH HEARINGS WE VE ALL BEEN SITTING THROUGH THE LAST TWO WEEKS WE HAVE VERY DEFINITELY DECIDED THAT EVERY DEPARTMENT .
THERE IS JUST OVERSTAFFED .
RIGHT .
THEY REALLY DO NT HAVE ENOUGH TO KEEP THEM BUSY TO KEEP THEIR NOSES AT IN THEIR OWN BUSINESS OF WHAT .
THEY RE DOING .
RIGHT .
AND THE OTHER THING IS UH BESIDES THAT I THINK UH TWO THINGS THAT VERY DEFINITELY NEED LOOKING AT ONE IS FOREIGN AID .
I HAVE A REAL PROBLEM WITH ALL THE FOREIGN AID .
THAT IS GOING TO THE COUNTRIES .
THAT REALLY HAVE NO USE FOR US .
RIGHT .
I FIND THAT A TOTAL WASTE AND PART OF THE DEFENSE BUDGET .
UH AGAIN BEING JUST A VOTER AND A TAXPAYER YOU KNOW WORKING THROUGH OUR CONGRESSMAN I DO NT THINK THERE S TOO MUCH THAT I M GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO ABOUT IT BUT I BELIEVE IN TAKING AN ACTIVE PART IN POLITICS SO .
YEAH .
WELL I ONE ONE THING .
THAT REALLY BOTHERS ME BEYOND BEYOND CUTTING WHAT .
THEY SPEND IS THAT JUST REALLY AGGRAVATES ME WHEN THE BIG BUSINESSES DO NOT END UP PAYING TAXES AND THE UM REGULAR NORMAL TAXPAYERS ARE YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
PAYING SUCH A LARGE PROPORTION OF OF OUR PERSONAL INCOME AND THEN THE UH CORPORATE YOU KNOW INDUSTRIES JUST DO NT SEEM TO NOT PAY PROPORTIONALLY .
RIGHT .
I THINK THAT THAT WOULD WOULD HELP A LOT .
I GUESS IN A WAY .
IT WOULD TRICKLE DOWN TO US IN THE PRICES OF THINGS BUT I DO NT KNOW .
IT S JUST HARD TO HARD TO TAKE AND YOU KNOW SEE SO MUCH OF OUR PAYCHECK GO OUT AND THEN REALIZE THAT THEY HAVE ALL THE LOOPHOLES THAT THEY CAN USE .
UHHUH .
AND UH SEEMS LIKE SOME RATHER LARGE CHUNKS OF MONEY COULD COME FROM FROM THAT DIRECTION .
BUT .
YEAH THEY DO NT THEY DO NT SEEM TO WELL I REALLY THINK THE BIGGEST PROBLEM AND THEN THE TAFTRUDMAN ACT IS SUPPOSED TO HELP THAT .
THE BIGGEST PART IS THEY HAVE NO ACCOUNTABILITY FOR WHAT .
THEY RE DOING .
YEAH .
I MEAN THIS NONSENSE .
THAT S COMING THROUGH NOW ABOUT UH UH LOWERING PAYMENTS ON SOCIAL SECURITY AND A FEW OTHER THINGS THAT BUSH HAS IN MIND IN ORDER T TO BOOST THE ECONOMY BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE N MORE MONEY AS IT S GETS IT S RIDICULOUS .
YEAH .
IF THEY DO NT HAVE THAT MONEY NOW BRINGING IN LESS IS NOT GOING TO HELP THE PROBLEM .
NOT NOT GOING TO HELP .
AS FAR AS THE GOVERNMENT .
IT S NEV NEVER HELPED MY MY PERSONAL SITUATION .
I .
NO .
I CA NT SAY IT WOULD HELP WITH THEIRS EITHER .
YEAH AND THANK GOD WE DO NT OPERATE OUR BUDGET .
THE WAY .
THEY OPERATE THEIRS OR WE D ALL BE IN IN DIRE TROUBLE .
AMEN .
BUT THAT S UH YEAH I DO NT KNOW WHAT .
WE RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO ABOUT IT BUT I GUESS IT S SITTING AROUND SO LONG THAT IT S SORT OF LIKE OUR MORTGAGES .
I DO NT EVER EXPECT TO PAY MINE OFF BEFORE I DIE SO I GUESS WHY SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT .
IS NT THAT S THE WAY .
THEY RE THINKING THESE DAYS ANYWAY .
IT SEEMS SEEMS TO BE .
I YOU KNOW I IT REALLY DOES BOTHER ME WHEN I THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW LEAVING OUR CHILDREN WITH WITH THIS SORT OF UH A NATIONAL PROBLEM THAT WE CA NT SEEM TO FIND AN AN ANSWER TO IT UH I DO NT KNOW .
I I DO NT THINK IT EVER WILL REALLY .
I MAYBE IF THEY EVER GET TO THE POINT .
THE BIGGEST YOU KNOW THE BIGGEST OUTLAID EXPENSE HAS ALWAYS BEEN EITHER .
WARS OR DEFENSE .
RIGHT .
REALLY .
IF THEY WERE TO TAKE HALF OF WHAT .
THEY SPEND ON THAT AND PUT IT ON SOME ECONOMIC YOU KNOW INTER INTERGOVERNMENTAL OR INTER UNITED STATES LIKE PROGRAMS THAT ONE REALLY MIGHT .
YEAH .
I I BELIEVE IN PAYING MY SHARE AND I DO NT MIND UH PAYING FOR SOME OF THESE FRINGE BENEFITS THAT PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO .
BUT I JUST I JUST SOMETIMES FEEL LIKE I M BEING USED .
BUT UH AGAIN I DO NT THINK WE LL BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT SO .
WELL THAT S THAT S QUITE POSSIBLE .
I GUESS WE HAVE TO HAVE TO KEEP PLUGGING AWAY A LITTLE BIT OR IT WILL JUST TOTALLY GET EVEN MORE OUT OF CONTROL BUT I I DO NT KNOW .
YEAH .
BITE THE BULLET .
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE A BABY THERE .
YEAH .
I I DO .
UHHUH .
SHE S A WE RE NOT FEELING TOO WELL OVER HERE SO THAT .
OH REALLY .

I MEAN I D I D WIND UP UH JUST A BABYSITTER IN A HOME .

JUST BECAUSE OF THE .
WELL TOO MANY KIDS AND AND I THINK TOO MANY INFECTIONS AND THINGS COMING IN .
YEAH THEY SEEM TO PASS A LOT OF .
YEAH SICKNESSES AND I DO NT KNOW THEN ALL THE THINGS YOU HEAR ABOUT THEM .
YEAH YOU .
KIND OF WONDER WHETHER OR NOT .
YEAH I MEAN I M SURE THERE S SOME GOOD ONES BUT I JUST I DO NT THINK THAT I WOULD UH .
I TOOK UH CAMMY TO A OH IT WAS A PRESCHOOL DAYCARE TYPE OF THING .
OH UHHUH .
BUT I .
KIND OF I LIKED IT .
SOME WAYS AND SOME WAYS I DID NT .
UH I THINK THE RATIO OF KIDS TO TEACHER IS REALLY IMPORTANT .
OH YEAH YEAH .
AND .
HOW WAS IT .
WELL I THINK THEY HAD A THEY HAD TWO TEACHERS AND I THINK THERE WERE TWENTY KIDS BUT I ONLY HAD HER GOING TWO DAYS AND MOST OF THE OTHER KIDS WERE GOING MORE DAYS SO THAT WAS PROBABLY MY OWN FAULT .
OH .
THAT SHE DID NT .
SHE WENT .
OH YOU KNOW ONE THING .
I NOTICED IS UH UH JUST THEY WERE TRYING TO GET HER TO TEACH HER TO WRITE HER .
NAME AND UH I DID NT NOTICE IT UNTIL THIS SUMMER WHEN I WAS WORKING WITH HER THAT SHE WOULD BEND HER WRIST .
ALL THE WAY OH NOT IN A NATURAL SH FORM .
OH SHE DID .
YES AND UH I WAS KIND OF M MAD THAT THEY HAD NEVER NOTICED THAT AND EITHER POINTED IT OUT TO ME OR OR UH TRIED TO SAY LOOK YOU RE HOLDING YOUR SHE WAS HOLDING HER PENCIL IN THE RIGHT FINGERS AND STUFF .
SH BUT SHE WAS .
WRAPPING HER ARM .
ALL THE WAY AROUND .
YES .

AND UH I HAD NT WORKED WITH HER ON WRITING AT ALL AT THAT POINT .
SHE WAS FOUR OR THREE YEAH SHE WAS UH IT WAS LAST YEAR AND UH THEN THIS SUMMER .
I GOT THE THING FROM THE SCHOOL .
THAT SAYS THINGS TO WORK WITH THE KIDS ON AND I W LIKE I SAID I DID NT NOTICE IT TILL THEN .

WELL THEY D NEVER PICKED IT OUT THOUGH .
NO .
HUH .
THEY NEVER .
OR JUST NEVER SAID ANYTHING .

TWO DAYS .
A WEEK AND MAYBE THAT WAS MY MAIN REASON FOR TAKING HER WAS UH JUST SOCIAL SKILLS .
YEAH .
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE .
YEAH .
I FELT SHE NEEDED THE S JUST I DID NT FEEL LIKE SHE WAS MATURE ENOUGH SOCIALLY .
YEAH .
AND UH .
WELL ONE THING .
THAT S KIND OF DIFFERENT TOO THOUGH A PRESCHOOL THAN THAN TAKING A A INFANT OR .
UHHUH .
TO AT A DAYCARE WHERE THEY RE .
OH YEAH .
TAKEN CARE OF .
I THINK IT WOULD BE HARD TO TAKE THEM TO PEOPLE YOU DO NT KNOW .
PRESCHOOL S A DIFFERENT THING BUT I THINK IT S HARD TO TAKE KIDS TO SOMEBODY .
YOU DO NT KNOW AND OR UNLESS YOU HAVE AWFULLY GOOD REFERENCES .
YEAH YEAH .
RELIABLE UH PEOPLE I DO NT KNOW IT S SO HARD TO TAKE YOUNG KIDS ANYWHERE FOR VERY LONG .
WELL I THINK IT S HARD TO LEAVE THEM IT IS .

YEAH .
BUT UH .
YEAH IT IT IS I THINK JUST HARD TO LEAVE THEM BECAUSE NOBODY WILL GIVE THEM .
THE KIND OF CARE THEIR OWN FAMILIES WILL .
WELL AND YOU KNOW THEIR KIND OF THEIR SCHEDULES AND YOU KNOW IF THEY RE UPSET AND THAT TYPE OF A DEAL .
YEAH YEAH .
I DO NT KNOW HOW UH PEOPLE UH THAT HAVE YOUNG KIDS WORKING WORK FULL TIME AND AND DO IT REALLY WITHOUT BEING STRESSED OUT ALL THE TIME .
I THINK IT S WELL I DO NT KNOW THEN THEN ON THE OTHER HAND .
I THINK IT S HARDER TO STAY HOME IN SOME REGARDS .
IT S HARD TO ALWAYS KEEP YOURSELF FEELING LIKE YOU RE DOING SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE AND AT THE END OF THE DAY YOUR HOUSE STILL FEELS LIKE IT S A MESS AND YOU HAVE NT GOT ANYTHING DONE AND .
OH YEAH .
WHAT .
AM .
I GOING TO FIX FOR SUPPER .
OH YEAH IT IS .
YEAH IT S KIND OF HARD TO ALWAYS FEEL GOSH WHAT IS THIS IMPORTANT .
WHAT .
I M DOING AND .
YEAH WELL UH THE WORK NEVER ENDS .
NO .
THAT S FOR SURE .
NO IT .
SO .
IT DOES NT .
HUH .
BUT I THINK FOR TAKING KIDS TO A PROBABLY PEOPLE .
THAT TAKE THEM TO UH PRESCHOOLS AND DAYCARES FULL TIME OH THEY WOULD I DO NT KNOW PROBABLY JUST FEEL A DIFFERENT UH I THINK I JUST THINK IT WOULD BE HARD TO DO THAT FULL TIME .
I FEEL SUCH A RESPONSIBILITY EVEN WHEN WE GO OUT FOR A FEW HOURS THAT ARE THEY DRIVING THE BABYSITTER CRAZY AND .
UHHUH OR IS EVERYTHING OKAY .
YOU KNOW .
WHAT WHAT DO YOU FEEL IS THE THE MAJOR CHANGE .
THAT S BEEN GOING ON .
THAT S A TOUGH QUESTION .
WE ARE NOW ABLE TO WORK FULL EIGHT HOURS .
A DAY AND STILL DO OUR HOUSEWORK .
RIGHT .
DO NT ASK ME .
I THINK THAT HAS BEEN THE MAJOR CHANGE IS THAT WOMEN FEEL THEY NEED TO GO OUT AND DO THIS THEY THEY NO LONGER FEEL IT .
S UH IT S NO BIG DEAL TO TO STAY HOME AND RAISE YOUR FAMILY .
WELL .
ANY MORE .
IT HAS NO CREDIBILITY ANY MORE .
I KNOW IT AND I I THINK I THINK THAT S REALLY SAD BECAUSE I THINK THERE S GOING TO BE A GENERATION OF KIDS .
THAT ARE GOING TO GROW UP RAISED BY SOMEBODY ELSE .
WELL I M A SCHOOL TEACHER AND I M IN CHARGE OF RAISING THEM SO I CAN APPRECIATE IT .
YOU DO NT WELL .
I M I M STILL HOME WITH WITH MY LAST ONE AND I WOULD NT TRADE CHANGE A MINUTE OF IT FOR ANYTHING .
OH GOOD FOR YOU GOOD FOR YOU .
BUT I I CA NT I CA NT HELP BUT THINK THAT EVENTUALLY THE PENDULUM S GOING TO SWING BACK THE OTHER WAY AGAIN .
WELL YOU KNOW IT S INTERESTING BECAUSE WHEN I HEARD THE TOPIC I WAS THINKING UH THIS SUMMER OPRAH HAD A T V SHOW .
UHHUH .
ABOUT WIVES .
THAT REFUSED TO GO TO WORK AND HOW THEIR HUSBANDS THOUGHT THEY WERE TERRIBLE AND ONE WOMAN HAD FOUR CHILDREN .
AND HER HUSBAND SAID SHE .
WAS NT PULLING HER OWN WEIGHT IN THE FAMILY .
OH YEAH THAT S .
THAT S FRIGHTENING .
YEAH IT IT S SAD .
AND IT YOU KNOW IT WAS ALMOST FROM THE AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION .
IT WAS ALMOST A SOCIAL ISSUE YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
PEOPLE WERE SIDING WITH THE HUSBAND SAYING YOU VE GOT TO GO TO WORK IF YOU HAVE THESE FOUR CHILDREN YOU VE GOT TO SUPPORT THEM AND NOBODY WOULD GIVE HER CREDIT FOR BEING .
UHHUH .
HOME AND RAISING THEM .
YEAH I I THINK TOO MANY PEOPLE FEEL THEY NEED TO LIVE A MORE EXTRAVAGANT LIFESTYLE THAN NECESSARY .
THAT S TRUE .
UH YOU KNOW TO I I DO NT THINK YOU KNOW THE KIDS DO NT BENEFIT FROM THE BIGGER HOUSE AND THE FANCIER CARS AND AND AND THIS TYPE OF THING .
I THINK THAT THEY WOULD FROM THE YOU KNOW ATTENTION OR WHATEVER .
THAT S TRUE .
UH BUT IT I UH I I DO NT KNOW I I SEE IT AS A MAJOR PROBLEM AND I THINK IT S GOING TO HAVE TO SWING BACK THE OTHER WAY BECAUSE I THINK WE RE GOING TO HAVE AN AWFUL LOT OF KIDS .
WHO ARE GOING TO HAVE MAJOR PROBLEMS FROM ALL THIS .
YEAH WELL YOU KNOW I AS I SAID I TEACH SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
AND GOSH I M TRYING TO THINK I DO NT KNOW I HAVE ONE WOMAN ONE MOTHER THAT I KNOW IS HOME BUT SHE ALSO HAS TEN CHILDREN .
WHAT WHAT GRADE DO YOU TEACH .
SIX SEVEN AND EIGHT .
SIX SEVEN AND EIGHT .
I VE GOT A CHI UH WHERE DO YOU LIVE .
ARE YOU OUT .
IN RICHARDSON .
IN RICHARDSON WE RE IN PLANO HERE .
OH OKAY .
I HAVE A DAUGHTER IN MIDDLE SCHOOL AND UH I KNOW THERE ARE NT VERY MANY SHE HAS A FEW FRIENDS .
THAT HAVE MOMS .
WHO ARE STILL AT HOME BUT DO YOU SEE UM YOU KNOW DO YOU EVER DO YOU EVER SEE PROBLEMS YOU KNOW THAT YOU FEEL .
OH YEAH .
YOU KNOW THAT THE KIDS ARE LEFT ALONE TOO MUCH AND .
I VE GOT ONE CHILD UM THAT STAYS WITH ME .
EVERY DAY UNTIL FIVE .
BECAUSE HIS MOTHER DOES NT COME HOME UNTIL SEVEN AND HE DOES NT WANT TO BE HOME FROM THREE THIRTY UNTIL SEVEN BY HIMSELF .
HE STAYS AT SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
AND THE SCHOOL ALLOWS THAT .
WELL HE STAYS WITH ME .
UHHUH .
AND I HAVE A TENDENCY TO WORK LATE .
I WORK UNTIL SIX .
UHHUH .
SO HE STAYS WITH ME UNTIL FIVE THIRTY AND THEN GOES HOME .
OH MY .
AND YOU KNOW I HAVE LOTS OF KIDS BECAUSE THEY KNOW I M THERE LATE .
UHHUH .
I M A SLOW MOVER TO SAY THE LEAST BUT UM THEY LL COME IN AND SAY CAN I STAY WITH YOU BECAUSE I DO NT WANT TO GO HOME TO AN EMPTY HOUSE .
AND THAT S FRIGHTENING BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE WHEN I SAID I I M I M RAISING THEM I AM BECAUSE WE RE TALKING ABOUT BOY FRIENDS AND WE RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT .
THE GIRL SAID IN CLASS AND YOU KNOW WHAT S RIGHT .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE THERE S NO MOTHER AT HOME .
NO MOTHER TO TALK TO .
AND UM IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE I AND JUST THE SOCIAL VALUES .
WELL I VE JUST DO YOU DO YOU FEEL IT WILL SWING BACK THE OTHER WAY OR DO YOU FEEL THERE S JUST GOING TO BE A BIG PUSH TO UH .
I I DO NT KNOW .
YOU KNOW FOR FOR MORE MORE AND MORE DAY CARE TYPE SITUATIONS .
I I HAVE A FEELING .
WE RE GOING TO GO MORE AND MORE I VE GOT A TWENTYONE YEAR OLD FEMALE AND I VE GOT TWENTYTWO YEAR OLD MALE CHIL CHILD CHILDREN AND I LISTEN TO MY DAUGHTER AND SHE S GOING TO WORK AND SHE S GOING TO BUY HER .
HOUSE AND SHE S GOING TO GET HER .
CAR AND THEN SHE S GOING TO HAVE HER CHILDREN AND THEN WHEN YOU KNOW THEY GO ON ONE SALARY WILL THEY BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN WHAT .
UHHUH .
THEIR LIFESTYLE IS .
AND THEY RE BACK TO WORK AND YOU KNOW I AGREE WITH YOU I WAS RAISED IN A GENERATION .
WE DID NT NEED ALL THOSE THINGS .
YEAH .
AND WE LIVED WITHOUT THEM WE DID FINE .
FOR N I S T THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY .
OH OKAY SO IT S RIGHT UP YOUR ALLEY THEN .
I SUPPOSE SO .
LET ME PUSH THE BUTTON .
ALL RIGHT .
OKAY UH I GUESS I M SUPPOSED TO BE ALL FOR SWITCHING TO THE METRIC SYSTEM BUT UH I SENSE THAT IT S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ANYTIME SOON .
YEAH I DO NT THINK IT S GOING TO HAPPEN EITHER BUT I WISH IT WERE BECAUSE I M A I GOT MY BACHELOR S IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING .
UHHUH .
I M AT GRAD SCHOOL NOW IN ACOUSTICS AND ALL .
WE DO IS METRIC STUFF .
YOU RE NOW IN WHAT .
ACOUSTICS .
ACOUSTICS UH .
YEAH SO EVERYTHING S METRIC AND THEN YOU GO TO READ SOME ORDER BOOK OR SOMETHING AND IT S ALL CONFUSING SO I DO NT UNDERSTAND AS MUCH SO I THINK WE SHOULD GET ONE ADOPTED PERMANENTLY .
WELL I GUESS THAT IS THE POLICY BUT IT S BEEN THE POLICY FOR A LONG TIME AND NOTHING EVER HAPPENS .
UH I SUPPOSE THINGS SOME THINGS WELL HAPPEN SLOWLY SIMPLY BY HAVING IT TAUGHT IN THE SCHOOLS MORE TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT S HAPPENING HAVING A NEW GENERATION COME UP THAT S MORE USED TO IT .
YEAH A LOT OF INDUSTRY OUT THERE IS DOING METRIC STUFF BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO .
THEY HAVE TO FOR INTERNATIONAL TRADE .
YEAH .
BUT I G GUESS IT S IT S EASIER TO SWITCH BACK AND FORTH THAN IT USED TO BE UH BE BE BECAUSE OF OF UH OF COMPUTERS COMING INTO EVERYTHING .
UHHUH .
YEAH I DO NT THINK SWITCHING BACK AND FORTH IS THAT BIG A DEAL .
I THINK PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND MORE LIKE WHAT .
A METER IS INSTEAD OF HOW MANY FEET IN A METER OR SOMETHING .
JUST GET USED TO USING ALL THE TERMS .
BECAUSE SOMEONE SAYS A KILOGRAM NO ONE KNOWS WHAT .
THAT IS .
EVERYONE WANTS A WANTS A CONVERSION OF THAT BEFORE KIND OF RECOGNIZING IT AS A AS AS AS AS A CONCEPT TO HOLD IN MIND .
YEAH .
UH I I I DO NT SEE THAT IT IT IT CAN CHANGE IT VERY QUICKLY .
I MEAN WE RE NOT THE KIND OF SOCIETY THAT THAT UH THAT SOMETHING CAN BE POSED UPON UH BY GOVERNMENT WILL .
YEAH NO ONE SEEMS TO BE ADOPTING IT .
METRIC SYSTEM NO ONE S VERY UH NO ONE WANTS IT AT ALL SEEMS LIKE .
UH THE THE THE PUBLIC IS JUST VERY CONSERVATIVE THAT WAY IN REFUSING TO CHANGE MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS UH MONEY DOLLAR COINS ANYTHING LIKE THAT .
YEAH .
AND AND AND IT IT OBVIOUSLY MAKES NO SENSE THAT WE RE PRACTICALLY ALONE IN THE WORLD IN IN USING THE OLD SYSTEM .
YEAH I IT S PRETTY TOUGH WHEN YOU GET EVERYTHING CONFUSED THOUGH .
I THINK TWO SYSTEMS IS WORSE THAN ONE THOUGH .
BECAUSE I KNOW WE DO A LOT OF PROBLEMS AND THINGS AND THEY RE HALF ENGLISH AND HALF METRIC AND YOU YOU MAKE MORE MISTAKES DOING ALL THE CONVERSIONS THAN YOU WOULD DOING THE PROBLEMS .
MUMBLEX JUST GET ONE .
I PREFER METRIC BUT EVEN IF IT S ENGLISH THEY SHOULD JUST HAVE ONE .
WELL I MEAN UNFORTUNATE I THINK PEOPLE LIKE YOU ARE RELATIVELY RARE .
WHO ARE COMING UP AGAINST THIS PROBLEM .
EVERY DAY .
YEAH YEAH I THINK SO .
YOUR YOUR AVERAGE GUY JOGGING DOWN THE HIGHWAY WANTS TO KNOW HOW MANY MILES .
IT IS TO HIS DESTINATION .
UH I MEAN THERE ARE THINGS YOU COULD DO .
UH WE HAVE SIGNS UP ON THE N I S T CAMPUS HERE SPEED LIMIT TWENTYFIVE MILES PER HOUR FORTY KILOMETERS PER HOUR .
YEAH .
UH BUT THAT HAS NT BEEN ADOPTED VERY WIDELY .
YEAH THEY HAVE SOME OF THOSE IN OHIO .
THERE S THIS .
ONE .
SIGN S KIND OF FUNNY .
IT SAYS UH METRIC SIGNS NEXT HUNDRED MILES .
BUT I MEAN AND NO ONE WILL WILL GO A STEP FURTHER TO REMOVE THE ENGLISH SIGNS .
YEAH THAT WOULD FORCE EVERYBODY TO USE IT .
OR TO QUIT SELLING TAPE MEASURES IN INCHES .
UH YEAH OR YOU HAVE HIGHWAY SIGNS SAYING SPEED LIMIT UH EIGHTY EIGHTYFIVE WHATEVER WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER .
YEAH I GUESS A HUNDRED IS SIXTYTWO .
HUNDRED CAR IS GOING SIXTYTWO YEAH SO IT WOULD BE MORE LIKE UH LIKE NINETY .
I GUESS CAR IS GOING FIFTYFIVE .
UH YOU SUDDENLY HAVE A HAVE A EVEN WORSE PROBLEM WITH SPEEDING THAN WE DO NOW .
YEAH YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE TRYING TO DO NINETY .
DO DO DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE DO THE SCHOOLS EMPHASIZE THE METRIC SYSTEM .
YEAH IN THE ENGINEERING .
THEY .
ALL DO PRETTY MUCH .
NO I I I MEANT I MEANT DOWN LIKE IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS .
OH IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS .
I DO NT KNOW .
I WOULD NT THINK SO .
I REMEMBER .
I MEAN I THINK .
A WAYS BACK WE DID LIKE CONVERSIONS BUT WE NEVER ACTUALLY WENT OUT AND MEASURED ANYTHING OR DID ANYTHING ON ONE SYSTEM .
YEAH I MEAN I THINK MY CHILDREN LEARNED THE METRIC SYSTEM BUT IT DOES NT GET GET EMPHASIZED OVER THE OTHER .
YEAH THEY LEARN HOW MANY CENTIMETERS ARE IN AN INCH AND THAT S ABOUT IT .
ALL RIGHT DO YOU DO EXERCISE .
I DO YES I UH UH I GUESS IT ACTUALLY CHANGES I DO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS .
UHHUH .
SIMPLY WALKING WITH MY WIFE .
RIGHT .
AND SOMETIMES MY DAUGHTER WILL COME ALONG ON HER LITTLE BICYCLE .
UH AND THEN MOVING UP I RUN .
UHHUH .
IN THE MORNINGS NOT EVERY MORNING IT PROBABLY AVERAGES ABOUT TWO DAYS .
A WEEK .
RIGHT .
AND THEN WITH MY WIFE .
I ACTUALLY GO TO THE GYM AND LIFT WEIGHTS WHICH IS NT I UNDERSTAND QUITE EXERCISING BUT IT S ALONG THE LINES .
RIGHT .
HOW ABOUT YOURSELF .
WELL UM THAT S A HARD QUESTION TO ANSWER BECAUSE I DO PHYSICAL THINGS BUT I DO NT ALWAYS SET OUT FOR THEM TO BE EXERCISE .
UHHUH .
I WALK WITH MY PARENTS OCCASIONALLY NOTHING S REAL REGULAR ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I HAVE A WEIRD SCHEDULE AND THEY HAVE A NORMAL SCHEDULE AND UM I PLAY RACQUETBALL BUT I HAVE NT SINCE I VE BEEN OUT OF SCHOOL .
I DO NT HAVE ANYWHERE TO DO THAT BUT THAT S GOING TO START SOON AGAIN .
UHHUH .
AND UM I PLAY SOFTBALL ONCE A WEEK WHICH IS KIND OF MORE RECREATION THAN EXERCISE .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE I REALLY DO NT LIKE TO EXERCISE I THINK THAT S THE BASIC POINT OF IT IS I M NOT I I DO NT ENJOY IT .
RIGHT .
IF I KNOW THAT IT S EXERCISE BUT IF IT S LIKE A SOCIAL ACTIVITY OR A RECREATIONAL ACTIVITY I DO NT MIND .
RIGHT .
SO I HAVE TO DISGUISE IT IT S LIKE FEEDING LITTLE BABIES FOOD AND TELLING THEM .
IT .
S .
SOMETHING ELSE SO THAT THEY LL EAT IT .
THAT S RIGHT .
THAT S KIND OF THE SAME THING FOR ME .
I HAVE TO NOT KNOW THAT IT S EXERCISE SO I CAN DO IT .
RIGHT .
SO YOU LOOK AT IT MORE AS A TASK .
WELL YEAH IF IT S EXERCISE IT S A TASK .
RIGHT .
I DO NT WANT TO DO ANYTHING .
I HAVE TO DO .
I SEE .
I MEAN I LL VOLUNTARILY CLEAN THE BATHROOM BUT I WO NT DO IT IF I HAVE TO DO IT .
RIGHT RIGHT .
SO I M THIRTYTWO YEARS OLD .
UHHUH .
WHICH IS PROBABLY DIFFERENT THAN YOURSELF .
RIGHT I M TWENTYTWO .
AND SO IT S INTERESTING THAT AS YOU GET OLDER YOU BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU NEED TO EXERCISE .
RIGHT .
MY JOB AT TEXAS INSTRUMENTS I HAVE TO SIT IN FRONT OF A COMPUTER .
ALL DAY AND MAKE PHONE CALLS SO THAT I DO NT GET ANY EXERCISE DOING THAT .
RIGHT .
AND PLUS THERE S A BUILD UP OF STRESS .
UHHUH .
SO I NEED TO GO OUT AND TAKE THOSE WALKS AFTER DINNER AND I NEED TO GO OUT IN THE MORNING AND RUN OR I LL JUST GET NUTS .
RIGHT .
SO THAT S KIND OF A MOTIVATOR SO EVEN THOUGH I CAN LOOK AT IT AS A TASK THE YOU KNOW I .
KIND OF GET THE I GET SOME KIND OF GLOBAL BENEFIT .
RIGHT .
FROM THE WHOLE THING BY SAYING WELL I M LOWERING MY CHANCE OF HEART ATTACK AND THUS THAT TYPE STUFF .
EATING RIGHT AND NO CHOLESTEROL AND ALL THAT .
SURE THAT ALL I I DO ALL THAT .
YEAH WE I M SURE I WILL DO I M DOING THAT MORE AND MORE THAN I USED TO .
YEAH .
I M GETTING BETTER ABOUT THIS KNOWING THAT I NEED EXERCISE AND DOING IT BUT IT S STILL AT THE TASK STAGE .
RIGHT .
IS IT .
A PLEASURE FOR YOU OR ARE YOU .
WELL IT S A SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A WALK WITH MY WIFE IS VERY ENJOYABLE .
RIGHT .
I DO THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY AND IT TAKES YOU KNOW THAT THAT DURING THAT TIME .
THE STRESS FROM THE DAY GOES AWAY .
I GET TO SHARE WHATEVER .
I DID WITH MY WIFE AND AND VICE VERSA .
RIGHT .
GOING TO THE GYM IS IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN THAN LIKE OH AND THE RUNNING AND I ENJOY THAT TOO .
UHHUH .
YEAR I VE BEEN RUNNING SINCE HIGH SCHOOL .
OH .
ON TRACK TEAMS AND THE LIKE SO RUNNING I I M AT THAT POINT .
WHICH .
YOU PROBABLY GET TO AFTER ABOUT SIX MONTHS OF DEDICATED .
UHHUH .
RUNNING WHERE YOU DO NT FEEL YOUR MUSCLES .
ANY MORE .
RIGHT .
AND YOU DO NT THINK ABOUT THE PAIN OF IT .
YOU YOU YOU TAKE THE TIME TO RELAX SOME HOW AND YOU THINK ABOUT OTHER THINGS .
DURING THOSE FIRST FEW MONTHS YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT RUNNING AND WHY YOUR ELBOW HURTS AND .
UHHUH .
WHY YOU CA NT BREATHE AND THIS AND THAT AND THAT S NO FUN .
AND IT S SO HARD TO GET PAST THAT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE .
RIGHT THAT S I NEVER GOT PAST THAT STAGE .
YEAH THE EX THE UH WEIGHT LIFTING ON THE OTHER HAND IS ACTUALLY YOU KNOW I THINK I LOOK BETTER .
RIGHT .
I HAVE JUST A I DO NT I M NOT A HUGE PERSON I M JUST A REGULAR LOOKING GUY BUT JUST GOING TO LIFT WEIGHTS ON OCCASION WITH MY WIFE AND MY WIFE THINKS THE SAME THING ABOUT BOTH .
ME AND HERSELF .
UHHUH .
THAT GET THAT LITTLE BIT OF DEFINITION IN YOUR MUSCLES IS IS ATTRACTIVE .
RIGHT .
SO THAT PAYS ALSO .
THAT S GOOD .
YEAH SO SO I GUESS THAT ASPECT OF THAT TAKES AWAY THE WORK .
YEAH .
THE WITH MY WIFE WHICH IS NICE I LOVE HER YOU KNOW I ENJOY BEING WITH HER .
UHHUH .
I GUESS THAT S ONE THING BUT ALSO UH THAT THAT LONG TERM BENEFIT OF A LITTLE BIT OF TONE IN YOUR MUSCLES .
RIGHT THAT S IT I DO THE OCCASIONAL PUSH UP AND SIT UP .
I HAVE NT REALLY BROUGHT MYSELF TO GO TO THE .
YEAH .
THE GYM BECAUSE THAT S VERY STRESSFUL TO ME BECAUSE I FEEL I FELT REAL COMPETITIVE THERE AND I NEED TO FIND SOME PLACE .
I COULD GO AND NOT FEEL LIKE THERE S ALL THESE PEOPLE .
WHO ARE JUST HUGE AND HULKING THAT ARE .
OH YEAH I DO NT I DO NT LET THAT BOTHER ME BUT YEAH THAT S SOMETHING .
THAT COMES WITH TIME TOO .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW I LL TELL YOU THE SIT UPS AND PUSH UPS ARE EXCELLENT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW IT S YOUR OWN YOU YOU RE YOU RE STRUGGLING AGAINST YOUR OWN BODY WEIGHT .
RIGHT .
YOU CAN D HAVE VARIETY BY PUTTING YOUR FEET HIGHER OR LOWER BY PUTTING YOUR ARMS FURTHER APART OR CLOSER TOGETHER BY DOING THEM REAL QUICK OR REAL SLOW .
RIGHT .
AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY GET A GOOD WO YOU CAN I KNOW IN THE PUSH UP AT LEAST YOU CAN GET CHEST MUSCLES AND THE BACK OF YOUR ARMS QUITE BUILT UP .
UHHUH .
JUST DOING PUSH UPS .
THAT S A GOOD IDEA BUT I DO HAVE MY RIDE WE HAVE A STATIONARY BICYCLE AND A STAIR STEP MACHINE HERE AT THE HOUSE .
OH IS THAT RIGHT .
I LL DO THOSE ONCE IN A WHILE JUST .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW LIKE .
YEAH .
AT ELEVEN THIRTY WHEN LOVE CONNECTION S ON .
RIGHT .
AND I CA NT SLEEP I LL GET UP .
AND STAIR STEP FOR HALF AN HOUR .
THAT S FUNNY .
SO .
YEAH .
IT S I GUESS PRETTY PRETTY HEALTHY BUT I DO NT HAVE A REGULAR PLAN THAT S .
YEAH .
I NEED TO GET STARTED ON THAT .
WELL MAY YOU KNOW MAYBE NOT .
I D SAY I D SAY AT TWENTYTWO .
YOU DO NT NECESSARILY NEED A PLAN AS LONG AS YOU RE GETTING GETTING THE EXERCISE OTHERWISE .
RIGHT .
WHEN YOUR LIFE BECOMES SEDENTARY IS WHEN YOU HAVE TO MAKE YOURSELF .
A .
UHHUH .
PLAN AND WHAT S REAL FUNNY ABOUT PLANS IS THAT THERE S A STRUGGLE BETWEEN UH WHEN YOU WHEN YOU ADD SOMETHING TO YOUR LIFE WHEN YOU ADD A PLAN TO YOUR LIFE SOMETHING ELSE HAS TO GO AWAY .
UHHUH .
AND THAT S THE HARD DECISION IS OKAY IF I M GOING TO RUN IN THE MORNINGS WHAT .
AM .
I WHAT DO I TRADE IT OFF FOR .
WELL THE ANSWER S .
SLEEP .
SLEEP RIGHT .
IF I M GOING TO WALK AT NIGHT WHAT DO I TRADE IT OFF FOR .
WELL STAR TREK .
UHHUH .
OR YOU KNOW IT IT IT S ALWAYS TRADE OFFS AND YOU ACTUALLY .
YEAH .
HAVE TO AS YOU GET OLDER YOU HAVE TO REALLY THINK WHAT CAN GO AND WHAT TO TO TO REPLACE THIS THING .
IT S I MEAN NOT JUST EXERCISE BUT ANYTHING .
IT .
S .
RIGHT .
VERY HARD .
AND UH I DO NT I DO NT THINK YOU SHOULD WORRY ABOUT NOT HAVING A PROGRAM YET .
THAT LL COME .
YEP .
SOME DAY WHEN I .
YEAH I GUESS IF YOU CARE OR IF YOUR WIFE YOUR FUTURE WIFE UH GIVES YOU .
A REASON TO CARE .
RIGHT .
WHICH HELPS .
WELL I HOPE SO .
WELL I THINK WE COVERED IT .
YEAH SOUNDS GOOD .
NICE TALKING WITH YOU CRAIG .
YEAH YOU TOO .
HAVE A NICE DAY .
YOU TOO .
GOOD DAY .
BYE .
BYE .
OKAY WE RE BEING RECORDED .
ALL RIGHT RON .
UH NUMBER ONE I AM ONE HUNDRED PERCENT FOR TOTAL GUN T CONTROL I .
TOTAL GUN CONTROL .
YES I AM NOT A MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION AND .
I DO NT BELIEVE IN HUNTING AND UH I JUST HAVE HAD MY FILL OF WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE CRIME RATE AND I REALLY FEEL THAT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO UH TO MUMBLEX .
YES I I AGREE SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE BUT I THERE I DO NT BELIEVE THERE IS ANY WAY OF TOTAL CONTROL OVER WEAPONS BECAUSE CROOKS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO PERFORM THINGS THAT ARE NOT CORRECT WILL HAVE ACCESS TO WEAPONS FROM SOMEWHERE AND THAT MEANS THEY LL ALWAYS HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OVER US AND UH THEY MAY EVEN GET WORSE BECAUSE THEY KNOW WE HAVE NOTHING TO SUPPORT MYSELF NOW YOU KNOW I I AGREE WITH A LOT OF THE THINGS YOU JUST SAID IN YOUR FEW MOMENTS BECAUSE PERSONALLY I USED TO BE A GREAT HUNTER AND IN THE LAST FEW YEARS I VE SAID NO WAY MATTER OF FACT IF I FIND A UH A A FLY RUNNING AROUND IN THE HOUSE I PICK HIM UP AND CARRY HIM OUTDOORS I I DO NT EVEN HIT HIM WITH A FLYSWATTER SO I VE UH GOTTEN OVER THIS BUSINESS OF WANTING TO GO OUT AND SHOOTING AND AND KILLING AND THAT SORT OF THING .
UHHUH .
BUT I I THINK THAT UH PERSONALLY THAT WE DO NEED SOME WEAPONS AVAILABLE TO MOST OF THE PEOPLE MOST OF THE PEOPLE REALLY ARE UH HONEST AND UH WORTHY OF CARRYING ON THEIR LIVES PROPERLY UH I M SORT OF IN LINE THINKING IN TERMS I DO NT SEE ANYTHING WRONG WITH THIS FIVE DAY WAITING PERIOD IF THE WAITING PERIOD IS UTILIZED TO REALLY LOOK AT THE BACKGROUND OF THE PERSON PURCHASING THE WEAPON I MEAN THERE S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT DO YOU SEE ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT .
NO THERE S ONLY ONE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THE WHOLE THING THOUGH TH IS YOU KNOW WHEN THEY DO IT I THINK OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM IS YES THE THE CROOKS AND WHAT HAVE YOU ARE GOING TO GET WEAPONS IF THE WEAPONS ARE AVAILABLE .
RIGHT .
I THINK THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY IS THERE ARE JUST ENTIRELY TOO MANY WEAPONS AVAILABLE AND THE TYPES OF THE WEAPONS I MEAN THERE IS .
YEAH .
NO .
I M AGAIN I M AGAINST THIS UH AUTOMATIC AND SEMIAUTOMATIC STUFF .
RIGHT THERE IS .
I DO NT THINK WE SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE .
THERE IS NO REASON FOR IT I MEAN .
NO .
AND YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE SAY YOU KNOW WELL MY GOD THEY RE THEY RE CUTTING INTO MY CIVIL LIBERTIES AND ALL THIS NO I I I TAKE A DIFFERENT STAND THAT AS LONG AS THEY ARE AVAILABLE AND THEY ARE SO READILY ACCESSED OUT THERE THEN SOMETHING IS TAKEN AWAY FROM MY CIVIL LIBERTIES .
HUH .
AND UH MAYBE I M A LITTLE BIT STRONG WHEN I SAID TOTAL GUN T CONTROL THAT S THAT S REALLY NOT WHAT I MEANT BUT I MEAN WE NEED CONTROL WE VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO GET A HANDLE ON WHAT IS HAPPENING AND WE VE GOT TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF WEAPONS THAT ARE OUT IN THE IN THE .
YES .
IN THE PUBLIC .
AND THE THE PEOPLE SHOULD BE UH SELECTED SO THAT WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE ALL RIGHT AND THAT THEY RE THEY RE NOT UH ACQUIRING WEAPONS FOR ILLICIT USE UH THAT IS NOT GOOD THERE S NOTHING WRONG WITH A PERSON THAT ENJOYS THE MECHANISMS AS A MATTER OF FACT UH THERE S A FELLOW OUT THERE WORKING ON MY HOUSE RIGHT NOW WHO UH BROUGHT TO ME A TARGET FROM A RIFLE THAT HE UH PRETTY WELL HALFWAY DESIGNED AND HE HE PUT TOGETHER THE UH THE BULLETS IN IT .
UHHUH .
AND HE WAS SHOWING ME THAT AT A HUNDRED YARDS HE KEPT FIVE SHOTS WITHIN A QUARTER OF AN INCH OF EACH OTHER AT ONE HUNDRED YARDS NOW SEE FROM A TECHNICAL POINT OF VIEW THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THAT OUR MILITARY PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT .
UM .
SO THERE ARE OTHER INTERESTING UH FACETS IN IN GUNS AND WEAPONS THIS IS A UH BOLT ACTION RIFLE I THINK HE HAS AND HE HAS DONE OTHER THINGS TO THE WAY THE UH BARREL SITS IN THE UH THE WOOD PART OF IT AND UH HE DESIGNED THE THE THE BULLETS THEMSELVES AND HE HAS FANTASTIC ACCURACY .
UHHUH .
JUST JUST FROM A TECHNICAL POINT OF VIEW THAT INTERESTS ME NOT TO KILL ANYBODY WITH IT OR ANYTHING WITH IT BUT JUST THE FACT THAT A PIECE OF MECHANISM LIKE THAT COULD BE MADE TO BE SO ACCURATE .
YES ALL RIGHT YOU YOU SOUND LIKE YOU RE INTO THE TECHNOLOGY OF IT WHICH IS YEAH I AGREE AND YOU KNOW AND AGAIN I M MY ENTIRE FAMILY ARE THEY ARE ALL HUNTERS .
UHHUH .
AND YOU KNOW THEY THEY DO NT APPRECIATE MY STAND AND I .
YEAH .
I HAVE NO I REALLY HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH SPORTS HUNTERS I REALLY DO NT IT S JUST WHEN THEY COME OUT AND THEY SAY THEY NEED AN UZI IN ORDER TO DO SOME ACCURATE OR DECENT DEER HUNTING I THINK I THINK THAT S TOTALLY OUTRAGEOUS WHAT S HAPPENING IS PEOPLE ARE LOSING THEY SEEM TO BE LOSING THEIR COMMON SENSE OVER THE ISSUE .
YEAH .
AND THE ISSUE .
IS THE ISSUE IS BECOMING THE FOCUS AND NOT WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING WITH GUNS UH I I THINK SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN .
UHHUH .

AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE TRY TO DO IS WE TRY TO AVOID DOING THAT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE .
UHHUH .
ALTHOUGH IT REALLY IS VERY EASY TO DO THAT TYPE OF THING .
JUST PLOP THEM DOWN IN FRONT OF THE T V AND LET THEM BE UH ENTERTAINED THAT WAY .
AND UH SEEING AS YOU VE GOT .
YEAH .
SOME OLDER CHILDREN I I M WONDERING HOW DID YOU HANDLE THAT .
WHEN THEY WERE GROWING UP .

IN FACT I I THINK THINGS WERE WERE QUITE A BIT DIFFERENT .
UHHUH .
UH WHEN MY MY BIG KIDS WERE WERE LITTLE UH YOU KNOW EV EV ALL THE MOTHERS WERE HOME .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THE THE KIDS GOT UP IN THE MORNING AND ATE BREAKFAST AND POKED AROUND AND THEN WHEN THEY FELT LIKE IT THEY WENT OUT TO PLAY YOU KNOW .

WHICH .
HE STARTED WATCHING AND OTHER THAN THAT I MEAN THERE WAS BASICALLY THERE WAS NOT EDUCATIONAL T V OR .

UH YOU KNOW YOU GOT SOME CARTOONS AND THAT WAS IT BUT THEY THEY WERE NEVER THAT INTERESTED IN IT ANYWAY .

UHHUH .
AND SHE PLAYS ON HER SCHOOL VOLLEYBALL TEAM AND UH STUFF LIKE THAT .
BUT UH WE WE STILL UH OH LIKE TO PACK UP YOU KNOW JUST GO SOMEPLACE FOR THE DAY .

OR UH YOU KNOW JUST STUFF LIKE THAT .
ONE OF OUR OLDER KIDS NOW IS GOING TO GRADUATE SCHOOL DOWN AT COLLEGE STATION .

I KNOW WE D I D LIKE TO GET INTO DO MORE CAMPING AND OUTINGS AND THINGS .
AND I THINK WE PROBABLY WILL SOON AS THE BOYS GET A LITTLE .
UHHUH .
BIT OLDER .
BUT UH YOU KNOW FOR RIGHT NOW THEY DO NT YOU KNOW JUST GETTING OUT IN THE FRONT AND JUST BEING OUTSIDE IS GOOD FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY LIKE .
OH YES .
JUST BEING OUTSIDE .
YEAH I I THINK OUR KIDS JUST ALWAYS DEARLY LOVED THAT YOU KNOW PLAY BOUNCE THE BALL OR .
UHHUH .
JUST UH COURSE WHEN OUR BIG ONES WERE LITTLE WE LIVED UP NORTH YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
AND THIS TIME OF THE YEAR .
IT IT THE FUN THING WAS TO GO OUT AND SWOOSH AROUND IN THE LEAVES YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
SO .
THAT S TRUE YOU DO NT SEE MANY LEAVES AROUND DALLAS .
YOU KNOW SO IT S IT S VERY DIFFERENT AND AND UH YOU KNOW WE ALSO COME WINTER TIME .
WE D STICK THEM ON SLEDS .
AND .
UHHUH .
UH WE HAD A POND ACROSS THE STREET AND AND FROM LITTLE ON YOU KNOW I M IT S IT S SO DIFFERENT DOWN HERE WHERE Y YOU GO TAKE LESSONS TO LEARN TO ICE SKATE OR SOMETHING .
YOU KNOW WHEN OUR KIDS WERE LITTLE YOU YOU GOT THEM .
A PAIR OF SKATES .
WELL HAL WHAT S UH WHAT S CRIME LIKE IN DALLAS .
WELL IT DEPENDS WHERE IN DALLAS YOU ARE .
UHHUH .
THERE ARE CERTAINLY PARTS OF TOWN .
I WOULD NOT WANT TO LIVE IN .
YEAH .
BECAUSE IT S THE SITUATION .
IT IS VERY LOCATION DEPENDENT .
UHHUH .
AND THERE ARE PARTS OF TOWN HERE WHERE WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT THE NIGHTLY GUNFIRE .
OH YEAH .
YEAH IN BALTIMORE WE HAVE SIMILAR .
UH I LIVE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF BALTIMORE AND UH WE LIVE RIGHT OUTSIDE THE CITY AND OUR NEIGHBORHOOD IS PRETTY MUCH WORKING CLASS PEOPLE THOUGH I M IN GRADUATE SCHOOL UH I LIVE HERE BECAUSE IT S CLOSE TO THE UNIVERSITY .
UHHUH .
BUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE UH IT IT S REALLY FUNNY THE ONLY CRIME .
WE REALLY SEE IS UH JUST THE KIDS BEING MALICIOUS .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND I THINK MOST OF THAT IS BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS ARE NT AROUND .
THAT MAKE SENSE .
YEAH .
YEAH .
THAT UH THE WHAT .
THEY CALL THE LATCHKEY CHILDREN .
YEAH SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
NO ONE S YOU KNOW OR OR FATHERS ARE JUST MISSING YOU KNOW SO THERE S NO UH NO CONSISTENCY THERE IN THE HOME OR WHATEVER .
THERE S NO ONE TO TELL THEM .
WHAT S RIGHT AND WHAT S WRONG YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
THE SORT OF ON MY END IS MORE OF THE UPPER MIDDLE CLASS SO .
UHHUH .
I THINK OUR UH NOT THAT WE DO NT HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF LOCAL PROBLEMS .
UHHUH .
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND UH WE GET THE UH AFFECT OF THE UH THE CITY AND UH THE MAIN CRIMES WITHIN THE SUBURB HERE ARE THE THE THEFT CRIMES .
UHHUH .
A SMALL NUMBER OF ASSAULTS UH WELL IF WE HAVE ONE MURDER .
A YEAR .
YEAH .
THAT S PROBABLY AS MANY BUT THEN YOU KNOW YOU GO INTO DALLAS AND THEY ARE UNFORTUNATELY .
UHHUH .
UH HAVING MURDERS .
YEAH .
AT A RATE GREATER THAN ONE .
A DAY .
YEAH I THINK THAT S WE RE ABOUT THE SAME IN BALTIMORE .
THOUGH UH WASHINGTON I THINK IS UH CLOSE BY AND YOU KNOW THEY EXPERIENCE A LOT MORE .
UHHUH .
I THINK THEY DEFINITELY HAVE MORE PROBLEMS .
THAT UH IN IN THE AREA .
WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK CAN PREVENT CRIME .
WELL THE THING IS I DO NT IT S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE IF YOU RE A GRAD STUDENT .
YOU CAN APPRECIATE THE STATISTICS ON .
UHHUH .
UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE OFTEN THESE CORRELATIONS .
THAT ARE INVERSE OF WHAT .
THEY SHOULD BE LIKE UH WHEREVER THERE ARE MORE UH CRIMINALS THERE ARE MORE POLICEMEN .
YEAH .
BUT THAT S WHICH CAME FIRST .
YEAH .
BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IS IT S IT S BASICALLY THE THE PROBLEM IS WITHIN THE IN THE SOCIETY .
UHHUH .
AND THE SOCIETY S VIEWS AND WELL UH SINCE NOW I M IN MY MIDFORTIES WHEN I WAS IN GRAD SCHOOL OR WHEN I WAS AN UNDERGRADUATE GROWING UP IN A MORE RURAL AREA .
UHHUH .
I THOUGHT YOU KNOW CRIME WAS WAS REASONABLY UNKNOWN .
YEAH .
AND JUST THE SITUATION .
THAT S DEVELOPED WITH THE THE DRUG .
YEAH I THINK .
ASPECT OF UH .
UHHUH .
UH THE PUSHERS THE DEALERS AND THE ADDICTS UH .
YEAH I I I THINK I AGREE WITH YOU THERE .
BECAUSE IT JUST WAS NOT UH SOMETHING BACK IN THE SIXTIES THAT .
UHHUH .
UH I EVEN HAD TO WORRY ABOUT .
BUT I THINK YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS A LOT IN THE SOCIETY WHERE THINGS HAVE CHANGED UH SO IT S EFFECTED ALL OF US .
UHHUH .
YEAH I THINK THEY THE DRUG CULTURE DEFINITELY HAS UH IS ONE OF THE MAIN PROBLEMS .
YEAH OUR UH OUR MAYOR IN UH BALTIMORE IS ONE OF THE PEOPLE .
THAT GOES ON NATIONAL TELEVISION AND SAYS THEY SHOULD UH LEGALIZE DRUGS .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE IT WOULD ELIMINATE THE UH THE VIOLENCE AND THE UH THE UNDER THE THE MARKET I GUESS THE THE HIDDEN MARKET OF THE DRUGS AND EVERYTHING .
THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT .
UHHUH .
THAT MAKE SENSE .
HE .
S .
ONE OF THE BIG PROPONENTS OF THAT .
HE GETS ON NATIONAL TELEVISION AND AND SAYS THAT YOU KNOW .
SO IT S UH AND HE WAS A D D A DISTRICT ATTORNEY BEFORE AND A PROSECUTOR BEFORE BECOMING BECOMING MAYOR .
SO THAT S A REALLY STRAN YOU KNOW IT S A DIFFERENT VIEWPOINT .
I UH .
YOU KNOW IN A SENSE .
I DO NT I M N I HAVE REAL MIXED FEELINGS ON THAT .
YEAH .
BECAUSE IT COMES A BIT FROM THE ANGLE THAT THE UH UH IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE AN INTERESTING TEST .
UHHUH .
BUT THE OTHER SIDE OF IT TO ME .
WHAT HAPPENS IF WE LOSE WORSE .
UH Y WELL THE OTHER SIDE IS THAT UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF THE DOWN SIDE AND I THINK IF I LOOK BACK FIFTY OR A HUNDRED YEARS I D SAY YOU KNOW BACK THEN THERE WERE THE OPIUM DENS .
RIGHT .
BUT THE THING IS IF SOMEBODY RUINED THEIR LIFE UH SOCIETY DID NT TRY TO THEN SAVE THEMSELVES FROM IT THEY LET THIS PERSON .
WHO HAD RUINED IT .
UHHUH .
UH BECOME WELL DIE OR WHATEVER .
I MEAN .
RIGHT YEAH .
THEY PROBABLY BECAME WEAKENED PHYSICALLY AND OTHER THINGS TO THE POINT THAT THEIR LIFE EXPECTANCY WAS REAL SHORT BUT NOW WE TEND TO BELIEVE SOMEWHERE IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM OTHERWISE WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE EVEN IF THEY HAVE YOU KNOW PHYSICALLY RUINED THEMSELVES .
YEAH THEY HAVE INDUCED IT .
THEMSELVES .
YEAH .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
AND SO TO ME .
THAT S I UH I WOULD CERTAINLY LIKE TO SEE A REAL TEST OF OF MAKING DRUGS REAL CHEAP .
UHHUH .
TO SEE IF WHEN YOU MAKE THEM AVAILABLE PEOPLE THEN DO NT USE THEM .
UHHUH .
WELL I THINK .
UH .
YOU KNOW THEY DID THAT IN ALASKA .
THAT THAT ACTUALLY ALASKA JUST RECENTLY LEGALIZED MARIJUANA .
UHHUH .
BUT I NEVER I NEVER HEARD RESULTS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT SO I NEVER YOU KNOW PLUS THAT S SUCH A THAT S NOT A TRUE UH YOU KNOW IT REALLY COULD NT BE A GOOD TEST BECAUSE ALASKA S SO DIFFERENT THAN EVERY OTHER PART OF THE COUNTRY .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW SO THAT BUT THAT WAS INTERESTING YOU KNOW I I DO NT CRIME IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS .
THAT .
S UH I I DO NT KNOW YOU KNOW THE DRUG CULTURE THE UH THE UH YOU KNOW I I SEE IT WITH THE KIDS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD JUST STEALING THINGS NOT THINKING ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT .
YEAH WELL TH SOME OF THAT AND OF COURSE I M A BABY OF THE OLD SCHOOL .
YEAH .
BUT IT IT BOTHERS ME FROM THE FIFTIES ON NOT THAT I D REMEMBER THAT MUCH .
UHHUH .
FROM THE FIFTIES BUT BUT BASICALLY WE HAVE SO MUCH MORE OF THE SOMETHING FOR NOTHING .
MENTALITY .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
THAT S TRUE .
WE WORKED HARD FOR EVERYTHING .
THAT S VERY TRUE .
AND SO THEY .
UHHUH .
IN THE THERE WERE THE SIXTYFOUR THOUSAND DOLLAR QUESTION SHOWS IN THE FIFTIES BUT NOWADAYS THERE S SO MUCH ON TV WHERE WHERE PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE THE IDEA .
THEY CAN GET SOMETHING FOR NOTHING .
OF COURSE .
UHHUH .
UH I WORK FOR LAWYERS .
A LOT AND I SEE UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE THIS WHOLE MENTALITY THAT SOMEHOW THERE ARE THESE POTS OF MONEY OUT THERE THAT YOU CAN SUE SOMEBODY AND YOU KNOW THERE S A MILLION DOLLARS YOU CAN HAVE .
UHHUH .
UH FOR MENTAL DURESS OR WHATEVER .
YEAH .
BUT YOU KNOW THE OTHER THING .
THAT BOTHERS ME IN THE CRIME IS THE UH IN EUROPE THEY SEEM TO HAVE MENTALITY AND DRUNK DRIVING IS A GOOD ONE IS THAT PEOPLE ARE WELL INDOCTRINATED IN THEIR SOCIETY THAT DRUNKEN DRIVING IS UNACCEPTABLE .
RIGHT .
AND YEAH IF YOU RE GOING TO DRINK AND YOU MAY DRINK YOU BETTER HAVE YOUR DESIGNATED DRIVER .
UHHUH .
IN THIS COUNTRY AND FOR EXAMPLE WITH ALCOHOL OR WITH DRUGS IS WE DO NT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO HANDLE IT AS A SOCIETY TO SAY OKAY IT IS OKAY UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT IF YOU STEP OUTSIDE THESE BOUNDS THE PUNISHMENT IS EXTREME .
YEAH .
AND WE MEAN IT .
YEAH .
THAT I THINK THAT UH THE DRUNK DRIVING HAS JUST ACTUALLY JUST CAUGHT ON .
UH .
UHHUH .
A AND I I I REALLY UH MY FATHER WAS HIT BY A DRUNK DRIVER WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
AND UH THAT WAS A VERY UH THAT THAT WAS AN AWFUL THREE YEARS AFTERWARDS .
YOU KNOW OF RECOVERY .
UHHUH .
AND THE DIFFICULTIES AND UH EVERYTHING .
WE DID AND YOU KNOW THE GUY WENT FREE BECAUSE THIS WAS TWELVE YEARS AGO .
UHHUH .
THIRTEEN YEARS AGO THERE WAS NO HIS FATHER WAS EVEN THE UH POLICE CHIEF OF THE TOWN .
UHHUH .
SO THERE WAS NO REPERCUSSION AT ALL .
YOU KNOW OTHER THAN INSURANCE BUT HE WAS UNINSURED .
YEAH .
SO UH OUR INSURANCE PAID FOR EVERYTHING BUT IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT TIME AND AND THEN LATER THIS WAS ACTUALLY FUNNY MY BROTHER AND I WERE PICKED UP BY THE POLICE FOR QUESTIONING BECAUSE THIS FELLOW HAD BOUGHT A A NEW CAR AND SOMEBODY HAD TAKEN LIKE A BASEBALL BAT TO IT .
UHHUH .
AND BROKE ALL HIS WINDOWS AND HIS LIGHTS AND HIS DENTED IT EVERYWHERE AND THEY CAME AND QUESTIONED US .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW AND .
BUT THAT KIND OF SHOWS HOW OUR ATTITUDE TOWARD DRINKING .
RIGHT .
AND DRIVING WAS UH MISPLACED .
UHHUH .
FOR YEARS .
YEP .
THAT YOU KNOW IT WAS AN ACCEPTABLE SOCIAL BEHAVIOR .
UHHUH .
YEAH VERY MUCH SO .
YEAH THAT THOSE ARE SOME IMPORTANT POINTS .
YEAH I THAT S THOSE ARE .
WHAT ARE WHAT DOES YOUR CITY HAVE FOR GUN CONTROL IF ANYTHING .
WELL SEE MARYLAND IS ONE OF THE MOST WE JUST VOTED IN UH GUN CONTROL STRONG GUN CONTROL HERE IN THE STATE OF MARYLAND .
I I THINK .
HELLO .
HELLO .
HI MY NAME IS DOLPHENE .
I LIVE IN TEXAS .
HI MY NAME IS PAT JOHNSON AND I LIVE IN TE TEXAS TOO .
OKAY I WORK FOR T I DO DO YOU ALSO .
NO .
OKAY .
NO I LIVE IN DALLAS .
I WORK FOR THE DALLAS SCHOOL SYSTEM .
OH OKAY .
UH YOU READY TO BEGIN .
WE MIGHT AS WELL .
OH OKAY .
OKAY .
I UNDERSTAND WE ARE DOING CARE OF THE ELDERLY RIGHT .
YES .
AND HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT PUTTING SOMEONE IN THE NURSING HOME .
WELL I DO NT THINK THAT UH ANY OF MY RELATIVES WOULD REALLY LIKE TO GO THERE .
I I BELIEVE IF I AM IN A POSITION UH LIKE WHEN MY MOTHER GETS TO A POINT WHERE SHE NEEDS SPECIAL CARE THAT I WILL BE ABLE TO JUST BRING HER INTO MY HOME .
UHHUH .
AND MY FATHER ALSO AND UH OR HAVE SOMEONE GO INTO THEIR HOME YOU KNOW AND UH AND LOOK AFTER THEM .
THAT WAY .
YES I WOULD FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT UH TO UH PLACE EIT MY FATHER OR MY STEPMOTHER .
UHHUH .
UH IN A PLACE LIKE THAT .
PARTICULARLY SINCE I KNOW HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT IT .
RIGHT IT S BASICALLY IT S MORE HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT IT .
YES .
AND IT IS LIKE THEY FEEL THEY ARE UH THE WAY MY MOTHER WOULD PUT IT LIKE SOMEBODY HAD THROWN THEM AWAY .
YES .
YOU KNOW .
I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME SIGNIFICANT KINDS OF THINGS TO TO LOOK FOR YOU KNOW IF YOU ARE FACED WITH PLACING SOMEONE .
RIGHT .
IN A PLACE LIKE THAT UH YOU KNOW ASIDE FROM THE CLEANLINESS AND THE MEDICAL CARE .
THAT IS OFFERED .
UHHUH .
AND SUCH BUT ATTITUDE OF STAFF MAKES SUCH A TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE .
AND I HAVE A .
A FRIEND .
WHO IS PARTLY PARALYZED AND IS IN A NURSING HOME .
UHHUH .
AND HAS NO FAMILY .
WHO YOU KNOW COULD CARE FOR HER .
AND UH I KNOW THAT THE CHEERFUL PLEASANT PEOPLE .
WHO TREAT HER KINDLY MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD IN HOW SHE FEELS ABOUT UH HER SITUATION .
UHHUH .
AND ANOTHER THING TO THINK ABOUT UH ON THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE NURSING HOMES HERE I USE TO WORK IN ONE OF THE OFFICES IN A NURSING HOME .
UHHUH .
AND I GOT TO SEE A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT THEY DID .
UHHUH .
THEY UH THEY HAD A LOT OF CRAFTS .
YES .
AND THEY HAD A LOT OF GAMES AND UH THEY GET TOGETHER AND JUST DO THEY .
THEY DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS AND THEN THERE .
SOME SOME OF THE UH THE PEOPLE .
THAT ARE IN THERE ARE REAL YOU KNOW VERY NICE AND FRIENDLY TO EVERYBODY .
UHHUH .
AND UH THEN THERE ARE OTHERS .
THAT ARE UH IT IS JUST A JOB AND THEY JUST YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
WANT TO GO IN AND DO WHAT .
THEY HAVE TO DO AND GET OUT GO HOME .
UHHUH .
UH THE THE ATTITUDE OF THE STAFF AS YOU SAID IS REALLY .
UHHUH .
VERY VERY IMPORTANT .
I THINK IT WOULD MATTER TOO UH KINDS OF UH DISABILITIES THAT THE NURSING HOME ACCEPTS .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME UH WHO .
POOR THINGS YOU KNOW DO NT HAVE UH ANY REAL GRASP ON REALITY ANY LONGER .
RIGHT .
AND THEY MAY BE AMBULATORY BUT THEY TEND TO BEHAVE LIKE CHILDREN SMALL CHILDREN .
YEAH .
AND THAT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT I THINK FOR AN ADULT .
WHO WAS NT IN THAT SITUATION TO TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH ON A DAILY BASIS .
YEAH .
UH .
WELL IT IS LIKE WEL THE ONE THAT I WORKED IN UH YOU WOULD SEE SOME OF THEM JUST LIKE IN WHEELCHAIRS ALL DAY THEY WOULD JUST ROLL THEMSELVES AROUND ALL OVER THE PLACE AND .
YES .
AND THEY WOULD ENJOY ENJOY THEMSELVES WITH ACTIVITIES AND THEN YOU WOULD SEE SEE SOME OF THE OTHERS .
THAT ARE WERE LIKE DISTANT FROM THE OTHER GROUP AND THEY .
THEY JUST DID NT LIKE PARTICIPATE TOGETHER WITH THE OTHERS .
UHHUH .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE THEY HAD SOME .
SOME UH I GUESS UH SLIGHT MENTAL DISABILITIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
YES .
WHAT WHAT DO YOU CALL ALZHEIMER DISEASE AND STUFF LIKE THAT .
YES ALZHEIMER YES .
AND THEY DO NT DO NT UH THEY WERE NT REALLY TOGETHER WITH THE REST OF THEM WHEN THEY GOT TOGETHER FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES .
YES AND THAT CAN .
YES .
UM I GUESS MY INITIAL VIEW IS OUR TAX BURDEN HAS NT GONE DOWN IN RECENT YEARS DESPITE OUR TOTAL TAX BURDEN DESPITE TAX CUTS .
UHHUH .
BUT AMONG INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS WE HAVE ONE OF THE LOWEST IN IN THE WORLD AND IN MUMBLEX OF THE MATTER YOU GET WHAT .
YOU PAY FOR IF WE RE GOING TO HAVE NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE WHICH SEEMS LIKELY IT S NECESSARILY GOING TO INVOLVE MORE TAXES .
UH I SUSPECT I TAKE THE VIEW THAT CUTTING INCOME TAX RATES HAS BEEN GOOD FOR THE THE ECONOMY THAT MOST OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE A HIGHER SHARE OF THE TAX BURDEN IN VARIOUS KINDS OF SALES TAXES UH ENERGY TAXES PARTICULARLY AND THAT TO THE EXTENT .
WE NEED TO RAISE MORE TAXES THAT S THE DIRECTION .
WE SHOULD LOOK .
RIGHT .
WELL I GUESS I .
KIND OF HAVE MIXED FEELINGS .
UM YOU KNOW YOU ALWAYS SIT THERE AND OUT OF EACH PAY CHECK SO MUCH COMES OUT OF IT AND YOU WONDER YOU KNOW WHERE S IT .
ALL GOING .
WHERE S IT .
ALL GOING .
AND WE HAVE SUCH A HUGE UH NATIONAL DEFICIT AND AND I GUESS A LOT OF TIMES .
THERE .
S QUESTIONS WONDERING WELL IF IT S DOING A WHOLE LOT OF GOOD .
I KNOW THERE S A LOT OF SOCIAL PROGRAMS OUT THERE .
THAT NEED HELP .
BUT YOU .
KIND OF ALWAYS WONDER WELL WHERE S WHERE S THE MONEY GOING .
WELL ONE ONE ONE OF THE BIG TAX .
THAT HAS GONE UP A LOT IN THIS YEAR IS THE SOCIAL SECURITY TAX .
UHHUH .
WHICH IN PRINCIPLE IS GOING INTO INTO A BIG TRUST FUND BUT THAT IS A PARTICULARLY REGRESSIVE TAX UH IT S A TAX ON THE FIRST DOLLAR EARNINGS AND SENATOR MOYNIHAN S UH PROPOSAL TO TO TO CUT THERE I THINK WOU MAKES A LOT OF SENSE .
I M SORRY I COULD NT .
I THINK SENATOR MOYNIHAN S PROPOSAL TO TO CUT THE SOCIAL SECURITY TAX .
WHICH IS NT REALLY GOING TO GOING TO BEEF UP UP UP THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAM COULD MAKE A LOT OF SENSE .
RIGHT RIGHT .
YEAH I AGREE WITH THAT .
AS FAR AS OTHER COUNTRIES I M NOT UM I DO NT KEEP UP ON IT TOO MUCH AS TO FAR AS WHAT YOU KNOW AS WHAT .
THEY RE DO .
I KNOW WE WERE IN IRELAND LAST YEAR .
UHHUH .
AND I KNOW THAT THE TAX .
THERE IS EXTREMELY HIGH MUCH HIGHER THAN WE PAY HERE BUT .
OH YEAH .
BUT AS FAR AS OTHER COUNTRIES I M NOT UH UP TO PAR ON .
I THINK JAPAN I THINK JAPAN IS PROBABLY ABOUT EQUAL TO OURS .
UHHUH .
AND OTHER MAJOR COUNTRIES ARE HIGHER .
OUR FRIENDS WERE AMAZED THAT THE SALES TAXES THE COST OF THINGS WHEN THEY WENT TO CANADA NOT SO LONG AGO .
UHHUH .
AND AS A WHOLE MOST OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE A HIGHER LEVEL OF CRADLE TO GRAVE GOVERNMENT SERVICES AND .
RIGHT .
IT S A REAL REAL THEY RE THEY RE REAL TRADEOFFS THERE .
RIGHT .
YEAH BUT AND AND YOU SIT THERE AND WONDER UM I GUESS THIS DOES NT REALLY HAVE TO DO WITH TAXES BUT JUST MONEY IN GENERAL AND AND UM WONDERING IF YOU RE GOING TO HAVE ENOUGH WHEN YOU RETIRE TO LIVE ON .
UH I THAT S THAT S A SCARY THING THAT THERE S NO NO REAL KNOWING ABOUT .
UH THE THE .
THERE S A LOT OF INFLATION RISK .
THAT IS NT TAKEN CARE OF IN MOST PRIVATE PENSION PLANS .
UHHUH YEAH THAT S TRUE .
BUT UM ARE YOU INVOLVED WITH THE LEGISLATURE UP THERE OR WHICH .
NO I M AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY .
UHHUH .
UH PART OF THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT .
OKAY .
HERE IN GAITHERSBURG MARYLAND .
UHHUH .
I WAS JUST WONDERING SINCE YOU SAID WASHINGTON D C AND YOU AND YOU PICKED THIS TOPIC I WAS JUST .
WELL WELL .
KIND OF CURIOUS .
I I I DID NT PICK IT UH .
OH YOU DID NT .
I MEAN UM I LIKE I DO NT REALLY RECALL .
I MAY HAVE FILLED OUT ON THE ON THE FORM BUT I I CERTAINLY CERTAINLY HAVE THE FEELING .
I VE BEEN GIVEN TOPICS DIFFERENT FROM THE ONES THAT I MENTIONED BEFORE .
OH DID YOU .
SEE I HAVE NT PLACED ANY CALLS .
DID THEY AUTOMATICALLY ASSIGN THE TOPIC .
YES YES WHEN YOU PLACE A CALL .
OH I DID NT .
TOPIC IS GIVEN TO YOU .
KNOW THAT .
I THOUGHT WHOEVER MADE THE CALL COULD CHOOSE WHAT TOPIC BECAUSE I HAVE NT MADE ANY CALLS YET .
I VE JUST RECEIVED SOME .
OH YOU SHOULD TRY IT .
OH I DID NT REALIZE THAT .
OKAY .
YEAH BECAUSE IT S KIND OF A IT CAN BE A RATHER CONTROVERSIAL SUBJECT DEPEND ON WHO .
YOU RE TALKING TO .
UH MANY OF THE SUBJECTS ARE .
UH TAXES TAXES ESPECIALLY .
UM ONE THING .
THAT HAS KEPT OUR TAX BURDEN HIGH AND THIS WILL CHANGE SOMEWHAT IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS IS THE IS THE LEVEL OF DEF OF THE DEFENSE BUDGET .
EXACTLY .
AND THAT S THAT SAME SUBJECT .
UM ARE YOU FROM THIS AREA .
I M FROM DALLAS .

OH .
IT S IT S JUST DIFFERENT KINDS OF PLASTICS LIKE THE CLEAR PLASTIC IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT MILKY LOOKING PLASTIC .
OH OKAY .
AND THAT S THAT S WHAT THE DIFFERENT TYPES ARE .
YEAH .
YEAH .
IT SEEMS TO BE MADE OUT OF SOMETHING DIFFERENT .
YEAH YES .

THEY BUILT UP ONE MOUNTAIN COVERED IT WITH GRASS AND PUT SKI LIFTS ON IT .

NOW WHEN THEY GO TO THEIR GRANDMOTHER S HOUSE .
WHICH IS EVERY WEEKEND .

THAT S WHEN THEY .
A DIFFERENT STORY .
ALL AROUND .
AS OUR FAMILY WOULD SAY A PIG OUT .
UHHUH .
THAT S GOOD .
THAT S EXACTLY WHAT .
IT IS .
OH ONE OF MY BOYS THAT THAT S TWELVE UM IS HAS HIGH CHOLESTEROL .
OH REALLY .
HAVE YOU EVER FOUND OUT .
NO .
ABOUT YOUR KIDS .
NOT YET .
UM AND MY OTHER .
ONE DOES NOT .
HUH .
SO OH YEAR OR SO AGO HE FOUND OUT AND HE WENT ON A FAIRLY STRICT DIET TO TRY TO GET IT DOWN .
AND DID .
HE WAS ABLE TO GET IT DOWN .
IT S I THINK IT S MOSTLY HEREDITARY BECAUSE WE REALLY HAVE NEVER EATEN HIGH .
YEAH .
THINGS IN CHOLESTEROL .
HE S NEVER EATEN ANY EGGS .
HE S NEVER HAD ANYTHING BUT SKIM MILK AND YOU KNOW I VE NEVER BOUGHT BUTTER .
HUH .
AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
BUT UM OH HE JUST LEFT FOR THE DOCTOR AGAIN AND IT S IT S KIND OF BACK UP .
UM SO HE NEEDS TO BE CAREFUL AGAIN .
YEAH .
SO WE VE REALLY BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE FOODS YOU KNOW FOR HIM TO TO BE SURE TO EAT .
THE LOWER CHOLESTEROL FOODS AND STUFF .
AND UH SO HE S EATING AN APPLE .
A DAY FOR THE LAST TWO DAYS .
AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF DOES REALLY HELP .
WELL I THINK WE VE PROBABLY TALKED LONG ENOUGH AND .
THEY RE TALKING ABOUT UH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE NT THEY .
I M SURE WELL ACTUALLY PROBABLY ANY GOVERNMENT BUT .
YEAH .
THE FEDERAL ONE S THE BIG ONE SO UH SO WHAT DO YOU WHAT DO YOU THINK IN THE SHORT TERM WE SHOULD BE DOING TO TO IMPROVE IT .
WELL I SAW A PROGRAM ON UH RECENTLY AND AND IT SAID EVERY TIME THEY CUT YOU KNOW LIKE FIFTYFIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON A CERTAIN THING THEN THEY BRAG ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY THEY CUT AND THEN THEY GO AND SPEND THAT MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE .
RIGHT .
AND THAT S WHY THE BUDGET IS NEVER BALANCED .
RIGHT .
THE GRAMM RUDMAN ACT DID NT SOLVE THE PROBLEM THEY JUST TAKE ALL THE MONEY THAT THEY SAY THEY CUT AND THEY SPEND IT SOMEWHERE ELSE .
YEAH .
OR THEY YOU KNOW THEY PAD OUT THEIR STAFF OR YOU KNOW SPEND IT IN BOUNCED CHECKS AT THE .
COMMISSARY OR .
UH YEAH I M GETTING PRETTY KIND OF DISGUSTED WITH THE UH UH YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT THEY RE COUNTING A REDUCED DEFICIT AS BEING SOME BIG STEP RIGHT I MEAN FIRST OF ALL WE WERE WE VE ALREADY HIT THE LARGEST DEFICIT THIS PROPOSED BUDGET HAS THE LARGEST DEFICIT EVER AND TWO A DEFICIT IS I MEAN THE DEFICIT IS ONLY UH IS IS AS FAR FROM A BALANCED BUDGET YOU REDUCE THE DEFICIT YOU YOU RE STILL NOT YOU RE STILL NOT YOU RE STILL OVERSPENDING .
UHHUH .
RIGHT I MEAN IT S JUST THE AMOUNT THAT YOU RE OVERSPENDING AND THIS IS YOU KNOW FOR SOME REASON THE WAY THAT THE REPORTING IS GOING ON NOW IT SEEMS LIKE LIKE THE GOAL IS TO REDUCE THE DEFICIT TO SOME YOU KNOW STILL OUTRAGEOUS AMOUNT UM YEAH I I I THINK IN THE LONG TERM SOMETHING IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE DONE WITH UH SORT OF THE THE UH WELL I MEAN IT SEEMS TO BE KIND OF INHERENT IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS RIGHT THAT YOU VE GOT UH PEOPLE YOU KNOW TRYING TO TRYING TO CORNER MONEY FOR THEIR STATE OR FOR THEIR CONSTITUENTS SO THAT THEY CAN GET REELECTED .
UHHUH .
AND UH THERE IS NT ANY SORT OF OVERALL ACCOUNTABILITY AND AND UH I DO NT KNOW I I SUPPOSE THAT THAT THAT THE ONLY KIND OF SOLUTION ULTIMATELY THAT WE RE GOING TO HAVE IS IS IS EXPOSURE AND INFORMATION AND I DO NT KNOW THAT IN GENERAL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE THAT INTERESTED YOU KNOW TO LISTEN TO TO AS MUCH UH UH YOU KNOW I MEAN YOU RE GOING TO HAVE TO KNOW WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING AND UH YOU KNOW AND HOW AND HOW HOW PARTISAN AND HOW AND HOW SELFINTERESTED THEIR THEIR MOTIVES ARE .
UHHUH .
AND AND TAKE IT TO TASK FOR IT BECAUSE IT S NOT GOING TO GET SOLVED YOU KNOW IF PEOPLE ARE STILL TRYING YOU KNOW LIKE YOU WERE SAYING YOU SAY YOU KNOW HEY WE JUST YOU KNOW WE JUST CUT DEFENSE LET ME GRAB SOME OF THIS MONEY FOR MY STATE NOW AND THEN WE CAN THROW IN SOME HIGHWAY BILL OR YOU CAN THROW IN SOME YOU KNOW SOME OTHER KIND OF THING AND UH IT S A PRETTY VICIOUS UH VICIOUS CYCLE I DO NT KNOW .
WELL I THINK THEY SHOULD THEY SHOULD LIMIT THE SENATE TO ONE TERM ONE SIX YEAR TERM .
THAT S YEAH THAT S BEING BATTED AROUND I UH MY MY DAD WAS ALWAYS A PRO PROPONENT OF THAT HE UH .
UHHUH .
HE FELT THAT THAT WOULD GET PEOPLE INVOLVED WHO WERE WHO WERE INTERESTED IN BEING PUBLIC SERVANTS AS OPPOSED TO PERSONAL SERVANTS .
RIGHT AND AND DO NT LET THEM COME BACK AND AND UH KEEP CONGRESS TO UM TWO TERMS OF TWO YEARS A PIECE .
UHHUH .
AND THEN IT LL BE OVERTURNING AND THEY WO NT HAVE THE SAME PEOPLE THERE ALL THE TIME .
RIGHT .
AND THEN ALL THE SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS WILL HAVE TO RENEGOTIATE ALL OF THEIR .
RIGHT .
THEIR PAYOFFS AND KICKBACKS AND THAT LL KEEP THEM BUSY ENOUGH SO THAT THEY WO NT HAVE AS MUCH INFLUENCE .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE THAT S ONE OF THE THINGS ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS IS THAT UH THE FACT THAT THEY RE ALWAYS TRYING TO LEAN SOMEBODY TOWARD ONE WAY OR ANOTHER WHETHER IT S THE OIL COMPANIES OR THE AUTOMOTIVE COMPANIES AND LIKE THE AIR BAG THING THE AIR BAG CAME OUT WHAT TWENTY YEARS AGO .
RIGHT .
AND ONLY NOW THEY RE GETTING THAT PUT IN CARS .
UHHUH YEAH .
AND THE OIL COMPANIES ARE REALLY ARE NT RESPONSIBLE YOU KNOW THE VALDEZ PROVED THAT AND THEN THE GOVERNMENT DOES NT JUMP ON THEM HARD ENOUGH TO MAKE THEM DO ANYTHING .
RIGHT .
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE IMMEDIATELY .
YEAH YEAH I THINK I THINK THAT THAT S PROBABLY RIGHT BECAUSE IN TERMS OF LONG TERM YOU JUST GOT TO GET PEOPLE UM I MEAN UH AT ONE POINT AT LEAST ON A LOCAL LEVEL UM GOING INTO POLITICS IS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU RE DOING IS IS REALLY TRYING TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY .
UHHUH .
RIGHT I MEAN YOU DO NT EXPECT TO MAKE ANY MONEY OUT OF IT YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU GAIN A LITTLE BIT OF LOCAL FAME BUT BUT IT S UH YOU PUT IN A LOT OF WORK IN EXCHANGE FOR THAT .
RIGHT .
AND I DO NT HAVE THE FEELING THAT NATIONAL LEVEL POLITICIANS ARE ARE AT ALL LIKE THAT .
NO THEY LISTEN TO WHEREVER THE MONEY IS .
YEAH AND UH YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THAT THAT THE PROBLEM WITH HAVING YOU KNOW JUNIOR PEOPLE COMING IN ALL THE TIME IS THAT YOU END UP KIND OF WASTING A LOT OF TIME WITH UH YOU KNOW WITH IN INEPT POLITICIANS .
RIGHT .
OR PEOPLE WHO DO NT KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH IT .
YEAH THEY RE NOT AS EFFICIENT THAT S FOR SURE .
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND MAYBE THAT S .
AMERICAN AMERICANS LIKE ME AND WHETHER I NIGHT UH UH NOT I THINK THAT WE RE PAYING TOO MUCH TAXES UM THAT INCLUDING TAXES IN GENERAL OR INCOME TAX AND UM THE OTHER THING WAS DO WE GET WHAT WE PAY FOR I MEAN WHAT WHAT IS OUR WHAT IS OUR OPINION ON THAT SO .
OKAY .
ARE YOU PREPARED TO TALK .
OH I GUESS SO GO BY EAR .
LET ME PUSH .
OKAY .
LET ME PUSH ONE HERE OKAY UM WELL I CAN JUST TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT TAXES IN TEXAS IT S MOST INTERESTING BECAUSE WE RE ONE OF THE FEW IF I DO NT KNOW OF ANY OTHER STATE UM DOES NOT HAVE A A STATE INCOME TAX .
RIGHT .
SO WE DO NT HAVE A STATE INCOME TAX BUT WE CERTAINLY MAKE UP FOR IT IN OTHER WAYS HERE UM FOR INSTANCE THE LOCAL UM SALES TAX IS EIGHT AND A QUARTER PERCENT .
OH WOW .
IS NT THAT AWFUL .
HOW ABOUT YOU WHAT DO YOU HAVE THERE .
UH WE HAVE A SIX PERCENT .
UHHUH .
SALES TAX .
AND YOU HAVE STATE INCOME TAX ALSO .
YES .
UHHUH YEAH WELL IT S BEEN PEOPLE HERE HAVE JUST HAVE THIS UM THEY VE BEEN REALLY HOLDING OUT IN THE LEGISLATURE AND IT S STARTING TO SHOW UM IN A LOT OF WAYS AS FAR AS THINGS THAT ARE JUST TOTALLY UNDER FUNDED AND AND I DO NT KNOW IF TEXAS IS EVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO TO UM TOTALLY AVOID HAVING AN INCOME TAX OR NOT I THINK EVENTUALLY THEY RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO IT .
UHHUH .
BUT UM DO YOU THINK YOU PAY TOO MUCH THERE OR HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT .
I DO NT MIND MY TAXES AS MUCH AS MY SOCIAL SECURITY .
OH REALLY .
YEAH .
INTERESTING UHHUH .
YEAH UM THE TAXES I DO NT KNOW I CAN DEAL WITH THAT BECAUSE I KNOW EVERYONE ELSE IS PAYING IN TOO I GUESS .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
YES .
BUT UH OH I DO NT KNOW UH THE ONE THING THAT WE DO NT HAVE UH TAX ON CLOTHES .
UHHUH .
DO YOU .
UM YES WE DO HAVE TAX ON CLOTHES .
THAT S WHAT I THOUGHT I KNOW NEW YORK ALSO HAS A SALES TAX ON CLOTHES .
UHHUH .
AND I KNOW A LOT OF KIDS LIKE GOING TO COLLEGE WITH ME THAT LIVED IN NEW YORK OR OUT OF STATE AND A LOT OF THEM WOULD BUY THEIR CLOTHES IN PENNSYLVANIA JUST FOR THE SIMPLE SAKE OF NOT PAYING THAT .
HOW INTERESTING I GUESS I DID NT REALIZE THAT .
UHHUH .
UM WE DO NT HAVE TAX ON GROCERIES FOR INSTANCE UH .
NO WELL WE DO NT HAVE IT NECESSARILY ON FOOD BUT THEN THERE S OTHER THINGS THAT THEY NAIL YOU FOR IT .
YEAH .
LIKE HEALTH AND BEAUTY PRODUCTS .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW .
YES YES I SHOULD I SHOULD HAVE UM DELINEATED YET YOUR ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IT S THE FOOD THE CONSUMABLE FOOD PARTS THAT YOU KNOW WE DO NT HAVE TO PAY .
YEAH .
TAX ON YEAH YEAH AND YOU REALLY HAVE TO WATCH YOUR YOUR UM BILL SOMETIMES I THINK UM IT S REAL INTERESTING TO LOOK TO SEE HOW MANY THINGS THAT I BUY IN A GROCERY STORE WHICH ARE NOT REALLY EDIBLE GROCERIES .
AND THAT S WHEN IT REALLY STARTS TO ADD ON AND UM SO UM THAT S THAT IS SORT OF A HELP BUT UM I DO NT KNOW IT S JUST EIGHT AND A QUARTER JUST SEEMS LIKE AN AWFULLY LOT OF OF TAX ON UH ANY SALE AS FAR AS I M CONCERNED UM .
YEAH THAT MUMBLEX .
IT S REAL INTERESTING THIS LAST UM TAX SEASON I M A STUDENT AND THE LAST TAX SEASON I HAD A JUST A PART TIME JOB HELPING OUT IN A TAX OFFICE AND THE WOMAN THAT OWNED THE OFFICE WAS SAYING SHE D HAD THIS BUSINESS FOR OH PROBABLY SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN YEARS AND SHE WAS SAYING AS THE YEARS HAVE GONE ON THERE ARE FEWER AND FEWER THINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN UH TAKE OFF OF THEIR INCOME TAX .
DEDUCT YEAH .
AND YOU KNOW IF YOU RE NOT A HOME OWNER OR IF YOU HAVE NT SOLD PROPERTY OR UH HAVE SOMETHING MAJOR LIKE THAT IT S HARDLY YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
IT S JUST NOT MUCH ELSE YOU CAN DO AND SHE SAID IT S REALLY TAKEN THE FUN OUT OF DOING TAXES FOR PEOPLE FOR HER BECAUSE SHE USED TO BE REAL CREATIVE ABOUT HELPING THEM .
UHHUH .
FIND WAYS OF .
AND SEE .
YOU KNOW ACCUMULATING RECEIPTS .
I TAKE IT SHE WAS AN ACCOUNTANT .

UHHUH .
UM AND IT IT DOES NT SEEM FAIR AND I I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE DO MAKE MONEY UM YOU KNOW IN IN GOOD INVESTMENTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT I THINK THAT S A LOT OF LUCK AND A LOT OF GAMBLING AND NOT A NOT A WHOLE LOT OF WORK .
I AGREE WITH YOU I DO THINK IT S A LOT OF LUCK AND I DO NT LIKE THAT PART OF THE FINANCE YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
WHATSOEVER .
RIGHT .
I DO NT KNOW BUT LIKE WHAT I WAS SAYING ABOUT THE SOCIAL SECURITY THAT S REAL YOU KNOW IT NEVER BOTHERED ME UNTIL WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT IT IN MY CLASSES .
UHHUH .
AND THEN THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT THE MORE I THINK I M PAYING IN TO SOMETHING THAT I GRANTED YOU KNOW I M PAYING FOR MY GRANDPARENTS .

THAT S EXACTLY RIGHT .
I LIKE TO INSTEAD OF THINKING HOW MUCH YOU KNOW THAT I M PAYING OUT I LIKE TO JUST LOOK AT IT AND SAY OH WELL EVERYONE ELSE IS DOING IT TOO YOU KNOW .
THAT S RIGHT YEAH AND I .
OKAY .
OKAY .
SO TELL ME ABOUT CHINA CRY .
OKAY CHINA CRY WAS BASICALLY THE THE TRUE STORY WRITTEN BY THIS THIS LADY .
WHO HAD UH WAS A NATIVE A NATIVE CHINESE UH UH WHO WAS RAISED BY CHRISTIAN PARENTS .
UHHUH .
AND HER HER TIME FRAME WAS PRIOR TO THE NINETEEN FORTYNINE REVOLUTION .
I SEE .
ALTHOUGH SHE HERSELF HAD NEVER REALLY ACCEPTED JESUS OR GONE THROUGH ANY OF THE OTHER UH CHRISTIAN UH PORTIONS OF OF THE FAITH REPENTANCE BAPTISMS ET CETERA ET CETERA .
SHE HAD ALWAYS FELT A VERY STRONG UH LEANING IN THIS DIRECTION .
AND WHENEVER THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION OF NINETEEN FORTYNINE OCCURRED AND MOST CHURCHES WERE EITHER BANNED OR THEIR ALL THE CLERGY AND SO FORTH WERE KILLED OR OR IMPRISONED OR AND THE PROPERTY CONFISCATED SHE WAS SAFE BECAUSE SHE HAD YOU KNOW NOT OFFICIALLY JOINED THE THE CHRISTIAN MOVEMENT .
UHHUH .
SO ANYWAY SHE AS SHE GREW UP TOWARDS MATURITY HER PARENTS WELL HER DAD WAS A DOCTOR AND AND HE WAS RATHER WELL YOU KNOW RATHER WELL TO DO IN THE OLD REGIME AND THE THE CHIN THE COMMU THE COMMUNIST CHINESE DID NT LIKE THIS AT ALL .
YOU KNOW THE BOURGEOISIE WAS WAS WAS DEFINITELY OUT OF UH STYLE THEN .
RIGHT .
EVERYBODY WAS BACK TO A COMMONALITY OF ONE .
AND SO THEY KEPT PICKING AT HIM PICKING AT HIS AT HER MOTHER AND UH FINALLY UH STARTED PICKING ON HER .
UHHUH .
AND GETTING HER TO YOU KNOW THEY WERE STARTING TO UH ACCUSE HER OF OF OF UH CRIMES AND ATROCITIES BEFORE THE THE REVOLUTION AND AND HAD HER WRITE HER OWN STORY OVER AND OVER AND OVER .
UH AND THE UH THE MAJOR POINT OF THE MOVIE WAS THAT THAT SHE HAD UH MARRIED THIS THIS CHINESE FELLOW AND WAS WITH CHILD WHEN THEY STARTED THIS MASS COURT .
NOW I THINK I M LEAVING OUT A PORTION .
SHE .
GR SHE WENT THROUGH COLLEGE AND GRADUATED VERY HIGH UP IN HER CLASS AND HAD UH GOTTEN A JOB AS AS AN INSTRUCTOR AND THEY HAD HER TEACHING OR WERE STARTING TO HAVE HER TEACH HISTORY FOR THE SOLDIERS .
UHHUH .
WHEN THE THEY DECIDED THAT THAT SHE NEEDED TO START RECANTING OF ALL OF HER .
PRE UH REGIME CRIMES AS IT WERE .
UHHUH .
BEING A CHILD YOU KNOW .
SO THEY KEPT ON AND ON AT AT HER AND IN THE MEANTIME SHE AND HER .
HUSBAND UH WERE EX EX WERE EXPECTING A CHILD THEIR OWN CHILD .
AND UH THE THE PEOPLE KEPT HARASSING HER OVER YOU KNOW OVER A PERIOD OF MONTHS AND FINALLY THEY UH CARRIED HER UH OUT INTO THE COURTYARD TO TO EITHER REALLY TO SHOOT HER OR TO GO THROUGH THE MOTIONS OF OF SHOOTING HER UH WITH BY FIRING OR YOU KNOW EXECUTING HER BY FIRING SQUAD .
UHHUH .
AND UH THE LORD JUST SAID NO THIS IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN EVEN THOUGH THIS LADY HAS NOT REALLY YOU KNOW SHE S SHE S ONE OF MINE SHE IS NOT GOING TO DIE AND UH THE THE SOLDIERS WERE BLINDED WHEN THEY SHOT .
HUH .
AND SHE HER LIFE WAS SPARED .
AND THIS THIS FRIGHTENED THE THE UH THE COMMANDANT AND SO HE CALLED THIS KIND OF STUFF OFF AND JUST PUT HER IN THE LABOR CAMP .
HUH .
WELL UH AND COURSE HERE S THIS THIS WOMAN .
WHO IS HEAVY WITH CHILD DRAGGING ROCKS AROUND .
HUH .
WELL SHE SHE PUT IN FOR GOING GOING TO UH AND HER HUSBAND HAD ESCAPED TO HONG KONG UH AND THEN SHE PUT IN TO GO SEE HIM .
AND OVER TIME .
SHE UH UH FINALLY THROUGH HER PERSEVERANCE AND WRITING ENOUGH LETTERS TO ENOUGH DIFFERENT PEOPLE EMBARRASSED ENOUGH OF THE THE MIDDLE UH BUREAUC BUREAUCRACY THAT THEY FINALLY LET HER GO .
HUH .
AND OF COURSE SHE HAD TO WALK .
YOU KNOW THEY THEY STRIPPED HER OF EVERYTHING PRACTICALLY BESIDES THE THE CLOTHES ON HER BACK .
AND UH SO SHE SO SHE WENT ACROSS THE BORDER TO HER HUSBAND AND ANOTHER AND OTHER CHILD THAT THEY D ALREADY HAD .
UHHUH .
UH TO FREEDOM .
OH .
AND THEY KNEW THAT SHE WAS NT GOING TO COME BACK BUT YEAH SHE DID YEARS LATER WHEN THE UH LIBERALIZATION YOU KNOW IN REAL LIFE .
UHHUH .
LIBERALIZATION OF CHINA HAPPENED AND UH SHE WAS NOT PERSECUTED OR ANYTHING ELSE LIKE THAT .
HUH .
INTERESTING STORY .
YES IT WAS .
UH VERY MOVING TOO .
I UH I DO NT EVEN REMEMBER SEEING THAT ADVERTISED AND IT WAS PROBABLY HERE AND GONE FAIRLY QUICKLY .
WELL IT WAS WITHIN OH NINETY DAYS .
OH .
THAT RECENT .
YEAH .
NO I MEAN IT S IT WAS IT WAS ADVERTISED OVER A PERIOD OF ABOUT NINETY DAYS .
OH I SEE WHAT .
YOU MEAN .
BUT IT .
WAS NT UH THEY DID NT HAVE IT IN UH TOO AWFULLY MANY MOVIE HOUSES BUT IT WAS IT WAS IN THE IT HAD LARGE UH UH UH PRESS RELEASE .
UHHUH .
WELL UH I GUESS WHAT .
I WHAT .
I SAW MOST RECENTLY AND LUCKILY I SAW IT ONLY A WEEK AGO SO I D REMEMBER .
OKAY .
REMEMBER IT WELL WAS UH SORT OF LIGHT BY COMPARISON .
UHHUH .
UH MY HUSBAND AND I HAD THIS GREAT DESIRE TO GO SEE A COMEDY AND AND UH WE ENDED UP GOING TO SEE GREEN CARD .
GREEN CARD .
GREEN CARD .
UHHUH .
AND UH HE CHOSE IT AND UH IT S GOT THIS WONDERFUL FRENCH ACTOR .
WHO S IT WAS HIS LIKE HIS AND HE S BEEN A STAR IN FRANCE AND A WONDERFUL ACTOR .
WHO .
WE VE ENJOYED FOR YEARS BUT HE S NEVER MADE AN AMERICAN FILM .
THIS WAS HIS AMERICAN FILM DEBUT .
OH I SEE UHHUH .
AND HE SPEAKS VERY BROKEN ENGLISH .
AND BASICALLY HE PLAYED UH A FRENCHMAN .
WHO MARRIED AN AMERICAN GIRL UH IN A MARRIAGE OF CONVENIENCE .
UHHUH .
SO THAT HE COULD GET HIS GREEN CARD WHICH IS WHAT .
AN ALIEN NEEDS TO WORK IN THIS COUNTRY .
RIGHT UHHUH .
AND UH BECAUSE SHE COULD CLAIM SHE WAS MARRIED SHE COULD GET UH AN APARTMENT OR A CONDOMINIUM IN A VERY EXCLUSIVE BUILDING IN NEW YORK .
THAT HAD A GARDEN AN AN AN OUTSIDE GARDEN WHICH IS VERY UNUSUAL THERE .
UHHUH .
SO SHE WAS A HORTICULTURIST AND THAT WAS SORT OF HER DREAM .
OH I SEE UHHUH .
OF COURSE YOU KNOW THEY GOT MARRIED AND THEY NEVER SAW EACH OTHER AGAIN .
EXCEPT EXCEPT FATE THROUGH THEM TOGETHER AND THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONAL NATURALIZATION SERVICE UH STARTED INVESTIGATING .
SO THEY HAD TO GET BACK TOGETHER AND GET THEIR STORIES STRAIGHT .
AND AND SHE WAS A VERY SVELTE SOPHISTICATED URBAN NEW YORKER .
OH .
AND HE WAS A A POOR FRENCHMAN .
WHO HAD GROWN UP ON THE ON THE STREETS AND SORT OF PULLED HIMSELF UP BY HIS BOOTSTRAPS AND CLAIMED TO BE A COMPOSER BUT THERE WAS NO PROOF WHATSOEVER THAT HE REALLY WAS .
UHHUH .
HE D BEEN WORKING IN A RESTAURANT WHEN THEY MET .
UHHUH .
AND UH THEY HAD TO LEARN ALL ABOUT EACH OTHER BASICALLY .
JUST THEN .
IN A IN A WEEKEND .
AND UH IT WAS YOU KNEW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN OF COURSE .
UHHUH .
THAT THEY WOULD FALL IN LOVE .
WELL THEY FELL INTO LIKE AT ANY RATE AND .
RIGHT UHHUH .
AND WHEN THEY WENT TO THE QUERY OR INQUISITION OR WHATEVER UH THEY DID PERFECTLY AND THEN HE SAID SOMETHING BECAUSE HIS ENGLISH WAS SO POOR ON FOR THE MOST PART HE HE WAS SO PROUD OF HIMSELF FOR GIVING EX ALL THE CORRECT ANSWERS THAT THAT ON THE LAST ONE HE SAID OH I NEVER REMEMBER THAT ANSWER AND THAT CLUED THE INVESTIGATOR THAT HE HAD MEMORIZED A SERIES OF ANSWERS .
UHHUH .
UHHUH .
SO UH .
THE AIDS ISSUE IS IS A BIT OF A PROBLEM .
I GUESS THE FIRST THING .
THAT COMES TO MY MIND NOT HAVING ANY IMMEDIATE FRIENDS WITH THAT PROBLEM IS IS THE FINANCIAL END .
AND HOW CAN A COUNTRY STAND TO UH SPEND AS MUCH OR MUCH MORE THAN THEY ALREADY ARE ON SUCH A PROBLEM UH BUT THEN THAT KIND OF THINKING IS ALSO TEMPERED WITH THE THE KNOWLEDGE OR AT LEAST THE THE RUMOR I M NOT REALLY SURE IF IT S TRUE OR NOT THAT UH WE RE NOT SPENDING AS MUCH PER LET S SAY AFFLICTED PERSON ON CANCER .
UH THERE S SOME UH TAKE BREAST CANCER FOR INSTANCE .
IT SEEMS TO BE DOING MUCH MORE DAMAGE AND AFFECTING MUCH MORE PE MANY MORE PEOPLE THAN AIDS .
AND YET UH MORE PEOPLE DIE OF IT AND YET THE FUNDING HAS ALREADY UH EXCEEDED AIDS HAS MORE MONEY THAN UH BREAST CANCER .
THAN WELL THAT S INTERESTING IS NT IT YEAH .
SO UH I MEAN IF IT S TRUE .
I I VE I VE ALWAYS HEARD THESE THINGS .
I VE NEVER BOTHERED TO DIG IT OUT AND MAKE SURE BUT UH I VE HEARD IT ON MORE THAN ONE DOCUMENTARY .
THAT UH THEY WERE COMPLAINING THAT .
WHOEVER S SITTING UP THERE MAKING THESE DECISIONS OR WHATEVER INSTITUTIONS RAISE THE MONEY AND UH IT S JUST ONE BIG P R CAMPAIGN THAT YEAH WE THINK THAT S THE WORLD S WORST THING SO LET S GIVE MONEY TO AIDS .
AND YET WE VE HAD BREAST CANCER PROBLEMS FOR YEARS .
RIGHT .
AND IT S JUST ONE OF THOSE UH COURSE ONE OF THE SHOWS I SAW WAS TAKING IT FROM THE ANGLE THAT SINCE IT DOES NT EFFECT MEN IT S NOT GOING TO GET FUNDED .
AND UH HAVING THOUGHT ABOUT THAT FOR A WHILE .
WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT THAT IDEA .
WELL I I .
KIND OF I THOUGHT WELL THAT THAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE SINCE THERE ARE A LOT OF MEN IN CONTROL OF THAT KIND OF THING .
BUT THEN I GOT I GOT TO THINKING THE THE NUMBER ONE KILLER OF MEN SEEMS TO BE THE PROSTATE AND THERE S ONLY ONE TEST THAT JUST RECENTLY GOT DEVELOPED UH A BLOOD IN ANTIGEN UH ANTIBODY TEST FOR THE ANTIGEN IN THE BLOOD AND THAT S FAIRLY RECENT .
AND YET MEN HAVE BEEN DYING FROM PROSTATE CANCER FOR YEARS .
THEY VE NOT REALLY GIVEN IT .
ATTENTION EITHER YEAH .
SO IT S NOT REALLY CURED YEAH IT S NOT UH NOT THAT HEAVILY FUNDED EITHER AND THEN THAT SEEMS TO BE ONE OF THE THE MAJOR UH PROBLEMS THAT MEN HAVE IN THE REALM OF CANCER SO I DO NT KNOW .
I I GUESS THERE S JUST SOME STRANGE PUBLIC OPINION AS TO WHO .
THEY WANT TO GIVE TO .
UH BE IT THROUGH DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS MARCH OF DIMES TYPE UH TELETHONS OR OR BICYCLE RIDES OR WHATEVER HOW THEY FUND WHATEVER UH ILLNESS .
THEY WISH .
RIGHT .
IT .
S KIND OF HARD TO TO GET AN EVEN KEEL ON THAT .
I MEAN IT S REALLY HARD TO SAY WELL THERE S YOU KNOW A HUNDRED THOUSAND PER YEAR AFFECTED BY THIS .
ONE SO LET S GIVE IT .
THIS AMOUNT AND THEN THIS OTHER .
ONE S ONLY A TENTH OF THAT SO GIVE IT .
A TENTH OF THAT AND AND JUST KEEP DOLING IT OUT THAT WAY OR .
WELL I M I M GLAD I M NOT THE ONE .
THAT .
S THAT S IN CHARGE OF OF MAKING THOSE DECISIONS .
THEY UH YOU WISH THAT THERE COULD JUST BE MONEY FOR ALL THESE PROBLEMS BECAUSE THEY RE ALL SO SERIOUS YOU KNOW .
I MEAN IT S NOT SO SERIOUS I GUESS UNTIL IT AFFECTS YOUR FAMILY AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN .
IT S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING .
RIGHT .
SO I I WOULD HATE TO HAVE THAT RESPONSIBILITY JUST PERSONALLY BUT BUT THEN AGAIN WE REALLY WE REALLY DO HAVE IT AS A SOCIETY TO DECIDE WHICH THINGS WE NEED TO ADDRESS .
I UH I GUESS I IT IT FRIGHTENS ME TO THINK OF SO MANY PEOPLE WITH WITH AIDS AND WITH CANCER AND MANY OF THOSE THINGS UH IF THEY RE NOT ABLE TO TO BE INSURED THEN THE COUNTRY S GOING TO PAY FOR IT .
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER .
RIGHT .
WHETHER IT S THROUGH PREVENTION OR OR TREATMENT OR YOU KNOW JUST UH JUST HELPING THE PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES .
IT SEEMS LIKE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER WE RE GOING TO END UP PAYING FOR IT .
THAT S TRUE .
BUT .
YOU KNOW THE THE OTHER THOUGHT THAT I HAD UH I VE HAD SEVERAL MINUTES TO THINK ABOUT THIS AFTER I UH WHILE I WAS FINDING PEOPLE I UH I COULD THINK ABOUT THE TOPIC LONGER THAT THE PERSON .
THAT RECEIVES IT SO IT S KIND OF A A UNFAIR ADVANTAGE .
AS IT WERE BUT THE OTHER THING THAT I THOUGHT OF ON THIS IS I WONDER IF THERE IS NT ENOUGH MONEY UH IN OUR ECONOMY OR IN OUR SYSTEM .
UH IT SEEMS LIKE THERE S SO MUCH THAT GOES TO THINGS .
THAT DO NT REALLY DO A WHOLE LOT OF GOOD .
I MEAN YEAH THEY RE KIND OF NICE .
BUT WE HAVE SUCH AN AFFLUENT A SOCIETY SOCIETY THAT I WONDER IF IF WE TOOK A LITTLE FROM HERE AND THERE AND THE OTHER IF WE MIGHT WIND UP WITH A A CURE FOR JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING .
JUST CHANGE OUR P .
OF COURSE THEN WE WOULD NT HAVE ANY ROOM TO PUT PEOPLE BUT THAT S .
RIGHT JUST CHANGE OUR PRIORITIES .
YEAH .
A LITTLE BIT .
YOU KNOW YOU HEAR THESE RIDICULOUS FIGURES FOR PIZZA OR YOU HEAR THESE THESE PHENOMENAL AMOUNTS OF DOLLARS SPENT FOR THIS THAT OR THE OTHER AND THEN YOU HAVE ALL THE ARTS .
THAT THAT ARE NICE AND AESTHETIC BUT .
RIGHT .
ARE THEY THAT ENHANCING FOR THE FOR THE MASSES YOU KNOW .
THEY CERTAINLY DO WELL FOR THOSE .
WHO GO TO THE SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA AND ALL THAT BUT UH HAD ALL THAT DONATION AND TIME AND LABOR AND EFFORT GONE TOWARD SOMETHING ELSE .
OKAY DID THEY TELL YOU OUR TOPIC .
UH NO SOMEBODY ELSE ANSWERED THE PHONE AND PUT MY NUMBER IN .
OKAY IT S UH .
UH WHAT IS THE TOPIC .
THE TOPIC IS CARS WHAT KIND OF CAR WILL YOU BUY NEXT AND WHAT KIND OF DECISION YOU D DO YOU THINK ABOUT GETTING YOU KNOW PICK THAT CAR OUT AND UH AND WHY .
OKAY UH MY NEXT CAR TO BUY PROBABLY WOULD BE A CADILLAC .
OKAY .
I VE HAD UH WELL I M ON MY THIRD ONE AND I M NOT REAL SURE THAT I D BE IN THE MARKET FOR A CAR FOR QUITE A WHILE .
YEAH I M THE SAME WAY I WAS UH I HAD TWO CADILLACS I WENT TO MY FIRST LINCOLN THIS LAST TIME I TRAVEL AND UH MY GRANDFATHER WORKED FOR FORD MOTOR COMPANY SO HE ALWAYS SAID WHY DO NT YOU DRIVE A FORD OR WHY DO NT YOU TRY A LINCOLN .
UHHUH .
SO I FINALLY TRIED ONE .
MY .
AFTER FIFTY YEARS AND UH I VE HAD I GUESS I GUESS FOUR CADILLACS AND AND ONE SUBURBAN IN MY LAST FIVE CARS BUT I BOUGHT A LINCOLN AND I LIKE IT .
MY DAD HAS BEEN A A UH LINCOLN MAN FOR A LOT OF YEARS BUT I VE ALWAYS BEEN A G M MAN I M IN THE AUTO PARTS BUSINESS MYSELF .
OH ARE YOU .
AND UH THE LAST CADILLAC I BOUGHT WAS AN ALLANTE .
UHHUH .
AND I JUST LOVE IT TO DEATH I M NOT SURE I D EVER GET RID OF IT .
WELL I M A I M A TRAVELING SALESMAN I TRAVEL ON THE ROAD SO I LIKE A LITTLE HEAVIER CAR BUT .
I USED TO DO THAT QUITE A BIT MYSELF .
SO THAT S WHY I CHOOSE YOU KNOW TO DRIVE A HEAVIER CAR .
YEAH .
AND MORE LUXURY CAR BUT I TELL YOU WHAT I WILL PROBABLY GET A CADILLAC THE NEXT TIME QUITE HONESTLY .
REALLY .
YEAH BECAUSE I LIKE THE LINCOLN BUT THERE S JUST SOMETHING ABOUT THAT CADILLAC THAT WHETHER IT S A G M C PRODUCT OR WHATEVER .
THEY SEEM TO PUT .
SEEMS THEY HANDLE BETTER .
THEY SEEM TO BE PUT TOGETHER A LITTLE BIT BETTER .
I THINK SO TOO .
AND YOU KNOW THE BUTTONS ON THE CONTROLS AND THINGS LIKE THAT ARE A LITTLE EASIER TO GET TO THAN FORD PRODUCTS AND I THINK THAT S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES ME SHY AWAY FROM UH IMPORTS IS THEY PUT SO MUCH YOU KNOW GADGETRY ON THE DASH AND AND THE THE BUTTONS ARE SO SMALL .
YEAH THEY REALLY DO .
TO PUSH AND G M DOES NT SEEM TO DO THAT I KIND OF LIKE THAT FEATURE SO .
YOU KNOW I M A FUNNY DUCK THAT CAME IT COMES TO THE SIMPLE THINGS LIKE FRONT END ALIGNMENTS .
UHHUH .
I HAVE NEVER HAD TO HAVE A FRONT END ALIGNMENT ON A CADILLAC I DO NT KNOW WHY WHY .
UHHUH .
WHETHER I JUST SEEM TO DRIVE THEM BETTER OR WHAT BUT I VE NEVER HAD TO HAVE A FRONT END ALIGNMENT ON A CADILLAC THEY ALWAYS APPEAR TO HOLD WELL .
I VE UH I HAD AN ELDORADO WAS MY FIRST ONE WAS AN EIGHTY .
UHHUH .
AND UH I THINK AT ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND MILES I FINALLY HAD IT LINED UP .
DID YOU .
AND I HAD THEM DO ALL FOUR WHEELS .
AND THE ONLY THING I MISS ABOUT A CADILLAC IS A FLEETWOOD BROUGHAM WAS MY LAST CAR AND I TRADED IT IN TRADED IT IN ON MY LINCOLN AND THEY RE JUST NOT AS LARGE AS BEFORE I DO MISS THAT .
THAT S TRUE YEAH BUT WHAT IS BIG TODAY .
WELL YOU RE RIGHT .
YOU KNOW LINCOLN IS STILL AS BIG AS IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN BUT .
YEAH IT S BIG BUT THE TRUNK SPACE FOR ME UH WHAT I USUALLY DO IS I USUALLY TAKE THE BACK SEAT OUT OF MY CAR AND THAT S WHERE I PUT MY SAMPLES BECAUSE TRUNKS JUST ARE NT BIG ENOUGH .
YOU KNOW A CAR I RAN ACROSS RECENTLY THAT HAS A TREMENDOUSLY LARGE TRUNK IS THE LINCOLN CONTINENTAL .
YEAH NOW I HAVE THE TOWN CAR AND IT S IT S A DEEP TRUNK BUT NOT AS BROAD AS THE UH THE CADILLAC .
WELL THE TOWN CAR I NOTICED UH OR WITH THE WITH THE CONTINENTAL UH I WAS RENTED ONE ONE TIME .
UHHUH .
UH WE COULD UH PUT GOLF CLUBS IN THEM .
OH GOOD .
YOU KNOW STRAIGHT ACROSS I MEAN .
THEY WENT ALL THE WAY DOWN .
FRONT TO BACK .
WELL THAT S GOOD .
NOT GOING FROM SIDE TO SIDE .
THAT S GOOD .
AND WE GOT THREE FULL SETS IN THERE AND STILL HAD ROOM FOR LUGGAGE .
YEAH I SELL SPORTING GOODS UH HUNTING RELATED ITEMS I SELL GUNS GUN CASES .
I SEE .
AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
YEAH .
AND I NEED TO YOU KNOW THAT S ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS A GOLF CLUB .
UHHUH .
THEY NEED TO SAMPLES NEED TO STRETCH OUT AND GUN CASES AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND .
I DO NT KNOW IF YOU VE EVER LOOKED AT A CONTINENTAL .
NOPE .
UH IT S NOT AS PEPPY AS A AS A TOWN CAR .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE IT S A V SIX BUT IT UH I TOO I DROVE IT FROM HERE TO MEMPHIS AND I REALLY ENJOYED DRIVING THAT CAR IF I WAS GOING TO BUY A FORD PRODUCT THAT S WHAT I WOULD BUY .
YEAH I DROVE MINE A COUPLE WEEKS AGO TO OUR ONE OF OUR BIG NATIONAL SALES MEETINGS IN NASHVILLE I USUALLY FLY I DROVE IT WITH ANOTHER ONE OF MY GUY THAT WORKED FOR ME WE DROVE IT TEN HOURS TO NASHVILLE AND IT IT HANDLED REAL WELL BUT MY MAIN THING IS SPACE SO IF A CONTINENTAL I MIGHT CONSIDER IT THE NEXT TIME A CONTINENTAL HAS .
YOU MIGHT TAKE A LOOK AT THEM .
MORE TRUNK SPACE .
THEY THEY HAD A A LOT MORE TRUNK SPACE AS A MATTER OF FACT THEY HAD MORE TRUNK SPACE THAN MY UH SEDAN DE VILLE HAD .
YOU ALWAYS HAVE LEATHER INTERIORS ON YOUR CADILLACS .
UH ALL THREE OF MINE HAVE HAD LEATHER INTERIORS YEAH .
YEAH I LIKE LEATHER INTERIORS ALSO .
UH I HAD A EIGHTY ELDORADO WHICH WAS LEATHER AND UH THEN MY EIGHTYSIX WAS A TOURING SEDAN .
UHHUH .
AND UH IT HAD THE GRAY LEATHER PACKAGE IN IT AND MY ALLANTE HAS UH .
THAT S A NICE CAR .
I GUESS SADDLE SADDLE COLORED TYPE THING .
YOU BET AND I LL I WILL SAY ONE THING ABOUT CADILLACS VERSUS .
OKAY I GUESS OUR TOPIC IS UM ADVICE ABOUT GOING TO COLLEGE .
UHHUH .
DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN OF YOUR OWN .
OH NO I DO NT HAVE ANY CHILDREN BUT I M STILL GOING TO COLLEGE .
OH ARE YOU .
UHHUH .
WHAT SCHOOL ARE YOU GOING TO .
N C STATE .
OH .
ARE YOU ENJOYING IT .
UM WELL IT S A LOT OF WORK .
ARE YOU WORKING ON YOUR UM .
MY BACHELOR S .
BACHELOR S DEGREE .
UHHUH .
AND WHAT FIELD OF STUDY ARE YOU IN .
UM IT S ACTUALLY IN COMPUTER SCIENCE .
UHHUH .
AND I HAVE A SPECIAL INTEREST IN VOICE I O .
OH WELL THAT S NEAT .
ARE YOU FROM NORTH CAROLINA .
NO I M ACTUALLY FROM AMARILLO TEXAS ORIGINALLY .
OH ARE YOU REALLY .
UHHUH .
OH .
WELL WHAT TOOK YOU TO NORTH CAROLINA .
OH UM THE SERVICE .
OH I SEE .
YEAH .
WELL THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS THINKING ABOUT IN SCHOOL UM I WENT TO TEXAS TECH OUT IN LUBBOCK .
UHHUH .
AND UH I HAD A FRIEND MY ROOMMATE WENT TO TECH ALSO BUT SHE WAS FROM NEW MEXICO .
UHHUH .
AND SHE HAD TO PAY OUT OF STATE TUITION .
OOH .
AND I THINK THAT WOULD HAVE UH PLAYED A REAL BIG PART OF MY DECISION .
IT WOULD HAVE PLAYED A MAJOR PART IN MINE .
YEAH BECAUSE UM SHE WAS PAY OF COURSE BACK THEN IT WAS SO MUCH CHEAPER THAN IT IS NOW .
IT WAS LIKE FOUR DOLLARS .
A SEMESTER HOUR .
UHHUH .
AND SO I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL FOR YOU KNOW JUST A FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS .
A SEMESTER AND SHE WAS PAYING FORTY DOLLARS .
AN HOUR .
GOLLY .
SO SHE PAID TEN TIMES AS MUCH BECAUSE SHE WAS OUT OF STATE .
YEAH LUCKILY I VE PAID IN STATE TUITION .
THE WHOLE TIME .
OH THAT S GOOD .
YEAH SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE ONE THING .
I WOULD DEFINITELY CONSIDER .
UHHUH UM .
TRY TO FIND A SCHOOL WITHIN THE STATE THAT UM I LIKED WELL ENOUGH TO ATTEND .
UHHUH .
THE SECOND THING IS SOME COLLEGES ONLY OFFER THE UH LIBERAL ARTS .
UHHUH .
AND UH WHEREAS LIKE STATE THEY OFFER ENGINEERING COURSES .
RIGHT YEAH .
SO DEPENDING ON WHAT .
YOUR MAJOR IS OR MEDICAL YOU MIGHT WANT TO ATTECK SOME UM ATTEND SOMEWHERE LIKE TECH .
YEAH RIGHT .
AND UM ASIDE FROM THE UH WELL SOME SCHOOLS MAY EVEN GIVE YOU FINANCIAL AID WHERE ANOTHER .
ONE WO NT .
YEAH THAT S TRUE THAT WAS SOMETHING ELSE I HAD WAS I HAD GOVERNMENT AID OF COURSE BUT UH IT WAS WONDERFUL BECAUSE I GOT ONE OF THOSE GRANTS THAT YOU DO NT HAVE TO REPAY .
OH REALLY .
AND YEAH IT WAS SO NICE .
UM .
IT PAID MOST OF MY TUITION AND UM A LOT OF THE BOOK COSTS AND THAT KIND OF THING SO .
WOW THAT S GREAT .
YEAH I REALLY .
WAS IT .
A PELL GRANT .
I M SORRY WHAT DID YOU SAY .
WHAT KIND OF GRANT WAS IT .
WELL IT WAS CALLED A B E O G A BASIC EQUAL OPPORTUNITY GRANT .
UHHUH .
AND IT WAS FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND IT WAS BASED AT FIRST IT WAS BASED ON MY PARENTS INCOME .
MY PARENTS HAD FIVE CHILDREN AND REALLY DID NT MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO SEND ANY OF US TO SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
AND SO UH BECAUSE BASED ON THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN AND THE AMOUNT OF MONEY UH MY FATHER BROUGHT IN I GOT A SMALL GRANT .
UHHUH .
BUT THEN AFTER THAT I WAS ON MY OWN WORKING AND YOU KNOW TRYING TO GO TO SCHOOL ON MY OWN .
SO THEN I GOT A REAL BIG GRANT BECAUSE THE .
WOW .
AMOUNT OF MONEY .
I WAS MAKING REALLY DID NT COMPARE .
UHHUH .
SO IT WAS KIND OF NICE .
UM .
I DO NT KNOW IF THOSE ARE STILL AVAILABLE OR NOT BUT .
UH I M NOT QUITE THERE S THERE S A LOT OF DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS .
WHO UH WHO DO GIVE GRANTS BUT UH I M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHICH ONES THEY ARE AND HOW MUCH THEY YOU KNOW THEY GENERALLY RUN .
YEAH YEAH THIS WAS GREAT IT WAS JUST BASED ON YOU KNOW HOW MUCH YOUR TUITION COSTS AND EVERYTHING AND GENERALLY IT PAID EVERYTHING SO .
UHHUH .
I WENT TO SCHOOL ABOUT THREE YEARS OF MY FOUR FOR ALMOST NOTHING SO THAT WAS .
GOLLY THAT S GREAT .
YEAH IT WAS REALLY NICE .
OH ANOTHER THING .
I VE GOT A I VE GOT A DEGREE FROM ANOTHER COLLEGE .
UHHUH .
AND UH SOMETHING .
THAT MIGHT PLAY A PART IS THE SIZE OF THE COLLEGE .
RIGHT .
UH MUMBLEX .
THE SMALLER SCHOOLS CAN GIVE YOU .
A LOT UH A LOT MORE SPECIALIZED INSTRUCTION .
UHHUH .
AND ATTENTION THAN THE LARGER SCHOOLS .
YEAH .
IN THE LARGER SCHOOLS YOU GET CAUGHT UP IN THE BUREAUCRACY AND .
UHHUH .
AND THEY JUST GIVE YOU .
A TEACHER S ASSISTANTS YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
INSTEAD OF A SCHOLAR .
YOU GET A T .
A .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND UH YOU DO NT GET NEAR THE UH QUALITY OF EDUCATION AND AS WELL THE UH SMALLER SCHOOLS OFTEN TIMES DO NT COST AS MUCH .
UM I DID NT KNOW THAT .
OH YEAH .
UM .
WELL I GUESS THE ONLY COMPARISON .
I HAD EVER HEARD WAS BETWEEN A A CHRISTIAN COLLEGE BECAUSE I THOUGHT ABOUT ATTENDING ABILENE CHRISTIAN .
UHHUH .
INSTEAD OF TEXAS TECH .
UHHUH .
AND OF COURSE .
THE PRICE WAS JUST ASTRONOMICAL COMPARED TO TECH .
UM .
THE CHRISTIAN COLLEGE WAS SO MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE .
BUT I GUESS SOME OF THE OTHER SMALLER COLLEGES MIGHT MIGHT BE A LOT DIFFERENT .
UM .
OH I AT STATE I THINK IT S JUST A WASTE OF SOMEBODY .
S MONEY TO GO THERE .
REALLY .
IT S REALLY A SHAME BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW THE INSTRUCTION .
YEAH .
UM I D RATHER GO TO ANY OTHER COLLEGE YOU KNOW IN THE STATE AND I WOULD DEFINITELY GET MY MONEY S WORTH UH MUCH BETTER THAN STATE .
YEAH HUH .
IT .
S KIND OF UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE THEY VE THEY VE JUST GROWN SO BIG THAT THEY JUST DO NT CARE ABOUT THE STUDENTS ANY MORE .
YEAH YEAH YOU RE JUST A NUMBER .
YEAH THEY RE THEY RE BENT ON UH SEEING HOW MUCH LAND HOW MUCH MORE LAND .
THEY CAN GET AND HOW MUCH UH HOW MUCH OF THE CAMPUS .
THEY CAN BUILD UP .
RIGHT .
AND UH .
YEAH .
YEAH IT S REALLY A BAD SITUATION HERE .
OH THAT S A SHAME .
WELL I I FELT A LITTLE CHEATED AT TECH ALSO .
ONCE I GOT INTO MY I UM MAJORED IN .
OKAY .
YOU PROBABLY UH MORE UP ON THIS SUBJECT THAN I AM BUT THE ROLES THAT .
THAT .
WOMEN HAVE PLAYED IN THE LAST PUP COUPLE OF YEAR IN OUR OR COUPLE OF GENERATIONS .
RIGHT .
WELL THEY VE ENTERED THE WORK FORCE MORE UH YOU KNOW SINCE WORLD WAR TWO IS WHEN THEY STARTED .
YOU BET .
AND UH I THINK THAT THAT IS YOU KNOW VERY SIGNIFICANT THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF THE WORK FORCE TODAY CONSISTS OF SUCH A HIGH PERCENT OF WOMEN .
YOU BET .
YOU KNOW WHERE I VE NOTICED IT MORE I THINK IS I M A TRAVELING SALESPERSON AND I HAVE TRAVELED MOST OF MY LIFE AND I KNOW JUST ESPECIALLY IN THE LAST OH TEN YEARS AND REALLY SINCE IN THE LAST HALF OF DOZEN YEARS I SEE MORE AND MORE WOMEN TRAVELING .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW AS FAR AS BOARDING PLANES AND DRIVING CARS AND CALLING ON CUSTOMERS .
I SELL SPORTING GOODS AND EVEN IN OUR INDUSTRY UH THERE WAS VIRTUALLY REALLY AND TRULY NO WOMEN AS FAR AS SELLING THE TYPE OF THINGS I SELL AND EVEN IN THE LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS BOY .
WE SEE MORE AND MORE WOMEN BEING INVOLVED AND YOU KNOW IT S A IT S A CREDIT TO THEM AS FAR AS HOW THEY RE DOING THINGS .
YEAH THE YOU SEE MORE OF THAT YOU SEE MORE OF THEM UH LEAVING THEIR CHILDREN IN THE CARE OF THEIR HUSBANDS WHILE THEY DO TRAVEL TOO .
YOU BET .
YOU KNOW I I GO TO A I HAVE A CLUB THAT I BELONG TO ON TUESDAY THAT YOU KNOW ONE OF THE GIRLS TRAVELS QUITE EXTENSIVELY AND SHE SAYS WELL MY CHILDREN HAVE TWO PARENTS .
YOU KNOW WHY NOT .
YOU BET .
THAT S SORT OF NEAT .
SO THAT THAT S A I THINK THAT S A CHANGE AND I THINK THAT S A CHANGE .
YOU RE GOING TO BE SEEING MORE OF IN THE IN THE FUTURE PEOPLE HAVING THAT KIND OF ATTITUDE THAT THE FATHER S GOING TO TAKE MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN CHILD REARING .
SURE .
I THINK UH IT S THE AGE OLD THING EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE .
YOU READ IN THE NEWSPAPER OR YOU LL SEE IT ON T V OR SOMETHING WHERE THE DISCUSSION COMES OUT THAT YOU KNOW WOMEN ARE PAID LESS THAN MEN AND THEY RE AND THEY RE DOING THE SAME UH OR CARRYING THE SAME JOB RESPONSIBILITY .
RIGHT .
AND YOU KNOW I THAT S A VERY TRUE STATEMENT AND IT SHOULD NT UH IT SHOULD NT BE THAT WAY .
NO .
YOU KNOW .
THAT THAT I THINK SHOULD CHANGE WILL CHANGE IN THE NEAR FUTURE ALSO .
I THINK SO HOPE SO A .
IT S BEEN CHANGING IT S BEEN EVOLVING BUT THERE S STILL A AN AN INEQUALITY IN THE .
ABSOLUTELY .
WORK FORCES OR JOBS .
IT S YOU KNOW .
YOU KNOW I VE .
AND YOU HEAR SOME PEOPLE SAY YOU KNOW WELL HE S A MAN HE HE HE NEEDS THAT SALARY .
RIGHT .
YEAH THEY FORGET .
ALSO I THINK UH A GOOD ARGUMENT FOR THAT IS IN THE AREA OF POLITICS YOU KNOW IF A A WOMAN CONGRESSMAN I M SURE MAKES AS MUCH AS A MAN CONGRESSMAN AS AND THE SAME AS A SENATOR OR WHATEVER .
RIGHT .
SO THEY CERTAINLY UH THEY CERTAINLY DESERVE IT .
ALL THE WAY .
BUT I GUESS JUST THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THING CHANGED FOR ME AGAIN AS I MENTIONED WAS JUST IN TRAVELING YOU SEE UH MORE AND MORE LADIES OF ALL AGES WITH BRIEFCASES AND UH AND IN THEIR BUSINESS SUITS AND .
AND GOING YEAH .
AND GOING .
UHHUH .
AND I EXPECT YOU RE RIGHT IN REGARDS TO HAVING TWO PARENTS NOW .
THAT S A GOOD A GOOD STATEMENT .
AND I THINK IF IN THE FUTURE .
IT S EVEN GOING TO BE UH MORE NOTICEABLE AND MORE SIGNIFICANT .
RIGHT .
YEAH I I THINK IT WILL BE .
I THINK I WELL AN ANOTHER THING .
I READ TOO THE OTHER DAY THIS IS NOT JUST FOR WORKING WOMEN BUT HOW MUCH THEY RE OUT THERE I GUESS IS THE CAR DESIGNERS UH ARE STARTING TO DESIGN CARS WITH WOMEN IN MIND .
UH BECAUSE IN THE PAST .
THE MALE BOUGHT THE CARS BUT NOW THEY RE SHOWING THAT FIFTYFIVE PERCENT OF WOMEN ARE ACTUALLY MAKING THE NEW CAR PURCHASES .
WOW .
AND THAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR UH DIFFERENT THINGS IN THE CAR .
THE MAN IS LOOKING FOR THE E IN THE ENGINE AND THE WOMAN IS LOOKING TO HOW EASY CAN SHE SLIDE IN UNDER THE STEERING WHEEL .
YOU BET .
UH CAN HER .
MAKEUP COME OFF THE UPHOLSTERY .
GOOD POINT .
AND IF THEY RE OUT THERE BUYING THAT MANY CARS THEN THERE S THAT MANY OUT THAT ARE SELF SUFFICIENT AND YOU KNOW MOBILE AND WORKING .
RIGHT NOW I M SELF EMPLOYED AND AND MY WIFE S ALWAYS WORKED .
SHE S A SCHOOLTEACHER BUT FOR SHE STARTED WORKING AND THEN WHEN I FIRST STARTED MY BUSINESS UH SHE WAS SELLING REAL ESTATE AT THE TIME AND HERS WAS THE ONLY INCOME .
WE HAD FOR THREE OR FOUR MONTHS SO .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW SHE CERTAINLY DID HER PART IN HELP GETTING ME ESTABLISHING IN MY BUSINESS AND SHE STILL WORKS EVERYDAY SO .
YEAH WE .
ALL DO .
YOU BET .

YOU SEE THE OLD UH CIGARETTE ADS YOU KNOW ABOUT YOU VE COME A LONG WAY .
YOU VE COME A LONG WAY BABY .
BABY RIGHT AND UH .
RIGHT .
YOU THINK ABOUT THIS WHEN YOU COME TO WHEN IT COMES TO A SUBJECT LIKE THAT AND IT S REALLY TRUE .

YEAH .
BUT THE FOUR BEDROOMS AND ALL THE REST OF IT SOUNDS JUST ABOUT ABOUT ALIKE .
I THINK IT S PRETTY MUCH TYPICAL FOR THIS AREA .
IT IS .
HAVE YOU BEEN LIVING THERE VERY LONG .
I VE BEEN IN THE HOUSE .
I M IN HERE RIGHT NOW ABOUT TWELVE AND A HALF YEARS .
SO YOU VE BEEN THERE LONGER .
WE BUILT THIS ONE ABOUT UH IT .
S BEEN LET S SEE IT S BEEN SIX YEARS .
UHHUH .
SIX AND A HALF YEARS AGO AND WE SUBCONTRACTED IT OUT OURSELVES .
WE BOUGHT .
OH REALLY .
THE LOT AND UH HAD AN ARCHITECT DRAW THE PLANS BASED ON OUR SPECIFICATIONS .
UHHUH .
AND THEN WE SUBBED IT OUT SO WE VE BEEN HERE A LITTLE OVER SIX YEARS NOW .
AND .
UHHUH .
UH HAVE REALLY ENJOYED IT BECAUSE .
WELL I BET YOU .
WE BUILT WHAT .
WE WANTED TO HAVE TO LIVE IN .
UHHUH .
MY HUSBAND GOT HIS BIG GARAGE .
HE .
HA WE HAVE A THREE CAR GARAGE THAT HE HAS A BIG WORK AREA IN .
UHHUH .
AND HE LIKES TO REBUILD CARS AND REDO ENGINES AND SO HE HAS ALL THE WORK SPACE .
HE NEEDS .
WELL THAT SOUNDS INTERESTING .
I BET HE S ENJOYED HAVING IT .
THAT WAY .
HE .
BECAUSE SOME KIND OF HARD TO FIND ONE PREBUILT .
THAT S KIND OF FITS THOSE SPECIFICATIONS .
IT IS AND THAT S WHY WE DECIDED TO BUILD .
WE LOOKED .
UHHUH .
AT THINGS .
THAT WERE ALREADY UH BUILT AND THE GARAGES WERE ALWAYS IF THE HOUSE W WAS LARGE IT SEEMED LIKE THE GARAGES WERE SMALL EVEN IF THEY WERE THREE CAR GARAGES WHICH IS .
WELL THEN MOST .
WHAT .
WE HAVE .
OF THEM DO NT HAVE A THREE CAR GARAGE .
UHHUH .
THEY RE KIND OF RARE .
SO WE PUT A THREE CAR GARAGE IN .
UHHUH .
BUT EVEN IF THEY HAD THREE CAR GARAGES THEY DID NT HAVE A WORK SPACE .
ALL OF IT WAS TAKEN UP WITH JUST CAR SPACE .
UHHUH .
AND SO HE HAS A BIG LANDING AREA .
THAT S BETWEEN WHERE THE CARS ARE IN THE GARAGE AND WHERE THE HOUSE STARTS .
UHHUH .
THAT HE CAN WORK ON .
WELL THAT MY WE VE JUST GOT A TWO CAR GARAGE BUT MY HUSBAND S GOT A BIG SPACE IN BETWEEN THE WHERE THE CARS ARE AND THE HOUSE WHERE HE HAS A BIG WORK SHOP YOU KNOW WORKBENCH AND EVERYTHING .
WELL SOUNDS LIKE OUR HUSBANDS HAVE SIMILAR INTERESTS .
NOW MINE DOES NOT WORK ON CARS HE JUST PIDDLES ON THIS AND THAT .
OH I SEE .
BUT HE LIKES TO HAVE A SPOT TO KEEP ALL OF HIS HIS PIDDLING THINGS .
UHHUH .
WELL THAT S NICE THAT IT S NOT IN YOUR HOUSE .
IT REALLY IS .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY HAVE A LOT OF THINGS OF THEIR OWN AND I YOU KNOW I WOULD NT MIND HAVING AND I AT ONE TIME WAS GOING TO FIX UP WHEN ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS LEFT A BEDROOM TO WHERE I HAD A ROOM TO JUST PUT ALL OF MY CRAFT STUFF AND .
UHHUH .
SEWING MACHINE AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF BUT I SOMEONE I DO NT KNOW IT ENDED UP I GOT SOME FURNITURE BACK THAT ONE OF THEM HAD MOVED OUT OR SOMETHING .
RIGHT .
SO I DID NT END UP WITH MY VACANT ROOM LIKE I HAD THOUGHT I WOULD .
WELL WE STILL HAVE A A SON AND DAUGHTER IN COLLEGE THAT COME HOME .
UHHUH .
AND THE OTHER ROOM .
WE USE AS A GUEST BEDROOM BECAUSE MY HUSBAND S FAMILY COME .
HIS PARENTS COME AND ALSO THE KIDS HAVE FRIENDS .
WHO COME .
UHHUH .
AND STAY AND SO .
UHHUH .
IT SEEMS LIKE IT S ALWAYS USED AS A BEDROOM .
WELL I STILL ALL THREE OF MY DAUGHTERS ARE MARRIED BUT I DO NT KNOW I JUST STILL HAVE NEED FOR THE FOUR BEDROOMS JUST HAVING COMPANY FROM TIME TO TIME .
RIGHT .
AND SOME OF THEM COMING BACK HOME AND THINGS YOU KNOW .
OH I UNDERSTAND .
AND WE VE GOT GRANDCHILDREN NOW SO .
WELL WE .
WHEN THEY COME THEY HAVE TO HAVE A PLACE .
THAT S TRUE AND YOU DO NT WANT THEM TO NOT BE ABLE TO COME BECAUSE THERE S NO ROOM .
THAT S RIGHT YOU SURE DO NT .
AT TIMES I KEEP THINKING THOUGH THAT MIGHT BE KIND OF NICE .
WELL .
I C I HAVE NT REACHED THAT POINT YET .
I VE HEARD PEOPLE SAY THAT .
BUT UH MY MIDDLE SON IS ENGAGED MY OLDEST SON HAS BEEN GOING WITH THE SAME GIRL FOR A WHILE .
UHHUH .
HE S OUT OF COLLEGE .
UHHUH .
AND HAS A GOOD JOB SO HE COULD AFFORD TO GET MARRIED .
UHHUH .
BUT IS NOT ENGAGED YET AND MY DAUGHTER S BEEN GOING WITH THE SAME BOY FOR A WHILE BUT SHE S STILL IN COLLEGE AND WE RE JUST AS HAPPY FOR HER TO FINISH .
UHHUH .
HER EDUCATION FIRST .
THAT S .
WELL I DO NT BLAME YOU FOR THAT .
WHAT .
SHE PLANS TO DO .
SO I HOPE SO .
WELL I HAVE THE THREE GIRLS AND THEN WE ENDED UP WITH FOUR GRANDSONS .
OH HOHO .
AND LITTLE BOYS ARE AROUND THE HOUSE .
A WHOLE NEW WORLD .
A WHOLE LOT MORE THAN GIRLS .
UHHUH .
AND UH I ENJOY THEM COMING BUT FOR SHORT DOSES .
I CAN UNDERSTAND .
IT FEELS AFTER THEY VE BEEN HERE TEN MINUTES THEY HAVE ALREADY EXPLORED THE ENTIRE HOUSE THEY KNOW EVERYTHING .
UHHUH .
BUT THEY RE FUN .
SO YOU RE ALL BACK TO THE SAFETY CATCHES AND THE WHOLE NINE YARDS OR EITHER WATCHING THEM .
EVERY MINUTE .
WELL I JUST WATCH THEM .
YEAH .
I D I NEVER DID PUT THINGS UP WHEN MY KIDS WERE LITTLE AND I HAVE NT WITH THEM .
I TRY TO TEACH THEM NOT TO GET INTO THINGS .
WELL THAT S THE SAME THING THAT I DID .
I HOPE I LL BE ABLE TO DO THE SAME WITH GRANDCHILDREN .
I THINK THAT ONCE YOU DO THAT YOUR CHILDREN KIND OF DEVELOP THE SAME ATTITUDES .
AT LEAST MY DAUGHTERS HAVE .
THEY TRY TO TEACH THEIRS NOT TO GET INTO THINGS INSTEAD OF HAVING TO PUT EVERYTHING UP .
SO IT S WORKED PRETTY WELL .
THERE S I DO NT REALLY THINK ANYTHING S BEEN BROKEN .
EVERY NOW AND THEN WE HAVE TO KIND OF GO AND SAY NOW DO NT BOTHER THIS YOU KNOW .
UM UHHUH .
BUT ALL IN ALL THEY MIND PRETTY WELL .
BUT I GUESS MOST OF THE HOU D WHAT KIND OF ROOF DOES YOUR HOUSE HAVE .
HERE I M GETTING OFF THE SUBJECT .
WELL WE HAVE .
OKAY .
WHERE DO YOU ENJOY DINING OUT .
OH I GENERALLY GO TO THE QUICKIE PLACES JUST BECAUSE THEY RE CHEAP .
YES DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN .
UH WE HAVE FOUR BUT MOST OF THEM ARE GONE NOW .
UH .
SO THERE THERE MIGHT BE BUT WE WERE TAKING YOU KNOW UH FOUR FIVE AND SIX PEOPLE OUT .
YEAH THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE DOES NT IT .
YES .
WHAT AREA OF THE COUNTRY DO YOU LIVE IN .
I M IN TEXAS .
YES I AM TOO .
BUT .
AND WE LIVE WE LIVED IN OHIO PRIOR TO THIS .
I DID TOO .
I M FROM THE DAYTON AREA .
UH WE WERE UP NEAR CLEVELAND .
OH .
YEAH UH BUT I LOOK FOR SERVICE EVEN AT THE QUICKIE PLACES .
UHHUH .
TYPE THINGS .
UH I DO NT LIKE TO GO TO THE DRIVETHRUS BECAUSE SOMETIMES THEY GET YOUR ORDER WRONG .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND THEN YOU RE STUCK AND IT S A PAIN TO HAVE TO STAND THERE AND SEE WHAT .
IT IS BEFORE YOU LEAVE .
YES .
SO I REALLY DO NT LIKE THE DRIVETHRUS THAT MUCH .
I I LIKE TO GO AND EAT THERE .
BUT I WOULD SAY SERVICE UH ATMOSPHERE AND WHETHER THE FOOD IS GOOD AND ON GOING OUT I LIKE STEAKS .
SO WE TRY TO HIT THOSE PLACES WHEN WE CAN .
WHEN WE TRAVEL WE LOOK FOR WENDY S BECAUSE WE HAVE KIDS AND MY HUSBAND AND I LIKE GETTING THE SALADS OR THE LIGHTER MEALS .
UHHUH .
AND THEN THAT WAY .
THEY CAN GET THEIR BURGERS AND FRIES AND WE CAN HAVE A SALAD BAR .
YEAH .
SO SOMETIMES WE DRIVE FOR A COUPLE HUNDRED MILES UNTIL WE FIND A WENDY S .
BECAUSE IT S ALL .
EITHER MCDONALD S OR DAIRY QUEENS .
UH YEAH AND IN IN IN THE COUNTRIES UNLESS IT S A LARGE CITY I GUESS DAIRY QUEEN AND WALMART ARE THEIR MAIN .
RIGHT THAT S RIGHT .
THAT S WHAT .
YOU FIND RIGHT .
I KNOW .
MY HUSBAND LIKES UH DAIRY QUEENS .
HE LIKES THEIR MILK SHAKES AND THEIR CHILI CHEESE .
UHHUH .
DOGS I GUESS SO HE S A FAN OF OF DAIRY QUEEN AND AND WE LL GO EVEN IN TOWN HERE AT TIMES JUST AS A A CHANGE ALTHOUGH .
UHHUH .
I M NOT THAT EXCITED ABOUT IT .
BUT WE VE EAT WE EAT OUT SO MUCH IT S GOTTEN SO I DO NT LIKE TO REALLY EAT ANY PLACE BUT YET I HATE TO COOK FOOD AT HOME .
OH .
SO THAT MIGHT BE WHY I LOOK FOR INEXPENSIVE PLACES .
UHHUH .
JUST BECAUSE WE RE EATING OUT PROBABLY FIVE NIGHTS .
A WEEK .
UM .
MAYBE .
OR WE EAT JUNK FOOD AT HOME .
YEAH .
UH NOW MY HUSBA .
WELL WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR YOUR FAVORITE INEXPENSIVE PLACES .
OH WE LL GO TO THEM .
ALL .
WE SORT OF TAKE TURNS .
AND WE UH I SORT OF FAVOR THE ONES IF I HAVE A COUPON .
WE CAN GO THERE AND IF NOT WE CA NT BECAUSE IT S CHEAPER .
UHHUH .
SO MINE IS MONETARILY I GUESS STRONGLY MONETARILY BASED .
UH WE LL GO GET PIZZA AND UH AT LITTLE CAESAR S ALTHOUGH THE KIDS PREFER DOMINO S .
OH WE ARE LITTLE CAESAR FANS HERE .
RIGHT .
THAT S WHERE WE ALWAYS GO .
BUT IT S JUST A LOT CHEAPER THAN THAN DOMINO S SO THAT S .
WE GO TO GRANDY S QUITE A BIT .
I WOULD SAY .
YES WE LIKE GRANDY S TOO .
MCDONALD S UH WE VE SORT OF BEEN OFF OF THAT FOR A WHILE AND NO PARTICULAR REASON AND I MAYBE WE AVOIDED WENDY S THE LAST FEW YEARS BECAUSE OUR DAUGHTER WORKED THERE AND SHE NEVER WANTED US TO SHOW UP THERE .
OH .
SO I DO NT WE DO NT GO THERE THAT MUCH .
WHERE DO YOU GO IF YOU LIKE TO HAVE A NICE MEAL OUT OR A BIG MEAL .
A NICE MEAL OH .
WHERE DO YOU GO FOR STEAKS .
IT S USUALLY WHEN WE RE OUT OF TOWN .
OH .
AND I LL ORDER STEAK OR STEAK AND LOBSTER COMBINED .
UHHUH .
SO IT S REALLY NOT IN TOWN .
OH .
YOU EVER BEEN TO HOUSTON S ON BELT LINE .
NO .
THAT S WHERE WE GO TO GET STEAKS .
UHHUH .
THEY HAVE A TERIYAKI STEAK THERE AND WHEN WE HAVE SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE WE HEAD TO HOUSTON S .
THEY DO NT TAKE RESERVATIONS AND YOU WIND UP WAITING ABOUT AN HOUR .
UHHUH .
BUT THE FOOD IS GOOD AND THEY VE GOT A NICE PATIO AREA THAT YOU CAN WAIT AND GET SOMETHING TO DRINK UNLESS YOU GET THERE AT FIVE OCLOCK THEN YOU CAN GO RIGHT THROUGH .
RIGHT .
BUT THEY HAVE REAL GOOD SIGNATURE SALADS THERE AND NICE STEAKS SO THAT S OUR NICE PLACE TO GO .
WE DO NT USUALLY TAKE THE KIDS WHEN WE GO THERE .
BUT WELL WE DO NT GO OUT THAT MUCH I GUE WELL .
I GUESS WE DO GO OUT WITHOUT KIDS .
WE RE USUALLY PICKING THINGS UP QUICKLY THOUGH .
YEAH .
WE JUST DO NT DWELL ON FOOD TOO MUCH AND UH WITH MY HUSBAND TRAVELING HE CAN GET ALL HE NEEDS .
RIGHT .
OF THAT DURING THE WEEK GOING TO THOSE PLACES .
THAT S RIGHT .
SO IT DOES NT REALLY MATTER TO HIM .
HE D PROBABLY JUST LIKE TO STAY HOME .
YEAH THAT S THE WAY WITH MY HUSBAND .
HE S GONE DURING THE WEEK AND LIKES TO EAT AT HOME ON THE WEEKENDS AND I VE BEEN EATING AT HOME .
ALL WEEK LONG WITH THE KIDS AND WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT SOMEWHERE .
SO WE HAVE A CONFLICT OF INTERESTS ON THE WEEKEND .
WELL I THINK I I NEVER HAVE LIKED TO COOK FOOD BUT I THINK IT .
ALL BEGAN EATING OUT WHEN WE HAD UH THE BOYS IN IN DIFFERENT UH BASEBALL .
RIGHT .
ON BASEBALL TEA IT WAS MAINLY BASEBALL TEAMS .
YES .
AND MY HUSBAND WOULD COACH SO WE WERE NEVER HOME AT THE SAME TIME .
UHHUH .
I M NOT ONE .
THAT S GOING TO FIX YOU KNOW THE MEAL AT TWO OCLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON SO THEY CAN EAT IT .
ALL DAY WHENEVER .
RIGHT .
THEY RE THERE .
IF THERE NOT THERE IN BETWEEN FIVE AND SIX WELL THEN I GUESS WE DO NT EAT TODAY OR YOU GO YOU KNOW .
YEP .
YOU FEND FOR YOURSELF .
YOU GO SOMEWHERE ELSE .
SO THAT YOU KNOW THAT REALLY SNOWBALLED WHEN WE GOT DOWN HERE WHEN I STARTED TO SUB MAKE MONEY I WENT OH WELL I LL JUST SUB TO .
W .
HI .
WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK .
WELL PROVIDING UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE INSURANCE FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS A PRETTY BIG TASK AND I UH PERSONALLY I DO NT APPROVE OF IT FOR TWO REASONS NUMBER ONE IS THAT I THINK THAT UH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS A PROBLEM WITH THE DEFICIT RIGHT NOW AND IF THEY WERE TO ADMINISTER THIS THEY WOULD UH GET US MORE AND MORE INTO DEBT FURTHER THAN WE CAN EVER GET OUT OURSELVES NUMBER TWO I THINK THAT THE QUALITY OF HEALTH CARE WOULD GO DOWN BECAUSE THE COMPETITION WOULD WOULD BE DRIED UP AND REALLY NO ONE WOULD BE WOULD ONLY ANSWER TO TO THE GOVERNMENT TO A BIG BUR BUREAUCRATIC MESS AND UH I VE SEEN WHAT IT HAS DONE IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND SO I DO NT THINK UH I DO NT THINK WE SHOULD HEAD IN THAT DIRECTION ALTHOUGH THAT WE HAVE PROBLEMS RIGHT NOW AND I DO AGREE THAT THEY EXIST BECAUSE HEALTH CARE INSURANCE FOR FOR EVERYONE IS SKYROCKETING AND IT S BECOME TO A POINT WHERE BASICALLY NO ONE CAN AFFORD IT ANYMORE .
UHHUH .
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE WHOLE ORDEAL .
WELL I AGREE THAT IT S A BIG TASK BUT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT THE U S SHOULD MOVE TOWARD SOME KIND OF NATIONAL HEALTH CARE PLAN AT LEAST AS A LONG TERM KIND OF GOAL .
UHHUH .
AND POSSIBLY Y JUST STARTING WITH MORE REGULATION OF HEALTH INSURANCE AND THAT SORT OF THING BUT I THINK THAT ULTIMATELY IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO UH AND NOT HAVE A COMPLETELY SOCIALIZED .
MEDICAL SYSTEM .
UHHUH .
IN THE COUNTRY MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT HALFWAY BETWEEN THAT AND WHAT WE HAVE NOW .
OKAY .
IT UH JUST BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT UH HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS ARE SKY ROCKETING WELL AS FAST AS THE NATIONAL DEFICIT .
OH YEAH .
PERHAPS AND SO THAT AND .
BUT WHAT .
THAT S A .
WHAT YOU RE THINK .
THAT S A VICIOUS CYCLE OF COURSE .
YEAH SO WHAT YOU RE .
BECAUSE .
SAYING THOUGH IS INSTEAD OF HAVING THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT UH GOVERNMENT ADMINISTER GIVING HEALTH INSURANCE TO EVERY MAN WOMAN AND CHILD WITH THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE COMPANY YOU SEE MORE OF THEM AS REGULATING THE HIGH COSTS UH THAT PEOPLE ARE FORCED TO PAY FOR IT RIGHT NOW IS THAT .
UM .
IS THAT CORRECT OR DO YOU THINK THAT .
WELL I UH WELL I WOULD NT EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY ADMINISTRATING IT ULTIMATELY I DO NT THINK THAT THAT WOULD NECESSARILY BE SUCH A BAD IDEA AND UH .
WELL WITH THE WITH THE COSTS AS THEY ARE RIGHT NOW DO YOU THINK THAT THE GOVERNMENT UH BECAUSE WHAT THAT WOULD REQUIRE IS FOR US TO PAY UH MORE TAXES AND THE THE IN THE PEOPLE THAT CAN AFFORD TAXES THE MIDDLE INCOME AND THE UPPER INCOME WILL BE PAYING MORE C TAXES TO TO PAY FOR HEALTH INSURANCE FOR EVERYONE WHEREAS RIGHT NOW .
RIGHT .
THE THE PUBLIC THEMSELVES GET HEALTH INSURANCE AND THEY PROVIDE THEIR OWN HEALTH INSURANCE .
THE WELL AS IT IS NOW THE MIDDLE AND UPPER CLASSES ARE PAYING MORE THAN THEIR SHARE FOR THE HEALTH CARE OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY RE THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT CAN AFFORD HEALTH INSURANCE AND SO THAT THE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE NO HEALTH INSURANCE AND YOU KNOW THEY LL GET MEDICAL CARE ANYWAY AT LEAST IN EMERGENCIES AND .
E .
SOMEBODY WINDS UP PAYING FOR THAT AND BASICALLY THE PEOPLE PAYING FOR IT ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BUYING HEALTH INSURANCE SO I DO NT SEE THAT ANYTHING THAT THIS SITUATION WOULD GET ANY WORSE THAT WAY IT MIGHT GET BETTER .
YOU THINK IT MIGHT B GET BETTER HUH I I KIND OF DISAGREE .
UHHUH .
THE REASON BEING IS UH WE HAVE I DO NT KNOW I GUESS IT S MY MY FEAR OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AND ALSO BECAUSE THE BUREAUCRATIC .
UHHUH .
RULES THAT IT WOULD TAKE TO ADMINISTER IT AND UH THE THE HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES RIGHT NOW PRETTY MUCH REGULATE AND ARE PRETTY PICKY AND AND UH DO NT ALLOW CASES WHERE THEY MIGHT THROW THEM OUT OF BUSINESS WHEREAS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IF THEY TOOK OVER EVERYTHING THEY WOULD NT CARE BECAUSE THEY LL NEVER GO OUT OF BUSINESS PEOPLE WOULD STILL HAVE TO PAY TAXES THE MONEY WOULD HAVE TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE AND SO YOU D S I I FEEL THAT THE COST WOULD INCREASE DRAMATICALLY ALSO BUT IN THE SAME SENSE THE THE CARE AND THE THE ATTITUDE OF THE DOCTORS AND THE PROFESSIONALS WITHIN THE MEDICAL UH FIELD WOULD WOULD DIMINISH .
UHHUH .
UH .
YEAH WELL I THINK .
ALL RIGHT .
WELL SHE LIVES IN UTAH SO .
OH UHHUH UHHUH THAT S THE WAY WE ALWAYS WERE WE ALWAYS LIVED AWAY FROM OUR FAMILY AND RELATIVES WHILE THE KIDS WERE GROWING UP .
YEAH .
SO WELL I GUESS WE RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT CHILDREN TODAY .
OKAY LET S DO I .
SO YOU READY MY CHILDREN ARE ALL GONE ALREADY .
UHHUH .
THEY RE THEY RE ALL OUT ON THEIR OWN SO UH DO YOU WANT TO START FIRST YO YO .
OKAY .
DO YOU WORK .
NO I DO NT .
UHHUH .
I STAY HOME MOST OF THE TIME BUT I KNOW THAT IT S VERY DIFFICULT TO TO FIND GOOD HELP SOMETIMES WHEN AND ESPECIALLY WHEN YOUR WHEN YOU WANT YOUR CHILDREN TO BE TAKEN CARE OF .
RIGHT .
UM YOU KNOW THERE S A MY NEIGHBOR SHE TENDS CHILDREN THOUGH AND AND UM THERE S A BIG CONTROVERSY WHETHER THEY SHOULD HAVE TO UM HAVE A A L A LAW TO HAVE THEM CERTIFIED OR OR NOT .
UHHUH .
AND UM YOU KNOW THERE S PROS AND CONS ON BOTH SIDE OF THAT .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE IF THEY WERE THEN YOU KIND OF KNOW THAT THEY HAD TO GO THROUGH SOME KIND OF TESTING .
UHHUH .
OR SOME KIND OF SOMETHING TO BE ON GET AN OKAY SEAL .
YEAH BUT YET MOST OF THE PROBLEMS WE HEAR OF COURSE MAYBE THAT S WHAT WE HEAR ABOUT IS FROM ORGANIZED AND APPROVED DAY CARE CENTERS .
THAT S RIGHT THAT S RIGHT .
BUT MAYBE WE DO NT HEAR ABOUT THE OTHER ONES THOUGH THAT COULD BE .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW THE INDIVIDUAL INCIDENCE OR SOMETHING .
UHHUH UH NOW USUALLY WHEN I HAVE SOMEONE TEND UM MY OLDEST TENDS FOR ME NOW IF I GO SOMEWHERE BUT .
UHHUH HOW OLD .
BEFORE .
IS YOUR OLDEST .
HE S ALMOST A TEENAGER .
OH WELL HE S PLENTY BIG ENOUGH THEN .
YEAH HE S HE S VERY GOOD UM BUT UM BEFORE THAT I WOULD I WOULD USE UH KIDS FROM OUR CHURCH .
UHHUH .
AND THEY DID A GOOD JOB .
UHHUH UHHUH .
FOR ME UM BUT I VE NEVER HAD TO LEAVE THEM LIKE IN A DAY CARE CENTER .
UHHUH .
OR ANYTHING AND I VE BEEN VERY LUCKY JUST BE ABLE TO STAY HOME .
THAT S THE WAY WITH ME I I WORKED FOUR YEARS ONE TIME BUT MY LAST TWO CHILDREN WERE UH BOTH ENTERING HIGH SCHOOL AGE .
UHHUH .
AND UH THEY WERE OF COURSE GONE WHILE I WAS W WORKING SO IT WAS NT A PROBLEM I SAW AND I STAYED HOME THE REST OF THE TIME .
YEAH .
I SO I DID NT HAVE THAT PROBLEM EITHER NOW I HAVE I MY OLDEST DAUGHTER SHE HAS TWO CHILDREN AND THEY VE BEEN IN DAY CARE UH .
UHHUH .
SHE WORKS FULL TIME .
YEAH THAT S HARD .
IT IT S DIFFICULT BUT YET SHE S THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT I DO NT KNOW IF SHE D BE HAPPY STAYING AT HOME .
WELL SOME PEOPLE ARE NT .
UHHUH .
YEAH .
SHE SHE SURPRISED ME THOUGH SHE S DONE A LOT OF THINGS THAT I NEVER THOUGHT SHE WOULD DO YOU KNOW WITH WITH THE FAMILY BECAUSE SHE WAS M THE ONE THAT SAID SHE WAS NEVER GETTING MARRIED AND NEVER GOING TO HAVE ANY CHILDREN .
OH IS THAT IS THAT RIGHT .
SO SHE IS SHE SPENDS A LOT OF QUALITY TIME I THINK WHEN SHE IS WITH WITH THE CHILDREN .
I THINK THAT S REALLY IMPORTANT .
AND UH SH THEY VE USED THE DAY CARE MOST OF THE TIME THEY TRIED ONE ONCE THEY HAD A LADY COME IN .
UHHUH .
AND UH SHE SHE ALSO HAD A SMALL CHILD SHE BROUGHT WITH HER AND IT DID NOT WORK OUT UH AT ALL .
UHHUH .
IT SHE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO SHE WAS REAL EXCITED BECAUSE IT WAS SO MUCH EASIER THAN TAKING THE CHILDREN OUT .
YEAH UHHUH .
IN THE MORNING BUT UH I TH THE LADY CALLED AND HER BABY WAS NT VERY OLD AT THE TIME AND SAID SHE WAS HAVING TROUBLE AND THIS BABY IS THE IS THE MOST PLEASANT UH REAL PLEASANT BABY EASY TO SATISFY USUALLY AND AND SHE WAS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH HER AND SO SHE CALLED AND SAID THINGS WERE OKAY SETTLED DOWN AND WAS ALL RIGHT .
YEAH YEAH .
WELL MY DAUGHTER DECIDED TO CALL THEM AND CHECK AND THINGS WERE NT OKAY .
OH .
HER HER ONE SON WAS WATCHING THE SOAPIES WHICH SHE DOES NT ALLOW THEM TO WATCH THE SOAPIES .
OH UHHUH .
AND THE BABY WAS IN HIS CRIB WITH THE DOOR SHUT JUST SCREAMING HIS HEART OUT .
OH DEAR .
AND THE BABYSITTER WAS IN THE KITCHEN WITH HER BABY .
OH .
AND SO THAT ENDED THAT .
YEAH .
EPISODE AND SHE WAS MOST UPSET UH OVER FINDING THIS .
YEAH I BET .
SO UH SHE THEY KIND OF HAD DECIDED THAT THE DAY CARE WAS BETTER THERE S UH .
UHHUH .
MORE PEOPLE INVOLVED MORE THAN ONE ADULT THEY AND THE AGE GROUPS ARE SEPARATED AND UH .
WELL NANNIES HAVE BEEN AN OPTION UH BUT I KNOW THAT AT DAY CARE THEY HAVE MORE OF A A ROUTINE LIKE AT MAYBE IN UH .
UHHUH .
PRESCHOOL WOULD HAVE WHERE THEY HAVE LESSONS AND .
YES .
SO FORTH .
STORY TIME UH .
AND SO ON UHHUH .
AND THE THIS ONE HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY NICE IT UH IT KEPT TRACK OF WHAT THEY DID .
UHHUH .
AND THEY WOULD TELL THE PARENTS WHAT THEY DID THAT DAY YOU KNOW IF THEY SAID ANYTHING OR DID ANYTHING SO IT KIND OF AC I KEPT THEM .
GAVE YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT YOUR CHILD .
YEAH .
WAS PROGRESSING IN OR DOING .
I OFT I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT IF YOU WERE CHECKING INTO A DAY CARE THAT YOU WOULD BE GOOD TO GET REFERENCES .
YEAH .
UH ON PEOPLE THAT HAD BEEN IN THAT DAY CARE BUT WAS NO LONGER THERE .
YEAH YEAH .
BECAUSE THEY WOULD NT HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT SAYING YOU KNOW IF THERE WAS A PROBLEM THEY THEY WOULD I THINK BE MORE READY TO TELL YOU WHAT IT WAS .
OH I THINK SO BECAUSE IF THEY WERE STILL THERE YOU KNOW THEY MIGHT NOT .
THEY MAY NOT SAY ANYTHING .
RIGHT RIGHT .
AND UH OTHER THAN HOW ELSE HOW DO YOU JUDGE OTHER THAN FROM WHAT OTHERS HAVE UH WHAT YOU SEE UH THE CLEANLINESS AND THAT TYPE OF THING .
YOU CA NT REALLY YOU CA NT REALLY UNLESS YOUR CHILD WOULD BE OLD ENOUGH TO SAY SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
AND USUALLY THEY ARE NT AT THAT AGE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW UM .
BUT IT WOULD BE REAL DIFFICULT TO PICK YOU YOU KNOW TO FIND ONE AND .
UHHUH .
DECIDE .
WELL I KNOW I UH ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO I I TENDED SOME CHILDREN .
UHHUH .
AND UH YOU KNOW I I WONDERED IF I WOULD HAVE TO BE CERTIFIED OR WHETHER THEY D JUST BRING THEM AND .
UHHUH .
AND WE GOT TO WHERE WELL WE WERE JUST FRIENDS AND SO .
UHHUH .
THEY SAID NO DO NT DO THAT WE LL JUST BRING THEM .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND THEN IF THERE WAS A PROBLEM AND THEN WE D SIT DOWN .
UHHUH .
AND TALK ABOUT IT BUT IT NEVER HAPPENED .
YEAH .
TO BE A PROBLEM .
YEAH .
AND AND SO THINGS WORKED OUT OKAY AND THEIR KIDS PLAYED WITH MY KIDS AND IT WORKED OUT WELL .
I IT WORKED OUT GOOD I M GOING TO I VE DECIDED I M GOING TO BABYSIT MY TWO GRANDDAUGHTERS .
OH .
SINCE THEY LL BE GOING BACK AT THE END OF THE MONTH AND SO .
THAT S GREAT .
I M GOING TO GIVE IT A TRY I I I SELL AVON AND STANLEY PRODUCTS .
OH UHHUH .
AND I VE GOT THAT WORKED OUT MY HUSBAND HE S RETIRED SO HE S GOING TO DELIVER MY PRODUCTS SO I LL DO MY ORDERS AND THAT BY PHONE .
WELL THAT WILL BE GREAT .
SO UM .
YEAH .
I LL BE ABLE TO KEEP THAT UP A LITTLE BIT BUT I TH .
YEAH .
I THINK I LL ENJOY DOING .
I BET YOU LL HAVE SOME GREAT EXPERIENCES WITH THEM .
YEAH I I THINK I LL ENJOY .
YEAH .
I I GUESS I KIND OF MISS HAVING A BABY AROUND .
A KID AROUND OR SOMETHING .
SURE WHY NOT .
YEAH .
AND AND YOU KNOW THE GRANDPARENTS UH I ALWAYS HEAR IT S ALWAYS FUN WHEN YOU CAN SEND THEM HOME AT THE END OF THE DAY INSTEAD OF HAVING TO .
RIGHT THAT S RIGHT .
SO .
WELL THEY DO SAY YOU ENJOY THEM MORE .
THAT S RIGHT .
A SOME SOMEBODY SAID IF THEY KNEW GRANDCHILDREN WHERE SO MUCH FUN THEY WOULD HAVE HAD THEM FIRST .
WELL UH MY HUSBAND S MOTHER LIVES RIGHT OVER HERE AND SHE TAKES CARE OF THEM SOMETIMES .
UHHUH .
FOR ME AND AND JUST IS A LOVELY LADY .
UHHUH .
AND I VE ALWAYS APPRECIATED WHEN SHE S SAT WITH THEM .
YEAH MY DAUGHTER .
AND .
ALWAYS SAID SHE WOULD NOT LET ME BABYSIT BECAUSE YOU DO HEAR GRANDPARENTS COMPLAINING .
OH .
YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE THEY RE STUCK WITH THEIR GRANDCHILDREN SO MUCH .
UHHUH .
BUT THEY RE THE ONES THAT COMPLAIN A LOT ARE THE FIRST .
OKAY WELL I LL START OFF BEING CONTROVERSIAL I M IN FAVOR OF IT .
THAT DOES NT NECESSARILY MEAN YOU RE CONTROVERSIAL .
WELL IT SEEMS TO BE IN THE CURRENT SITUATIONS BUT UH I STILL FEEL THAT IT COULD BE A DETERRENT TO CRIME PARTICULARLY WITH THE INCREASE OF SERIOUS CRIME THAT S GOING ON NOW .
WELL I THINK THAT THOSE CRIMES WHICH ARE PUNISHABLE BY THE DEATH SENTENCE NEED TO BE REEVALUATED .
OKAY .
I THINK THERE ARE OTHER CRIMES THAT COULD EASILY DRAW THE DEATH PENALTY AND NOT MAKE ME FEEL BAD AT ALL .
YEAH I THINK UH .
CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN IS ONE OF THEM .
OH DEFINITELY ANY ANY CRIMES AGAINST PERSON .
YEAH .
UH I FEEL UH THERE SHOULD BE MORE THAN A SLAP ON THE HAND .
UHHUH .
AND BEING SENT TO PRISON AND BEING RELEASED IN UH TWO OR THREE YEARS .
ACTUALLY I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE SYSTEM REVERT A LOT BACK TO SOME OF THE FORMS OF PUNISHMENT THAT EXIST IN MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRIES IF YOU STEAL YOU LOSE A HAND .
OH YEAH THAT S A .
YOU KNOW UH IF YOU KILL YOU LOSE YOUR LIFE WHAT S WRONG WITH THAT .
I DO NT SEE A THING WRONG WITH THAT .
YEAH .
I BELIEVE THAT UH .
UH .
WELL IT S JUST AN AN EXAMPLE I THINK THERE S UH SOMEONE THAT S ON TRIAL RIGHT NOW .
UHHUH .
HERE IN THE DALLAS AREA AND THEY WERE INTERVIEWING THE THE A YOUNG LADY WAS KILLED SOMETIME BACK .
UHHUH .
A YOUNG GIRL .
UHHUH .
A PERSONAL TRIAL AND THE REPORTER WAS ASKING A STUP STUPID QUESTION OF THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE WELL HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS .
UHHUH .
AND YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
HOW DO THEY FEEL ABOUT IT I M SURE THAT UH THEY WANT IT OVER WITH AND THEY WANT THE PERSON PUNISHED AND PUNISHED .
UHHUH .
PROPERLY .
UHHUH DECIDING WHAT THAT PROPER PUNISHMENT IS IS ONE THING I THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO WAY I I REALIZE THAT INNOCENT PEOPLE COULD GO TO UH WHAT IS IT LETHAL INJECTION NOW .
YES .
INNOCENT PEOPLE COULD DO THAT BUT FOR EVERY INNOCENT PERSON WHO WOULD BE EXECUTED HOPEFULLY THERE WOULD BE TEN GUILTY .
YEAH WELL .
UH .
I FEEL LIKE THE THE COST OF S SOMEONE WHO S QUOTING FIGURES MADE THE COST .
UHHUH .
AT LIKE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS .
UHHUH .
A YEAR .
UHHUH .
TO KEEP SOMEONE IN PRISON .
TO MAINTAIN A PRISON INMA THAT S RIGHT THAT S STUPID .
AND WELL THE PROBLEM THERE IS THEY RE NOT KEEPING THE RIGHT ONES IN PRISON IN MANY CASES .
UHHUH .
THERE ARE MORE .
SURE .
AND MORE INSTANCES BEING ON THE NEWS .
UHHUH .
OR THIS INDIVIDUAL WAS OUT ON THE STREETS .
UHHUH .
ON PROBATION OR PAROLE AND KILLED SOMEONE ELSE .
SURE .
OR .
SURE .
SERIOUSLY INJURED SOMEONE .
WELL I DO NT HAVE SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEMS BUT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THESE THIS WOULD BE NICE IF AND THERE S PROBABLY THOUSANDS OF HOLES IN THAT THEORY BUT I THINK THAT IF YOU DID SOMETHING FOR EXAMPLE TO AN INDIVIDUAL AND CAUSED THEM TO LOSE THE ABILITY TO EARN A LIVING I REMEMBER A MAN DROVE BY RANDOMLY SHOT A WOMEN IN THE HEAD WHILE SHE WAS DRIVING .
YEAH .
BLINDED HER I THINK THEN THAT A LIFE SENTENCE TO RESTITUTION IS APPROPRIATE .
YES .
I THINK HE SHOULD SPEND THE REST OF HIS LIFE WORKING TO SUPPORT THAT INDIVIDUAL .
YES INDEED .
OR THE FAMILY OF AN INDIVIDUAL .
YEAH .
UH WHO HAS BEEN HARMED YOU YOU YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO KILL POLICEMEN POLICEMEN WHO ARE KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY .
YEAH .
THEY MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN WILLFULLY INTENDING TO KILL THAT POLICEMAN BUT THAT FAMILY STILL HAS NO PROVIDER .
NO .
AND I S .
HERE AGAIN ANYTIME ANYONE GOES OUT WITH A GUN IN THEIR HAND AND CRIME ON THEIR MIND .
UHHUH .
UH THE OPPORTUNITY EXISTS FOR SOMEONE TO GET KILLED .
THAT S RIGHT .
NOW I M NOT IN FAVOR OF GUN CONTROL TO THE MUMBLEX DEGREE OR ANYTHING BECAUSE UH THERE ARE USES FOR GUNS WHICH ARE NONCRIMINAL .
UHHUH .
BUT IT SEEMS THAT THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT ARE THE ONES THAT ARE USING THEM UH ASIDE FROM DOMESTIC DISPUTES HUSBANDS SHOOTING WIVES OR VICE VERSA .
UHHUH .
BUT THESE INDIVIDUALS IF THEY HAVE A GUN WITH THEM I THINK THAT THE THE SENTENCE SHOULD BE EVEN LONGER THAN IF THEY DO NT .
I DO NT I DO NT AGREE WITH THE LENGTH .
WELL .
OF THE SENTENCE THOUGH I THINK EXPEDIENCY IS THE ANSWER .
WELL BUT HERE AGAIN UH IF A MATTER OF EXPEDIENCY .
UHHUH .
PART OF THESE COSTS LIKE THE PEOPLE ON DEATH ROW .
UHHUH .
IS THAT THEIR APPEALS CAN TAKE YEARS AND YEARS .
THAT S RIGHT .
THERE SHOULD BE SOME UH I KNOW THERE S A LAW I BELIEVE THAT IT S AUTOMATIC APPEAL IF IT S A DEATH SENTENCE .
UHHUH .
WELL I THINK THAT AUTOMATIC APPEAL OUGHT TO TAKE PLACE UH WITHIN A REASONABLE LENGTH OF TIME SAY SIX MONTHS .
UHHUH .
AND A DECISION BE MADE AND NOT DRAG OUT IN THE COURTS FOR YEARS .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE OF MISPLACED COMMAS OR WHATEVER TECHNICALITIES .
THAT S RIGHT .
THERE MIGHT BE .
TECHNICAL I THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE A STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON APPEALS .
RIGHT THERE S GOT TO BE A .
YO YOU CAN APPEAL IT ONCE .
THERE S GOT TO BE A TIME LIMIT .
I THINK IF IT IS APPEALED ONE TIME AND THE APPEAL IS TURNED DOWN OR THE SENTENCE STANDS THEN YOU MIGHT BE ALLOWED ONE MORE APPEAL IF IT IS IF IF IT IS .
A A LEGIT .
CONTRADICTORY .
LEGITIMATE APPEAL .
YEAH .
NOT A TECHNICALITY .
THAT S RIGHT .
OF UH .
UHHUH .
IF AND THEY RE NOT ARGUING THAT THE GUY OR WOMAN COMMITTED THE CRIME THEY RE ARGUING OVER WELL WERE HIS CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATED BECAUSE UH .
UHHUH .
SOMEONE DID NT FILE THE PROPER PAPER AT THE PROPER TIME .
UHHUH UHHUH .
THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT HAVE CAUSED THEM TO DRAG OUT I THINK .
THAT S RIGHT WELL ONE OF THE SAD THINGS IS THAT SO MANY OF THESE NEVER ACTUALLY COME TO TRIAL BECAUSE OF OF THE PROCESS IN WHICH THE CRIMINALS WERE APPREHENDED .
YEAH .
I MEAN UH YOU KNOW THE GUY IS GUILTY YOU KNOW HE S DONE WHAT HE S DONE YOU YOU MAY HAVE STOOD THERE AND SEEN IT BUT BECAUSE HE WAS NT READ HIS RIGHTS WHENEVER HE WAS ARRESTED YOU KNOW .
HE DID NT SEE HIS .
HE HE GOES FREE .
LAWYER AS QUICKLY AS HE SHOULD HAVE .
UHHUH .
OR SOME .
UHHUH YEAH .
SOME MICKEY MOUSE TYPE THING LIKE THAT .
RIGHT AND I REALIZE THAT THAT IS DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE INNOCENT IT S ALSO DESIGNED TO LINE THE POCKETS OF LAWYERS .
OH YES .
AND UH I I JUST DO NT THINK THAT I THINK WE COULD GET ALONG A LOT BETTER IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IF WE HAD SOME STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON LAWYERS .
YES .
I HOPE YOU RE NOT A LAWYER .
NO I M NOT A LAWYER .
I I M AN ACCOUNTANT AND I AGREE .
YEAH .
WE PRACTICE LAW OURSELVES BECAUSE IT S TOO EXPENSIVE TO HIRE LAWYERS .
ABSOLUTELY .
TO A DEGREE .
THAT S WHY YOU CHECK BOOKS OUT FROM THE LIBRARY .
THERE YOU GO .
BUT I REALLY BELIEVE THAT OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM IS IS THE BEST AROUND BUT IT S NOT PERFECT AND THAT DOES NT MEAN THAT YOU LEAVE IT IN TACT .
WELL IT S IT S A CASE THAT WE HAVE A A LEGAL SYSTEM WHICH THE CRIMINALS HAVE FOUND A WAY TO USE AND A WAY TO BENEFIT THEM RATHER THAN THE PUBLIC ITSELF .
THAT S RIGHT .
SO .
THAT S RIGHT .
THAT S HOW WE GET CAUGHT IN THIS UH .
UHHUH .
SORT OF A CATCH TWENTYTWO .
THAT S RIGHT .
BUT YOU HAVE TO CONTINUE UH TO PROTECT THE INNOCENT YOU RE GIVING AN OPEN DOOR TO THE GUILTY .
THAT S RIGHT AND AND IT I DO NT KNOW THERE JUST SEEMS TO BE SO MANY CLEVER WAYS TO AVOID THE REAL INTENT OF THE LAW BY FOLLOWING THE LETTER .
YEAH .
AND THAT JUST THAT REALLY DOES RUFFLE MY FEATHERS .
YES .
AT TIMES .
IT DOES .
I MEAN I CAN JUST GET SO .
MOST PEOPLE .
AGGRAVATED ABOUT IT BUT YOU KNOW IT S IT S GOING TO TAKE SMARTER PEOPLE THAN ME TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM AND I HOPE .
AGAIN ONE OF OUR .
NOT LAWYERS .
ONE OF OUR PROBLEMS IS THAT UH OUR LEGISLATURE AND THE STATE AND OUR NATIONAL CONGRESS THE MAJORITY OF THE MEMBERS THEREOF ARE LAWYERS .

I I COULD HAVE ASKED THAT BEFORE .
DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN .
NO .
NO .
OKAY .
BECAUSE I I DID NT KNOW IF THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE .
YEAH .
IN HOW YOU FELT .
UM WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE PROPOSAL THAT ALL YOUNG AMERICANS SHOULD SPEND A YEAR OR TWO .
I THINK IT S A GOOD IDEA .
I THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD SHOULD UH PUT IN THEIR TIME SO TO SPEAK FOR THE FOR THE GOOD OF THE THE NATION AND FOR THE GOOD OF THEMSELVES .
YEAH .
I THINK IT S UH WOULD EVERY EVERYONE GROW UP AND MATURE AND AND REALIZE WHAT .
THIS COUNTRY S ALL ABOUT .
I JUST UM I GUESS THAT S MUMBLEX MY THAT S SOMETHING THAT MY FAMILY HAS ALWAYS BELIEVED STRONGLY IN AND UH I HAD OPPORTUNITIES IN HIGH SCHOOL .
TO WORK IN SOME PROGRAMS UM .
DID YOU .
OH .
AND AND I AGREE WITH WHAT .
YOU SAID THAT IT S UH .
IT BENEFITS THE PERSON DOING IT .
UHHUH .
SO MUCH I DO NT THINK THEY REALIZE AND I UH I I THINK IT GIVES YOU .
A BETTER PERSPECTIVE .
ON LIFE AND UH IT GIVES YOU .
A LITTLE BIT UH MORE A GLIMPSE OF THE THE REAL WORLD AND .
YEAH .
AND IT WOULD CERTAINLY HELP THE COUNTRY TOO UH .
REALLY .
YEAH I THINK THAT S PROBABLY LIKE UH QUITE A FEW THINGS THAT THAT THE KIDS UH MAYBE NOT SO MUCH NOWADAYS BUT USED TO .
YEAH .
GO THROUGH YOU KNOW THEY JUST THEY WERE THEY DID THINGS FOR PEOPLE .
YES .
YOU KNOW FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES FOR THEIR THEIR UH FAMILIES FOR THEIR FRIENDS WHERE NOW I M NOT SURE THEY REALLY DO .
YEAH .
WELL I THINK SOMETIMES THROUGH GROUPS AND ORGANIZATIONS UM MY FIRST WHEN I FIRST THOUGHT OF IT I THOUGHT IT UH WHEN THEY ASKED THE QUESTION .
I THOUGHT WELL THAT SOUNDS WONDERFUL .
AND THEN I WONDERED IF PEOPLE WERE UNWILLING BUT BUT I THINK EVEN IF YOU WENT IN WITH A NEGATIVE ATTITUDE .
I DO NT THINK IT WOULD STAY NEGATIVE VERY LONG .
UM BUT I DO KNOW THROUGH SOME ORGANIZED GROUPS LIKE SCOUTS AND CHURCH .
UHHUH .
UM THEY .
DO STILL HAVE OPPORTUNITIES .
YEAH THAT S PROBABLY TRUE .
BUT I I THINK THAT S A SMALL UH NUMBER COULD .
YOU KNOW BUT EVEN EVEN THROUGH THOSE GROUPS DO YOU THINK THAT THEY PARTICIPATE AS MUCH AS MAYBE THEY USED TO .
NO UM NOT SINCE UM NOT AS MUCH AS I REMEMBER GROWING UP .
AND THAT WAS SOMETHING UH I THINK IN THE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES UM .
UHHUH .
SEEMED MORE COMMON IN THE LAST TWO DECADES .
YEAH .
I THINK THAT S PROBABLY TRUE .
BUT .
I THINK IT S PROBABLY MORE TRUE STILL IN THE IN THE SMALLER COMMUNITIES .
YEAH .
THEN IN THE LARGER CITIES .
YEAH .
WHERE UH WHERE ABOUTS DO YOU LIVE .
WHAT PART OF THE COUNTRY .
WELL I LIVE IN RICHARDSON RIGHT NOW .
WHICH IS JUST .
OH OKAY .
WE RE IN PLANO SO WE RE NOT FAR APART .
RIGHT .
YEAH OKAY .
ONE OF THE CALLS I D GOTTEN BEFORE WAS UH DOWN TO AUSTIN AND AND I KNOW A FRIEND OF MINE TALKED TO SOMEONE IN THE MIDWEST SO I KNOW THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT .
YEAH .
IT COULD BE OUT OF THE AREA .
GOSH I HAD NT EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT IT BEING OUT OF THE AREA BUT YOU RE RIGHT .
YEAH .
I GREW UP IN A REAL SMALL TOWN IN FLORIDA .
OH .
I MEAN A REAL SMALL TOWN .
AND UH I THINK IT WAS JUST MUMBLEX OF COURSE .
IT WAS BACK IN THE IN THE FIFTIES AND I THINK IT WAS REAL PREVALENT BACK THEN .
I MUMBLEX I THINK PEOPLE THOUGHT MORE OF OTHERS THAN THEY DO NOW .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW AS FAR AS DOING THINGS FOR THEM AND AND THEN GAINING BENEFITS FROM IT .
WELL AND MAYBE UH MAYBE THIS WOULD BE A WAY TO GET THAT FEELING BACK .
UM IF WE VE LOST SOME OF THAT AND IT IT SEEMS IN THE LAST DECADE OR TWO UM THAT S TRUE MAYBE THAT S A WAY IF IF YOUNG PEOPLE HAD TO DO IT .
UHHUH .
UM MAYBE THAT WOULD START THE TREND BACK BECAUSE THAT S ONE OF THE THINGS I ALWAYS THOUGHT WAS A WONDERFUL PART OF OUR COUNTRY .
UM .
YEAH I DO TO .
I DO TO .
IS HELPING OTHERS .
I M NOT SURE THAT THAT TODAY S KIDS WOULD GO FOR IT THOUGH .
I THINK YOU WOULD HAVE TO START YOUNGER .
YEAH .
I I DO NT KNOW HOW YOUNG YOU D HAVE TO GO BUT I THINK BY THE TIME .
THEY RE OH EARLY TEENAGERS ANYWAY I THINK IT S TOO LATE NOW .
AT LEAST AROUND HERE .
YEAH I THINK UH I THINK IT DOES HELP UM EVEN PRESCHOOLERS YOU KNOW THEY RE UM THINGS EVEN JUST STARTING AROUND THE HOME .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW LITTLE ONES CAN DO A LITTLE BIT TO HELP THE FAMILY .
UHHUH .
AND AND JUST WATCHING THE PARENTS DO THINGS TOO UM IT CAN START A PATTERN .
THERE S ALWAYS SOMETHING NO MATTER HOW YOUNG AND THEN THAT HELPS DEVELOP THAT ATTITUDE .
UM I GUESS I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE THIS HAPPEN WITH FAMILIES MORE .
YOU KNOW I THINK THIS IS CERTAINLY A POSSIBLE WAY UM TO HANDLE IT BUT I WISH MUMBLEX THAT S SOMETHING THAT I THINK THAT HAS BEEN LOST IN FAMILIES AND I THINK THAT S A GOOD PLACE TO START AGAIN .
YEAH .
I THINK IT HAS TO START IN THE FAMILIES FIRST BECAUSE IF YOU DO NT DO IT FOR FOR YOUR OWN IMMEDIATE FAMILY YOU RE SURE NOT GOING TO DO IT FOR ANYBODY ELSE .
YEAH .
AND I DO THINK UM THE SCHOOLS IF YOU RE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING EVEN WITH FOOD DRIVES AND UH SOMETIMES WHAT .
RICHARDSON AND PLANO .
BOTH I MEAN WHEN YOU LIVE IN AREAS LIKE THAT WHERE THERE S SO MUCH .
UHHUH .
THEY DO NT REALIZE WHAT .
A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE WORLD .
THAT IS .
I MEAN THAT S UH GOSH I M SURE NOT EVEN ONE PERCENT OF THE WORLD IS AS FORTUNATE AS THESE AREAS AND UH .
THAT S PROBABLY TRUE .
THAT S PROBABLY TRUE .
IT S I KNOW OUR CHURCH YOUTH GROUP UH STARTS WITH PROJECTS YOUNG BUT THEY HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL GROUP .
THAT WORKS IN THE APPALACHIA .
UHHUH .
AREA .
EVERY YEAR .
THEY VE DONE THIS FOR FOURTEEN YEARS NOW .
OH THAT S GREAT .
UM AND IT IS IT S UH AND THEY VE ALSO SEE THAT THERE S THERE S A DIFFERENT WAY OF LIFE AND THOSE FAMILIES ARE REALLY CLOSE .
SOME OF THE THINGS .
THAT WE TALKED ABOUT THAT WERE COMMON IN THE FIFTIES ARE STILL THERE .
UHHUH .
AND UH IT REALLY EVERY YOUTH .
THAT S EVER GONE REALLY HAS FELT THAT THEIR LIFE HAS BEEN CHANGED AND IT S CHANGED THEIR PERSPECTIVE .
AND AND THAT S JUST THE T TWO WEEKS DURING DURING THE SUMMER .
UHHUH .
SO IF TWO WEEKS UH COULD HAVE THAT KIND OF EFFECT .
I WOULD .
WELL THAT S THAT S GREAT .
THINK UH .
I M GLAD THAT THERE ARE STILL SOME AREAS .
THAT THAT GET THE YOUTH INVOLVED IN THAT SORT OF THING .
WELL THAT S .
LIKE I SAID I THINK IT DOES E EVEN A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXPOSURE CAN MAKE A VAST DIFFERENCE .
YES .
IN THEIR ATTITUDES .
WELL .
WELL I GUESS UM DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE .
NO NO I GUESS THAT S ABOUT ALL .
OKAY .
OKAY .
WELL I ENJOYED TALKING WITH YOU .
WELL GOOD TALKING WITH YOU .

NO UH MY FIANC3E WORKS FOR THE COMPUTERS FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND THAT S HOW HE GOT IT .
OH OKAY SO WHO DO YOU WORK FOR .
I JUST GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE .
SO YOU DO NT HAVE ANY BENEFITS AT ALL TO TALK ABOUT .
NO .
YOU RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO IMAGINE WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE AS BENEFITS .
OR WHAT I M LOOKING FOR .
OH OKAY OKAY WELL IN IN INTERVIEWING HAVE YOU EVER DISCUSSED BENEFITS WITH SOME OF THE POTENTIAL EMPLOYERS .
NO HUHUH .
DID NT GET THAT FAR .
NO .
YO YOU NORMALLY JUST TRY TO SELL THEM ON YOUR UH APTITUDE AND NOT YOU KNOW WELL HOW MUCH VACATION DO I GET OH WELL .
UM .
WELL I LL TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT T I HAS AS BENEFITS WE DO HAVE UH LIKE MOST COMPANIES WE HAVE MEDICAL INSURANCE ALTHOUGH THEY RE TENDING TO TRY TO REALLY CUT COSTS MORE AND MORE UM WHAT THEY STARTED WITH A FEW YEARS AGO IS THAT THEY ONLY WOULD ALLOW YOU TO GO TO UM SET HOSPITALS IN THE AREA THEY CALL IT NETWORK HOSPITALS THEY RE HOS .
OH YEAH I VE HEARD OF THAT .
YEAH THEY RE HOSPITALS THAT THEY RE UH AGREEING WITH UH T I THAT THEY LL BE A CERTAIN RATE YOU KNOW FOR ROOMS AND CARE AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF TO KEEP CO YOU KNOW COSTS DOWN .
UHHUH .
NOW THEY RE GOING TO START TO DO THE SAME KIND OF THING WITH DOCTORS SO IT S ALMOST LIKE A UM UH AN H M O .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW KIND OF THING THAT UH ONLY CERTAIN DOCTORS ARE YOU GOING TO BE ALLOWED TO GO TO AND GET THE FULL COVERAGE IF YOU GO TO A DOCTOR WHO IS NT IN THE NETWORK THEN IT WILL BE LESS BENEFITS THAT YOU GET .
UHHUH .
WE HAVE SOME DENTAL COVERAGE NOW UM BUT YOU HAVE TO PAY A LITTLE MORE TO REALLY GET SOMETHING WORTHWHILE LIKE I VE HAD A COUPLE OF CROWNS RECENTLY AND IF YOU DID NT HAVE THE EXTRA DENTAL PLUS UM YOU ONLY GET LIKE A THIRD OF YOUR COST WHICH CAN BE KIND OF EXPENSIVE WITH A CROWN .
YEAH IT CAN .
SO I I PAY YEAH I PAY FOR THE EXTRA DENTAL PLUS SO MUCH MORE PER MONTH BECAUSE IT ALWAYS SEEMS LIKE IF YOU RE GOING TO HAVE A CROWN OR SOMETHING MAJOR DONE IT PAYS A LITTLE MORE .
UHHUH .
UM WE DO HAVE PENSION ALTHOUGH I VE REALIZED RECENTLY THAT THE PENSION DOES NT SEEM TO BE TOO GOOD AND I KNOW WHEN YOU FIRST START OUT WORKING YOU RE NOT THINKING ABOUT THAT .
OH I LIKE TO THINK ABOUT THAT .
AFTER YOU VE BEEN WORKING FOR A WHILE AND YOU LOOK AT YOUR PENSION ACCOUNT AND YOU GO IS THAT ALL THAT S IN THERE I DO NT THINK S IT S GOING TO PAY TOO LONG WHEN I GET OUT UM WE DO HAVE A NEW THING THAT THEY VE STARTED A FEW YEARS AGO UM IT S NOT AN I R A IT S CALLED A FOUR OH ONE K PLAN IT S KIND OF LIKE PENSION YOU PUT IN SO MUCH MONEY AND THEN T I UM MEETS YOU HALF WAY UP TO A CERTAIN MAXIMUM SO LIKE I PUT IN A DOLLAR THEY PUT IN FIFTY CENTS .
UHHUH .
SO THAT GROWS PRETTY GOOD AND I THINK THAT WILL BE MORE OF SOMETHING I CAN SEE OF A PENSION THAN THE REGULAR PENSION PLAN .
UHHUH .
OF COURSE YOU CAN BUY STOCK IN THE COMPANY BUT YOU KNOW THAT S NOT ALWAYS A REAL FOR SURE KIND OF THING COUR .
NOT ALWAYS SAFE .
YEAH ESPECIALLY WITH THIS ONE YOU KNOW IT KIND OF GOES UP AND DOWN I DO NT KNOW IF IT S ANY DIFFERENT THAN OTHER COMPANIES BUT YOU HATE TO HAVE IT FLUCTUATE AND LIKE YOU KNOW LAST YEAR IT WAS FORTY DOLLARS A SHARE AND NOW THIS YEAR IT S THIRTY SIX DOLLARS A SHARE AND YOU GO GEE I M LOSING MONEY DOES NT QUITE FEEL AS GOOD .
YEAH .
AND WE GE YOU KNOW VACATION NORMALLY AFTER YOU RE HERE FOR SIX MONTHS AND YOU START TO GET LIKE FIVE DAYS EVERY SIX MONTHS IS KIND OF HOW THEY ACCRUE IT TO YOU AND IT S ONE NICE THING ABOUT T I IS AFTER YOU VE BEEN HERE UH FOR FIVE YEARS .
UHHUH .
YOU GET THREE WEEKS .
OH THAT S NICE .
WHICH A LOT OF PLACES MAKE YOU WORK LIKE TEN YEARS OR SO .
YEAH .
BEFORE YOU GET THAT MUCH .
UHHUH .
AND WE GET SOME WE GET UH DECENT HOLIDAYS UM A AT THANKSGIVING WE ALWAYS GET THE TWO DAYS OFF WHICH IS NICE TO MAKE A NICE LONG WEEKEND AND AT CHRISTMAS WE ALWAYS GET TWO DAYS AT CHRISTMAS THEY FLOAT IT AROUND DEPENDING ON WHICH DAY OF THE WEEK CHRISTMAS FALLS ON .
UHHUH .
SO THAT S NICE SO YOU ALWAYS GET TWO DAYS AT CHRISTMAS A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST TAKE YOU KNOW THAT WEEK I NORMALLY TAKE THAT WEEK SOMEHOW YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
YOU ONLY HAVE TO TAKE THREE DAYS OF VACATION AND YOU GET THE WHOLE WEEK AT CHRISTMAS TIME .
YEAH WELL UM I CAN JUST TELL YOU LIKE YOU KNOW FROM MY DAD AND MY FIANC3E LIKE MY DAD .
WELL THERE S TWELVE KIDS IN MY FAMILY .
WHOA OKAY .
SO THE THE DENTAL WAS VERY IMPORTANT YOU KNOW TO MY DAD .
UHHUH .
BUT UM I THINK THEY TOOK THE DENTAL AWAY NOW HE WORKED FOR UNITED TELEPHONE SYSTEM IT S YOU KNOW .
UM .
IT S JUST ANOTHER YOU KNOW TELEPHONE NETWORK .
UHHUH .
AND THEY TOOK THE DENTAL AWAY BUT NOW I THINK THEY RE GOING TO START GETTING INTO EYE .
OH YEAH .
YEAH .
YEAH I THINK UH UM I DO NT USE THE SERVICES BUT YEAH I THINK SOMETIME LAST YEAR OR JUST RECENTLY THEY STARTED TO GIVE SOME KIND OF EYE COVERAGE YOU GET DISCOUNTS ON UH GLASSES AND I M NOT QUITE SURE THERE S CERTAIN PLACES YOU CAN GO TO THAT HAVE UH DISCOUNTS FOR PEOPLE THAT WORK HERE .
UHHUH .
SO YOU CAN GET GLASSES AND CONTACTS AND STUFF THROUGH THOSE PARTICULAR STORES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
YEAH AND NOW FOR HIS PENSION HE PRETTY MUCH JUST HAS THE STOCK BUT MY FIANC3E .
UM .
HE S ON THAT SAME KIND OF PENSION AS WHAT YOU SAID ONLY .
UHHUH .
FOR EVERYTHING HE PUTS IN THEY LL MATCH IT UP TO A CERTAIN AMOUNT .
YEAH .
LIKE IF HE PUTS IN A DOLLAR THEY LL PUT IN A DOLLAR YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
AND THEN HE S ONLY ALLOWED I THINK I DO NT KNOW IF IT S MAYBE FIVE PERCENT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT HE S ALLOWED TO PUT IN AND THEY LL MATCH IT .
UHHUH .
SO AND UM HE WORKS FOR THE DID YOU EVER HEAR OF THE NATIONAL BUREAU OF STANDARDS .
YEAH .
OKAY WELL HE WORKS FOR THEM THEY CHANGED THEIR NAME NOW BUT THAT S THAT S WHERE HE WORKS AND UM HE HIS VACATION IS REALLY NICE HE S GOING TO BE THERE THREE YEARS AT THE END OF THIS MONTH AND HE LL BE GETTING THREE WEEKS VACATION .
GEE THAT S PRETTY DECENT .
YEAH YEAH OK YOU KNOW OF COURSE IT S A GO IT S FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND HE HAS ALL ALL THE HOLIDAYS OFF .
RIGHT AND YOU GET SOME EXTRA ONES FEDERAL WORKERS ALWAYS SEEM TO GET YOU KNOW YOU GET COLUMBUS DAY AND VETERANS DAY .
RIGHT RIGHT .
AND THOSE ONES THAT YOU COULD NT REALLY CARE ABOUT SO MUCH BUT YOU GET THE DAY OFF ANYHOW .
YEAH UHHUH HE HAS IT REALLY NICE IT S NICE WHERE HE WORKS AND UM HE SEEMS TO BE VERY HAPPY YOU KNOW LIKE HIS HOSPITALIZATION AND YOU KNOW HE HAS ALL THAT AND WITH HIS DOCTORS AND STUFF THEY HAVE UM A LIST OF DOCTORS THAT THE EMPLOYEES CAN GO TO AND IT ONLY COSTS A DOLLAR AS LONG AS THEY GO TO THAT DOCTOR .
OH YEAH OKAY .
YOU KNOW AND I THINK IT WORKS THE SAME WAY WITH HIS PRESCRIPTIONS AND STUFF IF HE NEEDS ANY BUT YOU HAVE TO GO YOU KNOW TO CERTAIN ONES BUT STILL THAT WORKS OUT REALLY NICE YOU KNOW IT .
YEAH WE RE DOING AN H M O RIGHT NOW UM AND WHEN WE GO TO GET PRESCRIPTIONS IT S FIVE DOLLARS SO BUT .
THAT S NOT BAD EITHER .
SO YOU KNOW SOMETIME SOMETIMES WHEN YOU GO YOU KNOW THE PRESCRIPTION LIKE MY HUSBAND ALWAYS TAKES MUMBLEX WHICH IS KIND OF LIKE YOU KNOW CONTACT STUFF ONLY BETTER UM YOU THAT S LIKE A BUCK A CAPSULE .
UHHUH .
SO IF YOU VE GOT THIRTY IN THERE IT NORMALLY COMES OUT TO ABOUT THIRTYFOUR DOLLARS SO WHEN YOU PAY FIVE IT S A PRETTY GOOD SAVINGS THEN THERE S OTHER TIMES THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE THE PRESCRIPTION WOULD NT COST MORE THAN LIKE SEVEN OR EIGHT DOLLARS AND YOU PAY FIVE ANYHOW SO IT IS NT A .
I GUESS WE RE BE RECORDED .
OKAY .

WE GOT A .
OH WELL YOU HAD SOME THERE .
PRETTY FAIR AMOUNT OF SNOW .
YEAH .
BUT UH I GOT DOWN HERE IN JUNE OF EIGHTYFOUR AND THE FIRST WINTER DOWN HERE WAS PROBABLY THE WORST WINTER .
THEY D SEEN IN TWENTY YEARS AND IT WAS AMAZING HOW A FEW INCHES OF SNOW WOULD TURN NORMALLY SANE MANLY ADULT MEN INTO PLAYFUL LITTLE CHILDREN .
OH I KNOW .
WE HAD THIS GROUP OF UH SURVEYORS COME INTO UH A SHOP .
I WAS WORKING IN UH FOUR OR FIVE OF THEM THESE BIG OLD FLAME WORN SUBURBANS AND THE SNOW .
ALL OVER THE PLACE .
THEY HAD JUST COME IN TO GET GAS IN THEIR VEHICLES AND GET THE OIL CHECKED .
BUT WHILE THEY WERE THERE THEY SET BACK DRANK ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE CUPS OF COFFEE APIECE AND MADE SNOWMEN ON THE HOODS OF THEIR VEHICLES .
OH NO .
THREW SNOWBALLS ALL OVER THE PLACE .
HAD THEMSELVES .
A BALL FOR ABOUT AN HOUR .
WELL THE UH THE LEXUS UH REALLY AND THE MOON ROOF .
I THINK IS ALSO AN OPTION .

ALTHOUGH MOST OF THEM ARE ORDERED THEM WITH IT BUT THERE REALLY IS ONLY ABOUT A HALF .
A DOZEN UH THINGS AND .

EVERYTHING ELSE IS PRETTY STANDARD .
I DID NOT GET THE TRACTION CONTROL .
WHICH ALSO WHEN YOU TAKE THE C TRACTION CONTROL AND THE AND THE SUSPENSION THING .
IT ALSO PUTS HEATERS IN THE FRONT SEATS TOO .
OH SO THAT S KIND OF .
YOU GO OUT AND GET IN THAT REAL COLD CAR .
IT S A PACKAGE DEAL .
AND YOU TURN THAT ON AND IT YEAH AND IT .
KIND OF UH BUT THAT S ONLY AVAILABLE IF WITH THE TRACTION CONTROL AND THE OTHER OPTION .

AND THOSE TWO ARE SOLD TOGETHER SO YOU HAVE TO TAKE A TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR OPTION THERE TO .
OUCH .

NO IT DOES NT SOUND REAL NECESSARY IN TEXAS .
AND UH THE DEALERSHIP .
I DEALT WITH THEY ORDER THEM .
ALL WITH THE UH MOON ROOF AND UH .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW NICE FLOOR MATS AND EVERYTHING IN THERE .
YEAH I WORKED FOR LINCOLN .
SO THE ONLY THING .
I HAD TO DECIDE ON WAS WHETHER I WANTED A C D OR NOT IN THE STEREO SYSTEM AND THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH IT .
AND THEY HAD LIKE THREE OR FOUR BASIC PACKAGES THAT THEY .
YEAH .
THEY OFFER .
SOUNDS LIKE THE LINCOLN MERCURY DEALER .
I USED TO WORK FOR .
THEY DID NT ORDER .
ANYTHING BUT THE EXTRA LUXURY VERSION OF WHATEVER .
THEY GOT .
LITTLE MERCURY TRACER .
YEAH I VE BEEN O I VE BEEN .
IMAGINE OR NOT THEY MAKE A THEY MAKE A LUXURY MERCURY TRACER .
YEAH I VE SEEN THAT IN THE DEALERSHIP .
I WAS DRIVING A LINCOLN A MARK SEVEN .
YEAH .
FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS BEFORE I TRADED IT FOR THIS AND UH I M LEASING THE LEXUS .
I USUALLY LEASE THEM .
YEAH .
SINCE I OWN A BUSINESS .
I JUST RUN IT THROUGH MY BUSINESS BUT .
UHHUH .
BUT IT THE LINCOLN RIDE IS CERTAINLY GOOD TOO BUT THE THIS LEXUS IS NOTHING LIKE I HAVE EVER BEEN IN BEFORE .
IT S JUST .
LIKE SITTING IN YOUR LIVING ROOM .
YEAH IT REALLY IS AND IT S GOT A LUMBAR SUPPORT IN THE SEATS .
ADJUSTABLE .
ADJUSTABLE UH .
YEAH .
POWER AND JUST KIND OF BRINGS THAT SUPPORT UP IN THE SMA .
UP UP THERE MAYBE MAYBE YOU .
GUYS DO NT HAVE AS UH BIG A PROBLEM WITH AIR POLLUTION AS MANY DO YOU .
WE WE WE HAVE A TERRIBLE AIR POLLUTION PROBLEM .
DO YOU REALLY .
OUR SUMMERS ARE EXTREMELY UH HAZARDOUS .
UHHUH .
AND DURING UH CERTAIN WIND DIRECTIONS BECAUSE WE GET THE UH GARY INDIANA .
UHHUH .
CHICAGO POLLUTION .
UHHUH .
AND WE CAN LOOK OUT ON THE LAKE AND JUST SEE THE BROWN HAZE UH .
THAT S HORRIBLE .
COMING UP ALONG THE LAKE .
UHHUH .
AND THEY DO POST UH UH WARNINGS FOR PEOPLE .
WHO HAVE UH HEART DISEASES OR RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS .
UHHUH .
DURING THAT SUMMER SEASON .
IN THE WINTER .
IT S NOT AS SEVERE .
RIGHT .
BUT UH IF THE WIND COMES BASICALLY FROM THE SOUTH .
IT CAN BE REALLY BAD .
UHHUH .
UH THE STATE OF WISCONSIN AS A MATTER OF FACT UH STARTED SOME LITIGATION AGAINST ILLINOIS BECAUSE OF THE AIR POLLUTION .
WE WERE GETTING .
UHHUH .
UH I DO NT THINK IT S GOING TO GO VERY FAR BUT IT IT WAS UH A WAY OF UH TRIGGERING UH AWARENESS .
RIGHT RIGHT .
SO WHAT S THE CONDITIONS LIKE IN DALLAS .
WELL UH IN DALLAS I I HAVE NT SEEN AIR POLLUTION QUITE ON A QUITE ON A LEVEL THAT WE HAD IN DENVER .
I GREW UP IN DENVER AND AND I VE LIVED THERE MOST OF MY LIFE AND WE USED TO HAVE THOSE UH YOU KNOW THE POSTED WARNING DAYS .
UH HOWEVER IN COLORADO NOW THEY HAVE THE EMISSIONS CONTROL LAW WHICH HAS REALLY CUT DOWN PROBABLY ONLY ONCE EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS DO WE EVER HAVE POLLUTION SO BAD THAT THEY HAVE TO PO POST WARNINGS NOW YOU KNOW AS FAR AS HEALTH CONCERNS .
UM .
UH DUE TO THAT EMI THE THE EMISSIONS UH UH CONTROL ON THE VEHICLES SEEMS THAT ALL OF OUR ALL OF OUR UH SMOG WAS CAUSED BY VEHICLES RATHER THAN INDUSTRY .
WISCONSIN HAS A A LAW IN WHICH .
WE NEED TO TAKE OUR CARS IN EVERY YEAR WHEN WE APPLY FOR A NEW LICENSE TAG .
UHHUH .
AND THEY ARE TESTED FOR UH THEIR POLLUTION CONTROL EQUIPMENT AND IF THEY DO NT QUALIFY THEN THEY HAVE TO TAKE IT TO A MECHANIC AND HAVE IT GONE OVER AND THEN VERIFY THAT IT IT IS DRIVABLE .
UM .
SO THEY VE THEY VE TRIED TO DO A LOT OF THAT .
UHHUH .
AND I THI YOU KNOW THERE SEEM TO BE AT LEAST IN CERTAIN LITTLE POCKETS AND WE WERE TALKING EARLIER ABOUT MADISON .
UHHUH .
MADISON HAS ONE OF THE NICEST UH BIKE UH ROAD UH SHARING PROGRAMS OF OF ANY CITY IN WISCONSIN .
OH REALLY .
AND ALL WISCONSIN HAS PROBABLY THE MOST EXTENSIVE NUMBER OF UH BIKE TRAILS FOR RECREATIONAL USE .
UHHUH .
OF ANY OF THE STATES .
UHHUH .
AND THERE IS A A REAL PROMOTION OF OF BIKING .
UHHUH .
BUT UM THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF PEOPLE .
WHO INSIST ON ON DRIVING THEIR OWN AUTOMOBILES .
RIGHT .
UH TO GO EVERYWHERE .
I FIND THAT A LITTLE IRRITATING BECAUSE .
UHHUH .
I DO NT THINK IT S ALWAYS SO NECESSARY .
YEAH YEAH IT IT BECOMES UH MAYBE TO YOU AND I .
WHO HAVE GROWN UP IN SOME IN UH UH SOME .
MORE BEAUTIFUL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY UH I THINK THAT THAT UH WE BECOME A LITTLE .
MORE AWARE UH RATHER QUICKLY OF OF WHAT S HAPPENING WITH AIR POLLUTION AND HOW UH HOW HORRIBLE .
IT REALLY IS .
UM I I NOTICE PEOPLE IN IN DALLAS SEEM TO SAY WELL SURE THERE S AIR POLLUTION BUT YOU KNOW REALLY HOW BAD IS HOW BAD COULD THIS PROBLEM REALLY BE .
SEND SEND THEM TO WISCONSIN .
AND WE LL LET THEM TRY TO DRINK OUT OF SOME OF THE LAKES .
OH REALLY .

UHHUH .
THEY LL THEY LL THEY MAY WAKE UP YOU KNOW HOW D YOU LIKE TO OWN A PIECE OF PROPERTY WHERE YOUR LAKE IS GOING SOUR .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE OF ACID RAIN .
RIGHT .
IT .
S UH REALLY A SERIOUS ISSUE FOR THOSE OF US UP IN THIS UH SECTOR UP UP HERE .
DO YOU FIND THAT UM OR OR DO YOU HYPOTHESIZE THAT THAT MOST OF THE UH SMOG OR OR AIR POLLUTION COMES FROM VEHICLES OR DOES IT COME MOSTLY FROM INDUSTRY UP THERE .
I THINK IT S MOSTLY VEHICLES .
YEAH .
ALTHOUGH IT DOES COME FROM SOME OF THE INDUSTRY OF OF THE GARY AREA .
UHHUH .
AND UH I DO NT KNOW EXACTLY WHERE IT EMERGES FROM WHEN IT IT S UP IN THE UH NORTHERN SECTORS OF WISCONSIN .
UHHUH .
THAT CAUSES THE ACID RAIN .
THAT I M A LITTLE UNCERTAIN OF BUT .
UHHUH .
I DO KNOW THAT UH IT IS A PROBLEM .
UHHUH .
I HAD TALKED WITH MY PARENTS .
I I GREW UP UH I WAS BORN IN UH MUNCIE INDIANA AND AND GREW UP A LITTLE BIT IN TERRE HAUTE AND I HAD ASKED THEM BEFORE UH I WENT BACK TO VISIT RECENTLY ABOUT A YEAR AGO AND I ASKED THEM I SAID DID YOU EVER REALIZE THE AIR POLLUTION .
THAT WAS .
SO DO YOU HAVE ANY .
RECYCLING PROGRAMS THERE .
UM I DO NT REALLY THINK WE HAVE ANYTHING IN THE WORKS AS OF YET .
UHHUH .
UH WE RE A PRETTY SMALL TOWN AND UH THE CLOSEST THING .
WE HAVE ARE BINS LIKE OUT IN FRONT OF WALMART .
OH UHHUH .
THAT SHOW YOU KNOW PLASTICS PAPER .

LITER BOTTLES ET CETERA ET CETERA .
WE VE PROGRESSED A LITTLE BIT FARTHER THAN THAT .

OH .
AND UH THEY RE THEY RE ACTUALLY GOING TO EXTEND IT I THINK ONE OF THESE DAYS MAYBE TO APARTMENT COMPLEXES AND UH .
OH THAT WOULD BE GOOD .
YEAH THINGS OF THAT NATURE .
SO I GUESS WHEN YOU LIVE IN A BIGGER CITY .
IT IT REALLY BECOMES UH .
YEAH SEE .

IT S NOT ANYWHERE NEAR THAT .
UH WE YOU KNOW AS FAR AS OUR LITTLE PITCH IN TO IT .

IT S IT S A PRETTY SMALL LITTLE TOWN .
YEAH I REMEMBER MY GRANDPARENTS AND I USED TO ALWAYS GET OUT THERE ON THE ROAD AND PICK UP BEER CANS .

SO YOU KNOW THAT S ABOUT ALL THE THAT WE RE DOING HERE .
UH THEY RE UH GETTING A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THEY NEED TO A LOT .
A MORE COMMUNITY AWARENESS OF JUST WHAT IS IT MEAN TO RECYCLE AND WHAT CAN YOU RECYCLE AND WHAT .
YOU CA NT .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE YOU KNOW NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE DO REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT .
IT S FOR .
YEAH THEY RE DOING A REAL GOOD JOB OF UH SEPARATING IT HERE .
AND OF COURSE THERE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC PLACE TO PUT YOUR PAPER .
YEAH .
AND UH THEY TRY TO GET YOU TO GO AHEAD AND SEPARATE IT BUT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THE DOOR TO DOOR PICKUP .
UM AND IT S UH I THINK IT STARTED OUT TO BE UM JUST KIND OF A TEST A PILOT PROJECT .
UHHUH .
AND IT WENT OVER SO WELL THAT THEY JUST EXTENDED IT .
AND IT S ALMOST UH I DO NT KNOW IF IT S DONE BY A PRIVATE COMPANY OR NOT .
IT MAY BE .
BUT UH THEY JUST GO AROUND TO EACH UH DOOR AND PICK IT UP .
WOW THAT S EXCELLENT .
YEAH .
THAT S GOOD .
LET S SEE .
OH AND EVERY YEAR OF COURSE THE PHONE BOOKS .

UM THEY TELL EVERYBODY ACROSS THE CITY TO UH PUT ALL THEIR PHONE BOOKS IN UH THE UH RECYCLE BINS .
OH .
BECAUSE YOU KNOW PHONE BOOKS ARE PRETTY WELL FOR A BIGGER CITY .
THEY RE PRETTY THICK .
YEAH THEY ARE .
AND SOMETIMES YOU MIGHT HAVE TWO OR THREE .
EXACTLY .
SO UH THAT S THAT S A BIG SAVINGS RIGHT THERE IN ITSELF .
YEAH SEE OURS JUST GOES IN THE REGULAR TRASH .
YEAH .
IT JUST .
HUH .
YOU KNOW THERE S NOT A WHOLE LOT .
AND THERE ARE YOU KNOW SOME PLACES .
THAT WILL SET UP YOU KNOW FOR OLD NEWSPAPERS AND STUFF .
UHHUH .
BUT USUALLY IT S IT IT .
HAS NT CAUGHT ON YET .
I M HOPING IT WILL SOON .
UHHUH .
WELL THE THING ABOUT NEWSPAPERS AND PAPER RECYCLED PAPER IS ACTUALLY VERY EXPENSIVE .
YEAH .
SO WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING .
THAT S ON RECYCLED PAPER THEY VE ACTUALLY GONE TO A LOT OF EXPENSE TO DO THAT .
IT .
S UH THEY RE NOT COMING OUT AHEAD AT ALL .
IT .
S UH IT S REALLY A COST .
HUH .
I WAS NT TOTALLY AWARE OF THAT .
YEAH .
SO .
I MEAN IT IT SOUNDS GOOD TO THE PUBLIC BUT THERE S REALLY A BIG COST INCURRED WHEN YOU DO RECYCLE SOMETHING .
NOW ALUMINUM .
I DO NT KNOW .
THEY MAY BE COMING OUT AHEAD .
BUT I KNOW .
YEAH .
FOR A FACT THAT THE PAPER UH ON THAT END .
THEY RE NOT YOU KNOW .
IT S JUST GOOD TO RECYCLE BUT IT S UH NOT TO THEIR ADVANTAGE .
YEAH .
AND IT COSTS LESS .
HUH .
WELL .
I CA NT THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE .
I CA NT EITHER .
OKAY .
BECAUSE WE RE WE RE AT A VERY YOU KNOW BEGINNING STAGES SO .
UHHUH .
WE LOOK FORWARD TO IT TO GET BETTER MUMBLEX .
WELL I HOPE YOU .

MUMBLEX AND IT S A REAL PET PEEVE OF MINE .
IT SEEMS I I DO WORK DURING THE DAY AND WHEN I M HOME UH YOU KNOW I M EITHER COOKING OR RUNNING DOING .
UHHUH .
THINGS OR UH LAUNDRY OR STUFF AND I HATE WHEN THE PHONE RINGS AND IT TURNS OUT TO BE A TELEPHONE SALESMAN .

AND IT S REAL THE TWO PET PEEVES THAT NUMBER ONE I REALLY FEEL THAT THAT S MY PRIVATE YOU KNOW MY OWN HOME .
UHHUH .
AND I HA AND IF I WANT SOMETHING I WILL GET IT .
UHHUH .
I WILL GO OUT AND GET IT MYSELF AND I WILL NEVER I NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM A TELEPHONE .
OH I WOULD NT .
SALESPERSON .
EITHER NO .
SO I REALLY FEEL THAT IT IS A REAL INVASION THEY RE INVADING MY TIME AND MY SPACE .
UHHUH .
BY YOU KNOW INTERFERING IN WHATEVER I M DOING FR AND I IT REALLY BOTHERS ME .
UHHUH .
UM IT S A LITTLE BIT LIKE JUNK MAIL BUT EXCEPT YOU CA NT YOU KNOW IGNORE IT UH QUITE AS EASILY .
YEAH .
AND I I TRY TO BE POLITE .
BUT AT THE SAME POINT .
THAT DOES NT ALWAYS WORK .
WELL I JUST SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR CALLING BUT I M NOT INTERESTED AND THEN I HANG UP BEFORE THEY CAN SAY ANYTHING .
OH REALLY .
YES AND IT WORKS VERY WELL .
OH .
BECAUSE YOU DO NT HEAR YOU KNOW HOW THEY CAN SAY ANYTHING THEY WANT IT S JUST BUT I JUST FEEL THAT S MY BIG THING ON THE INVASION OF MY THING ON INVASION OF PRIVACY .
UHHUH .
AND UM I HAVE UH I SORT OF HAVE A SORT LIKE YOU CAN PREVENT YOURSELF FROM GETTING JUNK MAIL BY GETTING YOURSELF OFF OF MAILING LISTS I WISH THAT THERE WERE A WAY THAT YOU COULD UM GET YOUR TELE YOU KNOW SUBMIT YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER TO THE PHONE COMPANY AND HAVE A PENALTY FOR ANYONE WHO CALLS YOU TO SELL THINGS .
UHHUH .
FROM A BUSI .
WELL HOW DO YOU GET YOUR NAME OFF THE JUNK MAILING LIST .
UH YOU YOU YOU YOU DO THAT BY UH UM THE POSTAL SERVICE HAS SOME INFORMATION WHICH YOU FILL OUT AND THEY SEND IT S FOR EVERY COMPANY I MEAN YOU CA NT DO IT FOR ANY COMPAN .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW BUT YOU CAN THEN SEND IT AND THEY CAN PRO THEY TELL THAT COMPANY IS NOT ALLOWED TO SENT IT YOU ANY JUNK MAIL .
OH REALLY .
IF YOU GET JUNK MAIL ON A REGULAR BASIS FROM ANY PARTICULAR COMPANY YOU CAN .
OH I DID NT EVEN KNOW THAT .
YEAH YEAH YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE POST OFFICE AND ASK THEM FOR THE FORM THAT YOU FILL OUT TO NOT TO GET YOU KNOW JUNK MAIL FROM SPECIFIC COMPANIES .
OH WOW .
AND I WISH THERE WERE SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHERE YOU CAN CALL THE TELEPHONE COMPANY .
YEAH .
AND YOU COULD SAY THAT UH HAVE YOUR NA YOUR NUMBER PUT IN A REGISTRY AND THEN ANYONE MAKING THESE CALLS HAVE TO CHECK THAT REGISTRY FOR THAT AREA .
UHHUH .
AND COULD NOT SHOULD AND IS NOT ALLOWED UNDER PENALTY OF YOU KNOW BEING REPORTED OR SOMETHING TO CALL YOU .
YEAH .
SO THAT WOULD BE ONE WAY OF DOING IT .
I CA NT REALLY THINK OF ANYTHING THAT INVADES MY PRIVACY BUT ONE OF MY PET PEEVES YOU CAME UP WITH THE TELEPHONE IS WHEN YOU HAVE AN ANSWERING MACHINE AND THEY HANG UP BEFORE THEY LEAVE A MESSAGE .
UHHUH .
I CA NT STAND THAT .
I THINK THAT IS SO STUPID YOU KNOW BECAUSE .
OH I M GUILTY OF THAT SOMETIMES BECAUSE I VE CALLED AND THERE REALLY WAS NT ANY SIGNIFICANT MESSAGE AND I AND I WAS NT GOING TO BE AVAILABLE TO BE CALLED BACK .
UHHUH .
AND IT WAS SORT OF LIKE OH THE HELL I M NOT GOING TO SPEND THE TIME GIVING .
LEAVING A MESSAGE AND UH I LL CALL LATER .
YEAH .
IF I M AVAILABLE THE OTHER THING THAT UM THAT THERE IS RECOURSE TO AND THAT S ANOTHER THING IS WHEN YOU YOU USE YOUR CREDIT CARD AND THEN THEY ASK FOR A TELEPHONE NUMBER .
UHHUH .
WELL LEG LEGALLY NOW THEY RE NOT ALLOWED THEY RE N YOU DO NOT HAVE TO GIVE A TELEPHONE NUMBER .
OH REALLY .
YES AND I DO NT REALLY LIKE ANNOUNCING IN PUBLIC .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU RE SITTING THERE MY TELEPHONE AND I DO NT LIKE THE WA WAY TELEPHONE NUMBERS CAN BE USED .
UHHUH .
WE ONCE HAD A SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE WAS USING A CREDIT CARD NUMBER OF OURS AND HE ACTUALLY HAD OUR PHONE NUMBER BUT IT TURNED OUT IT HAD TO HAVE BEEN MY HUSBAND S OFFICE PHONE NUMBER AND UH WE WERE ABLE WE WERE NT ACTUALLY ABLE TO TRACE IT BUT WE WERE ABLE TO TO DISCARD THE CHARGES .
UHHUH .
UM BUT IT WAS .
I DO NT LIKE HOW THEY A THE I I REALIZE THAT THIS IS YOUR IDENTIFICATION BUT I WORKED WITH SOMEONE THAT GOT HOLD OF HIS .
UHHUH .
CHARGE CARDS .
UHHUH .
AND HIS SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER .
YEAH SAME WITH MY HUSBAND IT WAS THE CHARGE CARD AND SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER .
AND YOU KNOW I DO NT I DO NT LIKE I DO NT G EVER GET ANYTHING OVER THE PHONE BECAUSE I DO NT WANT TO GIVE MY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER OUT .
WELL YOU SHOULD NEVER GIVE THE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER UH IF SOMETIMES IF YOU CHARGE SOMETIMES I CHARGE THEATER TICKETS .
UHHUH .
OVER THE PHONE AND THEN YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY PICK THEM UP AT THE BOX OFFICE WE LL CALL BUT UM THAT S THE ONLY THING I WOULD EVER HAVE EVER USED IT FOR THE PHONE AND THAT WAS BECAUSE I INITIATED IT .
YES .
UH AND OCCASIONALLY I DO ORDER THINGS FROM CATALOGS .
UHHUH .
OVER THE PHONE BUT AGAIN IT S I INITIATE IT NOT THE COMPANY THE OTHER THING IS THOUGH YOU DO NOT HAVE TO IF YOU RE BUYING SOMETHING IN A STORE AND THEY AS AND YOU PAY FOR IT BY CHARGE AND THEY ASK YOU FOR YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER YOU DO NOT HAVE TO GIVE IT THAT IS ONE THAT S A LAW THAT WENT INTO EFFECT I DO NT KNOW A YEAR OR TWO AGO .
OH I NEVER EVEN KNEW THAT .
AND UH YOU CAN JUST SAY I M SORRY THAT YO UH I M NOT REQUIRED TO GIVE THAT BY LAW AND THEN THEY WO NT A LOT OF STORES WILL STILL ASK .
UHHUH .
BUT UH THE CREDIT CARD COMPANY YOU KNOW ACCEPTS THE CHARGES I MEAN IT A REA THE CREDIT CARDS COMPANY S RESPONSIBILITY .
UHHUH WELL IS THERE ANY .
SO WHA IN THIS .
LIKE PET PEEVES THAT YOU HAVE THAT DO NT NECESSARILY INVADE YOUR PRIVACY .
UM WELL THIS WOULD THIS IS LIMITED TO THE PRIVACY ISSUE THE INVASION OF PRIVACY .
OH OKAY .
YEAH AND I GUESS UH THAT WAS MY THAT S PROBABLY MY BIGGEST ONE IN TERMS OF INVASION OF PRIVACY FOR PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE FAMILY OF COURSE I VE GOT LITTLE PET PEEVES YOU KNOW WITH MY FAMILY .
YOU KNOW BUT OF COURSE TH I GUESS THAT JUST COMES WITH THE UH WITH THE TERRITORY WITH A FAMILY THAT DOES A MOTHER CAN DO SOME PRIVACY .
I REALLY .
BUT UH .
CA NT THINK OF ANY THAT WOULD INVADE MY PRIVACY .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW .
NOTHING THAT YOU FELT THAT YOU KNOW ANY EXPERIENCES YOU VE HAD AT WORK .
NO I YOU KNOW OTHE I I REALLY CA NT SAY ANYTHING THAT WOULD REALLY BOTHER ME .
SO MANY THINGS I THINK OVER THE YEARS HAVE BEEN UM ACCEPTED I MEAN WHEN YOU UH THAT ARE NO LONGER DONE .
UHHUH .
I MEAN I CAN REMEMBER WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG MUCH YOUNGER AND I APPLIED FOR A JOB THEY SAID WELL D ARE NT YOU PLANNING TO HAVE CHILDREN WELL I MEAN THAT S NONE OF THEIR BUSINESS .
YEAH .
AND BUT OF COURSE NOW BY LAW THEY CA NT ASK THAT .
YEAH .
SO I MEAN THERE HAS BEEN I THINK A LOT TO DONE TO PROTECT PRIVACY .
YEAH ESPECIALLY BETWEEN WOMEN AND .
HOW DO YOU FEEL .
YOU KNOW LIKE AIDS AND ALL THAT STUFF .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW WITH SE YOU KNOW YOUR SEX YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
I I THEY VE GOTTEN A LOT WITH UH APPLICATIONS AND STUFF AND ARE NT ALLOWED TO ASK .
THAT S RIGHT DO YOU FEEL THAT DRUG TESTING IS AN INVASION OF PRIVACY .
NO BECAUSE .
OR AIDS TESTING .
I THINK IT S FOR THE BETTER OF LIKE I YOU MEAN LIKE FOR WORKING AND STUFF .
YEAH UHHUH .
NO I DO NT BECAUSE I THINK WHENEVER AND SOMETHING LIKE THAT THEY RE LOOKING OUT FOR EVERYONE THEY RE NOT .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW I THINK IT S MORE SAFETY THAN ANYTHING ELSE .
I FEEL THAT WAY TOO I SOMETIMES FEEL TH YOU KNOW SOMETIMES INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY HAVE TO BE SACRIFICED FOR A GREATER BENEFIT .
YEAH BECAUSE I KNOW .
YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE AIRLINE PILOTS I MEAN I DO WANT MY PILOT TO BE SOBER .
YEAH BECAUSE I KNOW I WORKED AT A STILL MILL IN THIS SUMMER AND I KNOW .
UHHUH .
THAT UM I VE COVERED FOR PEOPLE THAT CAME IN DRUNK YOU KNOW ON THE LATE SHIFT OR SOMETHING .
YEAH YEAH .
AND IT AND IT S DANGEROUS I DO NT EVEN LIKE HAVING THEM AROUND I KIND OF DO THEIR WORK FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY MAKE IT MORE HAZARDOUS THAN WHAT IT IS WITHOUT THEM YOU KNOW .
THAT S RIGHT YEAH I KNOW I YEAH I FEEL YOU KNOW I THINK SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT OPPOSE YOU KNOW MANDATORY DRUG TESTING FOR CERTAIN AREAS SAY WELL IT S NOT .
OKAY WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT UH THE SELF INSURANCE BUSINESS .
WELL I WATCHED SOMETHING ON T V A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO BY UH GENERAL EX UH SURGEON GENERAL KOOP .
UHHUH .
AND HE TALKED ABOUT CANADA S SYSTEM AND IT APPEARS TO WORK FINE FOR THE NORMAL COLDS AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT THE EXPENSIVE STUFF HEART UH OPERATIONS AND THINGS THEY HAVE A MANAGED SCARCITY AND THEY SAID THAT IN CANADA THERE WERE AS MANY HEART UH TRAUMA CENTERS AS THERE IS IN SAN FRANCISCO SO IN ONE CITY OF IN AMERICA THERE S AS MANY UH HOSPITALS THAT ARE EQUIPPED TO DO HOSP UH HEART OPERATIONS AS IN THE ENTIRE AREA OF CANADA AND THAT S KIND OF SPOOKY .
WELL I UH I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU RE SAYING AND THERE S PROBABLY SOME TRUTH TO THAT I THINK THAT UH GENERALLY I DO NT WELCOME ADDED GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES HOWEVER WHEN A ANYBODY CA NT POLICE THEIR OWN PROFESSION IT EVENTUALLY LEADS TO THAT AND I THINK THE COSTS AND THE UH THE WAY THE MEDICAL PROFESSION HAS EVERY YEAR I BEING IN MY OWN BUSINESS UH IN THE LAST SIX YEARS EVERY YEAR THERE S BEEN AT LEAST MINIMUM TWENTYFIVE PERCENT INCREASE IN HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS AND I THINK EVENTUALLY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT CAN AFFORD HEALTH INSURANCE AS AS IT IS NOW GETTING SQUEEZED AND SQUEEZED TIGHTER .
UHHUH .
UH I THINK THEY RE ASKING FOR IT I I THINK THE MEDICAL PROFESSION IS JUST JUST PUSHING UNTIL THERE S NO OPTION BUT THE GOVERNMENT TAKE IT OVER AND UH .
DO YOU THINK THAT IT S JUST UH MEDICAL GUYS WHAT ABOUT YOU KNOW YOU KNOW HOW EXPENSIVE NEW EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY IS THAT S WHERE I THINK MOST OF THE COST IS COMING .
WELL I I THINK A LOT OF IT IS UH I I DO NT DISAGREE TOTALLY WITH THAT BUT UH MY WIFE THIS LAST SUMMER UH WHEN WE WERE ON VACATION TORE UP HER KNEE AND UH UH IT WAS LIG LIGAMENTS UH IN HER KNEE .
UHHUH .
AS IT TURNED OUT UH SHE CAME BACK THAT UH WE WERE OUT AT CAPE HATTERAS WHEN THIS HAPPENED AND UH SHE GOT HOME AND THE LEADING ORTHOPEDIC MAN WHO HAS HANDLED FOOTBALL PEOPLE FOR YEARS AND IS AS GOOD AS THEY COME I MEAN HE KNOWS KNEE PROBLEMS OKAY .
UHHUH .
I MEAN IF ANYONE DOES THIS GUY KNOWS IT WELL SHE GOES IN HE SAYS WELL I THINK THIS IS WHAT IT IS BUT UH YOU BETTER GO TO THE HOSPITAL AND HAVE ONE OF THESE M R I THINGS A THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THIS UH OH MAGNETIC UH RESONANCE IMAGING TYPE THING AND MY WIFE SAID WELL DO I NEED THAT AND HE SAYS WELL UH YOU KNOW IT IT LL HELP ME DIAGNOSE THIS I MEAN UH YOU KNOW I I SUGGEST YOU GO HAVE THIS THING INSURANCE WO NT PICK THIS UP UNLESS YOU RE IN THE HOSPITAL NOW A .
OH GREAT .
THOUSAND UH UH DOLLARS FOR THIRTYFIVE MINUTES I MEAN DOCTORS ROUTINELY SEND PEOPLE IN FOR ANYTHING NOW FOR YEARS THEY DID NT HAVE THIS AND THEY SOLVED THESE PROBLEMS AND YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
I SAID TO HER WELL LOOK YOU KNOW IF YOU FEEL YOU GOT TO GO GO BUT I I THINK A THOUSAND DOLLARS THESE GUYS I DO NT KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT THERE S .
UHHUH .
NO DOUBT THEY GET KICKBACKS TO FILL THESE MACHINES UP NIGHT AND DAY AND EVEN IF THEY COST A HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AT UH ROUGHLY A THOUSAND DOLLARS EVERY HALF HOUR UH THAT S RIDICULOUS I I DO NT CARE WHAT ANYONE SAYS YOU KNOW THE COSTS ARE NOT IT S A PICTURE IT SHOULD NT COST MORE THAN THIRTYFIVE BUCKS FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW REASONABLENESS BUT THEY ARE NT REASONABLE FIFTY A HUNDRED DOLLARS THEY DO NT HAVE TO PAY THEM BACK IN THREE MONTHS TIME .
NO YEAH I LL HAVE TO AGREE .
YOU KNOW .
WITH YOU THERE BUT THERE S ANOTHER PROBLEM AND THAT S THE HOW LITIGIOUS OUR SOCIETY IS IF THE DOCTOR MAKES A MISTAKE HE CAN BE SURE THAT HE S GOING TO BE HAULED INTO COURT .
WELL I THINK THAT SHOULD BE THAT THAT S A ANOTHER PROBLEM BUT THAT S PART OF OUR LEGALESE PROBLEM AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT EVENTUALLY WILL ADDRESS TOO JUST YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT S OUT OF CONTROL I I AGREE WITH YOU YOU KNOW UH I WAS ON A JURY OR I I DID NT MAKE THE JURY BUT THERE WAS A .
DEAL WHERE A DOCTOR WAS GOING TO BE SUED FOR MALPRACTICE ON THE DEATH ON AN INFANT .
UHHUH .
LIKE IT WAS THREE DAYS AFTER IT WAS BORN AND HE WAS THE ONE THAT DELIVERED IT AND THEY GOT FOUR ATTORNEYS ONE GUY OUT OF HOUSTON HE INTRODUCED HIMSELF AS SNAKE SOANDSO AND HE SAYS WELL ANYONE HAVE TROUBLE AWARDING FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND I SAYS YEAH I GOT PROBLEMS WITH I MEAN YOU KNOW FIVE MILLION BUCKS IS NT GOING TO BRING THIS KID BACK YOU KNOW I MEAN AS SORROWFUL AS IT IS UH YOU KNOW IF THE DOCTOR IS WRONG YOU KNOW HE SHOULD BE PULLED FROM HIS LICENSE BUT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND AWAY HE GOES BECAUSE INSURANCE PAYS FOR IT YOU KNOW IT IT DOES NT MAKE LOGICAL SENSE TO ME BUT UH .

WELL HOW IS THE MARKET FOR THINGS LIKE THAT IN CALIFORNIA MUMBLEX .
IT SEEMS IT SEEMS LIKE THEY GO REAL GOOD YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
I MEAN THE COUNTRY ANYHOW OUT HERE .
UHHUH .
AND I LIVE OUT IN THE VALLEY .
UHHUH .
AND COUNTRY SEEMS TO BE THE IN THING OUT HERE .
OH .
YOU KNOW EVERYBODY WANTS LITTLE COUNTRY PIECES SO ANYTHING THAT LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT BE COUNTRY IS WHAT THEY WANT YOU KNOW .
THEY JUST SNAP IT RIGHT UP HUH .
YEAH .
OH .
AND UH THIS LITTLE RABBIT THAT I MADE IN UH TOLE PAINTING CLASS YOU KNOW IS LIKE A WELCOME IT S GOT A IT S GOING TO HAVE LITTLE WOODEN HEARTS HOLDING IT IN ITS HANDS .
UHHUH .
AND THEN WELCOME WRITTEN ON THOSE LITTLE WOODEN HEARTS .
OH .
AND .
OKAY .
YOU THINK YOU RE GETTING YOUR MONEY S WORTH .
UH NEVER .
UH THE ONLY THING .
I M I M THANKFUL OF IS THAT WE DO NT HAVE TO PAY ANY INCOME TAX IN IN TEXAS .
WELL THAT S PROBABLY THE NEXT YEAR S AGENDA .
YEAH .
BOY I TELL YOU .
WHAT I SURE HOPE THEY DO NT PASS SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
OH YEAH .
THEY RE FINDING A WAY TO TAX YOU .
EVERY TIME .
YOU TURN AROUND AND I I THINK ONE WAY OR THE OTHER WE RE GOING TO PAY FOR THE BUREAUCRACY I GUESS .
UH IT .
S ONE AREA .
THAT IS REALLY I I THINK HURTING THE ECONOMY MORE THAN ANYTHING .
I THINK THE TAXES HAVE JUST EVERY TIME .
YOU TURN AROUND THEY THEY HAVE TAKING MORE BITE OUT OF THE DOLLARS .
THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR SPENDING FOR ANY KIND OF PRODUCTS AND I I I THINK THAT IS PROBABLY AS BIG A ITEM FUELING THE RECESSION AS ANYTHING RIGHT NOW .
WELL I I TELL YOU UM I REMEMBER EVERY TIME IT SEEMS LIKE WE TURNED AROUND THEY RE ADDING ANOTHER NICKEL OR .
THAT S RIGHT .
A FEW MORE CENTS ONTO THE PRICE OF GASOLINE .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND ACTUALLY THAT ONE THE THE THE TAXES ON GASOLINE DO NT DO NT BUG ME AS MUCH AS UH UH WHAT ARE WE EIGHT AND A QUARTER PERCENT SALES TAX .
YEP THAT S RIGHT .
AND EVERY TIME .
YOU GO TO BUY ANYTHING NOW UH EVEN YOU KNOW THEY THEY TAX FOOD .
THAT S THE ONE THAT REALLY KIND OF BOTHERS ME .
WELL I THINK THAT UH THAT THE PROBLEM WITH THE SALES TAX OF COURSE IS IT S AN UNFAIR TAX ACROSS THE BOARD UH AS FAR AS ABILITY TO PAY WHICH A ALLEGEDLY ALLEGEDLY TAXES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DIRECTED TOWARDS .
BUT UH NOW PEOPLE WITH THE LOWEST INCOME PAY A HUNDRED PERCENT ALMOST OF YOU KNOW TAXES ON EVERYTHING .
THEY BUY AND WHERE PEOPLE .
THAT MAKE YOU KNOW TWO HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS .
A YEAR CERTAINLY A PORTION OF THAT THEY ARE NT GOING TO BE PAYING TAXES ON YOU KNOW .
AND UH THAT S THE UNFAIR EQUITY INEQUITIES OF SALES TAX AS A MAIN SOURCE OF REVENUE BUT I DO NT THINK IT IS ANYMORE NOT IN TEXAS ANYWAY .
OH I GOT YOU BECAUSE PEOPLE .
THAT UH DO NT MAKE VERY MUCH MONEY WIND UP SPENDING IT .
ALL .
THAT S RIGHT THAT S RIGHT .
YEAH WHATEVER .
THEY SPENT IT ON THEY HAVE TO PAY TAX ON .
THAT S RIGHT THAT S RIGHT .
AND THAT S THE UNFAIRNESS OF THE THING BUT UH I THINK TAXES GENERALLY ARE UNFAIR SO .
WHA WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT NEW LUXURY CAR TAX ANYTHING OVER TEN THOU OR THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS .
WELL YOU KNOW LIKE OTHER THINGS IF THEY DO NT AFFECT YOU YOU DO NT WORRY ABOUT THEM TOO MUCH .
I HAVE TROUBLE BUYING A TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLAR CAR STILL SO IT DOES NT I I THINK UH YOU KNOW GENERALLY THE PRICES OF CARS HAVE GOTTEN OUT OF LINE WHICH IS UH YOU KNOW .
OH SURE .
AND UH I GUESS IF PEOPLE GOT THIRTY FORTY THOUSAND BUCKS TO SPEND ON A CAR UH THAT S THEIR PREROGATIVE YOU KNOW .
I I I DO NT HAVE A WHOLE OF SYMPATHY ON THAT .
YOU MAYBE YOU BUY THAT YOU KNOW AND I DO NT MEAN TO BE KNOCKING UH .
NO UH NO I HAVE NT BUT IT IT TO ME .
IT SEEMS REALLY INTERESTING THAT THEY COME ALONG AND ADD ANOTHER TEN PERCENT TAX UH ON TOP OF IT .
AND THERE S AN AWFUL LOT OF CARS .
THAT COST MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND .
YEAH THERE ARE THERE ARE .
AND THE IDEA OF THAT KIND OF TAXATION IS TO HAVE PEOPLE THINK TWICE ON PUTTING THEIR MONEY INTO THAT I GUESS YOU KNOW UNLESS THEY REALLY WANT IT BUY SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW MORE WELL IT IT S JUST LIKE HAVING TAXES ON OR EXEMPTIONS FOR KIDS YOU KNOW .
IT S A WAY OF INCREASING THE POPULATION THAT THAT WAS ONE OF THE INITIAL IDEAS OF YOU KNOW GIVING EXEMPTIONS ON KIDS ON ON FEDERAL TAXES .
YEAH .
AND WHERE YOU EXEMPT THINGS LIKE UH UH ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I HEARD ON TAXES TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY SOMEONE BRILLIANT DEDUCTOR PROBABLY LLOYD BENTSEN SAID THAT ALL YOU KNOW IF THEY GAVE BACK THE DEDUCTIONS ON CREDIT CARDS ON YOUR FEDERAL TAXES .
RIGHT .
PEOPLE WOULD PROBABLY BE YOU KNOW SPENDING MORE MONEY USING THEIR CREDIT CARDS .
RIGHT .
NOW I DO NT KNOW IF THAT S TRUE OR NOT BUT IF YOU LOOK ON ALL INTEREST THINGS NOT JUST CREDIT CARDS BUT ON YOUR CARS AND YOU KNOW A ANY KIND OF INTEREST THAT YOU RE PAYING FROM A PERSONAL POINT OF VIEW THAT MIGHT MAKE CERTAIN SENSE IN STIMULATING CONSUMER PURCHASERS .
SURE .
SO THAT S A LOT OF THE GAMES THAT POLITICIANS PLAY ON WHERE THEY WANT TO GO YOU KNOW TAX THINGS THAT THEY DO NT YOU KNOW TO A DEGREE WELL LIKE BOOZE YOU KNOW EXAMPLE THEY KEEP RAISING THE TAXES ON BOOZE IT GETS TO THE POINT YOU KNOW IT MAKES DRUNKS SOBER YOU KNOW .
THEY QUIT BUYING IT .
WELL WHAT WHAT ABOUT THE TAXES ON CIGARETTES .
OKAY I I GUESS FIRST OF ALL I LL JUST SAY WE HAVE NT DONE MUCH UH GARDENING WE DO LAWN WORK ALL THE TIME BUT UH OUR GARDENING WE LOST REMEMBER THE LAST TWO FREEZES I DO NT KNOW HOW LONG YOU VE BEEN HERE .
YEAH I DO .
BUT WE LOST OUR BUSHES IN THOSE AND HAVE BEEN WAITING TO PLANT NEW ONES AND SO AS FAR AS OUR BUSHES WE DO NT HAVE ANY BUT WE DO HAVE SOME BLACKBERRY BUSHES AND .
OH REALLY .
AND THEY WERE REALLY HEARTY AND STAYED ON AND WE VE DONE REALLY WELL WITH THEM .
DID YOU PLANT THOSE YOURSELF .
UHHUH YEAH .
OH .
AND SO THEY VE BEEN REALLY GOOD AND THE KIDS I HAD TO .
THE FIRST YEAR I HAD TO TELL THE KIDS NOT TO PICK THEM WHEN THEY WERE RED BECAUSE THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE BLACKBERRIES BUT UH WE GO OUT IT IT S HARD TO GO OUT WHEN IT S THIS HOT .
UHHUH .
AND UH BUT UH KEEP THE WEEDS OUT OF THEM AND AND KEEP THEM OFF THE GROUND SO THE ANTS DO NT EAT THEM AND THEY RE OKAY .
OH .
YEAH UH .
THAT S NICE I I LOVE BLACKBERRIES AND WE UH WHEN I WAS SMALLER WE MY FAMILY LIVED IN TENNESSEE .

AND THERE USED TO BE WILD BLACKBERRIES THAT WE D GO OUT AND PICK MY BROTHER AND I BUT I DO NT HAVE ANY DOWN HERE .

OH I THINK I KNOW WHAT THEY .

OH .
DROPS AND AND THEY LOOK REAL PRETTY AFTER THE RAIN AND SO I REALLY LIKE THEM BUT I NEED TO GET OUT AND AND UM DO THAT NOW AS FAR AS OUR GRASS IT GROWS CRAZY HERE IT JUST KEEPS GROWING AND GROWING AND .
UH SOMETIMES MY HUSBAND DOES IT AND SOMETIMES MY SON DOES IT BUT IT JUST IS I DO NT I DO NT KNOW I VE LIVED IN UTAH MY WHOLE LIFE AND WE CA NT SEEM TO GET OURS GREEN I DO NT KNOW .
DOWN HERE THE GRASS .
YEAH .
WELL I M MUMBLEX WE VE HAD PROBLEMS WITH OUR YARD WE IT WAS ONE BIG WEED IS WHAT IT WAS .
UHHUH .
IT WAS JUST HORRIBLE AND MY NEIGHBORS ON EITHER SIDE OF ME HAVE BEAUTIFUL LAWNS AND WE HAVE THIS GOD AWFUL UGLY THING AND .
CRAPPY I KNOW WE HAVE THAT TOO .
AND I KNOW THEY MUST THINK YOU KNOW I WISH THOSE PEOPLE WOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR YARD BUT MY HUSBAND GOT SOME NEW FERTILIZER AND STUFF THAT THAT SEEMS TO BE HELPING AND HE PUT IT ON THE FRONT YARD .
UHHUH .
TO SEE HOW YOU KNOW IT WOULD DO AND STUFF BEFORE HE PUT IT ON THE BACKYARD BUT WE VE GOT A GREAT DANE IN THE BACK .
UHHUH .
AND SHE HAS EATEN EVERYTHING I HAVE PUT OUT THERE SHE S EATEN MY CREPE MYRTLE TREES .
OH DEAR .
I KNOW AND SHE S EATEN THE BUSHES I VE TRIED TO I SPENT LIKE EIGHT HOURS PLANTING THIS NICE GARDEN OUT THERE .
NO .
AND I BARRICADED IT UP .
SO SHE COULD NT GET INTO IT .
UHHUH .
AND I WENT AND TOOK A SHOWER AND LOOKED BACK OUT THERE AND SHE WAS ALREADY IN IT AND I WAS SO MAD .
HAD SOMEHOW GOTTEN IN .
SO I CA NT DO ANYTHING BACK .
YEAH .
THERE .
YEAH .
BECAUSE SHE JUST SHE DESTROYS IT BUT I VE TRIED OUT IN THE FRONT BUT LIKE YOU SAID THAT THAT FREEZE THAT CAME .
UHHUH .
I HAD SOME BUSHES THAT UH SOME SHRUBS I PU PUT OUT FRONT AND IT KILLED THOSE TOO SO I M JUST REAL DISCOURAGED WITH THE WHOLE THING I JUST DO NT EVEN WANT TO DO ANYTHING .
THE THE OTHER PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE WELL IT S FUNNY BECAUSE THE ONE THE TWO BUSHES ON THE ENDS OF THE HOUSE THAT I THINK ARE UGLY THEY LIVED AND SO I I DO NT KNOW .
YEAH THAT THAT HAPPENED TO US WE HAVE THESE .
SO LIKE I WANTED TO GO OUT AND KILL THEM TOO .
I KNOW .
THEY HAD NO RIGHT TO LIVE BUT ANYWAY UH UNDER OUR TREES WE GET A A NORTH SUN AND UH THE IT LOOKS LIKE OUR TREES DO NT HAVE ANY GRASS UNDER THEM .
OH I KNOW OURS DO NT .
AND WE JUST CA NT GROW UH GRASS UNDERNEATH THERE .
I KNOW WE CA NT EITHER BUT I VE GOT PRE TWO GOOD SIZE COTTONWOOD TREES OUT IN MY FRONT YARD UH YOU KNOW ONE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE YARD .
UHHUH .
AND AND THEY RE BIG AND MUMBLEX THEY RE REAL FULL AND EVERYTHING YOU KNOW IN THE SUMMER TIME BUT IT IT S KILLING EVERYTHING UNDERNEATH .
YEAH .
WHERE THE LEAVES ARE SHADING THE TREE BUT TOWARD THE END OF THE SUMMER YOU KNOW WHEN EVERYTHING STARTS DYING OFF AND WHATNOT AND THEN THE LIGHT CAN GET THROUGH THE TREE THEN THE GRASS STARTS GROWING BUT BY THEN IT S SO LATE THEN THE WINTER COMES AND IT STOPS YOU KNOW IT S IT S .
RIGHT .
IT S A NEVER ENDING CYCLE .
IT S A VICIOUS CYCLE .
IS NT IT .
YEAH IT REALLY IS .
IT JUST REALLY .
SO WE VE BEEN TRYING TO GET SOMETHING OR TO PULL SOME GRASS UNDERNEATH THERE AND AND WHATNOT SO .
WELL I DO NT WE VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS BUT WE VE BEEN THINKING YOU KNOW IF WE BUILT UP UH YOU KNOW EITHER A WOOD WOODEN LIKE TRENCH THING AROUND WHERE OUR BUSHES WERE AND FILLED IT LIKE WITH A NICE DIRT .
UHHUH .
THEN MAYBE WE COULD PLANT SOME EITHER FLOWERS .
OR OR SOME NEW BUSHES IN THERE THAT WOULD LIVE AND SO I THINK THAT WE RE GOING TO TRY THAT .
HUH .
I I THINK THE I THINK THAT S PRETTY MUCH WHAT WE HAVE DECIDED NOW I HAVE TWO LONG WINDOWS AND I M TRYING TO DECIDE WHETHER TO PUT LIKE BUSHES IN FRONT OF THEM OR NOT .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW MAYBE JUST HALFWAY UP THE WINDOW OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO PEOPLE CA NT SEE AND HEAR TOO MUCH .
REALLY C WELL I DO NT REALLY HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT THAT MUCH BECAUSE MY SONS BEDROOMS ARE IN THE FRONT AND THEY VE GOT MINIBLINDS AND STUFF .
YEAH .
BUT ONLY ONLY ONE IS REALLY LIKE IN THE FLOWER BED PART AND THE OTHER ONE IS OUT ON THE PORCH .
YEAH .
SO THERE S NOT REALLY MUCH I CAN DO ABOUT THAT .
THAT S WHAT OUR TWO ROOMS ARE ON THE FRONT TOO WITH THESE LONG WINDOWS ONE IS A BEDROOM FOR OUR OUR OLDEST SON AND ONE IS UH AN OFFICE THAT MY HUSBAND AND I WORK IN AND SO I I REALLY DO NT LIKE IT TOO MUCH BECAUSE THEN THE BACK OF OUR HOUSE FACES THAT WELL THE FLOWERS ARE OUT BY THE BACK OF THE HOUSE SO AND THAT S WHY THE FRONT ROOM IS SO THAT S NOT TOO BAD .
YEAH .
BUT I LIKE TO LOOK AT THE FLOWERS THEY RE PRETTY .
I DO TOO THAT S WHY I LOOK AT MY NEIGHBORS YARD .
YEAH .
I DO NT HAVE ANYTHING TO LOOK AT SO I LOOK AT THEIRS .
BUT IT S FUNNY BECAUSE UH YOU TRY SO HARD I THINK SOMETIMES TO TO ANYWAY I DO TO DO OUR YARD .
UHHUH .
AND THEN IT S LIKE THE WIND BLOWS EVERYTHING WHETHER THE WEEDS FROM YOUR YARD TO YOUR NEIGHBORS OR YOURS .
YEAH .
TO THEM OR AND SO EVEN IF YOU DID GET IT UNDER CONTROL IT SEEMS LIKE IN JUST A FEW MONTHS IT WOULD ALL BE BACK AND .
YEAH IT IT S REALLY A PAIN MY HUSBAND WORKS A LOT SO UM A LOT .
IT S HARD TO GET OUT A LOT AND DO THAT YARD WORK .
YEAH I M IT S USUALLY ME AND THE KIDS THAT GO OUT AND MOW THE YARD AND .
UHHUH .
AND I JUST I REALLY DO NOT APPRECIATE HAVING TO GO OUT THERE AND DO IT I HATE TO MOW THE YARD MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE I HATE TO MOW THAT YARD .
I KNOW IT IS IT S NOT MY FAVORITE .
THING IN THE WORLD EITHER I M GLAD I HAVE AN OLD ENOUGH SON TO DO IT FOR ME NOW .
YEAH WELL MINE S GETTING THERE HE HELPS HE DOES HALF AND I DO HALF SO .
UHHUH .
PRETTY SOON THOUGH BY NEXT YEAR HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO IT ALL BY HIMSELF .
YEAH .
WHETHER HE LIKES IT OR NOT .
YEAH WELL THAT IS ONE CHORE THAT WE WILL PAY HIM FOR IF HE LL GO DO THE YARD WORK OUT OUTSIDE SO .
OH SURE I LL BE MORE THEN GLAD TO PAY HIM .
YEAH .
IF HE D JUST GO OUT THERE AND DO IT .
AND AND DO IT TO WHERE I DO NT HAVE TO GO BACK OUT AND REDO IT .
RIGHT EXACTLY .
THAT THAT S MY ONLY THING WITH HIM .
EXACTLY .
THAT S WHY I M HELP HAVING HIM HELP ME NOW .
UH SO MY FAVORITE TEAM IS ABOUT THE RANGERS .
IS IT I D HAVE TO AGREE WITH THAT THEY ARE MY FAVORITE TEAM TOO .
YEAH .
A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING THE LAST FEW YEARS .
I M TELLING YOU YOU THINK THEY LL SIGN RUBEN .
YOU KNOW .
NO .
I REALLY DO NT I JUST DO NT THINK YOU KNOW WITH THAT GUY FROM PITTSBURGH GETTING ALL THAT MONEY TWENTYSEVEN OR TWENTYNINE MILLION OR WHATEVER IT WAS I JUST DO NT THINK THAT THEY RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SIGN RUBEN SIERRA AND IT S JUST GOING TO BE A SHAME FOR YOU KNOW OUR AREA .
RIGHT YEAH I THINK IT S GOING TO HAVE A BIG EFFECT IF THEY DO NT ON THE OTHER UH HISPANIC PLAYERS .
OH I DO TOO I JUST .
I THINK .
THE MAIN THING .
THAT S GOING TO BE THE BIG PROBLEM .
IT S JUST GOING TO EFFECT ON THE THE TEAM YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
WE JUST CA NT SEEM TO YOU KNOW I THINK WE VE BEEN IN THIS SPOT I THINK WE FINISHED SECOND ONCE OR MAYBE EVEN TWICE I DO NT KNOW I .
YEAH .
I M I HAVE NT BEEN TO A BASEBALL GAME IN A COUPLE OF YEARS IT S JUST IT S JUST TOO DISAPPOINTING I JUST WATCH THEM FALL EVERY YEAR .
RIGHT .
I WAS A PETE INCAVIGLIA FAN AND UH .
OH .
I LIKED HIM BUT OF COURSE I UNDERSTAND BASEBALL DECISIONS ARE ALL JUST DECISIONS LIKE THAT HAVE TO BE MADE BY SOMEONE GLAD IT S NOT ME MAKING THEM .
RIGHT I THINK THEY JUST WANT TO STAY MEDIOCRE AND DRAW THEIR TWO MILLION FANS OUT THERE AND THEN BE HAPPY WITH IT AND NOT HAVE TO PAY THE BUCKS TO GET A CONTENDER IN HERE BUT .
THEY SAY AS LONG AS THEY DRAW UP TWO MILLION FANS THAT .
RIGHT .
GREAVE AND VALENTINE WILL BE THERE .
RIGHT YEAH .
SO AND THAT S THE NAME OF THE GAME TOO YOU GOT TO MAKE MONEY .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW PAY THESE PLAYERS SO MUCH MONEY NOW IT S JUST .
RIGHT .
IT S FRIGHTENING YOU AND I SHOULD BE SO LUCKY TO YOU KNOW TO GO OUT AND SWING A BAT AND GET TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS EVERY TIME YOU SWING THE BAT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
THAT S TRUE BUT UH THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT TRADING HIM IF THEY RE NOT ABLE TO SIGN HIM AND UH USE THE MONEY THAT IT WOULD TAKE TO SIGN THE GUY YOU KNOW TO PAY FOR PITCHERS OR YOU KNOW WHAT IT WHAT IT WHAT THEY WHAT ELSE THEY NEED BECAUSE THEY VE GOT THE HITTING BUT THEY NEED THE PITCHING .
YEAH THEY REALLY DO .
UM .
I THINK THEY UH I THINK THEY NEED THEM ALL I JUST DO NT UNDER I UNDERSTAND THE BIG CITIES LIKE IN NEW YORK OR L A OR SOMEWHERE BECAUSE BIG CITIES AND YOU KNOW A GUY A PRO ATHLETE CAN GO OUT THERE IN THE AFTERNOON AND PROBABLY MAKE FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS JUST BY DOING A PERSONAL APPEARANCE AT A .
OH I KNOW .
AT A MEN S CLOTHING STORE OR SOMETHING OR SPORTING GOODS STORE BUT I REALIZE THE DIFFERENCE BUT I JUST DO NT UNDERSTAND .
YEAH IT S SURE AGGRAVATING WHEN YOU GO OUT AND BUST YOUR BUTT WORKING YOU KNOW YOUR DAY JOB AND YOU CAN WORK YOUR DAY JOB THE REST OF YOUR LIFE AND NOT BRING HOME AS MUCH MONEY AS THEY BRING HOME IN ONE GAME .
OH I KNOW .
I TELL YOU .
IT S REAL AGGRAVATING BUT .
BUT ONE THING I DO NT UNDERSTAND IS WHY A GROUP YOU KNOW HEADED UP BY GEORGE BUSH WOULD BUY THE TEXAS RANGERS AND NOT REALLY GET BEHIND THEM BECAUSE I TELL YOU WE NEED A WINNER IN THIS TOWN IT LOOKS LIKE OUR COWBOYS ARE COMING BACK BUT .
THAT S RIGHT .
SO THAT S THAT S GOING TO BE A BIG HELP TO DALLAS BUT YOU KNOW IN THE PAST HALF A DOZEN YEARS ALL WE VE HAD IS THE UH .
IT S ALWAYS GOT .
THE SOCCER TEAM .
YEAH IT S ALWAYS IT S ALWAYS WONDERED ME WHY I MEAN THEY ACT AS THOUGH THIS AREA IS NOT YOU KNOW A BIG METROPOLITAN AREA BUT YOU THINK WE D SOMEDAY GET AN OWNER IN HERE THAT COULD AFFORD TO BUY THE THE THE PLAYERS WE NEED .
OH I KNOW IT S .
JUST REAL AGGRAVATING TO BECAUSE I VE LIVED HERE YOU KNOW SINCE WELL I WAS BORN AND RAISED HERE SO I VE BEEN A RANGER FAN SINCE ABOUT SEVENTYSEVEN SO IT S A LOT OF LOSERS .
OH I KNOW .
IT S ABOUT TO GET YOU KNOW .
I VE BEEN ONE .
AS BAD AS THE CUBS OR WHOEVER YOU KNOW .
YEAH I VE BEEN I VE LIVED HERE SINCE SEVENTYFOUR AND I VE REALLY BEEN A RANGER FAN FOR THE LONGEST TIME AND EXCUSE ME I DO NT MISS A TIME PICKING UP THE MORNING PAPER .
RIGHT .
AND CHECKING THE BOX SCORE I MEAN I FOLLOW THEM AND I FOLLOW THEM LIKE I FOLLOW THE MAVERICKS AND LIKE I FOLLOW THE COWBOYS BUT AND I WANT TO SEE THEM WIN BECAUSE YOU KNOW DAMN IT THEY THE FANS DESERVE IT I MEAN IT .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW WE HAVE PRETTY UH GREAT FANS PUT TWO MILLION PEOPLE IN THAT STADIUM .
I M TELLING YOU .
I LOVE NOLAN RYAN I GUESS YOU PROBABLY LOVE HIM TOO .
RIGHT I THINK THIS TOWN WOULD GO CRAZY IF THEY EVER GOT A EVEN A PLAYOFF TEAM .
OH I .
T I MEAN .
DO TOO .
IT WOULD BE PACKED AND THEY GOT THAT NEW STADIUM THEY ARE BUILDING SO AT LEAST AT LEAST THAT WILL BE EXCITING .
IT WILL .
WHEN WE GET THAT BUT .
WELL WHERE DO YOU THINK THEY ARE HEADING THIS YEAR .
UH IT S HARD TO SAY IT S GOING TO BE DEPENDING ON WHERE THE WHAT THEY DO WITH RUBEN SIERRA AND UH I MEAN I M GETTING TIRED OF THEM GOING INTO EACH YEAR SAYING YOU KNOW BOBBY WITT IS THE ANSWER AND KEVIN BROWN .
RIGHT .
IS THE ANSWER AND MAN THAT S GETTING OLD YOU KNOW THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN PAMPERED I MEAN IT S TIME TO TO EITHER YOU KNOW PUT OUT OR SHUT UP .
YEAH BOBBY WITT .
AND .
GETS FORCED INTO WINS LIKE SEVENTEEN GAMES OR WHATEVER AND THEY HAVE THE LATER TEN GAME WINNING STREAK .

MORE THAN COMPETITIVENESS AGAINST SOMEONE ELSE IT S IT S A COMPETITIVENESS AGAINST YOURSELF .

THE ONLY THINGS THAT I HAVE RETURNED HAVE NOT BEEN FAULTY IT S BEEN BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OR .
RIGHT .
SOME PROBLEM LIKE THAT .
I REALLY HAVE NT HAD TO RETURN THINGS BECAUSE THEY DID NT PERFORM THE WAY .
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO .
MOST THE TIME .
THEY HAVE A PRETTY GOOD GUARANTEE YEAH .
THE ONLY THING .
I VE HAD LATELY IS UH MY KIDS GOT ALL THESE BARBIE KIND OF TOYS FOR UH CHRISTMAS AND UH I IT TAKES THEM LESS THAN A DAY AND THEY RE BROKEN IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER .
BUT I DO NT KNOW IF THAT S JUST KIDS OR IF THAT S UH MAYBE THOSE TYPE OF PRODUCTS SH SHOULD BE FOR OLDER KIDS .
UHHUH .
WHAT AGE ARE YOUR CHILDREN .
I HAVE A FIVE AND A HALF AND A THREE AND A HALF YEAR OLD THAT PLAY WITH THEM .
UHHUH .
AND UH I DO NT THINK THEY RE UNDULY ROUGH BUT MAYBE THEY ARE .
I DO NT KNOW .
BUT UH A LOT OF THE LITTLE BARBIE SETS THEY COME WITH REAL LITTLE PIECES AND THEY RE EASILY LOST AND EASILY BROKEN BUT .
UHHUH .
MUMBLEX .
WELL MY DAUGHTER IS TWENTYONE NOW SO IT S BEEN A WHILE SINCE WE VE HAD BARBIE THINGS .
IT S BEEN A WHILE SINCE THEY VE UH GONE THROUGH THE BARBIE STUFF MUMBLEX .
BUT WE DID HAVE BARBIES WE DID HAVE BARBIES AND THINGS AND THERE SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT BECAME A CRAZE WHEN SHE WAS ALREADY OH LIKE YOU KNOW THIRD FOURTH FIFTH GRADE .

THAT S ONE .
NICE THING IS THEY RE REAL GOOD ABOUT REPLACING IT .
WELL UH I GUESS IF THEY LL REPLACE THEM THEN THEY ASSUME THEY SHOULD NT HAVE BROKEN .
RIGHT .
WELL THE THE YOU KNOW THOSE LITTLE ARMS ARE SUPPOSED TO TWIST ALMOST ANY WAY AND .
ANY DIRECTION .
SHE S NOT THAT STRONG THAT I WOULD .
UHHUH .
SHE S NOT THAT BIG OF A GIRL THAT I THINK COULD REALLY .
RIGHT .
TAKE A GRIP ON IT LIKE A BIGGER KID COULD YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
THE MAIN THING THAT THEY VE THEY HAD WHEN MY DAUGHTER WAS PLAYING WITH BARBIES WAS JUST CLOTHES .
YES .
YOU KNOW THAT WAS ABOUT IT .
THAT WAS ABOUT IT .
UHHUH .
AND THE BARBIE DOLL .
ITSELF IS USUALLY PRETTY DURABLE AND THAT KIND OF STUFF BUT .
AND THE MAIN THING MY KIDS SEEM TO BE INTO NOWADAYS ARE ELECTRONICS .
MY MY CHILDREN ARE TWENTYONE AND TWENTYFIVE AND TWENTYEIGHT .
OH IS THAT RIGHT .
UHHUH AND .
WELL DO YOU SEE THAT THERE S A BIG PROBLEM WITH ELECTRONIC THINGS .
NO NOT REALLY .
WE UH HAVE NT HAD THAT MUCH YOU KNOW PROBLEM WITH THINGS THAT WE HAVE BOUGHT .

OH YEAH .
MUMBLEX .
YOU KNOW THEN THEY PUT AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON IT IF IT DOES NT WORK OR IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT IN A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME SO IT SEEMS .
YES .
LIKE IT S A WASTE OF MONEY .

UHHUH .
AND LIKE I VE EVEN BOUGHT ON A RECLINER ONCE I BOUGHT YOU KNOW A A AN EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR CLEANING AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND I NEVER USED IT .
YOU NEVER NEE EVEN NEEDED IT .

WASHERS AND DRYERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT I VE NEVER HAD ONE GO OUT .
IN FACT THEY USUALLY WHEN THEY DO GO OUT IT S EITHER SOMETHING .
MY HUSBAND CAN BUY THE PART AND FIX AND WE DO NT EVEN HAVE A REPAIRMAN COME OR IT MEANS IT S OLD ENOUGH THAT IT S TIME TO REPLACE THE WHOLE THING .

MY DAUGHTER WAS GOING .
TO CAMP GODDARD UM WHICH IS THROUGH THE PLANO SCHOOL SYSTEM YOU KNOW IN THE FALL .

SHE STARTED RECYCLING CANS AND FROM THERE WE NOW RECYCLE GLASS AND NEWSPAPERS AND UH ALUMINUM CANS AND PLASTICS .
REALLY .
UHHUH .
UHHUH .

WEIGH IT OR WHATEVER AND .
NO MUMBLEX .
THE ONLY THING .
WE GET PAID FOR ARE THE ALUMINUM CANS .
UM .
UM THE REST OF IT .
WE JUST DO BECAUSE MY HUSBAND HAS BECOME HOOKED ON RECYCLING .
AND SO YOU KNOW WE DO NT GET PAID FOR THAT BUT THAT S OKAY .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW IT S IT S NOT THAT MUCH OF A BOTHER REALLY .
YOU JUST HAVE TO RINSE OUT YOUR BOTTLES OR WHATEVER AND WE USE A LOT OF .
TWO LITER BOTTLES .
UM AND LIKE MILK CARTONS AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
IT S AMAZING HOW MUCH PLASTIC .
YOU GENERATE .
YEAH I WAS AMAZED AT HOW MANY CANS .
YEAH .
YEAH .
THAT WE GOT MUMBLEX BECAUSE WHEN THE KIDS FIRST WENT DOWN I SAID THAT YOU KNOW THAT S GREAT AND I WAS THINKING YOU KNOW MAYBE I D HELP SUPPLEMENT IT YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
WHEN THEY TURNED THEM IN BUT IT S AMAZING HOW MANY CANS YOU GO THROUGH .
YEAH IT REALLY IS .
AND HOW FAST THEY ACCUMULATE .
WELL ALL THAT STUFF AND HOW MUCH HOW MUCH WE HAVE REDUCED OUR WASTE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THAT WE WE RE GENERATING A WEEK .
UM I KNOW OUR NEIGHBORS WHEN WE FIRST WENT TO THIS BIN PROGRAM SAID OH THERE S NO WAY YOU KNOW WE RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE PICKUP TWICE A WEEK .
THEY WERE REAL UPSET BUT THEY WERE NT THEY WERE ONLY PICKING UP ONCE A WEEK .
AND WE SAID TO THEM IF YOU RECYCLE MUMBLEX YOU LL YOU KNOW YOU LL GO TWO WEEKS WITHOUT HAVING TO PUT OUT THE GREEN CONTAINER .
YEAH .
AND UH IT S IT S REALLY AMAZING .
THE OTHER THING .
HE DOES THAT MY HUSBAND .
A REAL STICKLER ABOUT IS WE DO NT COLLECT OUR GRASS CLIPPINGS .
REALLY .
NO .
HE HE GOT A LITTLE MULCHER THING .
UHHUH .
IT S JUST A LITTLE ATTACHMENT FOR THE LAWN MOWER AND WE MOW ONCE A WEEK .
YOU KNOW NO NO MORE OFTEN THEN THAT .
AND THEN THE CLIPPINGS JUST GET MULCHED UP AND THEN JUST LAY ON THE ON ON THE UH THE LAWN .
AND IT S AMAZING IT S AMAZING .
WE DO NT COLLECT ANY OF THAT AND THAT THAT HAS CUT DOWN A LOT IN WHAT .
WE THROW OUT .
YEAH MUMBLEX WE DO NT E WE DO NT CATCH IT EITHER MAINLY BECAUSE MY HUSBAND RARELY HAS TIME TO MOW THE YARD .
SO IF IT MOWS GETS MOWED I DO IT NORMALLY .
UHHUH .
AND I CA NT MOW THE YARD WITH THE GRASS CATCH ON IT .
IT S TOO HEAVY .
YEAH .
SO I JUST M I JUST MOW IT AND LEAVE IT .
YEAH .
IT JUST SOAKS IN .
SURE .
IT DOES .
SURE .
IT DOES .
IT REALLY DOES AND IT ACTUALLY THEY SAY THAT YOU RE WASTING FERTILIZER .
UHHUH .
IF YOU RE NOT UH IF YOU RE CATCHING YOUR GRASS CLIPPINGS .
THAT THAT S THAT MUCH FERTILIZER .
YOU HAVE TO USE BECAUSE IT DOES FERTILIZE THE LAWN .
IT S AMAZING .
YEAH .
YEAH .
YEAH .
OH I LIKE IT BETTER DOING IT .
WELL ONE IT CUTS DOWN ON MY MOW TIME ANYWAY .
UHHUH THAT S TRUE .
AND YOU ZIP THROUGH IT QUICKER .
THAT S TRUE .
THAT S TRUE .
WELL I I REALLY THINK YOU RE GOING TO GET HOOKED ON PLASTICS AND PAPER BEFORE YOU KNOW IT .
PROBA WE PROBABLY WILL .
IT S IT S REALLY NOT THAT MUCH TROUBLE .
WE KEEP A LARGE PLASTIC UH JUST A YOU KNOW A GARBAGE BAG IN THE GARAGE .
YEAH .
AND AS SOON AS WE USE SOMETHING YOU KNOW WE CRUSH IT UP AND PUT IT OUT THERE AND THEN YOU KNOW EVERY FEW WEEKS WE HAVE RECYCLING A RECYCLING CENTER LIKE NEAR WALMART .
UHHUH .
THEY RE THEY HAVE THE CONTAINERS THAT YOU CAN JUST GO OVER THERE AND DROP IT IN AND IT S REALLY NO TROUBLE .
AND UH I FEEL LIKE AT LEAST WE RE DOING SOMETHING .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW MUMBLEX UM I READ A BOOK ONE TIME OR A M A MAGAZINE ARTICLE AND THEY SAID SOMETHING ABOUT HOW YOU DO NT REALIZE EVEN JUST YOUR SMALL CONTRIBUTION IT SEEMS LIKE A SMALL CONTRIBUTION BUT IT S NOT .
IF EVERYONE WERE TO RECYCLE JUST THEIR NEWSPAPERS THEY WOULD S SAVE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF TREES .
A DAY .
REALLY .
A DAY JUST FROM NOT THROWING OUT YOUR NEWSPAPERS .
AND UH WHEN YOU READ THAT YOU THINK WELL GEE MAYBE IT IS A BIG DEAL .
YOU KNOW .
WHAT WHAT MAKES ME SICK IS IS WHEN THEY SHOW THE DUMP SITES .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND AND HOW BIG THEY ARE .
UHHUH .
OR LIKE IN NEW YORK THE BARGES THAT .
YES .
THAT GO UP AND DOWN THE THE RIVER .
YEAH .
AND THEY DO NT HAVE ANY PLACE TO PUT IT AND IT JUST FLOATS IN THE MUMBLEX IT S LIKE UGH .
YEAH YEAH YEAH .
AND THAT S AND THAT S REALLY NOT NECESSARY .
NO .
IT REALLY IS NT IF EVERYBODY WOULD DO JUST A LITTLE BIT .
IT WOULD MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE .
IT WOULD MAKE A HUGE IMPACT .
SO I M EXCITED ABOUT THE RECYCLING PROGRAM IN PLANO .
I I CA NT WAIT FOR THEM TO GET IT STARTED .
UM BECAUSE IT LL BE THAT MUCH EASIER FOR US YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID NOW WE HAVE TO TAKE IT OVER TO TO WALMART .
IT WOULD BE REAL NICE IF THEY JUST CAME BY AND JUST PICKED UP .
YEAH .
IT IT S .
UM .
IT S CONVENIENT OUT HERE FOR THEM TO DO IT .
NOW WHAT WHAT DO THEY PICK UP .
IT S JUST .
THEY PICK UP THE THE PLASTIC THE GLASS AND THE NEWSPAPER .
OH THEY DO .
UHHUH .
UHHUH .
AND DO YOU HAVE TO SORT THAT .
AND THEY WILL DO THE ALUM .
OR DO YOU JUST PUT IT .
ALL IN .
NO YOU JUST PUT IT IN THE ONE BIN AND AND I GUESS THEY DO THE SORTING .
BUT UM THEY LL DO THE ALUMINUM CANS TOO BUT WE DO NT GIVE THEM .
THOSE .

WHEN NEITHER ONE OF US ARE HOME T .
UHHUH .

UHHUH .
SO WE DO NT HAVE THE NEWSPAPERS BUT THE THE PLASTIC AND THE GLASS .
AT FIRST WHEN IT FIRST STARTED IT IT IT WAS HARD .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU RE JUST USED TO THROWING THINGS .
MY HUSBAND WOULD .
COME HOME AND GO THROUGH THE TRASH .
UH .
AND SAY YOU THREW THIS AWAY .
HE WOULD GET HE WOULD GET ALL UPSET AND I D SAY IT S JUST SUCH AN AUTOMATIC REACTION .
AND NOW .
IT IS .
WE THINK BEFORE WE THROW ANYTHING AWAY .
I MEAN IT S REALLY FUNNY .
WE WE REALLY ONCE YOU GET INTO THE HABIT OF IT IT S OKAY IT S JUST IT S JUST MAKING IT .
A HABIT .
THAT S HARD .
OH I KNOW .
WELL THE KIDS HAVE EVEN GOT TO THE POINT WHERE THEY IF THEY SEE ANYBODY GOING IN THE TRASH CAN WITH A CAN YOU KNOW THEY THEY RE OH NO DO NT DO THAT AND THEY GO TO THE SINK THEY RINSE THEM OUT AND THEY PUT THEM UPSIDE DOWN THEY LET THEM DRAIN AND .
UHHUH .
AND THEN UH AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS THEY TAKE THEM ALL OUTSIDE AND I PUT THEM IN A BIG BAG ANYWAY .

I THINK FOOTBALL IS FOOTBALL IS KIND OF A A SPORT THAT I THINK YOU .
KIND OF IT S HARD NOT TO LIKE IT .
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE S JUST .
WELL THERE IS SO MUCH ABOUT IT .
IT S EXCITING .
TO LIKE .
YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
IT S SO EXCITING .
AND WHEN THE COWBOYS WON THE SUPERBOWL HERE OF COURSE THEY PUT TOGETHER SOME REAL CUTE SONGS AND WE .
ALL RAN OUT AND BOUGHT THE RECORDS AND NOW WE FEEL LIKE THEY RE KIND OF A COLLECTOR S ITEM .
YEAH .
YEAH THEY PROBABL I I WISH I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT THE TAPE WHEN I WAS IN UH TE IN COLORADO .

BUT YOU KNOW WHEN I FIRST MOVED HERE WAS WHEN THEY WELL NO I GUESS IT WAS ABOUT A YEAR AGO THEY DID THIS .
THIS INTERSTATE SEVENTYFIVE SONG .
UHHUH .
OR WHATEVER .
IT WAS ABOUT CENTRAL EXPRESSWAY AND GETTING IT DONE IN NINETEEN NINETYFIVE AND EVERYTHING .
THAT WAS KIND OF A FUNNY SONG BUT THEY SURE DO IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE THEY REALLY LOVE THEIR COWBOYS HERE .
EVEN WHEN THEY WERE LOSING PITIFULLY YOU KNOW PEOPLE STILL SUPPORT THEM .
WE DRIVE BY SOME HOUSES EVERYDAY THAT HAVE BIG SIGNS WE LOVE THE COWBO .
UH WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE THE MAJOR SOCIAL CHANGES .
WELL .
WHAT AGE UH IF YOU DO NT MIND ME ASKING .
WELL I M I M UH THIRTYONE .
OH WELL YOU RE YOU RE YOUNG I M IN MY .
YEAH RIGHT .
EARLY FIFTIES SO YOU SHOULD TAKE MY WORD YOU RE YOUNG .
OH I YOU KNOW I VE SEEN A SOCIAL CHANGE YEAH .
IT S DEFINITELY FOR SURE AND IT S UH UH AND BESIDES THAT I CAME FROM CALIFORNIA WHERE SOCIAL CHANGE IS LIKE YOU KNOW .
EVERY DAY .
YEAH .
I MEAN EVERY SECOND .
YOU KNOW SOCIAL CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA MEANS IT TAKES ANOTHER TWO OR THREE MINUTES LONGER TO GET TO WORK .
YEAH I CAN BELIEVE THAT .
AND UH WHEN I STARTED WORK THERE IN IT STARTED YOU KNOW ACTUALLY GOING TO WORK IN EIGHTYTWO I GUESS THAT S WHEN IT WAS BETWEEN EIGHTYTWO AND EIGHTYFIVE UH IT STARTED OUT TAKING ME AN HOUR AND FIFTEEN MINUTES TO GET TO WORK AND THEN IT BECAME YOU KNOW AN HOUR AND A HALF TO YOU KNOW SOME DAYS TWO HOURS TO GET TO WORK .
THAT S SOCIAL CHANGE .
THAT S THAT S SOCIAL CHANGE .
WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK IS IS THE MAJOR SOCIAL CHANGE .
OH .
RIGHT NOW .
YEAH THAT S THAT S A THAT S A TRICKY ONE I LL LET YOU GO FIRST .
OKAY .
I THINK PROBABLY THE BIG MAJOR CHANGE IS THE ROLE OF WOMEN .
UHHUH .
I THINK ONE THE WOMEN UH IN THE WORK FORCE .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK THE FACT THAT THEY RE BECOMING UH MORE UH HOW DO I WANT TO SAY NOT NECESSARILY POLITICALLY INCLINED BUT THEY RE MORE APT TO BE IN POLITICAL OFFICES .
UHHUH .
NOW I THINK YOU KNOW WE VE MADE GREAT STRIDES .
UHHUH .
IN THAT RESPECT I THINK THAT IT THIRTY YEARS AGO WHEN UH I WAS NEWLY MARRIED FAMILY WAS VERY VERY IMPORTANT .
UHHUH .
THEN I THINK WE VEERED WHERE THE FAMILY WAS NOT AS IMPORTANT A UNIT AND I THINK NOW IT S REVOLVING BACK FULL CIRCLE I THINK .
UHHUH .
THE FAMILY UNIT IS BECOMING MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN IT WAS .
OH I THINK IT S THAT S PROBABLY FOR TWO REASONS UH YOU KNOW THE NUMBER ONE IS WOMEN WANTED TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE AND THE SECOND REASON WAS IS EVERYTHING COSTS SO MUCH MORE THAT IF YOU DO NT HAVE YOU KNOW EQUAL RIGHTS SO THAT YOUR WIFE GETS EQUAL PAY YOU CA NT MAKE TWICE AS MUCH .
THAT S TRUE THAT S TRUE .
WELL I KNOW THAT ECONOMICALLY UH A WIFE ALMOST HAS TO WORK ANYMORE .
UHHUH .
AND YET I M ALSO NOTICING UH IN THE AREAS THAT I M WORKING AND STUFF MORE AND MORE WOMEN ARE WANTING NOW TO STAY HOME WITH THE CHILDREN WHERE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO .
UHHUH .
THEY DID NT I MEAN YOU KNOW THEY WANTED CHILDREN BUT THEY STILL WANTED TO BE THEIR OWN PERSON OUT IN THE WORK FORCE .
UHHUH .
BUT I SEE I AM SEEING WOMEN NOW WANTING TO STAY HOME .
UHHUH .
MORE AT LEAST UNTIL THE CHILDREN ARE UP TO YOU KNOW SCHOOL AGE .
UHHUH .
AND UH I FIND THAT VERY INTERESTING THAT THAT .
YEAH .
IT S SORT OF REVERTING BACK .
YEAH I I VE I VE I VE FOUND THAT TOO YOU KNOW WHERE THE WIFE IS MARRIED AND AND I MEAN NOT NOT MARRIED SORRY WRONG WORD .
WHERE THE WIFE HAS GONE TO SCHOOL YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
AND GOTTEN A DEGREE SPENT FIVE YEARS OUT IN THE WORK FORCE FOUND YOU KNOW THE THE THEIR HUSBAND EITHER AT COLLEGE OR WHATEVER BUT STILL YOU KNOW AFTER FIVE YEARS IT S LIKE FIRST KID .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND THEN THEY RE OUT OF THE WORK FORCE FOR ANOTHER TEN YEARS .
UHHUH UHHUH .
BUT I THINK MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE STILL OUT .
PROBABLY .
I THINK THAT GENERATION THEY RE ALL AT HOME RIGHT NOW AND AND WE WO NT SEE THEM BACK FOR ANOTHER TWO OR THREE YEARS .
UHHUH UHHUH .
UH I M VERY RARELY DO I MEET ANYBODY WHOSE CHILDREN ARE ARE YOU KNOW PAST THAT AGE WHEN THEY VE BEEN AWAY FOR A FEW YEARS .
UHHUH .
BUT UH IT S KIND OF DIFFERENT .
YEAH YEAH IT IS IT UH I I NOTE THAT I HAD TAKEN CARE OF MY GRANDCHILDREN RECENTLY WHILE MY DAUGHTER AND HER HUSBAND HAD BEEN OUT OF TOWN .
UHHUH .
AND I DO NOT ENVY THESE MOTHERS .
UHHUH .
OR THESE FATHERS THAT HAVE THESE THE CHILDREN THAT THEY HAVE TO RUSH HOME FROM WORK AND PICK THEM UP AT DAY CARE GET THEM THROUGH THEIR HOMEWORK GET THEM TO THEIR SOCCER PRACTICE .
UHHUH .
GET THEM TO THEIR PIANO LESSONS .
I MEAN THAT S TOUGH .
I UH .
I DO NT ENVY THESE YOUNG PARENTS .
I M AN ASSISTANT SCOUT MASTER AND THAT S THAT S IT S LIKE UH YEAH PARENTS UH EVEN RARELY SEE THEIR KIDS FOR WEEKENDS WHICH IS YOU KNOW KIND OF ROUGH TOO .
THAT S TRUE .
THAT S TRUE .
ESPECIALLY NOW .
I DO NT KNOW .
YEAH .
AND AND I M FINDING YOU KNOW RUNNING INTO THESE UH WOMEN THAT ARE WANTING TO HAVE THEIR CHILDREN AT THE AGE OF THIRTYNINE FORTY I M THINKING AT THE AGE OF FIFTYTWO YOU RE CRAZY .
YEAH .
YOU RE GOING TO BE DOING YOUR WORST RUNNING AROUND WHEN YOU RE FIFTY .
AND YOU RE ABSOLUTELY NUTS .
I I KNOW TWO WOMEN THAT THAT UH LET S SEE ONE OF THEM S FORTYNINE AND THE OTHER ONE WELL THE OTHER ONE I DO NT KNOW WHAT HER AGE IS BUT I KNOW SHE IS SHE IS SOMEWHERE IN THAT HAIRY AGE OF HALF A CENTURY UP THERE .
AND UH BOY I LL TELL YOU THESE ARE THE THE GOGETTINGEST HAPPIEST PEOPLE I VE EVER MET .
YOU KNOW BECAUSE .
WELL YOU CAN BE GO GETTING BUT YOU CAN ALSO GET GRAY HAIRS AND HAVE A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN .
I M THIRTY I M GETTING GRAY HAIRS ALREADY .
I JUST KNOW IT IT WOULD ABSOLUTELY EXHAUST ME MAYBE IT S BECAUSE IT S MY GRANDCHILDREN AND IT S NOT MY CHILDREN .
UM .
MAYBE THAT S .
UH WELL I GUESS SOCIAL CHANGE TAKES IN A A BIG CATEGORY BUT UH I GUESS THE THE ONE ASPECT OF IT THAT I TOOK IN UH CONSIDERATION IS MORE ECONOMICAL .
UM .
I I KNOW THAT THE AMOUNT OF OR HOW FAR YOUR DOLLAR GOES PROBABLY MORE THAN ANYTHING HAS HAS GREATLY CHANGED .
YES I AGREE .
I KNOW THEY THEY DID A IT WAS ON A TALK SHOW THEY TOOK UH THE PARENTS AND THEN THE UH THE SON AND THEY COMPARED INCOME AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN TIME WHEN THE WHEN THE FATHER WAS YOU KNOW WAS A LITTLE BIT YOUNGER AND MORE IN HIS HEYDAY .
UHHUH .
AND THEY AND THEY COMPARED TO THE SON S THAT HE WAS MAKING NOW AND EVEN THOUGH THE SON WAS PROBABLY MORE SUCCESSFUL YOU KNOW HIGHER UP IN THE THE MANAGEMENT LADDER .
RIGHT .
UH HIS HE WAS ACTUALLY MAKING LESS MONEY .
UM .
WHEN YOU CO WHEN YOU GO BY COSTS OF LIVING .

BUT UH I M UH I M PRETTY MUCH OUT TO THE THINGS TO SAY .
OH LIKE LIKE SOCIAL CHANGES .
YEAH .
UM UM AND I DO NT THINK THIS WOULD HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT BUT LIKE CLOTHING AND STYLES LOT OF THOSE CHANGED .
OKAY YEAH I I .
I DO NT THINK THEY THEY CONSIDER LIKE I SAY IT S A BROAD CATEGORY IT S JUST I M NOT ECONOMICAL BUT .
YEAH .
UH EVEN ATTITUDES .
UHHUH DEFINITELY .
ON ON CLOTHING AND STUFF UH I KNOW .
TOWARDS EACH OTHER .
YEAH I I I KNOW A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT THAT WE WEAR MEN WEAR NOWADAYS WERE WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED UH FEMININE UH MANY YEARS AGO BUT .
UHHUH YEAH .
I KNOW IT S BEEN IT WAS HARD FOR ME AT FIRST BUT NOW I KIND OF LIKE YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE BRIGHT COLORS .
YEAH .
I MEAN LIKE I USED TO BE MORE UH CONSERVATIVE AND JUST YOUR BASIC COLORS BUT NOW I I DO LIKE SOME OF THESE UH BRIGHTER FLUORESCENT COLORS .
YEAH BUT THEY STYLES COME AND GO ALL THE TIME THOUGH IT S JUST RIDICULOUS FADS IN AND OUT AND EVEN UM CLOTHING FROM THE SIXTIES CAME BACK .
YEAH .
I SEE A LOT OF UM GIRLS WEARING SIXTIES CLOTHES .
YEAH I I I GUESS THE THE BEST THING I LIKE TO SEE FROM THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES IS OF COURSE IS THE MINI SKIRT OF COURSE .
ONE OF THE NICE THINGS BUT UH YEAH I DO NT THINK THAT THERE S ANYTHING AS ORIGINAL IT S IT S ALL BASED ON UH ONE OF THE PAST STYLES THEY JUST UM MAKE THEIR UH CIRCLE AND COME BACK AGAIN .
YEAH .
SO IF YOU HANG ONTO YOUR CLOTHES LONG ENOUGH UH .
YEAH .
THEY LL THEY LL BE BACK IN STYLE IN A FEW YEARS .
THAT S TRUE MAYBE SOME DAY I PROBABLY WO NT BE ALIVE TO SEE IT BUT PRICES MIGHT GO DOWN LOT MORE .
YEAH .
I DO NT KNOW THOUGH DOES NT LOOK GOOD .
WELL I THINK THINKING BACK I THINK THE ONLY STYLE I HOPE DOES NT COME BACK IS BELL BOTTOMS .
YEAH I REMEMBER THAT I DO .
I GUESS WHEN I LOOK AT PICTURES OF MYSELF IN THE BELL BOTTOMS I SAY GOD .
YEAH I DID NT REALLY CARE FOR THEM EITHER BUT NOW I .
OKAY WE RE ON UH RECYCLING .
YES .
AND UH I AM NOT REAL WELL INFORMED ON EXACTLY WHAT RICHARDSON DOES .
UHHUH .
I KNOW THAT WE UH THEY ASK US TO BUNDLE OUR NEWSPAPERS AND WE DO THAT AND WE RECYCLE OUR ALUMINUM POP CANS AND STUFF .
I SEE .
BUT NOW PLANO HAS QUITE AN ELABORATE SYSTEM DO NT THEY .
YEAH THEY DO UH IT STARTED OUT SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHEN THEY PUT THESE UH COLLECTION SITES .
UHHUH .
THEY UH NEAR A WALMART NEAR A FOOTBALL STADIUM AND THE LIKE AND THEY JUST COULD NT BELIEVE HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE GOING OUT OF THEIR WAY TO FILL THESE THINGS UP THESE HUGE DUMPSTERS WERE BEING FILLED UP IN A IN A MATTER OF A WEEK SO THEY KNEW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING GOING ON HERE SO THEY STARTED LOOKING INTO PROGRAMS AND WHAT WE HAVE NOW IT THEY CHANGED THE WHOLE WAY THAT THEY DO GARBAGE IN PLANO .
UHHUH .
INSTEAD OF COLLECTING PLASTIC BAGS OF GARBAGE TWO DAYS A WEEK THEY MAKE A COLLECTION ON MONDAY FOR YARD WASTE AND THE YARD WASTE HAS TO BE PUT IN A SPECIAL BAG THAT S A DECOMPOSABLE PAPER SACK .
UHHUH .
IT S A PRETTY GOOD SIZE IT S MAYBE THE SIZE OF TWO OR THREE UM GROCERY BAGS .
OH .
AND WE PUT THAT OUT BY THE STREET AND THEY COLLECT THOSE ON MONDAY AND THEN ON WEDNESDAY WE PUT OUT TWO CONTAINERS THAT THEY GAVE US ONE CONTAINER S A HUGE GREEN MONSTROUS THING THAT A UH UH A SPECIAL TRUCK COMES BY AND HOOKS ONTO THE SIDE OF IT AND FLIPS THE CONTAINER INTO THE BACK OF THE GARBAGE TRUCK SO AND THAT S WHERE YOU PUT YOUR REGULAR UM GARBAGE AND TRASH .
OKAY .
AND THEN ALSO THAT SAME DAY YOU PUT OUT A SMALL TUB IT S MAYBE TWO FEET HIGH AND THREE FEET BY TWO FEET WIDE AND YOU PUT JUST THROW IN YOUR ALUMINUM AND YOUR MILK JUGS AND NEWSPAPER AND THEN THE .
OKAY AND THEN THEY RECY THEY SEPARATE IT .
EXACTLY THEY HAVE A BIG TRUCK THAT HAS LIKE TE NOT TEN MAYBE FIVE BIG DOORS ON THE SIDE OF IT AND THEY THROW THE DIFFERENT STUFF IN THE DIFFERENT DOORS .
OH THAT S A NEAT SYSTEM .
YEAH IT IS AND APPARENTLY IT S YOU KNOW IT IT WENT OFF PRETTY MUCH WITHOUT A HITCH THE TRUCKS THE SPECIAL FIVE DOOR TRUCKS WERE A LITTLE TOUGH IN GETTING BECAUSE OF SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE PERSIAN GULF WAR .
OH UHHUH .
THAT THE TRUCKS WERE BEING THE ENGINES OR SOMETHING WERE BEING SHIPPED OVER THERE FOR SOMETHING OR OTHER BUT IT DOES WORK PRETTY WELL .
WELL I KNOW OUR SON AND DAUGHTERINLAW LIVE IN PLANO AND I KNOW THEY HAVE COMMENTED ON THE SYSTEM I DO NT KNOW THAT THEY KNOW THAT IT WORKED THAT WAY BUT THEY HAVE THE TWO SEPARATE CONTAINERS AND STUFF .
OH YES UHHUH I NOTICED SOMETHING INTERESTING LAST TIME I GUESS TWO WEDNESDAYS AGO WHEN THEY WERE PICKING UP I HAPPENED TO BE OUT THERE IN THE MORNING WHEN THEY WERE PICKING UP THE THAT TUB STUFF AND THE MAN WHO WAS DOING THE SEPARATING WHEN HE WAS DONE EMPTYING THE TUB HE TOOK A LITTLE ELECTRONIC READER DEVICE OFF OF HIS BELT AND HE READ THE BAR CODE THAT WAS ON THE SIDE OF THE TUB SO THEY MUST BE COLLECTING INFORMATION ABOUT WHO DOES IT AND HOW OFTEN .
OH THAT IS INTERESTING .
YEAH .
BECAUSE I WONDER IF THAT MEANS THAT IF YOU DO NT DO IT .
UHHUH .
DO YOU SUPPOSE THEY WILL COME AND KNOCK ON YOUR DOOR AND .
I I DO NT KNOW BUT I THINK THAT S A REALLY INTERESTING QUESTION .
THAT THAT IS INTERESTING YOU KNOW WILL YOU BE PENALIZED IF YOU DO NT WILL YOU UH .
YEAH THAT THAT SEEMS FARFETCHED ONLY BECAUSE IT IT THERE S NO LAW THAT SAYS YOU HAVE TO BUY A NEWSPAPER .
RIGHT RIGHT .
OR POP CANS OR MILK JUGS SO THERE THERE S IT S POSSIBLE THAT THERE IS A PERSON IN PLANO THAT DOES NT BUY ANY OF THOSE THREE THINGS AND THEREFORE WOULD NT HAVE .
THAT S TRUE EXCEPT THAT IT S HARD TO IMAGINE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE UH CANS YOU KNOW FROM THE THE MARKET AND UH .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW VEGETABLE CANS AND ET CETERA .
NO THEY WO NT TAKE VEGETABLE CANS .
OH THEY DO NT TAKE VEGETABLE CANS .
JUST JUST THE ALUMINUM POP CANS .
THIS IS JUST THEIR ALUMINUM CANS .
YEAH .
WELL THEN YES .

WOULD NT YOU REALLY LIKE TO KNOW .
I WOULD .
SOMEDAY I M SURE WE LL FIND OUT .
I M SURE YOU KNOW IF NOTHING ELSE CALL THE SANITATION DEPARTMENT SAY OKAY WHAT ARE YOU DOING READING YOU KNOW .

I THINK IT S A VERY GOOD THING I THINK THAT UH I THINK IT HELPS IF THE CITY IS GIVING YOU A NUDGE TO DO IT .

OKAY THEN .
OKAY .
BYEBYE .
UM BYE .
SO UH LET S SEE WH WHAT WAS THE TOPIC I FORGOT MUMBLEX WE ARE SUPPOSED TO TALK .
ADVICE FOR PEOPLE TAKING FOR PARENTS UH HELP THEIR KIDS THROUGH COLLEGE .
YEAH DO YOU HAVE ANY CHILDREN .
NO I JUST GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE .
OH DID YOU .
YES .
WHERE DID YOU GO .
I WENT TO CLARION .
CLARION .
UHHUH .
HUH UH WOULD YOU I MEAN IF YOU HAD CHILDREN WOULD YOU WANT THEM TO GO TO A CERTAIN PLACE OR .
UM I WOULD WANT THEM TO MAKE THAT DECISION AND I WOULD YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
UH I PRETTY MUCH MADE MY DECISION ON MY OWN AND MY B OLDER BROTHER LIKEWISE .
UHHUH .
AND UH YOU KNOW WE WE WERE BOTH PRETTY MUCH HAPPY WITH WHAT WE DID .
YEAH .
SO I THINK I WOULD NOT PUSH THEM TOWARDS ANY ONE PLACE .
UHHUH YEAH I KNOW I KIND OF FEEL THE SAME WAY I I JUST FINISHED COLLEGE A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND I UH YOU KNOW IT WAS WHILE I HAD MY FAMILY AND EVERYTHING AND IT WAS A LOT HARDER BUT UH YOU KNOW I WENT TO A COLLEGE THAT WAS FAIRLY LOCAL AND I FEEL LIKE MY EDUCATION YOU KNOW YOU GET OUT OF IT WHAT YOU PUT INTO IT I THINK .
UHHUH .
BUT YOU KNOW I KNOW IT S SOME PEOPLE ARE REAL ADAMANT ABOUT YOU KNOW GOING TO A CERTAIN SCHOOL OR WHATEVER .
UHHUH .
I DO NOT KNOW I GUESS IT A LOT OF IT WOULD DEPEND ON MAYBE WHAT YOUR MAJOR WAS OR SOMETHING I DO NOT KNOW BUT .
YEAH EXACTLY .
BUT .
I THINK ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS KIDS OUGHT TO LOOK FOR IS FIRST OF ALL THEY HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT THEY WANT TO MAJOR IN .
UHHUH .
AND THEN YOU KNOW FIND A SCHOOL THAT S GOOD FOR THAT .
YEAH IS THAT WHY YOU PICKED THE SCHOOL YOU DID OR .
WELL I PICKED IT FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS IT WAS ONLY ABOUT AN HOUR AND TEN MINUTES AWAY FROM HOME .
UHHUH .
SO IT WAS FAR ENOUGH AWAY THAT I WAS AWAY .
YEAH .
BUT YET CLOSE ENOUGH IF I EVER WANTED TO GO HOME I COULD .
YEAH .
UH .
SO YOU LIVED THERE AT SCHOOL THEN .
PARDON ME .
YOU LIVED THERE AT SCHOOL .
YEAH I LIVED UP AT SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
YEAH UH ANOTHER REASON WAS UH I PAID FOR MY ENTIRE EDUCATION .
UHHUH .
SO I HAD TO LOOK FOR SOMETHING THAT I COULD AFFORD ECONOMICALLY .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW AND UH CLARION WAS OH IT WAS ROUGHLY AROUND SIX THOUSAND A YEAR .
UHHUH AND THAT WAS FOR TUITION AND .
YEAH THAT WAS FOR EVERYTHING AND NOW I DID NOT GO OUT A LOT AND I DID NOT ORDER OUT A LOT .
UHHUH .
AND I YOU KNOW I DID NOT SPEND MONEY ON MYSELF .
UHHUH .
BUT UH THEN AGAIN I WAS THERE FOR SCHOOL SO .
YEAH .
UH AND THEN ANOTHER REASON WAS I WAS NOT SURE YOU KNOW I ALWAYS WANTED TO GO TO SCHOOL FOR NURSING AND THEN AT THE LAST MINUTE I CHANGED MY MIND .
UHHUH .
AND I KNEW THAT CLARION WAS KNOWN YOU KNOW MUMBLEX FOR TWO THINGS ACTUALLY FOR THEIR THEY ARE KNOWN AS A TEACHER S SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
AND ALSO FOR THEIR BUSINESS SO THAT S WHAT I ENDED UP GOING FOR IS FOR BUSINESS .
FOR BUSINESS .
UHHUH .
SO UH ARE YOU WORKING SOMEWHERE THEN OR .
NO NO NOT YET I AM MOVING SHORTLY SO I AM NOT LOOKING AROUND HERE .
OH I SEE WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO MOVE TO .
UH MARYLAND .
OH ARE YOU .
UHHUH .
DO YOU HAVE FRIENDS THERE OR .
MY FIANCEE IS DOWN THERE .
OH I SEE SO DOES HE WORK FOR A COMPANY DOWN THERE .
YEAH HE WORKS FOR THE GOVERNMENT .
OH I SEE OH THE BIG COMPANY .
YEAH .
SO YEAH I I HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR T I FOR ABOUT TWELVE YEARS I GUESS SO .
UHHUH .
BUT I AM NOT ORIGINALLY I AM ORIGINALLY FROM ILLINOIS BUT YOU KNOW I HAVE GONE TO COLLEGE I GUESS A FEW DIFFERENT PLACES BUT I THINK YOU KNOW MO FOR THE MOST PART YOU KNOW THE TEACHERS HAVE BEEN PRETTY GOOD AND I HAVE GOT OUT OF IT WHAT I HAVE WHAT I HAVE PUT INTO IT .
UHHUH .
SO BUT YOU KNOW I THINK I THINK THAT S MOST OF IT PERSONALLY BUT THAT S WHY I YOU KNOW WITH MY KIDS I THINK THAT YOU KNOW I AM JUST GOING TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO GO AND I AM GOING TO TRY TO HELP THEM FINANCIALLY BUT UH I THINK YOU KNOW FINANCIALLY I AM THERE S ONLY SO MUCH I CAN DO FOR THEM .
EXACTLY .
AND I WILL SAY HERE S WHAT YOU HAVE GOT YOU CAN EITHER YOU KNOW GO A COUPLE OF YEARS LOCALLY AND YOU KNOW THEN IF YOU WANT TO MOVE OFF TO A MORE EXPENSIVE SCHOOL THEN WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HANDLE IT BUT .
UHHUH .
OTHERWISE YOU CAN JUST GO FOR FOUR YEARS YOU KNOW SOMEWHERE AND I WILL TRY TO TRY TO HELP YOU BUT UH I DO NOT KNOW YOU KNOW THE FINANCIAL END OF IT LIKE YOU SAID I PUT MY WIFE THROUGH SCHOOL TOO OF COURSE T I PAID FOR A LOT OF THE TUITION AND BOOKS AND STUFF BUT UH IT STILL WAS A CHALLENGE TO DO AND UH SO I THINK YOU KNOW FINANCIALLY THAT S THAT S ONE OF THE BIG ASPECTS .
EXACTLY YEAH .
YOU KNOW YOU .
IT DOES HAVE A LOT OF BEARING ON IT WHETHER YOU ARE PAYING FOR YOURSELF .
RIGHT .
OR WHETHER YOUR PARENTS ARE YOU KNOW .
YEAH WELL DID YOU UH SINCE YOU WERE PAID FOR SCHOOL YOURSELF DO YOU THINK YOU HAD A DIFFERENT OUTLOOK ON IT LIKE YOUR GRADES AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
UH YEAH BECAUSE I WAS PAYING FOR IT MYSELF I KIND OF SLACKED OFF BECAUSE I FELT IT WAS MINE AND I COULD DO WITH IT WHAT I WANTED .
UHHUH .
I THINK IF MY PARENTS WOULD HAVE PAID FOR IT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN ON ME YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
UH THEY PRETTY MUCH GOT TO THE POINT WELL WELL YOU KNOW YOU ARE AT THAT AGE AND YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IF YOU GOOF .
RIGHT .
UP IT S YOUR FAULT IT S NOT OURS YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
AND THEN LETS ME GO AND I MEAN I DID NOT DO POORLY I FINISHED WITH A TWO FIVE THAT S NOT THAT WONDERFUL EITHER .
UHHUH YEAH .
BUT UH YOU KNOW I I MEAN I WORKED I DID NOT YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
GOOF AROUND I WORKED .
RIGHT .
IT WAS JUST HARDER YOU KNOW MUMBLEX I DO NOT KNOW I WAS USED TO BEING YOU KNOW ON TOP AND WHEN I STARTED THERE IT WAS LIKE YOU ARE MEDIOCRE SO .
YEAH WELL SEE I THINK YOU KNOW I HAVE KNOWN A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD GO TO SCHOOL AND THEIR PARENTS PAID FOR IT AND AND I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON THE WAY YOU ARE RAISED TOO BUT IF YOU IF YOU GROW TO EXPECT THAT YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
YOU KIND OF GO THERE AS SORT OF A VACATION YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
I THAT S THE WAY A LOT OF MY FRIENDS DID IT AND YOU KNOW THEY WERE NOT THEY DID NOT TAKE IT VERY SERIOUS I KNOW I TOOK IT REAL SERIOUS CAUSE I DID NOT START TO COLLEGE UNTIL YOU KNOW I WAS ABOUT EIGHT OR TEN YEARS AND UH YOU KNOW OUT OF WHAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
BUT UH YOU KNOW SO I THINK THAT HELPED ME BE REAL SERIOUS ABOUT IT AND I I ENDED UP GRADUATING WITH LIKE A THREE POINT SIX .
OH WOW THAT S REALLY GOOD .
YEAH SO I YOU KNOW AND THAT WAS HARD CAUSE I HAD TWO KIDS .
UHHUH .
AND YOU KNOW A FAMILY AND EVERYTHING ELSE SO I HAD A LOT OF DIFFERENT HATS TO WEAR ALL AT THE SAME TIME BUT .
YEAH SEE WELL I SCREWED MYSELF UP ALSO THERE WAS A POINT IN TIME THAT I DECIDED THAT I DID NOT WANT TO IN SCHOOL AND MY PARENTS NEVER PUSHED ME UNTIL MY DAD JUST SAID WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO AND I SAID WELL I AM GOING TO GO BECAUSE I HAVE NOT WHIPPING BUTTER THE REST OF MY LIFE YOU KNOW .
YEAH YOU ARE RIGHT EXACTLY .
SO I WENT AND I JUST TOOK BUSINESS .
UHHUH .
WELL BEING AS I WAS PAYING FOR IT MYSELF YOU KNOW I JUST KEPT YOU DO NOT GET INTO YOUR MAJOR UNTIL LIKE YOUR SECOND OR THIRD YEAR .
RIGHT .
AND I AM GOING INTO MY THIRD YEAR AND I DECIDED WELL I DO NOT WANT TO DO ACCOUNTING ANYMORE RIGHT .
UHHUH .
AND I THOUGHT OH MY GOD I AM PAYING FOR THIS MYSELF I AM NOT SWITCHING COMPLETELY BECAUSE .
RIGHT .
I WILL PUT MYSELF A YEAR BEHIND .

SO I SWITCHED TO FINANCE AND I LIKED IT BETTER AND I PULLED MYSELF FROM A TWO OH TO A TWO FIVE YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
IN MY LAST YEAR MY SENIOR YEAR .

UHHUH .
FOR AND SHE DID NOT REALIZE UNTIL SHE GOT TO BE A SENIOR AND WAS DOING HER STUDENT TEACHING THAT SHE DID NOT LIKE IT .
UHHUH .
BUT YOU KNOW BY THEN SHE HAD PRACTICALLY GOT HER DEGREE SO .

I THINK IF UH I WOULD HAVE WENT WITH THE MATH I THINK I WOULD HAVE DONE A LOT BETTER BECAUSE I WAS MORE INTERESTED .

UHHUH .

OH I SEE .
I GET UH MCCALL S .
OF COURSE ANYTHING .
THAT APPEALS TO THE HOMEMAKER SINCE THAT S MY MAIN LINE OF INTEREST .
UHHUH .
AND THEN ONCE IN A WHILE .
I LL PICK UP A WORKING WOMAN OR SOMETHING AND .
UHHUH .
REALIZE WHY I DO NT WANT TO RE GO BACK TO WORK .
WHAT .
I ENJOY ABOUT STAYING HOME .
RIGHT .
AND UH I READ MAGAZINES MAINLY BECAUSE THEY RE FAST AND IF I WANT TO RELAX WHILE I WATCH T V OF COURSE I M ONE OF THOSE .
THAT DOES TWO THINGS AT ONCE AND UH I READ GOOD HOUSEKEEPING AND BETTER HOMES AND MCCALL S .
AND I LIKE THEM BECAUSE THEY RE KIND OF SHORT AND TO THE SUBJECT .
RIGHT .
I U I USED TO TAKE MCCALL S AND GOOD HOUSEKEEPING AND UH SEVERAL MAGAZINES LIKE THAT A FEW YEARS AGO AT AT AT HOME .
UHHUH .
AND THEN YOU STOPPED THEM .
ALL .
BUT YEAH THE SUBSCRIPTIONS RAN OUT AND I NEVER RENEWED THEM .
AND I FOUND THAT I REALLY DID NT HAVE TIME AT HOME SINCE I WORK TO READ THEM .
I FIND THAT UH ABOUT TWO YEARS IS PROBABLY MY MAX .
UHHUH .
ON SUBSCRIBING TO ONE IN PARTICULAR AND THEN I .
KIND OF GET TURNED OFF BY IT .
UHHUH .
OTHER THAN GOOD HOUSEKEEPING .
GOOD HOUSEKEEPING IS THE ONE THAT KIND OF SETS AROUND FOR WHEN UH WHEN I M REALLY HAVE TIME AND I REALLY WANT TO READ SOMETHING YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
I DO NT GET INTO BOOKS TOO OFTEN BECAUSE I HAVE SO MANY THINGS THAT I STAY OCCUPIED WITH .
UHHUH .
UH ON A GENERAL BASIS AND WE TRAVEL A LOT SO I ENJOY READING PARTS ON TRAVEL IN THE VARIOUS .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW DIFFERENT ONES .
RIGHT .
AND I GET INTO UH NEWSPAPERS SO I GUESS THAT KIND OF TELLS YOU .
WHAT KIND OF PERSON .
I AM .
I M RE READ IT FAST AND PUT IT DOWN .
RIGHT .
UHHUH .
WHEN WHEN I HAD MY MAGAZINES AT HOME I WOULD FIND THAT I .
KIND OF SKIMMED THROUGH THEM AND LOOKED AT THE PICTURES YOU KNOW AND .
RIGHT .
IF SOMETHING CAUGHT MY EYE THEN I MIGHT READ SOMETHING BUT OTHERWISE THAN THAT YOU KNOW THEY WERE UH YOU KNOW NOT TOO USEFUL TO ME .
YOU KNOW .
WELL .
I GOT SOME GOOD RECIPES FROM THEM SOMETIMES BUT .
THAT S WHAT .
I DO .
YOU CLIP RECIPES AND YOU SAVE THEM FOREVER AND YOU NEVER REALLY .
UHHUH .
USE THEM .
THAT S RIGHT THAT S RIGHT .
AND THEN EVERY SO OFTEN YOU WEED THROUGH THEM AND YOU THINK WHERE DID I EVER PUT THAT RECIPE .
RIGHT .
BUT UH THAT S MAINLY MY UH WHOLE IDEA ON .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW SHORT SUBJECT UH READING AND THINGS LIKE THIS .
I I SUBSCRIBE LIKE I SAID TO A FEW AND ONCE IN A WHILE .
I BUY THAT NEW MAGAZINE CALLED FIRST ON THE NEWSSTANDS .
UHHUH .

KIND OF STAY WITH MY OWN SUBJECT MATTER .
WHAT UH PERTAINS TO MY DAILY LIFE .
RIGHT .
AT THE PRESENT TIME .
WELL SINCE I WORK WITH COMPUTERS DURING MY WORK I HAVE TO KEEP UP ON ALL THE NEW COMPUTER EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE AND EVERYTHING .
AND I HAVE TO READ THE MAGAZINES YOU KNOW SUCH AS BYTE AND COMPUTER WORLD AND MAC WORLD AND ALL OF THESE UH MAGAZINES SUCH AS THAT SO I REALLY YOU KNOW JUST I CAN SEE THAT IT WILL BE A VERY LONG TIME PROBABLY BEFORE I SUBSCRIBE TO ANY MAGAZINES AT HOME .
RIGHT .
WELL SOMETIMES IF YOU KNOW IF YOU RE IN TRANSPORTATION IN PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION .
UHHUH .
I KNOW THAT PEOPLE WILL READ THEM ON SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
RIGHT .
BUT I THINK AND THE IDEA IS TO IS AND GOOD I CAN JUST DUMP THEM AT THE OTHER END AND I DO NT HAVE TO CARRY THEM BACK WITH ME .
THAT S RIGHT .
I DO THAT WHEN WE TRAVEL .
I ALWAYS HAVE MY HEAD WITH A MAGAZINE SOMEWHERE AS WE .
UHHUH .
DRIVE OR WHEREVER WE NO MATTER .
WHAT .
IT IS AIR TRAVEL OR ANYTHING AND I .
UHHUH .
RIGHT .
IF I IF I GO ON AN AIRPLANE RIDE OR SOMETHING I LL STOP IN AND PICK UP A YOU KNOW A COSMOPOLITAN OR SOMETHING .
RIGHT AL ALTHOUGH NOW .
TO READ ON THE AIRPLANE .
BUT UH YOU KNOW THAT S BASICALLY JUST ABOUT I LL BUY A CROSSWORD PUZZLE MAGAZINE .
EVERY NOW AND THEN .
THAT S WHEN YOU REALLY HAVE TIME .
NOW SEE YOUR COMPUTER ONES I GOT INTO COMPUTER WORK SOMEWHAT UH WE HAVE OUR OWN COMPUTER SYSTEM AT HOME .
UHHUH .
AND I TRIED UH READING THE MAGAZINES HOPING I WOULD GET MORE FROM IT AND IT WAS JUST ABOVE MY HEAD WITHOUT HAVING SOMEONE THERE TO GIVE ME .
THE ADVICE AS I WENT ALONG .
UHHUH .
IT WAS YOU KNOW KIND OF A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN WHAT .
I NEEDED SO I NEVER DID GET INTO THEM .
I WHEN I BOUGHT THE COMPUTER ALL OF A SUDDEN I WAS RECEIVING THEM FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON THROUGH THE MAIL .
I THINK THEY .
ALL THAT THOUGHT WELL WE HAVE A LIVE ONE .
SHE LL SUBSCRIBE .

UHHUH .
AND WE HAVE A LOT OF UH BEAUTIFUL FRESH WATER STREAMS THAT COME THROUGH THI THIS AREA I M IN AN AREA CALLED CENTER COUNTY WHICH IS IN THE VERY CENTER OF THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA .
I VE I VE BEEN IN THAT AREA AND THE TROUT FISHING IS SUPPOSED TO BE LEGENDARY .
THE TROUT FISHING IS REALLY UH BEAUTIFUL AS I SAY THE THE STREAMS ARE OH EIGHT TEN FIFTEEN FEET WIDE AND SO FORTH AND UH YOU YOU STAND ON THE EDGE AND YOU YOU CAST OUT AND YOU YOU WORK UH FROM YOUR FEET MOST OF THE TIME .
UHHUH FOR BROOKIES .

UHHUH .
IT S A SALT WATER FISH IN FRESH WATER UH ENVIRONMENT .
WELL OUR OUR STREAMS HERE ARE REPLANTED WITH FISH ABOUT EVERY YEAR .
IT S ALL PUT AND TAKE .
SO THAT WELL THEY THEY THEY UH THEY HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF OF UH WHAT THE NUMBER OF FISH ARE IN THESE VARIOUS LOCATIONS AND .
UHHUH .
AND THEY HAVE HAVE CERTAIN AREAS THAT THEY PLANT YOU KNOW A HUNDRED HERE AND A HUNDRED THERE AND THIS IS OF COURSE X NUMBER OF WEEKS OR MONTHS BEFORE FISHING SEASON OPENS SO .
WHAT S THE SEASON APRIL TO SEP OCTOBER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
THAT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT .
UHHUH .
UHHUH PRETTY CLOSE .
UH .
YOU KNOW .
WHAT S A LICENSE COST .
WELL AS I SAY IT S BEEN SEVERAL YEARS BUT THE LICENSES WERE NT THAT EXPENSIVE I SEEMS TO STICK IN MY MIND FIVE TO SEVEN DOLLARS .
YEAH .
IS ABOUT ALL FROM WHAT I REMEMBER IT .
UHHUH IT S ABOUT THE SAME AS TEXAS .
UHHUH .
YEAH .
AND I HAVE OH PROBABLY A HALF A DOZEN DIFFERENT KINDS OF UH FISHING POLES AND AND FLY RODS AND SO FORTH AND AND I HAD BEEN SO BUSY IN MY WORK IN THESE LAST FEW YEARS THAT I HAVE NT HAD TIME TO FISH BUT I M GOING TO BE RETIRING AT THE END OF DECEMBER AND I I HOPE UH THE NEXT FISHING SEASON THAT I CAN SORT OF GET BACK IN AND UH ENJOY THAT THAT THAT WAS A REALLY ENJOYABLE UH THING FOR ME TO DO .
WELL I HAVE ALL SONS SO I THINK I M PROBABLY GOING TO BE FISHING FOR A LONG TIME .
HUH I JUST HAVE ONE SON AND HE HE LIVES OUT OF THE STATE NOW RATHER IN THE EASTERN CORNER OF IT SO I DO NT THINK HE HAS TIME TO FISH EITHER .
I CAUGHT THE DISEASE FROM MY FATHER AND I M PASSING IT ON TO MY CHILDREN IT S REALLY .
OH IS THAT RIGHT .
THEY LOVE IT YEAH .
OH MY GOODNESS .
RIGHT .
WELL I I THE DISEASE I CAUGHT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE UH I I WAS IN THE NORFOLK PORTSMOUTH AREA AND .
UHHUH .
PEOPLE THERE THERE S THERE S SO MUCH WATER AROUND .
RIGHT .
THAT YOU YOU RE EITHER BOATING OR YOU RE FISHING .
RIGHT .
AND UH I FAIRLY ENJOYED AT THAT TIME I HAVE A SMALL ALUMINUM BOAT HERE .
UHHUH .
THAT UH WHEN I GO ON ONE OF THE LARGE LAKES THAT WE HAVE HERE THAT I ENJOY FISHING FOR FOR TROUT FROM THAT .
UH UH I DO NT I DO NT KNOW ABOUT THE LAKES IN CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA ARE THERE MANY .
WELL AS I SAY I M IN CENTER COUNTY THERE S UM THERE RE TWO DIFFERENT SIZE LAKES ABOUT WELL FIVE SIX MILES FROM STATE COLLEGE .
UHHUH .
NOW THESE ARE NT HUGE LAKES FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW .
UHHUH .
BUT THEY ARE PROBABLY FIFTEEN TWENTY ACRES MAYBE .
UHHUH .
WHICH WHICH HERE IS A LOT OF WATER .
UH WE ARE TO DISCUSS AIR POLLUTION AND UH WHAT WE THINK THE CAUSES ARE .
UHHUH .
AND I PROBABLY WOULD UH TARGET UH .
INDUSTRY AS BEING NUMBER ONE POLLUTER .
YEAH THAT S PROBABLY A MAJOR ONE I THINK UH INDIVIDUALLY UH JUST BY THE VAST NUMBER OF PEOPLE THERE ARE THERE S I THINK CARS ARE ALSO A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO IT .
WELL VEHICLES AND AND .
YES .
YEAH VEHICLES .
RIGHT BECAUSE UH THERE S A LOT OF COMMERCIAL VEHICLES OUT THERE .
ESPECIALLY THOSE THE BIG RIGS LIKE THE BUSSES AND UM .
THE BIG .
HUH .
UH EIGHTEEN WHEELERS AND SO FORTH .
UHHUH UHHUH .
I THINK THEY WOULD GENERATE PROBABLY UH ONE OF THEM WOULD PROBABLY GENERATE ENOUGH FOR THREE CARS .
BUT THAT S NOT AND I THINK IT CAN BE RESOLVED IF UH IF THEY REALLY LET GO WITH .
JUST A MINUTE I M ON THE PHONE .
THE TECHNOLOGY THAT THEY HAVE AT UH AT THEIR HAND AND THEY HAVE NT RELEASED IT YET .
UHHUH .
I THINK THERE S A LOT OF HOLD BACK UH BECAUSE .
OF UH OH PRIORITIES THAT THEY HAVE .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
AND UH IT S .
WELL IT .
YOU HAVE SOME CHILDREN .
YES .
I HAVE I HAVE FIVE IN THE KITCHEN AT THE MOMENT YOU NEED TO SHUT THE DOOR PLEASE SHUT THE DOOR RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THE AIR CONDITIONER RUNNING WHAT DO YOU NEED HURRY I M ON THE PHONE YES YOU MAY AND THEY KEEP TURNING THE TAPE RECORDER UP BESIDES .
OH OKAY .
DO YOU HAVE DO YOU WATCH CHILDREN OR DO YOU .
UM I HAVE THREE OF MY OWN AND I HAVE UH TWO THAT I M TENDING FOR THE SUMMER .
UHHUH .
OFF AND ON SO .
WELL THAT S INTERESTING .
UM IS THERE ANYTHING .
THEY CAUSE MORE NOISE POLLUTION THAN AIR POLLUTION .
WELL TEMPORARILY THEY DO .
THAT S RIGHT THAT S RIGHT .
THEN WE GET OUT OF THAT PHASE .
YEAH .
SOON ENOUGH .
BUT UM I THINK ANOTHER YOU CAN TELL WHEN YOU GO AROUND CITIES YOU CAN SMELL SPECIFIC THINGS FROM FROM SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES .
OH YES .
I REMEMBER BEING I I GREW UP IN NEW JERSEY .
UHHUH .
AND UH I CAN REMEMBER THE SMELL OF NEWARK VIVIDLY .
UHHUH SURE .
AND IT S THE TYPE OF INDUSTRY YOU KNOW WHICH OBVIOUSLY IF YOU CAN SMELL IT IT S IN THE AIR .
UHHUH WELL I KNOW UH UH IN MICHIGAN UH THE WAY THEY USED TO TAKE CARE OF THE TRASH IS THEY WOULD INCINERATE IT AND THE FUMES FROM THE INCINERATION WAS A TERRIBLE POLLUTANT TO THE AIR .
YEAH .
AND UM OF COURSE NOW .
WELL PEOPLE THINK YOU BURN IT IT S GONE BUT IT S NOT GONE .
NO AND WHEN THEY .
AND YOU BURY IT AND IT S NOT GONE EITHER BECAUSE IT HAS UNTOLD RAMIFICATIONS .
UHHUH .
AND UH .
THEN IT JUST GETS INTO THE SOIL AND INTO THE WATER .
AND IT GETS INTO INTO PEOPLE .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW WHICH IS UH THE THE MOST IMPORTANT UM RESOURCE THAT WE HAVE IS PEOPLE AND THEY RE AND THEY RE DESTROYING US THEY .
YEAH .
REALLY ARE .
WE REALLY HAVE TO DO MORE .
SO I THINK THE COCKROACH WILL EVOLVE UH SA SAFELY .
SO THEY SAY .
I THINK WE VE GOT TO DO MORE WITH THE RECYCLING THAT S I M I M REALLY GLAD TO SEE THAT THERE S MORE OF THAT HAPPENING .
YES BUT THERE S NOT ENOUGH .
YEAH .
AND WE NEED EXPERT COOPERATION .
WELL IT S A WE RE GETTING AT LEAST THEY RE STARTING YOU KNOW .
YEAH EDUCATION OF THE .
SO AT LEAST THEY RE MOVING THAT DIRECTION .
EDUCATION OF THE PEOPLE IS PRIMARY I WOULD THINK .
YEAH .
AND UH AND WE RE HARD TO TEACH .
UHHUH WELL .
WE ARE HARD TO TEACH .
IT S GOING TO IT S PROBABLY GOING TO BE A GENERATION OR TWO BEFORE .
ABSOLUTELY YEAH .
BEFORE IT S REALLY GOING .
UHHUH .
VERY WELL BECAUSE NOW THE ADULTS ARE MORE AWARE OF IT AND THE CHILDREN ARE BEING TAUGHT IN THE SCHOOLS MORE IT LL BE YOU KNOW ON DOWN THE ROAD THIS IS GOING TO BE PASSED ON WHICH IS GOOD .
ABSOLUTELY YES UH OF COURSE UH WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT ACCELERATED BECAUSE UH OF THE CRITICAL NATURE OF IT .
UHHUH .
THE THE LEARNING OF IT AND THE JUST TO UM THINK THAT WAY WE HAVE TO BE IN THAT THOUGHT PATTERN AND ABLE TO UM MOTIVATE OURSELVES TO UM UH DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR THE ATMOSPHERE .
UHHUH .
UM I THINK WE RE ALL CONTRIBUTORS I MEAN EVERY HUMAN BEING THAT LIVES IS A CONTRIBUTOR .
YEAH .
TO POLLUTION SO .
YEAH .
WE JUST UM .
I THINK YOU RE RIGHT EDUCATION IS A BIG THING .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND AS WE EDUCATE THEM INDIVIDUALLY WHAT THEY CAN DO PEOPLE BECOME MORE AWARE OF THE THINGS IN INDUSTRY TOO THAT THAT ARE CAUSING PROBLEMS AND AND I THINK THAT THEY LL GRAD THEY LL WORK TOWARDS SOLVING THOSE PROBLEMS MORE TOO UM .
WELL HOPEFULLY IT CAN BE RESOLVED WITHIN A SHORTER TIME FRAME THAN WE HAVE SEEN IT DONE IN THE PAST .
UHHUH .
THAT THE TIME FRAME FOR CLEANING UP OUR AIR AND OUR AND OUR UM LAND YOU KNOW WHICH UH WE GET OUR NUTRIENTS FROM .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW I MEAN .
EVERYTHING GOES BACK TO THE LAND .
JUST A MINUTE AND I LL TURN IT UP I LL TURN IT UP IN A MINUTE HONEY WHEN I M DONE .
SO UM IT S JUST UM VERY CRITICAL I THINK AT THIS POINT TO .
UHHUH .
UH GET THAT THROUGH TO THE PEOPLE AND GET US EDUCATED .
YEAH WELL I THINK SCIENCE HAS COME A LONG WAY TO MAKING IT SO THAT IT S POSSIBLE TO FIND WAYS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM .
UHHUH .
UM .
I I DO NT KNOW IF THEY OFFER CLASSES IN UH THE UH IN THE GRADE SCHOOL .
UH UH SUBJECTING .
I THINK THEY TEACH IT A LOT IN SCIENCE .
IN SCIENCE OKAY .
YEAH I WOULD THINK THAT THAT S WHERE IT WOULD COME THROUGH .
WHAT GRADE LEVEL WOULD THAT BE WOULD THAT BE UM PERHAPS .
I .
THE FIRST GRADE LEVEL WHICH WOULD BE .
I THINK THEY RE KIND OF GETTING IT IN ALL DIFFERENT GRADES .
WELL I MEAN ARE THEY STARTING THOUGH AT AT WITH THE CHILDREN THAT ARE SO THEIR LITTLE MINDS ARE LIKE SPONGES AND THEY CAN REALLY .
YEAH .
UH RELATE TO THAT .
I THINK THEY ARE STARTING PROBABLY IN THE FIRST GRADE THEY RE YOU KNOW THEY RE HEARING SOMEWHAT ABOUT IT UM I KNOW UH TARGET HAS THEIR PROGRAM TO MAKE KIDS MORE AWARE OF IT AND .
TARGET STORES .

OH OKAY .
THEY VE GOT IF YOU GO IN THE ENTRANCE THEY VE GOT UH STANDS USUALLY WHERE THEY HAVE UM LITTLE UH KIND OF A LITTLE NEWSPAPER THING .
OKAY .
THAT THE KIDS CAN READ AND .
OH I SEE .
AND THEY CAN FORM A A GROUP TO UM .
UHHUH HELP FIGHT THE POLLUTION .
YEAH YEAH .
OH THAT S WONDERFUL .
SO .
WELL I M SURE THAT UH PERHAPS THEY RE THE LEADERS YOU KNOW AND OTHER WILL OTHERS WILL PICK UP ON THEIR EXAMPLE AND CARRY IT UH FURTHER .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW BECAUSE UH THOUGHTS ARE .
WELL I I KNOW IT S HAR IT S A HARD PROBLEM TO SOLVE BECAUSE YOU YOU KNOW LIKE MCDONALD S HAS CHANGED BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN PAPER AND FOAM AND THAT KIND OF THING .
UHHUH .
AND THEY DO ALL THESE STUDIES ON WHICH ONES POLLUTE MORE AND THEN THERE S THE PAPER AND PLASTIC BAG QUESTION .
SO WHERE WAS YOUR LAST VACATION .

YEAH WELL WE UH WE HAVE A FAMILY REUNION ON MY MOTHER S SIDE OF THE FAMILY THAT S UH OH IT STARTED PROBABLY ABOUT FORTY YEARS AGO UH BECAUSE I REMEMBER GOING AS A TEENAGER BEFORE I WAS EVER MARRIED AND THEN MY HUSBAND AND I WENT UH WHILE WE WERE STILL DATING AND IT S STILL GOING ON AND IT USED TO BE HELD AT LAKE BROWNWOOD DOWN AT BROWNWOOD TEXAS BUT NOW WE HOLD IT AT UH LAKE TEXOMA SO THAT THE OKLAHOMA GROUP DOES NT HAVE TO DRIVE AS FAR .
UHHUH .
AND UH WE HAVE HAD AS MANY ON A SATURDAY NIGHT IT STARTS ON FRIDAY AND GOES THROUGH SUNDAY AND WE VE HAD AS MANY ON A UH SATURDAY NIGHT AS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY .
UM NOW WE WOULD HAVE GROUP LIKE THAT IN ARKANSAS .

WELL WHAT KINDS OF THINGS DO YOU DO TO TRY TO GET YOUR CHILDREN INTERESTED JUST TALK TO THEM ABOUT IT .
WELL TALK TO THEM ABOUT IT AND YOU KNOW TELL THEM SOME OF THE THINGS WE RE DOING NOW WHEN HE WAS A CHIL UH A YOUNG OH PRETEEN YOU KNOW WHEN HE WAS LIKE TEN OR TWELVE .
UHHUH .
HE LOVED GOING HE HAD ANOTHER COUSIN HE WAS CLOSE TO AND WENT BUT THAT COUSIN KIND OF QUIT GOING AND AS HE GOT TO BE A TEENAGER UH HE WAS NT QUITE AS AS INTERESTED HE WAS MORE INTERESTED IN ROCK AND ROLL AND THIS IS MORE COUNTRY WESTERN GROUP .
UHHUH .
AND UH JUST LACK OF INTEREST .
SET .
OKAY .
YOU YOU GOT THE TOPIC RIGHT .
YEAH .
OKAY UH WELL WHERE IN DALLAS ARE YOU .
I M IN RICHARDSON .
OH OKAY SO YOU DO RE DO RECYCLING THERE .
YEAH RICHARDSON HAS UH WELL THEY HAVE A NEWSPAPER PICK UP ONCE A WEEK SUPPOSEDLY IF IT S NOT RAINING .
UHHUH .
AND THEY ALSO HAVE A COUPLE OF AREAS WHERE YOU CAN TAKE UH CANS PLASTIC AND PAPER TO UH YOU KNOW DUMP THEM OFF THERE IF YOU DO NT UH WANT TO WAIT AND HAVE A PICK UP LEAST OF PAPER BUT THEY DO NT PICK UP THE OTHER ITEMS THEY DO NT PICK UP CANS OR THE .
UHHUH .
PLASTIC .
ARE THEY GOING TO LATER DO YOU KNOW .
I M NOT SURE THEY ONLY STARTED TO DO THE NEWSPAPER UH LATE LAST YEAR JUST KIND OF LIKE A TRIAL BASIS .
UHHUH .
AND SEE HOW IT GOES SO I DO NT KNOW IF THEY RE GOING TO PICK UP THE OTHER THINGS .
UM .
WHAT ABOUT YOU .
WELL I M I M IN DALLAS PROPER .
UHHUH .
IN THE CITY OF DALLAS AND I KNOW THEY DO HAVE YOU KNOW A PILOT PROGRAM GOING ON BUT IT S NOT HERE .
UM .
SO THEY RE NOT PICKING UP ANYTHING .
OH .
SO I MEAN WE WE COLLECT EVERYTHING WE VE GOT ALL THESE BOXES IN OUR GARAGE FOR YOU KNOW GREEN GLASS AND CLEAR GLASS AND PLASTIC AND EVERYTHING .
WHERE DO YOU TAKE THEM .
WELL THERE S THERE S A COUPLE PLACES UNFORTUNATELY WE CA NT FIND A PLACE THAT WILL TAKE EVERYTHING .
UM .
UH THERE S A LOT OF PLACES TO TAKE LIKE THE PLASTIC UH SHOPPING BAGS .
UHHUH .
LIKE MOST OF THE GROCERY STORES .
UHHUH .
AND THERE S A WALMART NEARBY THAT TAKES ALMOST EVERYTHING I CA NT REMEMBER WHAT IT IS THEY DO NT TAKE .
UM .
AND THE LIBRARY WILL TAKE GLASS SO WE END UP YOU KNOW ON THE WEEKEND WE PACK IT ALL IN THE CAR AND .
AND AS WE GO PLACES WE OH WAIT WE CAN DROP THE GLASS OFF YOU KNOW .
UM .
DROP THINGS OFF ONE AT A TIME BUT UH AND IT S KIND OF DISAPPOINTING I MEAN I WOULD EVEN BE HAPPY IF THEY JUST HAD ONE YOU KNOW ONE PLACE WHERE YOU COULD DO EVERYTHING YOU KNOW IT WOULD STILL BE MORE CONVENIENT THAN WHAT WE HAVE NOW .
ONE OF THE PEOPLE FROM MY DEPARTMENT I THINK USED TO TAKE A LOT OF THE STUFF TO A RECYCLING CENTER THAT WAS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE DALLAS SHELTER .
UM .
I THINK IT WAS .
WHERE IS THAT .
CLOSER TO DOWNTOWN UH SHE S NOT HERE ANYMORE .
OH .
BUT UH YEAH .
I M PRETTY FAR NORTH I M NOT I M I M I M JUST I M NORTH OF ADDISON ACTUALLY .
OH .
SO I M I M REALLY .
YEAH .
I M S I M IN DALLAS BUT ONLY TECHNICALLY .
WELL SOMETIMES WE TAKE OUR UH WE ALWAYS KEEP OUR ALUMINUM CANS .
UHHUH .
YEAH .
AND A LOT OF TIMES THEY TAKE THEM OVER TO ONE OF THESE CAN BANKS .
YEAH I VE SEEN THOSE .
YOU DO NT GET TOO MUCH MONEY BACK I FIGURE IT PAYS FOR THE GAS TO TAKE MY CANS OVER THERE .
YEAH .
BUT NORMALLY I COLLECT OH LIKE THREE TRASH BAGS FULL .
YEAH .
AND I TAKE THEM OVER TO THAT CAN BANK AND IT S MORE FUN JUST TO KIND OF LIKE CRUNCH THE CANS .
IN THE CAN BANK DO NT GET TOO MUCH MONEY FOR THEM BUT .
WELL YOU GET SOMETHING .
UH .
YEAH .
WE USED TO DO THAT BUT AGAIN THAT S ANOTHER STOP .
UHHUH .
AND IT DOES NT TAKE PLASTIC BAGS AND AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING BUT UH I THINK THAT YOU KNOW I HEARD THAT IT WAS GOING WELL IN THE PILOT AREA WHEREVER THAT IS AND .
UHHUH .
SO HOPEFULLY THEY LL DO IT SOON THAT WOULD BE GOOD BECAUSE WE HAVE TWO TRASH PICK UPS A WEEK .
UHHUH .
AND WHERE I GREW UP WE ONLY HAD ONE A WEEK AND THAT WAS CERTAINLY SUFFICIENT SO IF THEY JUST DO ONE OF THEM WILL BE TRASH AND THE ALTERNATE TIME WOULD BE RECYCLABLES THAT WOULD BE GREAT .
YEAH .
SO .
YEAH UH I M DISAPPOINTED SOMETIMES THEY RE NOT ALWAYS CONSISTENT IN PICKING UP THOSE PAPERS YOU KNOW I SEEM TO PUT THEM OUT THERE .
UHHUH .
ON WEDNESDAY AND LIKE SOMETIMES THEY COME BY SOMETIMES THEY DO NT .
OH .
I M NOT REALLY SURE WHY THEY RE NOT ALWAYS CONSISTENT IN THAT .
UM .
BUT I COULD CERTAINLY HAVE UH THREE BINS OUT THERE FOR YOU KNOW PLASTIC AND .
RIGHT .
AND TIN AND PAPER WHATEVER THEY WERE GOING TO UH SEPARATE INTO AND AND HAVE THEM PICK IT UP ON ON ONE OF THE TWO DAYS PER WEEK THAT WOULD BE EASY .
YEAH DO YOU HAVE TO UH SORT THE PAPER AND TAKE OUT THE GLOSSY PAGES AND THAT THAT SORT OF THING OR DO THEY TAKE THE WHOLE THING .
YOU RE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE LIKE THE COUPONS IN THERE .
OH OKAY .
UH OR YOU RE NOT SUPPOSED TO PUT MAGAZINES IN THERE .
UHHUH .
AND YOU CA NT TAKE NEWSPAPERS NOW AT WORK UH YOU KNOW WE HAVE CHANGED OUR RECYCLING AT FIRST THEY WERE KIND OF FINICKY ABOUT WHAT KIND OF PAPER YOU COULD RECYCLE AND NOT TOO LONG AGO THEY FINALLY DECIDED IF IT S ANYTHING THAT S PAPER AND TEARS YOU CAN THROW IT IN THERE BECAUSE AT FIRST .
LET ME GUESS .
THEY SAID .
YOU WORK AT T I RIGHT .
YEAH AT FIRST THEY SAID .
SO DO I .
THEY SAID NO TELEPHONE BOOKS .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW WELL THAT S STUPID AND THEN THEY .
UM .
SAID NO NEWSPAPERS WELL IN THE MY DEPARTMENT EVERYBODY GETS THE WALL STREET JOURNAL .
YEAH .
THERE WAS LIKE A LOT OF PAPER COMING OUT OF OUR DEPARTMENT THAT WAS NT RECYCLABLE .
YEAH .
SO I THOUGHT THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD TO EXPAND UPON IT SAY .
WELL AND THEY TAKE CANS NOW TOO .
YEAH .
WHICH IS GREAT .
I STILL PUT MY CANS IN WITH THE CANS I MEAN I DO NT WANT IT WITH PAPER SOMEHOW THAT JUST SEEMS WEIRD TO ME .
WELL OUR DEPARTMENT USED TO COLLECT THE CANS ANYWAY FOR THE CHRISTMAS TREE PROJECT AND .
OH .
IN FACT WE GOT THIS PAST YEAR WE GOT ALL OF OUR MONEY FOR THE CHRISTMAS TREE BECAUSE WE SAVED CANS FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR .
OOH .
AND IT WORKED OUT REALLY WELL .
WELL WE HAD THE ONE PERSON WHO USED TO TAKE THINGS TO THE DALLAS SHELTER .
UHHUH .
I THINK THAT S WHAT THAT WAS CALLED .
UHHUH .
SHE COLLECTED SHE USED TO COLLECT FROM THE WHOLE DEPARTMENT BUT SHE TOOK THEM ALL DOWN TO THAT DALLAS SHELTER PLACE .
UHHUH .
I WISH I COULD REMEMBER THE WHOLE NAME OF THAT PLACE BUT IT S A CHARITY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THIS SHELTER .
UHHUH .
AND YEAH SHE U SHE USED TO COLLECT THEM FROM EVERYBODY IN THE DEPARTMENT .
YEAH .
SHE D GO UP AND DOWN WITH HER LITTLE BAG .
YEAH .
COLLECTING .
YEAH .
FROM EVERYBODY .
BECAUSE WE WOULD GET IT .
OKAY UH IT S NOT SUCH A BAD IDEA TO THINK ABOUT JUDGES UH YOU KNOW TAKING THE IDEA OF UH UH SENTENCING IN INTO THEIR HANDS VERSUS YOU KNOW THE JURY ESPECIALLY IF IT S A HIGHLY PUBLICIZED CASE SUCH AS UH YOU VE GOT CASES RIGHT NOW THAT ARE GOING ON THAT EVERYBODY S VERY WELL INFORMED OF OR HAVE READ UH CERTAIN UH THINGS IN REGARDS TO CASES LIKE THE DAHLMER CASE IN MILWAUKEE AND STUFF SO IT S IT MAY BE AN IDEA TO THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW COST TRYING TO FIND A JURY .
YEAH .
SO YOU CAN GET A JURY AS FAR AS UH THEY MAY SAY THEY RE NOT BIASED BUT DEEP DOWN THEY ARE A AGAINST THIS PERSON OR WHATEVER SO UH I DO NT THINK IT S SUCH A BAD IDEA TO THINK ABOUT SO .
RIGHT THAT IT THAT IT I A JUDGE WOULD BE MORE CONSISTENT FROM ONE CASE TO THE NEXT AND NOT .
EXACTLY .
NOT DE AND AND UH NOT DEPEND SO MUCH ON THE ON THE EMOTIONS OF A PARTICULAR CASE BUT BE ABLE TO PUT IT IN OVERALL PERSPECTIVE .
UHHUH .
WELL .
YEAH .
I I CERTAINLY HAVE NT THOUGHT MUCH ABOUT THIS BUT .
CATCHES YOU OFF GUARD DOES NT IT .
YES YES SOME OF THEM SOME OF THEM DO AND SOME OF THEM DO NT BUT UH THIS ONE UH I WAS TRYING TO REMEMBER BACK IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT YOU KNOW WHEN I STUDIED CIVICS IN .
UHHUH .
SCHOOL OR STUFF THAT THIS THE JURIES BEING INVOLVED IN THE SENTENCING WAS NT WAS NT SO MUCH AND I M I M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER THAT S I M REMEMBERING WRONG OR WHETHER THAT S A .
I DID NT THINK THEY .
BY STATE .
WERE EITHER I THOUGHT THE SENTENCING WAS DONE BY THE JUDGE .
YEAH .
I MEAN IT S EITHER GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY .
YEAH AND UH I I GUESS AND I DO NT KNOW WHETHER IT S BY STATE OR WHETHER THERE S BEEN SOME .
CHANGES .
SUPREME SUPREME COURT DECISION PERHAPS THAT SAID THAT UH THAT UH AS PART OF THE TRIAL BY THE PEERS THAT HAD TO INCLUDE THE SENTENCING OR .
UHHUH .
TOO OR WHATEVER I YEAH BUT I YEAH I CERTAINLY WOULD NT BE UH UH WORRIED ABOUT THAT I GUESS IN TERMS OF THE UH YOU KNOW HA HAVING A JUDGE DO IT WOULD SEEM TO ME TO BE MORE MORE FAIR AND .
OH SURE .
AND UH .
YEAH YEAH .
UNBIASED UH IN TERMS OF DOING AWAY WITH THE WITH THE UNANIMOUS JURY I GUESS I GUESS I UH WOULD BE A LITTLE MORE LEERY OF THAT KIND OF A CHANGE IN IN THE TRIAL SYSTEM THAT THAT S JUST A SUCH A TRADITION THAT IT S A THAT IT S GOT TO BE A UNANIMOUS .
EXACTLY .
JURY .
EXACTLY YEAH .
THAT UH I DO NT KNOW WHERE YOU D WHERE YOU D DRAW THE LINE ANYWHERE ELSE UH YOU KNOW UH .
YEAH .
TWOTHIRDS OR THREEFOURTHS OR WHATEVER .
UHHUH .
BUT UH AND AND I I I CERTAINLY WOULD NT FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH JUST A JUST A BARE MAJORITY .
EXACTLY .
UH .
UHHUH YEAH THAT S KIND OF HOW I YOU KNOW IN CERTAIN CASES I CAN SEE THEM GOING UH UH JUST BASICALLY WITH A JUDGE GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY .
YEAH .
VERDICT .
YEAH .
UH SIMPLY FROM A JUDGE IN HIGHLY PUBLICIZED CASES VERSUS THE SMALL UH MAYBE YOU DID A CRIME THAT WAS UH BURGLARY OR WHATEVER AND IT GOES INTO THE COURT CASE OR WHATEVER AND IT S NOT HIGHLY PUBLICIZED BUT WHEN YOU GET INTO THESE HIGHLY PUBLICIZED CASES WHERE EVERYBODY KNOWS DETAILS WHETHER IT S THROUGH THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER .
YEAH WHATEVER .
OR WHATEVER .
YEAH .
UH IT S THE IDEA THAT PERSON MIGHT INITIALLY HAVE THIS THOUGHT WELL JEEZ THIS PERSON S GUILTY NO MATTER WHAT I M NOT GOING TO LISTEN TO THE FACTS OR .
YEAH .
AND AND CON THEIR WAY INTO UH GETTING PAST THE LAWYERS AND GETTING THROUGH THAT BUT UH ALSO THERE S ASPECT OF COST AND I I M NOT QUITE SURE HOW MUCH COST IT DOES TAKE FOR UH THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO TRY AND CALL A JURY WHETHER IT S VERY COSTLY OR IF IT S SOMETHING THAT S NOT COSTLY OR WHAT YOU KNOW BEING THAT I M NOT IN THE THAT AREA I REALLY DO NT KNOW BUT I WONDER .
YEAH .
IF THERE IS SOME BIG EXPENSE IN TRYING TO CALL A JURY TO TRIAL AND THEN HAVING TO PAY WHATEVER THEY HAVE TO PAY IF THERE S SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY I KNOW COMPANIES HAVE TO PAY FOR THESE PEOPLE TO BE OFF FROM WORK OR .
YEAH .
AT LEAST GIVE THEM THE TIME OFF FROM WORK UH WHETHER IT S I THINK IT S WITH PAY IF I REMEMBER JURY DUTY IS WITH PAY .
WELL .
AND IT S NOT .
AND AND I M I I D I KNOW IT IS I KNOW IT IS WHERE I WHERE I WORK .
UHHUH .
BUT I M NOT SURE THAT THAT S THAT THAT S NECESSARILY REQUIRED UH YOU KNOW BY LAW THAT IT HAS TO BE .
PAID RIGHT .
PAID UH I SUSPECT THAT S A THAT S A BENEFIT OF A BIGGER COMPANY BUT BUT THERE ARE .
UHHUH .
CERTAINLY SOME .
SOME THAT MAY DECIDE NOT TO .
SOME THAT SOME THAT WOULD NT UH YEAH .
OKAY SO WHAT WERE YOU SAYING .
DO YOU WORK WITH DO YOU WORK AROUND CHILDREN WHEN YOU WORK .
NO NO NOT AT ALL .
I WORK WITH COMPUTERS .
WITH COMPUTERS .
YEP THEY .
WHAT .
OKAY DO YOU HA .
ONE THING .
I .
BUT YOU HAVE FRIENDS .
THAT HAVE CHILDREN .
I HAVE SOME FRIENDS .
THAT HAVE CHILDREN UH NOT THAT MANY ACTUALLY .
UHHUH .
UH .
WHAT IS CHILD CARE LIKE IN NEW YORK .
WHAT IS .
I DO NOT REALLY KNOW EXCUSE ME TOO MUCH ABOUT CHILD CARE IN NEW YORK .
DOES THE COMPANY .
YOU WORK FOR HAVE .
CHILD CARE ON PREMISES FOR .
EXCUSE ME .
ONE SECOND .
EMPLOYEES .
HUHUH .
NO NOT AT ALL IN FACT MY SITUATION IS A LITTLE BIT STRANGE I WAS UH A STUDENT FOR MANY YEARS AND THEN GRADUATED AND WENT AND WORKED IN FRANCE FOR AWHILE .
AND I .
OH .
HAVE JUST COME BACK AND WAS DOING CONSULTING WORK .
OH MY .
SO I AM JUST TAKING A LITTLE BIT OF TIME OFF RIGHT NOW .
A SABBATICAL .
UH AND AND I MIGHT .
WELL I HOPE YOU CAN STAY AS LONG AS POSSIBLE WITH IT .
YEAH WELL HOPEFULLY I CAN DO SOME .
CONSULTING WORK AT HOME .
AND IF I CAN DO THAT IT WILL YEAH .
OH YEAH THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL .
I LL BE ABLE TO SPEND THE TIME WITH MY DAUGHTER AND .
RIGHT .
NOT HAVE TO WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT CHILD CARE .
BUT .
RIGHT .
UH I MIGHT START TO GO CRAZY WITH IT TOO .
IT IS A LITTLE I MISS THE INTELLECTUAL STIMULATION .
RIGHT .
BUT AT THE SAME TIME .
I REALLY IT WOULD BREAK MY HEART TO GIVE HER TO A STRANGER RIGHT NOW .
AND .
I THINK IT DOES WHEN WHEN THEY ARE REAL LITTLE AND THEY ARE CHANGING EVERY DAY .
OH YES .
THERE S AND YOU JUST MISS THE LITTLE THINGS .
YEAH .
AND AND UH .
WELL I THINK FOR ME MUMBLEX THE IMPORTANT CONCERNS I DO NOT THINK I WOULD PUT HER IN DAY CARE FOR JOINT .
UHHUH .
SITUATION RIGHT NOW UNLESS IT WAS LIKE ONE .
OTHER CHILD WITH A WITH A PERSON .
UHHUH .
I WOULD NOT WANT HER TO BE INTO A IN A LARGE DAY CARE SITUATION SO YOUNG .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE I THINK A LITTLE INFANT JUST DOES NOT GET THE STIMULATION .
THEY NEED .
THAT S RIGHT .
MAYBE IF I NEEDED TO WORK PART TIME LIKE FOUR HOURS .
A DAY I MIGHT DO THAT CAUSE LIKE YOU SHOULD GET ENOUGH STIMULATION FROM YOU .
THE REST OF THE TIME .
BUT UH I JUST THINK THAT YOU KNOW WHEN THERE .
S TWO YEAR OLDS RUNNING AROUND THE WHOEVER IS TAKING CARE OF THE CARE GIVERS ARE GOING TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE TWO YEAR OLDS .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND ONLY WHEN THE INFANT SCREAMS .
THAT S RIGHT .
ARE THEY GOING TO GO THERE AND IF NOT THE INFANT IS GOING TO LAY IN THE CRIB .
ALL DAY AND MAYBE HAVE A MOBILE ABOVE IT TO PLAY WITH .
RIGHT .
AND YOU KNOW I PLAY WITH HER MOST OF THE TIME .
SHE IS AWAKE AND I THINK THAT IS SO IMPORTANT .
RIGHT .
WELL THAT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE BONDING THAT THEY DO IT .
YEAH .
WITH THE MOTHER .
WELL SUCH AS THINGS FOR LEARNING GIVES THE CHILD STIMULATION .
I THINK IS IMPORTANT .
RIGHT .
AND UH .
OUR OLDEST GRANDSON WHEN HE WAS EIGHTEEN MONTHS OLD WENT INTO A A MONTESSORI .
UHHUH .
DAY CARE SYSTEM .
AND THEY TOOK INFANTS STARTING AT SIX WEEKS AND THEY HAVE A PROGRAM UH IN THAT WAS DEVISED BY THIS MONTESSORI PERSON AND UH AND A CERTAIN TYPE OF STIMULATIONS AND THERE .
S TIMES OF DAY THAT EVEN WHEN THE CHILD IS AWAKE THAT THEY THAT THEY LAY QUIETLY AND LOOK AT CERTAIN THINGS THEY KEEP DELIBERATELY KEEP THE ROOM NOT REAL BRIGHT .
UHHUH .
AND AND UH THEY HAVE DIFFERENT THINGS THEY WILL THEY WILL PUT THEM DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND OF COURSE THEY NEVER HAVE MORE THAN LIKE FIVE AND AND THEY WILL PUT THEM DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND THEY WILL HAVE ON I THINK ONE OF THEM WAS A LITTLE MIRROR AND SOME WERE JUST DIFFERENT OBJECTS .
THAT HAVE HAD A DEFINITE PURPOSE .
UHHUH .
FOR KIDS YOU KNOW AND THERE S SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR EYES .
YEAH .
UH .
WELL SHE S SHE S JUST BEEN DOING ALL KINDS OF STUFF WHERE SHE S YOU KNOW MUMBLEX .
HOW OLD IS SHE .
SHE .
S TWO MONTHS NOW NINE WEEKS .
OH YEAH .
AND SHE S JUST DRASTICALLY MOVING HER EYES FROM ONE SIDE TO ANOTHER AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
AND SHE S JUST STARTED THAT LIKE YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND SO EVERY DAYS ARE DIFFERENT .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW I THINK CHILD CARE FOR INFANTS IS MUCH HARDER THAN WHEN THEY ARE OLDER AND I WILL PROBABLY BE GOING BACK TO WORK AROUND JANUARY .
UM .
WHEREAS SHE WILL BE ABOUT .
A LITTLE OLDER .
EIGHT OR NINE MONTHS OLD .
AND SO I THINK YOU KNOW SHE WILL BE AT A I HAVE HEARD IT S A ROUGH AGE TO PUT THEM INTO A .
IT IS BECAUSE THAT S WHEN THEY ARE CLINGING TO MAMA .
YEAH .
SO YOU MIGHT HAVE A REAL PROBLEM WITH THAT .
I THINK IT .
BUT BUT I THINK IT .
IT HURTS THE PARENTS TO LEAVE WHEN THE CHILD IS CRYING SO IT YOU KNOW IT WOULD BE IDEAL IF YOU COULD GET SOMEBODY IN SO YOU ARE NOT REALLY LEAVING THE CHILD IN A STRANGE PLACE .
YEAH .
WE ARE JUST GOING TO HAVE .
BUT THAT S UNUSUAL .
TO SEE HOW THINGS WORK OUT .
UH BUT I AM TRYING TO YOU KNOW LEAVE HER .
A FAIR AMOUNT EVEN AT THIS YOUNG AGE WITH HER GRANDPARENTS JUST TO .
UHHUH .
GO TO A MOVIE AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
SO THAT SHE IS USED TO OTHER PEOPLE TAKING CARE OF HER .
IS IT YOUR PARENTS OR YOUR HUSBAND S PARENTS .
MY PARENTS MY HUSBAND S PARENTS ARE IN FRANCE .
SO IT S A LITTLE BIT HARDER BUT DURING YOU KNOW SH SH SHE S MET THEM ALREADY .
OH .
NOT THAT SHE WILL REMEMBER THEM BUT SHE S MET THEM .
RIGHT RIGHT .
THAT S NICE WHEN UH I MY I HAVE THREE GRANDCHILDREN ANOTHER .
ONE COMING IN SEPTEMBER AND I IT WOULD IF THEY WERE WHERE I COULD NOT GET MY HANDS ON THEM I AM AFRAID I WOULD PROBABLY GO CRAZY .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW I I LIKE THAT .
ARE THEY ALL NEARBY .
BUT IF IT .
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PUT THEM IN CHILD CARE THAT S THAT S AN IDEAL SITUATION FOR YOU IS TO STAY WITH THEM AS OR YOU CAN SET UP YOUR WORK PROGRAM AND YOUR HUSBAND S SO THAT ONE OF YOU IS THERE .
ALL THE TIME .
YEAH .
THAT S THAT S WONDERFUL FOR THE CHILD .
BUT .
WELL IF I WORK PART TIME .
THAT MIGHT BE DOABLE .
RIGHT .
AND YOU NEED TO LOOK AT WHEN YOU IF YOU DO DECIDE TO GO WITH CHILD CARE YOU REALLY NEED TO TO LOOK AT WHAT .
YOUR OPTIONS ARE AND AND LOOK AT THE WHAT .
THEY OFFER DROP IN AT TIMES .
THAT ARE UNEXPECTED .
YEAH WELL .
THE .
RIGHT NOW THE SITUATION IS SO TIGHT AT MANY PLACES .
UH .
THAT IT S EVEN HARD TO HAVE A CHOICE .
UH .
INCREDIBLE BUT YOU KNOW SINCE THIS IS PEOPLE BEFORE THEY GET PREGNANT ARE FINDING CHILD CARE FOR THE KIDS .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND YOU KNOW I JUST FIND THAT INCREDIBLE .
AND MY SISTERINLAW IS GOING TO HAVE A BABY VERY VERY SOON AND SHE IS INTENDING TO STAY HOME WITH THE BABY .
OH .
AND YOU KNOW MAYBE DO SOME FREE LANCE TYPE WORK AT HOME .
AND SO IF I GO BACK TO WORK ON A PART TIME BASIS I AM HOPING I CAN LEAVE MY DAUGHTER WITH HER .
OH THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL .
BECAUSE HER DAUGHTER AGAIN WILL BE A COUPLE OF MONTHS MY DAUGHTER WILL BE ABOUT SIX MONTHS OLDER THAN HERS .
AND .
UHHUH UHHUH .
IT WILL BE A LITTLE ROUGH WHEN SHE IS A VERY VERY LITTLE INFANT .
UHHUH UHHUH .
BUT LIKE WHEN SHE IS A MONTH OR SO MY SISTERINLAW HAS HAD LOTS AND LOTS OF EXPERIENCE DEALING WITH BABYSITTING FOR LARGE FAMILIES .
OH .
AND SO UH SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO IT .
A COUPLE OF HOURS .
A DAY AND WE .
COU MIGHT EVEN BE ABLE TO DO IT ON A TRADE OFF BASIS .
THAT I WATCH .
RIGHT .
THEIR BABY WHEN THEY WANT TO GO OUT TO DINNER OR TO MOVIES OR WHATEVER .
RIGHT .
OR IF SHE WANTS AN AFTERNOON OFF .
RIGHT .
EVEN IF SHE WANTS AN AFTERNOON JUST TO WORK .

UH AND NOT BE BOTHERED WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO EXCHANGE THAT WAY .
UHHUH .
AND SO WE WILL JUST HAVE TO SEE HOW THINGS WORK OUT .
BUT I THINK THE WHOLE YOU KNOW IDEALLY I THINK UH BUSINESS SHOULD HAVE THE .
I DO TOO .
DAY CARE CENTERS THERE WHETHER IT S THE PARENTS .
WHO TAKE TURNS WATCHING THE KIDS OR WHETHER THEY HIRE A COUPLE OF PEOPLE AND UH YOU KNOW PARENTS COME DOWN TO SUPERVISE OR .
REALLY WELL TRAINED PEOPLE .
WHATEVER .

SET UP SO THAT YOU WHEN YOU GO YOU CAN BE ASSURED THAT IF THERE S AN EMERGENCY .
THAT PERSON IN CHARGE KNOWS C P R OR FIRST AID OR .
OH YEAH .
AND HAVE SOME KIND OF PROGRAM SET UP LIKE YOU SAY TO STIMULATE THE KIDS OR EDUCATE THEM IN SOME MANNER .
AND HAVE THE YOU KNOW THE RIGHT TOYS AND THE RIGHT SETTING AND UH HAVE A AN ORGANIZED TYPE OF PROGRAM SET UP SO THAT THE KIDS HAVE A SCHEDULE YOU KNOW THAT S REAL IMPORTANT TO LITTLE KIDS .
YEAH WELL SHE S MY DAUGHTER DOES NOT SEEM TO BE ON A REAL SCHEDULE YET AND IT S PROBABLY MY FAULT BECAUSE I DO NOT HAVE A REAL SCHEDULE NOW .
UHHUH .
BUT .
THEY THEY ADJUST TO WHAT .
THE PARENTS MUMBLEX .

RIGHT .
AND THAT S A PROBLEM SOCIETY IS GEARED TO A A DAY PERSON AND IT S I HAVE ANOTHER FRIEND .
WHO S .
BROTHER AND HIS WIFE HAVE DONE THIS THEY STAY UP UNTIL ALL HOURS OF THE NIGHT .
YOU VE DONE .
OUR .
MOST RECENT SERIES OF PROJECTS I GUESS WAS INSIDE WAS UH WE REMODELED A BATHROOM RECENTLY .
WELL HOW DID IT GO .
WELL IT WENT PRETTY WELL UH OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT WE ENCOUNTERED SOME UH PROBLEMS THAT YOU RUN ACROSS IN OLDER HOMES WITH PLUMBING WHICH .
ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER AND EVENTUALLY WE ENDED UP REPLACING ALL THE PIPES FROM THE SINK CLEAR BACK TO THE MAIN DRAIN .
GEE LIKE STARTING OVER I GUESS .
WHICH MEANT YOU NEEDED TO TAKE THE WALL OUT AND START ALL OVER .
UH .
IT WAS NT ONE OF THOSE IT STARTED OUT AS A SUNDAY PROJECT .
UHHUH .
AND BY BY THE NEXT SUNDAY .
IT WAS DONE .
IT .
WAS NT .
A ONE DAYER .
BELIEVE ME .
BOY THAT SOUNDS LIKE UH COURSE UH I DO NT KNOW ONCE YOU GET IT DONE THEN YOU PROBABLY WO NT HAVE THAT PROBLEM AGAIN .
YEAH IT S GOOD FOR ANOTHER THIRTY YEARS .
UM YOU VE GOT AN OLDER HOUSE .
YES .
THEY ARE BUILT A LITTLE BIT MORE STURDY THAN .
WELL THAT S THE THING .
THAT SURPRISED ME BECAUSE ONCE I GOT INTO THE PLUMBING .
RIGHT .
EVERYTHING IN THERE WAS COPPER AND IT WAS ALL SOLDERED .
OH IS THAT RIGHT .
THAT S WHAT DROVE ME BANANAS BECAUSE YOU KNOW I M GOING TO THE HARDWARE STORE SAYING GIVE ME PLASTIC PIPE AND .
YES .
AND CEMENT .
MUMBLEX .
TO FIT THEM TOGETHER AND NOTHING WANTED TO GO SO IT WAS LIKE I HAD TO GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE MAIN DRAIN AND START ALL OVER .
AND JUST START AT SQUARE ONE .
REALLY .
UH .
THAT WAS AN ALL DAY JOB JUST TO GET IT PLUMBED .
WELL AND THEN IF YOU DO IT WRONG .
FORTUNATELY I WAS VERY FORTUNATE UH IN THE FACT THAT UH WHEN I MADE THE INSTALLATION OF THE SINK AND EVERYTHING BOLTED UP AND WE TURNED THE WATER ON .
EVERYTHING WENT ALL RIGHT .
NOTHING LEAKED EVERYTHING WORKED .
AND I JUST SAID THAT S MARVELOUS .
I APPRECIATE IT .
THAT S THE TYPE OF THING .
YOU CROSS YOUR FINGERS AND ARE GLAD WHEN THAT HAPPENS .
WELL I EXPECTED SOMETHING TO LEAK YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
LEFT A FITTING LOOSE OR .
YES .
DID NT USE TEFLON TAPE ON ONE OF THEM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
RIGHT .
BUT IT .
ALL CAME TOGETHER SO I I FELT PRETTY FORTUNATE ABOUT THAT .
ALL WORKED OUT ALL RIGHT HUH .
HOW ABOUT YOU .
WELL UM WELL PROBABLY THE LAST THING .
I DID WAS UH PAINT AND WALLPAPER KIDS ROOM .
UHHUH .
AND UH I LEARNED TO I USED THE WRONG KIND OF PAINT .
THIS WAS NT MUST HAVE NOT BEEN A VERY GOOD QUALITY BECAUSE IT JUST HAS NT STOOD UP VERY WELL .
WHAT KIND OF PAINT .
IT WAS A LATEX PAINT PAINT IT WAS FLAT .
UHHUH .
AND I WONDER IF MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE USED A GLOSS .
UH BUT THEY SAY YOU OUGHT TO USE YOUR GLOSS MAINLY IN YOUR .
MUMBLEX .
KITCHENS AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
YEAH THAT AND SEMIGLOSS FOR TRIM WORK AND USUALLY FLAT FOR WALLS .
YEAH BUT I THINK MAYBE UH I DO NT KNOW IF IT WAS JUST THE .
WAS IT NOT WASHABLE PAINT .
WELL IT IT IS A LATEX PAINT BUT IT JUST KIND OF IS IS SO YOU KNOW SO IT S SUPPOSED TO WASH YOU RE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO WASH IT .
UHHUH .
BUT IT UM JUST LOOKS DINGY .
I DO NT KNOW HOW ELSE TO EXPLAIN IT .
WHAT COLOR IS IT .
IT S PINK .
PINK OKAY .
IT .
S KIND OF GOT UH OH JUST KIND OF A WORN LOOK TO IT .
I DO NT KNOW EVEN HOW TO SAY JUST DID NT TURN OUT QUITE AS NICE AS I WOULD HAVE LIKED BUT .
DID YOU UH REQUIRE MORE THAN ONE CAN OF PAINT .
I WE PUT TWO COATS ON IT AND IT S A SMALL ROOM BUT I THINK IT ONLY TOOK ONE UH CAN .
YOU DID NT HAVE TO MIX PAINT THEN RIGHT .
NO .
OKAY .
WE DID UH OH YOU DO MIX THE COLOR AS FAR AS YOU START WITH UH WHITE AND .
UHHUH .
THEN THEY ADD THE COLOR .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW WHAT .
I M SAYING BUT .
YEAH .
BUT YOU ONLY HAD ONE CAN OF PAINT THAT YOU .
YES .
DID THE ENTIRE ROOM WITH .
RIGHT .
AND THEN I .
WALL PAPERED A COUPLE OF WALLS AND UH .
HOW D THAT GO .
WELL THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME .
I VE EVER WALLPAPERED AND UH .
KIND OF FUN IS NT IT .
THAT S AN EDUCATION IN ITSELF .
REALLY .
BUT UH THE DYE LOTS UH MUST HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FROM FIRST OF ALL IT TAKES QUITE A FEW ROLLS EVEN A SMALL ROOM IF YOU RE TRYING TO MATCH A DESIGN .
REPEATING PATTERNS IS WHAT .
YOU HAVE TO CHECK FOR .
YES .
WHEN YOU WHEN YOU BUY YOUR PAPER .
THAT S WHAT .
I NEEDED AND I DID NT THINK ABOUT THAT .
I GOT A MICKEY MOUSE PRINT IS WHAT .
I GOT .
YEAH .
AND SO A LOT IS WASTED .
NORMALLY IT WILL TELL YOU ON THE ROLL HOW OFTEN A PATTERN REPEATS .
SO YOU KNOW HOW .
SEE I DID NT EVEN THINK TO LOOK FOR THAT .
YEAH .
AND THEN THE ONE OF THEM WAS JUST A DIFFERENT COLOR DIFFERENT COLOR PINK IS WHAT .
IT ENDED UP BEING .
UM .
AND MUMBLEX .
WHEN YOU DID YOUR PAPERING DID YOU START IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WALL .
NO I DID NT .
OR DID YOU START AT THE EDGE .
IS THAT HOW YOU RE SUPPOSED TO DO .
I STARTED AT ONE EDGE AND WENT OVER THEN YOU HAD TO CUT AROUND THE CLOSET .
UHHUH .
AND CUT AROUND A WINDOW .
UHHUH .
BUT UH .
I VE HAD MY BEST LUCK IN PAPERING WHEN I START IN THE MIDDLE OF A WALL AND I LL START WITH A PLUMB LINE .
AND START RIGHT THERE .
AND START IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WALL AND AND GO FROM THERE AND GO ALL THE WAY AROUND THE ROOM .
DO YOU SEEM TO GET IT STRAIGHTER IS THAT THE ADVANTAGE OR WHAT S THE .
WELL YOU YOU .
I HAVE UH I WELL I USED TO HAVE THE OPINION THAT THERE WA THAT THERE REALLY WAS NOT ANY MORE CRIME IN AMERICA IN THE CITIES ANYWAY THAN THERE WAS IN PREVIOUS CENTURIES UH BEFORE UH SIMPLY BECAUSE .
THE REASON THERE SEEMS TO BE SO MUCH WAS THE FACT THAT THE POLICE NOW HAD ADVANCED UH REPORTING METHODS WITH COMPUTERS AND OTHER DEVICES .
COMPILE MORE STATISTICS .
THAT S RIGHT AND THOSE STATISTICS IN TURN GOT THEM BIGGER BUDGETS .
UHHUH .
HOWEVER I HAVE BEEN PERSUADED LATELY I GUESS SIMPLY BY THE UH OVERWHELMING DATA .
THAT SEEMS TO BE AVAILABLE THAT THERE IS INDEED A LOT .
MORE VIOLENT CRIME .
MORE ESPECIALLY WHERE YOU ARE .
ARE YOU .
WELL YEAH .
IN WASHINGTON D C OR WASHINGTON STATE .
NO I AM IN I AM IN WASHINGTON D C .
YEAH YEAH I WAS GOING TO SAY .
ACTUALLY IT YOU KNOW I DO A LOT OF BUSINESS HERE AND I COME HERE QUITE OFTEN AND AND THAT AGAIN IS A IS A SORT OF MEDIA PERCEPTION .
THERE S SOME .
ABSOLUTELY LOVELY AND MARVELOUS AND PEACEFUL AREAS IN WASHINGTON .
OH YEAH .
REGARDLESS OF THE RACIAL MAKEUP BUT IT S IT S REAL UH THERE .
S POCKETS OF VIOLENCE .
THAT IS SO VIOLENT THAT THEY UH .
IT JUST REALLY GRABS YOUR ATTENTION .
YEAH .
IT JUST MAKES THE WHOLE PLACE SEEM LIKE THAT .
RIGHT .
NOW JUST TO FOCUS ON THAT A MINUTE I GUESS UH UH WHEN UH PREVIOUS SECRETARY OF UH EDUCA BENNETT I THINK HIS NAME WAS .
YEAH .
BECAME THE DRUG CZAR UH FOR UH PRESIDENT BUSH HE WAS GOING TO FOCUS ON IT ON THIS AREA AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND I SEE THAT EVEN HE WAS MET WITHOUT WITH WITH LITTLE SUCCESS EVEN THOUGH THE ENTIRE I GUESS A A QUITE A BIT OF MONEY AND OTHER UH PLANNING EFFORTS WENT INTO THAT .
WHAT DO YOU WHAT DO YOU THINK IS CAUSING ALL THIS .
WELL .
BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT THERE EVEN THOUGH CRIME THOUGH I THINK IT IS INCREASING IN NUMBER IT SURE DOES SEEM TO BE INCREASING IN INTENSITY .
YES .
AND VIOLENCE TOO .
WELL I I HAVE THREE THEORIES ABOUT IT YOU KNOW THREE THINGS .
I HAVE ONE THEORY AND IT S BROUGHT TO US BY TWO THINGS .
ONE .
I I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A FUNCTION OF UH THE VIOLENCE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE SEE ON TELEVISION AND THE MOVIES .
UHHUH .
AND I AM NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW UH ROLE MODELS OF GU OF TOUGH GUYS AND GANGSTERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT I AM NOT EVEN I AM NOT EVEN CONVINCED THAT MAYBE THINGS LIKE FOOTBALL HOCKEY AND TH TH THE YOU KNOW THE AND EVEN BASEBALL GAMES NOW WHERE THE EVERYTHING IS SETTLED WITH A FIGHT .
YOU KNOW THE THE IMMEDIATE NEED TO SHOW SOME SORT OF VIOLENCE TO SETTLE TH .
THE ARGUMENT .
AND AND THEN I I AM AN ADVOCATE OF HAND GUN CONTROL TO SOME DEGREE SO I THINK THAT PARTICULARLY I I WAS READING THE OTHER DAY ABOUT UH CORPUS CHRISTI TEXAS .
WHICH HAS THE MUMBLEX .
THE HIGHEST I THINK IT .
S CORPUS CHRISTI THAT HAD THE HIGHEST RATES PER HAND GUN DEATH IN AMERICA .
UM .
UH PER CAPITA .
YEAH I WAS I HAVE NOT SEEN THAT BUT UH .
I MEAN THE SATURDAY NIGHT SPECIAL STUFF SO .
YEAH .
THAT THAT S WHAT .
I THINK ABOUT IT THAT S SOME OF THE THINGS I THINK ABOUT IT PLUS I DO NOT KNOW WHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS .
WELL YEAH I TEND TO AGREE WITH YOU WITH YOU KNOW IT SEEMS ANYMORE UH A MOVIE CAN NOT BE CONSIDERED GOOD UNLESS THERE S JUST SOME SOME SORT OF VIOLENCE .
YES .
OR SOMETHING IN IT .
AND AND ALONG WITH THAT YOU KNOW AND THEN YOU START MAKING A MOVIE AND IT HAS NO THERE S NO CALL FOR SOMETHING VIOLENT BUT SO THEY JUST THROW SOMETHING IN THERE JUST TO SAY THEY HAVE IT .
EXAC WELL THAT S THAT S THAT S THE IMPRESSION .
I GET YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
AND I AND I IMAGINE THAT IT S MUMBLEX YOU KNOW IT JUST FEEDS UPON ITSELF WHEN WE HAVE THIS SORT OF VIOLENCE IN SOCIETY PEOPLE WANT TO IT CONDITIONS PEOPLE TO IT AND UH YOU HAVE TO AMP IT HAS TO BE EVEN UH MAGNIFIED TO TO ATTRACT PEOPLE S ATTENTION .
I GUESS .
YEAH YOU BECOME CALLOUS .
TO HAVE THEM SPEND MONEY ON SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
YEAH .
AND I AM SURE THAT IT DOES FORM ROLE MODELS FOR YOUNG FOR YOUNG MEN AND YOUNG WOMEN AND .
YEAH .
UH I MEAN I I READ NOW WHERE WE ARE YOU KNOW WOMEN ARE ARR YOUNG WOMEN ARE ARRESTED FIGHTING WITH KNIVES OVER OVER WHATEVER .
UM .
MUMBLEX WHATEVER REASON WHICH IS KIND OF UNHEARD OF WHEN I WAS YOUNG .
NOW I DO NOT WANT TO SOUND LIKE AN OLD FART BUT .
THAT S WHAT SEEMS THAT THOSE THINGS HAPPENED BEFOR DID NOT HAPPEN IN THAT MANNER BEFORE TELEVISION .
YEAH .
AND I I I I HAVE TO THINK THAT THAT IT HAS SOME INFLUENCE ON IT .
BUT .
I LISTENED TO A RADIO TALK SHOW TODAY AT LUNCH TIME .
YEAH .
UH RUSH LYNN BOTTOM I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU LISTEN TO HIM OR NOT .
NO .
HE S ON A M BUT THER THERE S A FELLOW .
THAT HAD CALLED IN AND WAS LAMENTING ABOUT THE THERE WAS AN INTERVIEW DONE ON THE ASSISTANT CHIEF OF POLICE FOR LOS ANGELES THE GUY UNDER GATES .
OH YES .
AND THEY WERE JUST REALLY COMING DOWN ON HIM BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE THINGS .
HE WAS JUST SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HE BELIEVED IN SOME OF HIS MORALS .
FOR INSTANCE UH THEY ASKED HIM IF HE SPANKED HIS KIDS AND HE SAID YOU BET I BELIEVE IN DISCIPLINE .
AND PEOPLE I I I I GUESS THEY .
CONFUS CONFUSED DISCIPLINE WITH PUNISHMENT .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
AND JUST IT SEEMS ANYMORE THAT UH IF IF YOU HAVE YOU KNOW THIS TYPE OF A MORAL STANCE THAT PEOPLE COME DOWN ON YOU .
IT .
S LIKE YOU KNOW HEY EVERYBODY HAS TO BE FREE TO DO THEIR OWN THING .
AND I DISAGREE AND I THINK THAT S REALLY CONTRIBUTING TO THIS HIGH RATE OF CRIME .
YES YES .
WELL I MEAN I I GUESS WHAT .
I WANTED TO SAY AND I STOPPED UH I DO NOT KNOW I GOT DIVERTED WAS THAT THAT UH THERE S SO MU THERE S SO MUCH OF A RETURN FROM PRIS TO PRISON THAT THE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS SEEM TO BE A FAILURE .
AND AND THAT IS NOT EMPHASIZED .
I RECOGNIZE THERE S THERE S OVER CROWDING PROBLEMS AND AND SINCE WE HAVE DECIDED TO PUT EVERYBODY IN JAIL .
THAT COMMITS A CRIME NOW THAT THAT S COMPLICATED THE ENTIRE PROCESS .
YEAH .
WHAT .
I ALSO THINK THAT I GUESS IT S THE REFLECTION OF THE SOCIETY WHERE WHERE WE HAVE SO MUCH MORE MOBILITY AND LESS ATTACHMENT TO UH YOU KNOW IT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE ANY RESPONSIBILITY TO THE COMMUNITY WHERE YOU WHERE YOU LIVE OR .
I DO NOT MEAN RESPONS ATTACHMENT AND RESPONSIBILITY I GUESS I MEAN ANY SORT OF .
WELL NOBODY FEELS RESPONSIBILITY TO DO SOMETHING .
IT .
S LIKE OH BOY I WISH THEY WOULD STOP DOING THAT .
YES THAT S RIGHT .
YEAH .
YEAH I I DO NOT KNOW HOW THAT S I DO NOT THINK IT S DONE BY UH THE CHANGES COME SIMPLY BY STATUTORY NATURE .
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT .
IT REALLY WILL TAKE .
UM .
AND I DO NOT KNOW IF I HAVE SOLUTIONS EXCEPT EXCEPT TO YOU KNOW I AM SORT OF A A AN ADVOCATE OF OF UH OF LETTING PEOPLE OF HAVING FREE SPEECH AND I GUESS TO CURB UH TELEVISION UH THE VIOLENCE ON TELEVISION AND IN THE MOVIES WOULD BE CONTRARY TO MY BELIEFS IN THAT .
YEAH .
HOWEVER THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A RIGHT NOW IN VERBALIZING IT DOES SEEM TO BE A HIGHER NEED FOR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT .
YEAH AND THEN HOW MANY .
AND THE SACRIFICE IS NOT THAT GREAT .
HOW MANY STUDIES HAVE TO BE DONE TO SHOW THAT THERE IS A LINK BETWEEN .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW WHAT .
YOU SEE AND HOW YO I MEAN WHAT .
YOU SEE AFFECTS HOW YOU THINK AND THEREFORE WHAT .
YOU DO .
YES YES I THINK I THINK THAT S CORRECT .
AND YES BUT YOU KNOW AS SOON AS YOU START UH .
WELL TEXAS HAS UH TEXAS HAS UH HAS ALWAYS STRUCK ME I MEAN I I I HAVE LIVED IN AND OUT OF TEXAS BOTH IN THE SERVICE AND UH UH SHORT BUSINESS STINTS .
AND IT SEEMS TO ME .
THEY ARE A PRETTY PRETTY TOUGH LAW AND ORDER STATE BUT THAT S A BUT YET THAT DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE EFFECTED THE AMOUNT OF VIOLENT RIGHT IN THE STATE .
JUST CITING THAT YOU KNOW .
YEAH UH UNFORTUNATELY YOU HAVE GOT A LOT OF THE UH SOME WELL A LOT OF IT CAN BE CONTRIBUTED TO TH THE RACIAL DIFFERENCES I MEAN JUST THAT WE ARE SO CLOSE .
YEAH .
TO THE BORDER WITH MEXICO WE HAVE GOT A LOT OF THAT INFLUENCE .
YEAH .
WELL LET ME JUST START BY ASKING WHAT .
YOU THINK OF THIS MIDDLE EAST AFFAIR .
WE VE GOT GOING ON .
I THINK THAT IT S TIME THAT WE CONCENTRATE MORE ON WHAT S GOING ON WITHIN OUR OWN BORDERS THAN WHAT S GOING ON IN THE MIDDLE EAST .
I HAVE TO AGREE WITH YOU THERE .
I UH I THINK THAT UH FOR ONCE WE SHOULD WE SHOULD NT EVEN BE AT AT THESE MID EAST TALKS BECAUSE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF OUR HOSTAGES WE REALLY DO NT HAVE TOO MUCH OF A UH REAL IN WE SHOULD NT HAVE TOO MUCH OF A REAL INTEREST IN DECIDING WHO S LAND .
IT IS .
JUST LET THESE PEOPLE FIGHT IT OUT .
I AGREE .
YOU KNOW WE VE GOT SO MANY DOMESTIC PROBLEMS AND AND WHAT DOES IT COST THESE PEOPLE OVER THERE YOU KNOW .
ABSOLUTELY .
OH SO HOW ABOUT THE SOVIET UNION .
WHAT DO YOU THINK S GOING TO HAPPEN THERE .
THE BREAK UPS .
I THINK THAT S GREAT .
UM I M GLAD TO SEE THAT BUT I AGAIN I DO NT WANT TO SEE US POUR A WHOLE LOT OF ECONOMIC AID INTO THE SOVIET UNION WITHOUT A UH WELL UH A WHOLE LOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BECAUSE I I DO NT KNOW I M I M A BELIEVER IN THE OLD ADAGE THAT IF SOMEBODY EARNS SOMETHING .
IT S WORTH MORE TO THEM THAN IF YOU GIVE IT TO THEM AND SO I M I M NOT MUCH IN FAVOR OF IT BUT I M GLAD TO SEE US ADVISING THEM .
UHHUH .
THAT DOES NT SEEM TO COST A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY .
THAT S RIGHT THAT S RIGHT .
BUT I M READY TO HAVE A PRESIDENT ELECTED THAT AT LEAST HAS SOME SORT OF A DOMESTIC AGENDA EVEN IF IT DOES NT WORK AT LEAST .
HE IS SOMEBODY .
WHO WHO IS WORKING ON THAT PROBLEM .
AND I I HAVE NT SEEN THAT IN THE LAST ELEVEN YEARS SO .
WELL ALL .
I VE SEEN .
THEY DO NT SEEM TO HAVE A CLUE .
REAGAN OBVIOUSLY WAS NT TOO CONCERNED WITH THE DOMESTIC SIDE OF OF OF HIS POLITICAL AFFAIRS .
I I THINK BUSH S KIND OF FOLLOWED SUIT .
UM INTERNATIONAL IS IMPORTANT BUT UH WE VE GOT A BUDGET DEFICIT .
THAT JUST WO NT GO AWAY UNLESS IT GETS SERIOUSLY ADDRESSED .
UH YOU KNOW AND THEN THERE S THE HOMELESS ISSUE AND THERE REALLY IS A LOT .
WE COULD BE DOING STATESIDE WITHOUT UH HURTING OUR INTERNATIONAL ASPECTS OR STRAINING ANY INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS I THINK AND WE WOULD NT HAVE TO SPEND THE BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS .
EACH YEAR THAT WE RE SPENDING .
OH I AGREE .
I JUST I THINK WE GOT ONCE WE STARTED ECONOMIC AID OVERSEAS WE HAVE REALLY SET OURSELVES UP TO BE SORT OF THE THE WORLD BANK AND .
RIGHT .
AS FAR AS AID IS CONCERNED AND I THINK THERE S A LIMIT AND WE PASSED IT .
A LONG TIME AGO .
I AGREE .
WE VE BEEN WRITING OFF WAY .
TOO MANY BAD DEBTS .
YEAH .
UH COUNTRY BAD DEBTS .
THAT S ANOTHER THING .
I DO NT UNDERSTAND IS IS IS THINGS LIKE SELLING TECHNOLOGY AND UH EVEN MILITARY HARDWARE TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND THEN FORGIVING THEIR DEBT .
EXACTLY .
TO ME THAT JUST DOES NT MAKE ANY SENSE AS AS MUCH IN DEBT AS WE ARE .
I KNOW IT .
I JUST I DO NT KNOW .
I THINK IT S DEFINITELY TIME FOR A CHANGE BUT I DO NT SEE ANYBODY I DO NT UNDERSTAND TOO WHY WE HAVE TO HAVE DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS AND IT S EITHER ONE WAY OR THE OTHER THIS .
RIGHT .
IT .
S SEEMS TO BE WE RE TURNING INTO A BLACK AND WHITE SOCIETY YOU EITHER DO IT .
THIS WAY OR YOU DO IT .
THAT WAY AND THERE S NO IN BETWEEN .
THAT S RIGHT YOU RE EITHER LIBERAL OR YOU RE CONSERVATIVE .
AND THAT UH IT OBVIOUSLY IS NT WORKING .
WELL I THINK UH IT WOULD NT HURT AND I KNOW THE INDEPENDENT PARTY S BEEN TRYING FOR YEARS TO GET A A A REAL FORCE IN IN THE UH IN CONGRESS BUT UH YOU RE RIGHT THERE S JUST TOO MANY ISSUES .
THAT COME UP THAT UH OUR SENATORS AND OUR CONGRESSMEN VOTE ON SIMPLY BECAUSE IT S A DEMOCRATIC ISSUE OR IT S A REPUBLICAN ISSUE .
OH YEAH .
AND IF THEY WOULD VOTE WITH THEIR CONSCIENCE AND WITH WHAT .
THEIR CONSTITUENTS FEEL I THINK UH WE MIGHT HAVE A A LOT BETTER A LOT .
MORE EFFICIENT RUNNING GOVERNMENT AND A LOT BETTER LAWS PASSED .
OH I AGREE WITH YOU .
WELL OF COURSE YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE NATIONAL EMBARRASSMENT IN OUR STATE JESSIE HELMS .
AND UH AS SOON AS AS WE CAN GET OF COURSE .
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT EVERY TIME .
HE OPENS HIS MOUTH HE HE JUST LINES UP PEOPLE AGAINST HIM SO .
IT S NOT TOO IT S NOT TOO OFTEN THAT YOU SEE HIM SWAYING TOO MANY OPINIONS .
HE .
S UH USUALLY ON THE NINETYEIGHT TO TWO SIDE HE S THE ONE OF THE TWO .
THAT VOTES .
HE .
S .
ONE OF THE TWO HUH .
YEAH HE S .
VERY INEFFECTIVE I THINK .
WELL LET S SEE SENATORS ARE IN FOR SIX YEARS RIGHT .
RIGHT .
AND UH WHEN DID YOU GUYS VOTE HIM INTO OFFICE .
OH UNFORTUNATELY NINETEEN NINETY .
OH YOU RE STUCK .
YEAH WE RE STUCK WITH HIM FOR .
A LITTLE WHILE LONGER BUT UH UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIM BUT MAYBE FORTUNATELY FOR US HIS HEALTH IS NOT GREAT SO I HATE .
OKAY WELL BASICALLY I AM A MOTHER OF A THREE YEAR OLD .
UHHUH .
SO I KIND OF RELATE TO TRYING TO FIND A GOOD DAY CARE BECAUSE IT S UH EXTREMELY HARD THING TO DO TO TRUST SOMEBODY ELSE WITH YOUR CHILD UH TRUST THEIR EMOTIONAL AND THEIR SAFETY AND .
RIGHT .
ALL THE REST OF THAT AND UH I VE BEEN PRETTY SELECTIVE AND WHAT I M FINDING IS WITH UM DAY CARES THAT ARE LIKE DAY CARE CENTERS LIKE FOR INSTANCE UH LEARNING TREE OR KINDER CARE AND ALL OF THAT .
UHHUH .
WHAT I FIND IS THAT THEY RE HIGHLY STRUCTURED HIGHLY ORGANIZED ALMOST TOO RIGID FOR THE CHILDREN IF YOU BRING A CHILD IN AT A CERTAIN TIME .
UHHUH .
UH LIKE NAP TIME OR WHATEVER TIME UH BECAUSE OF PARENTS HOURS THEY ARE DIFFER AND WHEN I BRING MY DAUGHTER INTO SUCH A SYSTEM LIKE THAT UH THEY ONLY HAVE ONE THING GOING ON AND THAT S NAP TIME EVERYBODY IS NAPPING .
UHHUH .
WHETHER THEY CAME THERE AN HOUR BEFORE OR THEY CAME A RIGHT DURING THAT TIME AND WITH THAT KIND OF A SYSTEM MY DAUGHTER JUST IS NT LIKELY TO ENJOY IT IF SHE HAS TO GOOD THERE IMMEDIATELY AND LAY DOWN .
UHHUH .
ON A COT SO UM HOME DAY CARE HAS BEEN AN OPTION AND I VE LOOKED INTO THAT THE ONLY THING IS YOU RAISE THE QUESTION OF IF IT S SAFE UH CAN YOU TRUST THE PEOPLE YOU KNOW .
THAT S RIGHT .
UM .
AND YOU NEVER KNOW I HAVE UM AN EXSISTERINLAW THAT .
UHHUH .
UM CURRENTLY HAS A CHILD ABUSE CASE ON A HOME BABYSITTER .
SURE OH SURE SURE THAT S REALLY SCARY AND .
UHHUH .
TO THE POINT THAT YOU KIND OF SAY TO YOURSELF ESPECIALLY HOME DAY CARE I MEAN I THINK CENTER DAY CARES THERE S SO MANY PEOPLE COMING IN AND OUT .
RIGHT .
THAT YOU RE BETTER OFF IF YOU RE GOING TO PUT A CHILD INTO THAT TYPE OF SYSTEM FOR EIGHT HOURS IT S FINE IT DEPENDS ON THE AGE OF THE CHILD NOW SOME CHILDREN DO REAL WELL THAT ARE AT THE AGE OF FOUR OR FIVE OR CHILDREN THAT HAVE BEEN IN THAT KIND OF SYSTEM FOR A WHILE BUT .
RIGHT .
HOME DA HOME DAY CARE WORKS WELL IF IT S AN INFANT IF IT S IF IT S .
UHHUH .
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE KIND OF LIKE A FAMILY STRUCTURING WHERE THERE S A HOME THAT THEY CAN BE PROVIDED BECAUSE I VE SEEN THINGS AT THE DAY CARE WHERE THEY CA NT KEEP UP WITH ALL THE KIDS THE KIDS HAVE .
RIGHT .
COLDS AND THEY RE SICK ALL THE TIME AND THE .
I M READY .
WHY DO NT YOU GO AHEAD AND START OFF .
OKAY WELL I DO NT HAVE AN ELDERLY PERSON THAT I COULD SEND TO A A NURSING HOME OR ANYTHING MY BOTH OF MY PARENTS ARE DEAD BUT I DID HAVE A FRIEND THAT WAS IN A CONVALESCENT HOME UH LIKE A NURSING HOME AND I H WENT THERE VERY OFTEN TO VISIT HER AND UH MADE ME FEEL REALLY SAD IF I DID HAVE A MOTHER LIVING I DO NT THINK I COULD DO THAT .
I THINK THEY WOULD BE BETTER OFF BEING AT HOME WITH THEIR FAMILY YOU KNOW .
I AGREE ALTHOUGH WE RE IN THAT SITUATION RIGHT NOW .
UHHUH .
WE HAVE A AN EIGHTY SEVEN YEAR OLD MOTHER IN LAW LIVING WITH ME RIGHT NOW .
UHHUH .
AND BECAUSE OF HER CIRCUMSTANCES SHE CAN NO LONGER LIVE INDEPENDENTLY AND EVEN MOVING FROM HER HOUSE TO OUR HOUSE .
UHHUH .
HAS BEEN TREMENDOUSLY UNSETTLING FOR HER AND WE HAVE SEVERAL YOUNG CHILDREN .
UHHUH .
AND THEY ABOUT DRIVE HER CRAZY .
OH I CAN BELIEVE THAT YES BECAUSE MOST ELDERLY PEOPLE CA NT TAKE HAVING A LOT OF NOISE AND KIDS RUNNING AROUND AND THINGS LIKE THAT IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT MAYBE IT WOULD BE BETTER .
WELL WE VE YOU KNOW WE VE STRUGGLED A LOT WITH IT BECAUSE AGAIN MOST OF THE NURSING HOMES I VE BEEN IN ARE VERY DEPRESSING TO ME .
UHHUH .
AND SHE S STILL ALERT ENOUGH THAT I THINK SHE WOULD REALLY KNOW THAT WE WERE PUTTING HER THERE .
OH YEAH .
AND I THINK SHE WOULD REALLY RESENT IT AND I THINK THAT WOULD MAKE IT VERY HARD .
UHHUH .
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I SEE MY WIFE WITH I GUESS OUR YOUNGEST ONE NOW IS FIVE .
OH .
AND HER TRYING TO STRUGGLE BECAUSE HER MOTHER REALLY CAN NOT TAKE CARE OF HERSELF SHE NEEDS TO BE .
UHHUH .
BATHED AND DRESSED AND A LOT OF THOSE KINDS OF .
OH .
THINGS .
SEE NOW THAT S THAT S THAT S REALLY A SAD SITUATION .
AND SO THE DRAIN ON THE FAMILY .
YEAH REALLY YOU KNOW .
AND WHEN THE KIDS HAVE KIDS COME YOU KNOW SHE S ALWAYS SAYING YOU KNOW WHY DO THEY HAVE TO BE HERE WHY CA NT THEY SEND THEM HOME IT S TOO NOISY AND .
UHHUH .
SHE LL SAY THAT TO THE KIDS FRIENDS .
YEAH RIGHT RIGHT .
SO IT S A HARD SITUATION EITHER WAY I THINK .
YEAH IN A CASE LIKE THAT YOU KNOW YOU MORE OR LESS THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER IF SHE WERE IN A NURSING HOME BECAUSE YOU HAVE YOUR FAMILY GROWING UP WHERE .
I THINK THAT S ONE OF THE THINGS WE RE REALLY WRESTLING WITH WHEN DOES IT BECOME DETRIMENTAL TO OUR FAMILY TO THE POINT THAT YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER THAT .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AS OPPOSED TO CONSIDERING HER CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES AND .
UHHUH BUT THE COST OF THESE NURSING HOMES ARE SO .
OH PROHIBITIVE .
YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE CA NT AFFORD THAT .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW SO YOU REALLY HAVE NO CHOICE THAT WAY IF YOU YOU KNOW IF YOU RE NOT RICH OR S YOU KNOW UH I KNOW THIS LADY THAT YOU KNOW THAT WAS A FRIEND OF MINE NOW HER HUSBAND WAS STILL ALIVE AT THE TIME WHEN SHE WAS IN THERE YOU KNOW AND IT WAS COSTING HIM A SMALL FORTUNE TO KEEP HER IN THERE .
YEAH .
SO .
I THINK WE NEED TO DEVELOP SOME ALTERNATIVES LIKE ADULT DAY CARE .
UHHUH .
THAT S MORE READILY AVAILABLE YOU KNOW I THINK IF WE COULD SEND HER SOMEPLACE FOR THE DAY .
YEAH THEN BRING HER BACK HOME AT NIGHT .
AND SHE COULD BE AROUND SOME ELDERLY PEOPLE AND HAVE SOME ACTIVITIES WOULD BE OF MORE INTEREST TO HER .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND THEN IN THE EVENING HAVE HER RETURN AND BE WITH THE FAMILY .
YEAH YOU KNOW JUST COME HOME FOR DINNER AND THEN USUALLY THEY WANT TO GO TO BED FAIRLY EARLY ANYHOW .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW SO THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE NICE IF WE COULD EVER GET SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT .
BUT THERE S NOT MANY OF THOSE AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW .
YEAH .
AND THEY RE VERY HARD TO GET THEM INTO AND .
UHHUH .
WE TRIED SENDING HER TO A SENIOR CITIZEN CENTER .
UHHUH .
BUT THEY RE REALLY NOT PREPARED TO COPE WITH HER BECAUSE SHE S SOMEWHAT SENILE .
UHHUH .
AND SO A LOT OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT THEY RE ENGAGED IN SHE CA NT PARTICIPATE IN .
UHHUH UHHUH UM .
BUT I THINK IT S AN ISSUE THAT YOU KNOW WITH THE GRAYING OF AMERICA WE RE REALLY GOING TO HAVE TO AS A AS A COUNTRY FIGURE OUT HOW WE RE GOING TO DEAL WITH THIS .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE IT IS A DIFFICULT SITUATION AND YOU KNOW YOU HATE SEEING THEM JUST SORT OF SEND OFF AND NOT WELL CARED FOR .
YEAH IF .
AND YET .
IF THEY DO NT KNOW ANYBODY AND THEY DO NT KNOW WHAT S GOING ON AROUND THEM AND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT WELL I CAN SEE MAYBE A NURSING HOME WOULD BE BETTER YOU KNOW .
BUT IF THEY THEY HAVE THEIR WITS ABOUT THEM AND EVERYTHING WHY IT S KIND OF HARD .
AND THEN I THINK IT DEPENDS ON THEIR PHYSICAL ABILITY TOO YOU KNOW IF THEY COULD BE UP AND DOING SOME THINGS .
UHHUH UHHUH .
IT MIGHT BE BETTER THAN WHEN THEY RE JUST SORT OF NEEDING ALMOST CONSTANT SUPERVISION AND CARE .
UHHUH UHHUH WELL UH MY MOTHER ALWAYS SAID SHE HOPES SHE NEVER HAD TO BE LIKE THAT AND UH LUCKILY I MEAN SHE LIVED BY HERSELF AND THEN YOU KNOW ONE DAY SHE HAD A HEART ATTACK AND SHE WAS GONE SO SHE NEVER DID HAVE TO GO INTO A NURSING HOME OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT THERE S SO MANY OF US KIDS THERE WAS LIKE SEVEN OF US THAT MY WE WOULD NT HAVE PROBABLY ALLOWED THAT TO HAPPEN ANYHOW .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW SHE COULD HAVE TAKEN TURNS LIVING WITH EACH ONE OF US YOU KNOW FOR A SH A SH A PERIOD OF TIME BECAUSE WE ALL DO NT LIVE IN THE SAME CITY ANYHOW O NOR THE SAME STATE SO .
DO YOU LIVE AT ALL CLOSE TO EACH OTHER .
UH I I HAVE A COUPLE MORE THAT LIVE OUT HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT THEN I HAVE A BROTH .
OKAY HOW S THE WEATHER BEEN IN PLANO .
BASICALLY ABOUT THE SAME AS WHAT YOU VE PROBABLY HAD .
YEAH THIS IS PROBABLY UNUSUAL TOPIC TO GIVE TWO OF US IN THE SAME CITY .
UHHUH .
WELL I DO NT KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I WAS REALLY ENJOYING THE COOL SNAP LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS AND I M READY FOR IT TO COME BACK .
OH YOU LIKE THE RAIN DO YOU .
WELL NOT THE RAIN SO MUCH AS THE COOL THE OTHER MORNINGS WHEN IT WAS LIKE SIXTYFIVE WHEN WE WOKE UP AND SIXTYSIX AND TODAY I KNOW WHEN I GOT UP THAT THE TEMPERATURE SAID MORE LIKE CLOSE SEVENTYNINE OR EIGHTY .
UHHUH .
SO I M KIND OF READY FOR THE PUMPKIN WEATHER .
OH ARE YOU I DO NT CARE FOR THAT AS MUCH .
YOU DO NT .
NO .
ARE YOU A SUMMER PERSON .
I M A SUMMER PERSON .
ARE YOU .
I LIKE THE HEAT .
WELL I HAVE A FRIEND WHO S THE SAME WAY AND ANYTHING BELOW SIXTY SHE S JUST NOT HAPPY .
BUT I I THINK WHAT I WOULD MISS IS THE CHANGE OF SEASONS AND ALL BECAUSE I KNOW IN PLANO WE REALLY DO NT HAVE AS MANY SEASONS AS UH MY HUSBAND S FROM NEBRASKA AND THEY HAVE MORE OF THE FOUR SEASONS .
YEAH AND I M FROM UTAH SO I I LIKE .
OH YOU RE .
THE FOUR SEASONS .
USED TO THAT TOO .
I JUST DO NT LIKE THE COLD .
YOU DO NT LIKE THE COLD WELL I USUALLY LIKE IT ABOUT SWEATER WEATHER AND THE PROBLEM .
UHHUH .
HERE IN PLANO IS IT DOES NT LAST VERY LONG IT GOES FROM HOT AND THEN YOU GET A COUPLE OF WEEKS OF THAT INDIAN SUMMER AND THEN IT S COLD .
YEAH .
AND I WISH IT WERE SEVERAL MONTHS OF THAT .
THE THING THE OTHER THING IS THE I DO NT LIKE THE RAIN EITHER .
WELL I DO NT EITHER UNLESS IT S LIKE UH SOME OF MY FAVORITE S LIKE A FRIDAY NIGHT WHEN IT RAINS AND YOU REALLY DID NT HAVE ANYWHERE TO GO AND IT S SLEEPING TIME BUT IF YOU HAVE TO GET UP AND GET OUT IN IT I DO NT LIKE IT EITHER .
WELL WE HAVE SEVERAL CHILDREN THAT ARE IN SPORTS AND SO .
OH YEAH .
IT ALWAYS MAKES THEIR GAMES BE POSTPONED FOREVER AND EVER AND EVER ON ON AND ON .
WELL SURE IT DOES THAT KIND OF SCHEDULE YOU REALLY NEED A LOT MORE SUNSHINE .
I LIKE IT BETTER I THINK .
AND ALSO THE EVENINGS ARE GOING TO BE GETTING UH DARKER SOONER .
UHHUH .
BECAU AS IT GETS COOLER .
YEAH .
BUT I DID A WALK LAST NIGHT AND IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS A LITTLE BIT HOT STILL SOMETIMES WHEN YOU WORK UP A SWEAT YOU NEED IT TO BE A LITTLE BIT COOLER .
THE THING ABOUT WHEN IT GETS HOT HERE IS I DO NT LIKE THE HUMIDITY THAT PART I DO NT CARE ABOUT .
WELL I AGREE ABSOLUTELY AND YOU KNOW IT S ALL RELATIVE BECAUSE I WAS FROM WEST TEXAS AND IT WAS VERY DRY AND SO I THOUGHT DALLAS WAS AWFUL AND I STILL THINK SO .
BUT THEN THIS SUMMER WE WENT TO ORLANDO FOR A WEEK AND IT WAS SO HUMID THERE THAT YOUR UM ALL YOUR WINDOWS WERE FR WERE WET EVERY MORNING THEY HAD TO GET THE .
OH REALLY .
SQUEEJIES AND CLEAN THEM OFF AND WHEN WE GOT BACK TO DALLAS IT SEEMED REALLY DRY .
BECAUSE IT S KIND OF LIKE WHAT YOU RE USED TO BUT I AGREE WITH YOU THE HUMIDITY ESPECIALLY FOR CURLY HEADS LIKE ME .
OH IS THAT RIGHT .
YES I DO NOT LIKE THE HUMID .
WELL ANOTHER REASON WELL I GUESS I CA NT SAY THAT IT I DO NT LIKE THE RAIN COMPLETELY WE HAVE A LITTLE GARDEN THAT WE HAVE AND .
UHHUH .
AND SO IT REALLY HELPS OUR GARDEN AND YOU KNOW EVEN I DO NT KNOW IF THAT S BECAUSE PLANTS ARE JUST THAT WAY AND THEY LIKE RAIN OR IT SEEMS THEY THRIVE WHEN IT RAINS THEY JUST REALLY .
YEAH I THINK SO TOO I KNOW OUR GRASS NEEDS MOWING TWICE AS OFTEN .
UHHUH .
WHEN IT RAINS .
YEAH .
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE HERE I WOULD LIKE IT TO RAIN AND THEN BE OVER AND THEN NOT RAIN FOR A WHILE IT SEEMS LIKE WHEN IT GETS STUCK IN A RAIN PATTERN THAT S ALL IT DOES .
YEAH YEAH .
SO UH BUT I I AM READY FOR A LITTLE BIT OF THE COOLER WEATHER AND NOT SO MUCH IN THE NINETIES .
WELL .
BUT SOMETHING LIKE I GUESS MY MY BEST WOULD BE PROBABLY SIXTYEIGHT WHEN YOU WAKE UP OR SIXTYSIX AND THEN PROBABLY SEVENTYFIVE DURING THE DAY .
WELL I LIKE SEVENTIES .
YEAH .
I LIKE SEVENTIES OKAY .
YEAH ARE YOU DO YOU LIKE THE HEAT IN THE SUMMER THEN WHEN IT GETS UP IN THE NINETIES AND HUNDREDS .

AND I M OKAY BUT WHEN IT GETS TOO HOT THEN IT S THAT I DO NT LIKE THAT .
YEAH .
I STAY IN THE HOUSE BECAUSE IT S JUST .
WELL I DO TOO I DO TOO .
IT S JUST TOO HOT .
AND THAT WAS ONE THING ABOUT THE YEAR AROUND SCHOOL THAT ORIGINALLY WE HAD BEEN SORT OF NEGATIVE ON IT BUT THEN WE STARTED THINKING ESPECIALLY IN PLANO THE WEATHER IS SO HOT IN AUGUST THAT THERE REALLY IS NT A LOT THE CHILDREN CAN DO OUTSIDE ANYHOW .
YEAH YEAH .
STATIC HERE .
THAT S OKAY UM I VE I VE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT TOO AND UM WHEN WE TAKE OUR VACATIONS WE WE DO TAKE THEM IN AUGUST SOMETIMES .
YEAH .
SO THAT WE CAN BE AWAY FROM HERE .
WE DO TOO I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE AGREE THE SAME .
IT JUST REALLY GETS WAY WHEN IT GETS WAY TOO HOT .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND WE VE BEEN HERE FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND WE VE BEEN HERE YEARS WHEN IT S BEEN HUNDREDS AND .
UHHUH NOW THERE HAVE BEEN WORSE SUMMERS IN FACT THIS MORNING WHEN THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT UH HAROLD TAFT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MILDER .
YEARS UHHUH .
OF THE SUMMERS AND MILDER FALL EVERYBODY SEEMS TO BE YOU CAN TELL SOME OF THE NEWSCASTERS WHEN THEY LIKE THE HEAT BECAUSE THEY LL TALK ABOUT IT BEING SO GORGEOUS ON THOSE DAYS WHEN WE RE MELTING .
AND YOU CAN TELL WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT BEAUTIFUL WEATHER SOME MORNINGS WHEN WE RE IT LL BE TOO COLD AND THEY LL SAY WELL THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT LIKE THE COLD WEATHER .
YEAH YEAH HE HE ALWAYS DID SUCH A GOOD JOB I THOUGHT .
OH YEAH HE DID HE DID IT WAS .
A GOOD WEATHER MAN .
IT WAS REALLY A SHAME HE DID NT GO WITH ALL THE GIMMICKS THAT SOME OF THEM DID .
YEAH ANYWAY UM I GUESS IT S .
IT S KIND OF HARD TO KEEP ON ABOUT THE WEATHER FOR FIVE MINUTES .
THAT S OKAY THEY SAY WHEN YOU RE DONE YOU RE DONE SO .
OH IS THAT RIGHT .
YEAH .
OKAY .
YOU DO NT HAVE TO WAIT FOR THEM TO SAY .
OH GOOD .
CUT OFF YOUR TIME YOU JUST SAY HAVE A GOOD DAY OR WHATEVER .
WELL GOOD WELL THEN HAVE A GOOD DAY .
YOU TOO .
AND I HOPE YOU ENJOY THE WEATHER THIS WEEK .
YOU TOO .
WELL THIS IS A SUBJECT THAT YOU NEVER THINK YOU LL BE ASSIGNED TO .
NO .
ONE THAT KIND OF COMES UP WHEN YOU VE LOST IT THE OTHERS OTHER SUBJECTS .
UM AS I WAS SITTING THERE I THOUGHT THE WEATHER S BEEN PERFECT .
I DO NT KNOW MUCH TO SAY ABOUT IT .
IT .
S UH IT S YOU KNOW FOR THE BALLOON FESTIVAL HERE IN PLANO .
IT WAS JUST GORGEOUS .
I M FROM PLANO ALSO .
ARE YOU .
IT COULD NT HAVE BEEN BETTER .
THAT S RIGHT .
I MEAN IT DID NT FOUL ONE LAUNCH AND THAT S KIND OF UNUSUAL AND IT S KIND OF COLD IN THE MORNINGS SO YOU DRESS UP WARM BUT BY .
RIGHT .
THAT S THE ONLY THING WRONG I CAN FIND WITH IT .
I JUST GOT BACK FROM DAYTON .
I SPENT THE WEEKEND IN OHIO WITH MY FAMILY .
OH HOW FUN .
AND THE TREES ARE CHANGING COLOR THERE .
I MISS THAT YEAH .
SO THAT AS SOON AS WE GOT OUT OF THE CLOUD COVER .
OF COURSE .
IT .
WAS NT SUNNY LIKE IT IS HERE .
IT WAS REAL GRAY .
YEAH .
BUT AS SOON AS THE PLANE GOT THROUGH THE CLOUDS AND I SAW ALL THOSE TREES IT JUST REALLY MADE ME REALIZE HOW MUCH I MISS THE FALL .
YEAH .
I DO NT COMPLAIN WEATHER WISE THOUGH BECAUSE IT WAS ALSO THIRTYFIVE DEGREES .
THERE YESTERDAY MORNING .
AND THE HIGH WAS ONLY FIFTY AND IT WAS SUPPOSED TO DROP AND GET SLEET IN THE AFTERNOON .
OOH .
SO IT WAS NICE TO GET OFF THE PLANE WHERE IT WAS IN THE SEVENTIES .
I GUESS YOU HAVE TO TAKE SOME THINGS AND LEAVE SOME THINGS .
THAT S RIGHT .
YEAH I M FROM UTAH AREA AND THEY YOU KNOW THEY HAVE TONS OF CANYONS WHERE THE LEAVES CHANGE AND THEY RE GORGEOUS .
YEAH .
YOU COULD SPEND EVERY WEEKEND OF THE FALL GOING TO A DIFFERENT AREA .
WE DID THAT WHEN WE LIVED UP IN MICHIGAN .
WE WENT UP TO THE UPPER PENINSULA AND THEY ACTUALLY PRINTED OUT MAPS OF ROUTES YOU COULD TAKE SO YOU WOULD GET MAXIMUM LEAF EXPOSURE .
AND THEN ON LEAF WEEKENDS .
IT WAS WHICH IS THIS TIME OF THE YEAR IT S BUMPER TO BUMPER TRAFFIC PEOPLE AS WHOEVER WAS DRIVING COULD NEVER HAVE A PRAYER OF LOOKING AT THE LEAVES BECAUSE THEY HAD TO KEEP WATCHING THE ROAD .
YEAH IT S KIND OF HAZARDOUS FOR DRIVING .
YES .
THAT S FOR SURE .
BUT I CA NT COMPLAIN .
I DO NT KNOW IF I VE BEEN SPOILED .
I VE BEEN THINKING IT S GETTING COLD SOONER THAN NORMAL .
WE VE ONLY LIVED HERE A COUPLE OF YEARS .
I THINK IT IS AND MY FAMILY SAID THAT IN OHIO THERE WAS JUST AN ARTICLE ON AT THE T V NEWS THAT THEY ARE THREE WEEKS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE .
HUH .
AS FAR AS THE COLDNESS OF THE TEMPERATURES AND UH THE FIRST FROST EVERYTHING JUST HAPPENED THREE WEEKS EARLY THIS YEAR .
WE LL HAVE TO SEE HOW IT GOES A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WE WERE COOLER THAN NORMAL BUT THEN WE RE BACK TO BEING WARMER THAN NORMAL .
THIS WEEK OR LAST WEEK SO .
JUST SO WE DO NT HAVE ONE OF THOSE FAMOUS ICE STORMS .
IN THE SPRING .
I DO NT HAVE TO LIVE THROUGH MANY ANY OF THOSE REALLY A BAD I MEAN NOTHING COMPARABLE I GUESS TO WHAT .
YOU VE HAD BEFORE .
WELL I VE ONLY BEEN HERE JUST A SHORT TIME TOO SO I HAVE NT BEEN THROUGH .
ANY OF THOSE .
EITHER SO .
I HAVE IN MICHIGAN BUT IN MICHIGAN YOU CAN GET TWELVE INCHES OF SNOW AND LIFE GOES ON .
YOU RE RIGHT .
SO AS I UNDERSTAND IT HERE IF THERE S ANYTHING THEY LL CALL OFF SCHOOLS AND AND CLOSE BUSINESSES .
WELL THEY GET ICE AND NO ONE CAN DRIVE ON ICE .
RIGHT .
I MEAN WE USED TO THINK THEY WERE PANSIES BUT THEN WHEN YOU DECIDED WHAT ICE WAS .
RIGHT THE REAL DEFINITION OF ICE .
SO WELL I THINK WE VE DISCUSSED IT GOOD ENOUGH TODAY .
I THINK SO .
IT WAS .
IT WAS NICE TALKING WITH YOU .
IT WAS GOOD TALKING TO YOU .
MAYBE WE LL GET THE NEXT TIME .
OKAY .
TAKE CARE .
OKAY .
BYEBYE .
BYE .
OKAY DO YOU UH THINK WE SHOULD GO METRIC .
WELL I I OH I DO NT KNOW IT S KIND OF A TRICKY QUESTION BECAUSE I THINK IT S IT S A PRACTICAL SYSTEM .
YEAH .
OBVIOUSLY IF IT S ALL COMPATIBLE AND IT YOU KNOW TENS AND THINGS MAKE SENSE UM IT S IT S A SWITCH THE PROBLEM WOULD JUST BE THE SWITCH OVER .
YEAH I THINK THAT THE I THINK WHAT I MEAN I DO NT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME I REMEMBER THEY TRIED IT IN THE SEVENTIES AT ONE POINT OR SOMETHING AND .
RIGHT THAT S WHEN I WAS IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL YEARS AND WE ALL .
YEAH ME TOO .
WE ALL LEARNED THAT METRIC AND THEY WERE READY WE WERE GOING TO BE METRIC AND .
RIGHT AND AND I DO NT QUITE KNOW WHY IT FAILED UM I WOULD BET THE PUSH I IT I BET THE PUSH JUST WAS NT BIG ENOUGH .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW THEY DID NT SORT OF ENCOURAGE I MEAN BUSINESSES AND THINGS TO USE IT SO YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT I THINK THEY D HAVE TO DO WOULD BE TO HAVE BOTH THINGS ON THERE FOR A WHILE AND THEN AND THEN START PHASING THINGS OUT SO .
SO I THINK THAT S WHAT THEY DID AT FIRST .
YEAH .
WAS THAT THEY HAD METRIC AND AND I MEAN AND THERE S THINGS THAT WE VE GONE METRIC WE HAVE METRIC COLA NOW .
RIGHT I WAS JUST THINKING .
YOU CAN BUY THAT AND YOU CAN .
TWO LITER BOTTLES ARE WHAT YOU BUY AND ONE LITER BOTTLES YOU DO NT BUY QUARTS AND GALLONS ANYMORE OF SODA .
SO THAT YOU KNOW SO THAT WE HAVE LITTLE THINGS THAT ARE METRIC BUT NO ONE TALKS ABOUT YOU KNOW UH YOU BUY NINE BY TWELVE FRAMES YOU DO NT BUY CENTIMETER LENGTH FRAMES .
RIGHT .
AND COOKING PANS .
AND AND AND EVEN THOUGH THE CAR SAYS MILES AND KILOMETERS YOU DO NT SAY I WENT .
UHHUH .
A HUNDRED KILOMETERS .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW .
FIFTYNINE KILOMETERS PER GALLON .
YEAH I WOULD I WOULD BE TOTAL LOSS .
YEAH THAT S .
I THINK I THINK THOUGH IF THERE WERE SOME YOU KNOW SORT OF GOVERNMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAM OR SOMETHING .
RIGHT .
PEOPLE WOULD BEGIN TO SWITCH OVER YOU KNOW AND I THINK THERE WOULD BE THE HARD CORE OLDER PEOPLE WHO WOULD GET REALLY PISSED AND PARDON MY EXPRESSION THERE BUT UH .
UHHUH .
WHO WOULD GET REALLY YOU KNOW UPSET AND START TO COMPLAIN AND GET ALL CRANKY AND STUFF BUT I THINK IN THE END IT WOULD MAKE LIFE A LOT EASIER FOR .
YEAH IT REALLY WOULD .
PEOPLE COMING UP .
IT S I I IT S BECAUSE I THINK THEY HAD A GOOD TRY THERE WHEN THEY STARTED WITH US IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS TRYING TO YOU KNOW GET THAT IN OUR MINDS SO THAT WE COULD CH I MEAN BECAUSE I THINK OUR GENERATION COULD MAKE A CHANGE .
YEAH .
IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT BUT IT WOULD NOT BE AS DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE SAY FIFTY YEARS OLD NOW WHO ARE HAVE NEVER BEEN EXPOSED TO THE METRIC SYSTEM OTHER THAN YOU KNOW BUYING A TWO LITER COKE .
RIGHT .
THAT S .
WELL WHAT I THINK I THINK THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NOW AND THEN MIGHT BE THIS IS JUST A MIGHT IS WE WERE THE FIRST GENERATION THAT WAS MUMBLEX IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL .
RIGHT .
AND IF THEY KEPT IT UP SO LET S SAY IMAGINE THEY HAD KEPT GOING YOU D HAVE YOU KNOW TWO OR THREE MORE GENERATIONS THAT ALL NOW ARE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE METRIC SYSTEM .
RIGHT .
NOT LIKE COULD USE IT COMFORTABLY RIGHT NOW BUT I COULD CONVERT YOU KNOW I COULD CARRY AROUND A LITTLE CONVERSION CARD OR SOMETHING AND .
RIGHT .
I COULD HANDLE IT FOR A WHILE AND THEN AND THEN EVENTUALLY I D LEARN AND I THINK THAT BEFORE IT WAS JUST YOU KNOW JUST A BUNCH OF LITTLE KIDS USING IT .
RIGHT .
AND NOW I THINK THERE ARE ENOUGH PEOPLE YOU KNOW SORT OF AS WE GET OLDER I THINK OTHERS THAT WILL BRING MORE GENERATIONS IN ON IT EVENTUALLY THEY LL BE ABLE TO MAKE THE SWITCH AND WE RE NOT GOING TO START GOING CRAZY AND YELLING AND SAYING .
WHAT ARE YOU CRAZY WE CA NT UNDERSTAND YOU WE LL SAY OH IT S A PAIN IN THE NECK BUT IT S FOR THE BETTER AND WE LL SORT OF DEAL WITH IT I THINK .
THAT S TRUE THAT MAKES SENSE .
I DO NT KNOW I I I WOULD HOPE IT WOULD UH IT SEEMS LIKE IT S A REASONABLE SYSTEM I MEAN EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE BASED ON THE SAME THING .
WELL I WAS TRYING TO THINK OF WHAT KIND OF THINGS YOU D HAVE TO CHANGE AND YOU D HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR HEIGHT ON YOUR DRIVER S LICENSE .
RIGHT .
WHEN YOU WOULD NT BE FIVE FOOT EIGHT ANYMORE UH YOU D BE A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY CENTIMETERS .
CENTIMETERS .
AND THEN YOU D BE LIGHTER IN KILOGRAMS THAN YOU WERE IN .
YEAH .
IN POUNDS .
BUT I WONDER IF IF .
SO ALL THE DIETERS WOULD BE HAPPY .
BUT YEAH RIGHT .
I ONLY WEIGH SIXTEEN TODAY THAT S .
YEAH BUT I WONDER IF THAT S EVEN SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW THEY THEY HAVE TO CHANGE IMMEDIATELY THEY COULD JUST YOU KNOW SORT OF PHASE THAT IN SO START YOU KNOW FROM NOW LIKE FROM NOW ON ALL LICENSES WOULD HAVE THAT .
RIGHT .
RATHER THAN GOING BACK AND CHANGING EVERYTHING YOU KNOW ALL NEW LICENSES AS OF NINETEEN NINETYTWO WOULD HAVE IT OR SOMETHING .
AND THEY D HAVE TO CHANGE THAT LITTLE RULER THAT S ON THE DOOR OF THE SEVEN ELEVEN THAT .
TELLS YOU HOW TALL THE ROBBERS ARE WHEN THEY .
THAT S RIGHT .
TO HOLD IT UP .
I KNOW THE AND OH YEAH I KNOW THOUGH AT THE UH AT THE AMUSEMENT PARKS THEY SAY IF YOU RE UNDER FORTYTWO .
INCHES OR SOMETHING .
RIGHT .
YOU CA NT WALK IN HERE .
YOU HAVE TO BE UNDER WELL I GUESS WHAT WHAT I BET WHAT THEY DO IN THAT CASE THEY UH SEE WHAT SOME OF THEM IS LIKE YOU KNOW THEY SAY IF YOU RE NOT TALLER THAN THIS LINE .
RIGHT MUMBLEX THIS LINE WHICH IS SEVENTYTHREE CENTIMETERS .
THAT S RIGHT .
JUST SO YOU LL KNOW BUT THAT WOULD BE GOOD THAT I DO NT KNOW .
IT WOULD BE A NEAT CASE WHERE LIKE WHERE KIDS TAUGHT THE PARENTS I THINK YOU KNOW .
RIGHT BECAUSE IS NT IT PRETTY MUCH EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD I KNOW ENGLAND IS NOT METRIC .
BUT I DO NT KNOW .
I .
ENG ENG ENGLAND IS NOT .
I DO NT THINK THEY ARE BECAUSE OUR UM OUR MEASUREMENTS STARTED IN ENGLAND .
OH .
ALL THAT BEGAN BACK THERE AND I THINK THEY RE THE ONLY PART OF THE CONTINENT THAT HAS NT CHANGED OVER TO METRIC .
YEAH BUT I MEAN BUT BUT VIRTUALLY THE REST OF THE WORLD IS I MEAN IT SEEMS LIKE .
RIGHT .
LIKE LIKE LIKE SORT OF STUPID I MEAN WE ARE OF COURSE WE ARE AMERICANS AND WE RE SUPPOSED TO BE YOU KNOW .
WE RE THE TREND SETTERS IN THE WORLD I DO NT KNOW WHY WE .
THAT S RIGHT AND AND NOW WE RE BACKWARDS .
WE HAVE NT CHANGED TO THE SENSIBLE SYSTEM .
I DO NT KNOW .
NO I I I WOULD THINK I MEAN A A A BASE TEN SYSTEM AS COMPARED TO A BASE TWELVE SYSTEM .
RIGHT .
MAKES A LOT MORE SENSE .
WELL AND IT S NOT EVEN BASE TWELVE FOR EVERYTHING IS IT IT .
NO ACTUALLY NO UM LET S SEE IT S .
WELL POUNDS I DO NT EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT .
I DO NT KNOW OH YEAH I I ALWAYS FORGET I DO NT EVEN KNOW HOW MANY OUNCES ARE IN A POUND I JUST SORT OF MAKE IT UP .
SEE AND I DO NT UNDERSTAND LIQUID OUNCES AND FLUID OUNCES IT S I MEAN I DO NT KNOW THAT I HAVE THAT MUCH CONCRETE KNOWLEDGE IN THE CURRENT MEASURING SYSTEM THAT WOULD .
RIGHT .
PREVENT ME FROM .
THOSE THOSE MUMBLEX WOULD NT BE A PROBLEM .
IT S NOT LIKE IT S REALLY ENTRENCHED OTHER YOU KNOW A LOT OF STUFF .
LET S SEE HOW MANY CUPS EQUAL THAT .
I I HAVE NO IDEA I JUST UH I KNOW THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW A PINT IS A POUND THE WORLD AROUND OR SOMETHING .
RIGHT I DO NT .
THAT S ALL I KNOW .
I DID NT EVEN KNOW THAT .
I I LEARNED THAT BECAUSE UH A FRIEND OF MINE I I HAD TWO FRIENDS AND I HAD MORE FRIENDS THAN THAT BUT TWO FRIENDS OF MINE IN COLLEGE .
I HAD A LOT MORE THAN TWO I PROMISE .
WELL THAT S GOOD .
UM WE OPENED A JELLY BEAN BUSINESS .
OH .
AND WE SOLD JELLY BEANS AND WE HAD UH NO IDEA HOW MANY YOU KNOW WE WE DID NT BO WE DID NT BOTHER BUYING A SCALE .
RIGHT .
WE D GO OUT AND JUST BUY YOU KNOW FIVE POUND BAGS OF SIXTEEN DIFFERENT FLAVORS PUT IT IN PLASTIC SHOE BOXES AND AND AND THEN SELL THEM FOR X AMOUNT PER POUND OR QUARTER POUND OR SOMETHING .
RIGHT .
AND WE WE DID NT BOTHER BUYING A SCALE AND ONE OF MY FRIENDS WAS A PHYSICS ONE OF THESE GUYS WAS A PHYSICS MAJOR AND HE SAID WELL JUST REMEMBER A PINT IS A POUND THE WORLD AROUND AND HE GOT THE MEASURING CUP AND JUST MEASURED I THINK A CUP OR TWO CUP WHATEVER IS A PINT .
DID YOU EVER CHECK IT TO SEE IF IT REALLY WAS .
GEE I THINK WH .
A PINT .
I THINK HE MUMBLEX THE CALCULATION AT HOME AND IT TURNS OUT THAT HE WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY CLOSE .
UM .
IF ANYTHING WE WERE ACTUALLY IN FAVOR OF THE CONSUMER .
RIGHT .
SO SO WE WERE GIVING THEM A LITTLE TOO MUCH BUT THAT WAS OUR GENERAL TENDENCY ANYWAY .
WELL THAT S YOU ALL ARE MUMBLEX NICE BUSINESS .
YEAH WELL WE WERE YOU KNOW WE WERE IN IT WAS IT WAS ALMOST LIKE WE DID IT FOR THE HELL OF IT IN SCHOOL WE REALLY DID NT .
RIGHT .
MAKE YOU KNOW I THINK WE WERE ONLY MAKING SEVENTYFIVE DOLLARS EACH PROFIT AT THE END OF THE YEAR .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW AFTER AFTER AN ENTIRE SEMESTER BUT WE HAD A HELL OF A LOT OF FUN DOING IT .
PROBABLY ATE ALL YOUR MERCHANDISE TOO .
YEAH WE WE WE TENDED TO EAT A LOT AND OUR FRIENDS WOULD JUST SORT OF WALK BY AND JUST PUT THEIR HANDS IN IT AND WE HAD ANOTHER FRIEND UM THE PHYSICS MAJOR AGAIN HE WAS NT .
UHHUH .
HE WAS NT AWARE OF JELLY BEAN PHYSIOLOGY I GUESS AND HE GOT INTO A SNOWBALL FIGHT .
WITH THE JELLY BEANS NEARBY AND HE JUST AND AND SOME SNOW FELL INTO ONE OF THE CARTONS .
OH .
SO HE BROUGHT THEM INTO THE BATHROOM TO WASH THEM OFF .
AND BASICALLY WHAT WE HAD SORT OF NON COATED BEANS AT THAT POINT .
YEAH IT S A LITTLE PROBLEM WHAT S INSIDE THE JELLY BEAN .
UH IT S JUST UH IT S JUST THE THE SAME THEY RE LIKE AN OUTER COATING AND THERE S JUST SORT OF TH THIS STUFF YOU SEE YOU KNOW IT S SORT OF LIKE GLORIFIED SUGAR I DO NT KNOW .
UH OH .
BUT WHEN YOU RINSE THEM OFF ALL YOU GET IS UH IS UH THE COATING .
OKAY .
I THINK .
THE FIRST THING .
THEY SAID I HAVE WRITTEN THIS DOWN SO IT WOULD IS IT .
P DO YOU THINK IT S POSSIBLE TO HAVE HONESTY IN GOVERNMENT OR AN HONEST GOVERNMENT .
OKAY .
YOU RE ASKING WHAT .
MY OPINION ABOUT .
YEAH .
WHETHER IT S POSSIBLE TO HAVE HONESTY IN GOVERNMENT .
WELL I SUSPECT THAT IT IS POSSIBLE .
UH I THINK IT PROBABLY IS MORE LIKELY IF YOU HAVE A SMALL GOVERNMENT UNIT WHERE EVERYBODY KNOWS EVERYBODY .
RIGHT .
THAT S A GOOD POINT .
BUT UH OTHER THAN THAT I THINK MAYBE IT JUST DEPENDS ON HOW YOU DEFINE HONESTY .
THAT S AN INT YOU KNOW THAT S INTERESTING .
I HAD READ SOMETHING .
ONE TIME AND IT WAS JUST APPLYING TO GOVERNMENTS IN GENERAL IT WAS WRITTEN MANY YEARS AGO .
IT SAID THAT IT S IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE A COMPLETELY HONEST SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT BECAUSE PEOPLE .
WHO CHOOSE GOVERNMENT FOR THEIR POSITIONS ARE POWER SEEKERS .
AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS INTERESTING .
IT .
WAS NT JUST TALKING ABOUT OUR GOVERNMENT .
IT WAS JUST GOVERNMENT IN GENERAL .
FROM TIMES PAST YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
ON AND .
SO THEY RE SAYING THAT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WOULD TEND TO BE POWER SEEKERS .
RIGHT .
AND THAT WOULD BE A NEXT QUESTION TO ASK .
HOW MANY DO YOU THINK ARE IN THERE FOR PUB FOR BU BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE A SERVICE TO US OR ARE THEY IN THERE FOR THEIR OWN GAINS AND PERSONALLY I FEEL IT S PROBABLY THERE S PROBABLY SOME OF EACH .
RIGHT .
YEAH .
BUT I THINK MAYBE A LOT OF THEM UM SAY THE MORE HONEST ONES .
WHO ARE STILL LOOKING OUT FOR THEMSELVES IT MAY BE MORE MATTER OF NOT WHAT CAN I STEAL WHILE IN AN OFFICE BUT HOW MANY FRIENDS CAN I MAKE WHILE .
UHHUH .
I M IN OFFICE .
YEAH .
AND YOU KNOW HOW GOOD A NAME CAN I MAKE FOR MYSELF AND SO FORTH .
SO I GUESS IT WOULD BE LIKE ANYTHING ELSE .
YEAH .
THE PRESIDENT OF GENERAL MOTORS PROBABLY HAS THE SAME .
OH YEAH .
AND THEY TALKED UH THE OTHER LET S SEE .
THIRD QUESTION WAS HOW M MUMBLEX SERVING FOR THEIR OWN GAINS DO YOU THINK GOES ON THEN THEY THAT S HARD TO ANSW I M SURE THERE S A LOT .
BUT I AGREE WITH YOU THERE S A LOT IN BUSINESS .
I THINK THAT S JUST I THINK THAT S VERY NORMAL .
I THINK I .
THAT WE SHOULD NOT EX I THINK I THINK WE PUT TOO MUCH ON POLITICIANS .
WE EXPECT THEM TO ONLY BE THERE TO SERVE US YOU KNOW .
I THINK A LITTLE MORE HONESTY IN THE CAMPAIGNS WOULD BE .
YEAH .
MORE TO THE POINT .
IF YOU KNEW WHAT .
YOU WERE GETTING WHEN YOU VOTED UH .
THAT S A PROBLEM IS NT IT .
YEAH .
IT S INTERESTING BECAUSE I M TAKING A TEXAS GOVERNMENT CLASS RIGHT NOW AND ONE OF THE THINGS MUMBLEX .
IT S SO EASY TO BLAME THEM TO MUMBLEX .
A LOT OF TIMES I THINK IT S OUR OWN FAULT .
THEY LIE TO US BECAUSE WE DO NT WANT TO HEAR THE TRUTH .
YEAH THEY SAY YOU .
AND IT .
GET THE GOVERNMENT .
YOU DESERVE .
IF THEY TELL US .
THE TRUTH WE DO NT ELECT THEM AND .
UHHUH .
ESPECIALLY WITH ALL THIS FRON CO STUFF COMING UP HERE LATELY ABOUT PEOPLE S PAST AND I DO NT KNOW WHY ANYBODY WOULD WANT TO GET UNDER THAT SCRUTINY ANYMORE .
IT S HARD TO IMAGINE .
BECAUSE IT S .
I THINK IT S GOTTEN JUST CARE WELL WE RE NOT TALKING ABOUT ISSUES WE RE TALKING ABOUT SOMEBODY .
S PERSONAL LIFE AND AND WE RE GETTING AWAY FROM WHAT .
WE OUGHT TO BE LOOKING AT .
YEAH AND IT ALMOST SEEMS LIKE IN ORDER TO AVOID UH SOME OF THE SCANDAL YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE THE KIND OF WIFE THAT YOU WOULD ONLY FIND ON SAY IN THE BOBSY TWINS OR .
RIGHT .
SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
YOU KNOW I ALSO THINK IT WOULD BE FUNNY IF WE COULD KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT THE PEOPLE .
THAT WERE IN THERE AND THROW THEM OUT .
I DO NT THINK THERE WOULD BE TOO MANY LEFT .
SO YOU RE TAKING A GOVERNMENT COURSE .
UHHUH .
AT WHAT .
THE UNIVERSITY .
UH AT UH IT .
S T C J C .
TEX TARRANT COUNTY JUNIOR COLLEGE .
OH .
YEAH .
OKAY .
AND IT S REALLY IT S REALLY ENJOYABLE .
I LIKE IT .
AND THEN THEY ALSO YOU KNOW ASK CAN WE ELIMINATE DO YOU THINK WE COULD MAKE LAWS TO ELIMINATE ALL CORRUPTION AND I DO NT THINK WE CAN MAKE LAWS TO ELIMINATE ANYTHING ANYPLACE TOTALLY .
YOU CAN MAKE LAWS AGAINST CORRUPTION .
YEAH BUT THAT .
BUT THAT DOES NT ELIMINATE IT DOES IT .
DOES NT MEAN I DO NT THINK MAKING LAWS WILL STOP IT .
I MEAN I DO NT KNOW HOW MANY LAWS YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE .
I MEAN .
WELL THEY VE GOT LAWS AGAINST CANNIB CANNIBALISM BUT THAT DID NT STOP THAT GUY IN .
NO SURE DID NT .
MILWAUKEE DID IT .
DID IT .
SO NO I THINK YOU CAN LEGISLATE BUT I THINK THERE S NO WAY THAT YOU ELIMINATE IT .
ALL BY LEGISLATING AND WE WOULD END UP WITH SO MANY MORE LAWS THAT YOU KNOW I MEAN I JUST THINK THAT S HUMAN NATURE THAT YOU RE GOING TO HAVE CORRUPTION IN GOVERNMENT IN BUSINESS PERSONAL LIFE I MEAN YOU KNOW .
ACTUALLY I THINK OTHER COUNTRIES MAY HAVE IT WORSE UH THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT IS ALWAYS HAVING A SOME KIND OF A SCANDAL .
RIGHT .
USUALLY INVOLVING THE PRIME MINISTER OR PEOPLE VERY CLOSE TO HIM .
YEAH .
SO UH .
YEAH I STILL BELIEVE I GET VERY FED UP WITH GOVERNMENT SOMETIMES BUT WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHERE I D WANT TO GO YOU KNOW THIS IS STILL THE BEST OR I CAN .
YEAH I VE BEEN AROUND TO A FEW OTHER COUNTRIES AND I UH I I HAVE NOT FOUND ONE YET THAT I WOULD RATHER LIVE IN .
I THINK UH .
YEAH .

WELL ACTUALLY I WENT UH CANOEING DOWN THE BRAZOS .
THIS WEEKEND .
OH MY GOSH NOW THAT HAD TO BE THAT S BOATING .
THAT HAD TO HAVE BEEN FUN .
IT WAS FUN IT WAS FUN .
WELL UH AND THAT S AN IDEA .
THAT S BEEN AROUND FOR KICKED AROUND FOR A LONG TIME .
I DO NT KNOW THAT IT S EVER BEEN SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED UH AS FAR AS CLOSE TO PASSING UH ANY LEGISLATION OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT .
BUT UH I BELIEVE ISRAEL DOES THAT DO NT THEY FOR THEIR .
UH YES I THINK SO .
UH .
WEL EVERYBODY HAS TO DO HAS TO DO SOMETHING .
YEAH I DO NT KN .
OR MAYBE MAYBE THEIRS IS IN FACT ONE YEAR OF MILITARY SERVICE FOR EVERYONE .
BUT UH .
YEAH I BELIEVE THAT S RIGHT .
OKAY .
AND UH AND I DO NT KNOW THAT THAT S REALLY WHAT .
WE RE TALKING ABOUT .
NO I DO NT THINK IT S IT S NECESSA N I THINK OF THAT .
IT IT COULD NT BE .
MILITARY SERVICE IS NOT THAT MUCH BUT THE M MILITARY USED TO DO IT BUT THE IDEA THAT UH THERE ARE THINGS .
THAT THAT DO NEED TO BE DONE THAT COULD BE DONE AND THEN UH COUNTRY WOULD BENEFIT FROM ONE YEAR FROM FROM EVERYBODY AND EVEN OUT THE THE UH .
YEAH FOR .
REQUIREMENT .
FOR KIDS IN HIGH SCHOOL IT COULD BE IN THE SUMMERTIME .
WELL NOW THAT S A THOUGHT .
YEAH .
UH YOU KNOW UM IT IT COULD EVEN BE DONE WHILE THEY RE DOING ANOTHER JOB .
YEAH .
WHILE THEY RE DOING YOU KNOW A JOB TO MAKE MONEY .
BUT UH IT S UH YOU KNOW SUCH A GRASSROOTS IDEA THAT IT I THINK THE FAMILY WOULD HAVE TO BE INVOLVED IN IT .
UHHUH .
AND PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TO BE CONVINCED THAT YOU KNOW I I THINK THE THE BASIC MESSAGE IS THAT GIVING IS BETTER THAN RECEIVING .
YEAH RIGHT .
AND THAT S NOT THE KIND OF SOCIETY .
WE HAVE RIGHT NOW .
OH YEAH I M AFRAID YOU RE RIGHT THERE .
BUT UH BUT UH ANYTHING LIKE THIS .
THAT CAME UP WHETHER IT IT QUICKLY WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRY IN IN FIGURING OUT HOW TO GET AROUND IT WHERE PEOPLE .
THERE .
S LOTS AND LOTS OF VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS AND UH .
YEAH .
BUT MOST OF THOSE ARE AT L LEAST .
IT IT S MY OPINION THAT MOST OF THOSE INVOLVE ADULTS .
UHHUH .
ADULTS .
WHO HAVE THE TIME TO GIVE AND AND UH YOU KNOW THE DESIRE .
UHHUH .
TO TO GIVE .
YEAH .
IT S NOT UH YOU KNOW IT S NOT UH MAYBE THE MAYBE IT .
COU UH YOUNGER PEOPLE FEEL LIKE IT S NOT OPEN TO THEM I DO NT KNOW .
BUT IT SHOULD BE IF IT S NOT .
YEAH .
UH I SUSPECT THAT THE YEAH THAT THAT THAT THAT S NOT THE THING .
THAT THEY THAT THEY DO NT FEEL IT S OPEN TO THEM .
IT S JUST THAT THEY UH ARE MORE SELFCENTERED IF YOU WILL AND NOT NOT CONSIDERING .
YEAH .
A VOLUNTARY MUMBLEX .
IT IS KIND OF AN INTROSPECTIVE TIME OF LIFE .
YEAH .
BUT SOME SCHOOLS SOME HIGH SCHOOLS HAVE ACTUALLY STARTED A PROGRAM OF LIKE A VISITATION PROGRAM TO UH YOU KNOW AREAS ECONOMICALLY UH .
UHHUH .
SAY LESS ADVANTAGED AREAS .
UHHUH .
AND UH THEY THEY PROMOTE SERVICE ON THE PART OF THE KIDS TO TO UH SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE .
SO AT LEAST .
THAT S A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION .
I GUESS .
YEAH .
YEAH .
AND UH NOW I DIDN I DO NT KNOW IT .
DI I I THINK YOU RE RIGHT THAT THAT S NOT THE NOT THE WAY THAT THE SOCIETY THESE DAYS IS GOING AND I I THINK WE NEED TO WE NEED TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT SOME WAY TO TO TURN THAT AROUND THAT .
EVERYBODY .
IT S REALLY IT S REALLY UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE WHEN YOU DO I DO VOLUNTEER WORK FOR THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION .
HUH .
AND I HAVE HAVE DONE UH GONE TO WORK FOR AMERICAN HEART AND JUST RECENTLY FOR THE LEUKEMIA SOCIETY .
AND THERE S THERE S NO QUESTION THAT DOING YOU KNOW DOING THAT KIND OF SERVICE .
YOU GET A LOT MORE OUT OF IT THAN UH THAN THE PEOPLE INVOLVED .
YEAH .
UH IT S IT S REALLY A GIFT TO YOURSELF AND AND THAT S I THINK THAT S A REALLY IMPORTANT LESSON TO LEARN .
YEAH .
AND AND MAYBE THAT S WHY WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE IN SOCIETY .
WHO ARE NOT UH NOT REALLY HAPPY YOU KNOW .
WELL THAT COULD BE .
BECAUSE IF YOU CONCENTRATE ALL OF YOUR ENERGIES AND EFFORTS ON YOURSELF YOU RE JUST KIND OF DOWN THE TUBE YOU KNOW .
YEAH RIGHT .
UH IT REALLY IS BETTER TO GIVE THEN TO RECEIVE .
YEAH I I AGREE WITH THAT AND UH AND I I I DO NT KNOW WHAT WHAT HAS WHAT HAS SET IT OFF OR WHAT BUT I IT IT CERTAINLY SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT UH UH THINGS IN IN THE LAST TWENTYTHREE YEARS UH THINGS HAV HAVE DEFINITELY GONE TOWARDS UH VERY MUCH THE CONCENTRATION ON SELF AND AND LOSS OF LOSS OF PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS .

UHHUH .
UH JUST WEST OF MAYFIELD .

UH .
RIGHT THAT S KIND OF ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN SO .
OH OKAY .
OUR KIDS PROBABLY NEVER WENT TO SCHOOL TOGETHER OR ANYTHING .
OH THEY RE THEY RE LITTLE ONES .
OH WELL I VE GOT ONE IN COLLEGE .
OH .
BY NOW .
LET S SEE WE RE ON GOVERNMENT .
RIGHT .
WHETHER WE THINK IT S HONEST OR CAN BE .
WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE TO HAVE AN HONEST GOVERNMENT I M BEGINNING TO THINK IT S NOT WHAT ABOUT YOU .
I I DO NT THINK UNDER THE WAY THE SYSTEM IS RIGHT NOW IT IS .
I DO NT EITHER I I THINK UH EVEN IF PEOPLE HAVE GOOD INTENTIONS I THINK UH POWER CORRUPTS OR SOMETHING TO A CERTAIN EXTENT YOU KNOW .
THE ULTIMATE POWER ULTIMATELY RE CORRUPTS .
YEAH IT SEEMS LIKE UH MAYBE MORE OF THEM COME IN WITH GOOD INTENTIONS BUT IT S JUST SO ENTICING AND A LOT OF CORNERS BEING CUT AND THE SPECIAL DEALS AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY RE IN ON THE KNOW YOU KNOW .
I DO NT KNOW IF .
OH .
THERE IS ENOUGH MONEY THAT YOU COULD PAY THEM JUST .
YOU KNOW X AMOUNT OF MONEY TO KEEP THEM HONEST I JUST I JUST DO NT UH .
RIGHT I MEAN YOU EVEN SEE PEOPLE ON A SMALL SCALE CHEATING WHEN THEY HAVE CERTAIN POSITIONS YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN .
RIGHT .
LITTLE BITTY LITTLE BITTY POSITIONS IN YOUR OWN HOME TOWN AND THEY LL CHEAT SOMEHOW OR YOU KNOW BEND THE RULES USE THEIR POWER SO MAYBE IT S JUST MAN S NATURE .
WE HAD UH HERE IN OKLAHOMA WE HAD A FEW YEARS AGO A MAJOR UH CORRUPTION ON ON OUR COUNTY COMMISSIONERS .
UHHUH .
AND THERE WERE SEVERAL COUNTIES UH INCLUDING THE ONE I WAS IN THAT LOST EVERY ONE OF THEIR COUNTY COMMISSIONERS AND .
OH MY WORD .
I MEAN IT WAS TO THE POINT OF NOT JUST LOSING THEIR JOB BUT GOING TO JAIL .
OH WOW WHAT WERE THEY DOING TAKING SOME .
OH THEY WERE TAKING KICKBACKS .
OH NO .
YEAH .
OH GOSH .
JUST A LITTLE HERE A LITTLE THERE .
YEAH RIGHT .
MAJOR AMOUNT HERE A MAJOR AMOUNT THERE .
RIGHT OH .
BUT I THINK THERE WAS SOMETHING LIKE YOU KNOW THIRTY OR FORTY COMMISSIONERS THAT ENDED UP GOING TO JAIL .
UM WE HAVE NT HAD THAT BIG A SCANDAL IN ARLINGTON BUT WE DO HAVE THE PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR THE CONVENTION CENTER WERE FALSIFYING RECORDS IN OTHER WORDS THEY D GO OUT AND HAVE A BIG LAVISH DINNER AND THEN PUT SOMEBODY S NAME DOWN THAT THEY SUPPOSEDLY HAD ENTERTAINED BUT THAT PERSON WAS NT EVEN ANYWHERE NEAR THERE YOU KNOW SOME OF THEM WERE NT EVEN IN THE SAME CITY ONE OF THEM HAD HAD CANCER AND DIED AND I MEAN THAT WAS OUR BIGGEST SCANDAL FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS I THINK .
UH THAT S THAT S SMALL SCALE I DO NT KNOW YOU KNOW I REALLY DO NT KNOW WHAT COULD BE DONE UH .
I DO NT I DO NT EITHER UH TO MAKE IT TOTALLY HONEST UH I THINK THERE S THERE S ALWAYS GOING TO BE SOME WAY SOMEBODY CAN CUT A CORNER UH HOWEVER THE THINGS THAT HAVE GONE GONE ON IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WE CA NT AFFORD TOO MANY OF THOSE YOU KNOW THE .
THAT S RIGHT .
THE HUD MESS OR THE S AND L WE COULD ALMOST NOT AFFORD SUCH TERRIBLE CORRUPTION .
THE COVERUPS AND .
RIGHT RIGHT I THINK THAT UH REAGAN AND BUSH WERE UP TO THEIR NECKS IN THAT IRAN CONTRA THING AND IT KIND OF MAKES YOU FEEL BAD THAT THE TOP PEOPLE IN YOUR COUNTRY WOULD BE LYING TO YOU LIKE THAT BUT UH .
I UH I DO NT KNOW I JUST UH I D LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS SOME WAY THAT OUR POLITICAL PEOPLE WOULD REALLY GO THERE AND LOOK OUT FOR OUR INTERESTS .
RIGHT .
I THINK THAT S WHAT UPSETS ME WORSE THAN THAT THEY RE GETTING A LITTLE YOU KNOW UH ON THE SIDE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
THAT THAT .
THAT S RIGHT BUT THEY STAY THERE .
IT SEEMS THAT WHEN THEY GET UP THERE IT S IT S WHAT IF I VOTE YOUR WAY WHAT IT LL DO FOR ME RATHER .
UHHUH .
THAN THIS IS THE WAY MY CONSTITUENTS WANT IT .
RIGHT AND THIS WOULD BE FOR THE BEST FOR THE NATION OVERALL YOU RE RIGHT IT S JUST A I DO NT KNOW I GUESS THAT S WHERE THEY STAY IN UH IN THEY TRY TO STAY IN OFFICE BUT THEY ALWAYS PLEASE THE MONEY PEOPLE TOO THEY NEED MONEY SO MUCH BECAUSE THEY RE CONSTANTLY HAVING TO RUN .
RUN .
FOR OFFICE AGAIN AND .
MAYBE AND THEN YOU THINK WELL IF IT WAS LONGER TERMS .
UHHUH .
THEN THEY WOULD NEVER HAVE TO TRY TO PLEASE THE PEOPLE AT HOME .
THAT S TRUE BOY IT IS A BIG PROBLEM BUT I THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE KIND OF DEPRESSED AND CYNICAL ABOUT GOVERNMENT NOW DO NT YOU .
I DO NT THINK THAT THEY ANYONE HAS A LOT OF RESPECT OR FAITH IN THE GOVERNMENT .
I KNOW IT S REALLY TERRIBLE I MEAN THERE WAS A TIME I MEAN WHERE I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS REAL YOUNG I JUST LOVED HARRY TRUMAN I THOUGHT HE WAS GREAT OH YOU KNOW I HAD SOME OF THEM SEEMED LIKE KIND OF UH HEROIC PEOPLE .
WELL I WONDER IF THEY REALLY WERE .
OR IF WE JUST REALLY DID NT .
OKAY .
SO WHAT DO YOU .
GUYS HAVING UP THERE .
I HAVE NT BEEN UP THERE SINCE OH LORD FORTYEIGHT I GUESS .
FORTYEIGHT .
THAT S A LONG TIME .
UH .
WELL NO IT .
WAS NT FORTYEIGHT IT WAS IT WAS UH LET S SEE YEAH IT WAS FORTYEIGHT .
I WAS IN THE AIR FORCE .
UHHUH .

IT REALLY HAS BEEN STRANGE HERE THIS YEAR I MEAN THIS WHOLE YE COURSE .
THIS WHOLE YEAR HAS BEEN A DIFFERENT YEAR IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE .
UHHUH .
BUT UH WE HAD UH YOU KNOW ALL THESE WE HAVE ALL THESE UH SOMEBODY SAID YOU KNOW YOU RE EITHER A STRANGER OR A FOOL TO TRY TO PREDICT TEXAS WEATHER BUT .
UHHUH .
WELL ALWAYS THEY WERE SAYING IT WAS GOING TO BE THE HOTTEST SUMMER EVER AND WE HAD ALL THIS RAIN AND IT REALLY IS NOT A BAD SUMMER AT ALL REALLY COOL .
BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN IN IN UH IN OCTOBER UH SEPTEMBER OCTOBER .
IT GOT REAL HOT AND DRY AND JUST STAYED THAT WAY FOR A LONG TIME .
AND UH THEN THE END OF OCTOBER .
IT STARTED RAIN ALMOST A WEEK WITHOUT STOPPING JUST POURING DOWN YOU KNOW .
THERE WERE FLASH FLOODS EVERYWHERE THAT KIND OF DEAL AND THEN .
UHHUH .
UH INTO OF NOVEMBER THE FIRST LIKE THE SECOND WEEK UH YOU KNOW THE FIRST WEEK ACTUALLY WE HAD WE HAD A FREEZE AND THE AVERAGE YOU KNOW THE AVERAGE UH FIRST FROST IS LIKE THE FIFTEENTH OF NOVEMBER HERE .
OH IF YOU HAD IT EARLY .
BUT USUALLY IT S NOT UNTIL LATER .
IT S REALLY STRANGE .
YEAH I THINK WE USUALLY HAVE A FROST IN OCTOBER .
YEAH .
UH BUT YOU KNOW .
WE REALLY NEED THE RAIN THAT WE VE BEEN GETTING AND IT HAS NOT TODAY BUT THE LAST FEW DAYS .
IT S BEEN BEEN POURING MOST OF THE DAY .
IS IT IS IT IS IT FLOODING ANYWHERE .
FLOODING ANYWHERE .
I HAVE NOT HEARD OF IT ANY PROBLEMS OF IT FLOODING ANYWHERE I MEAN THAT S OCCURRED CERTAINLY AT TIMES IN THE PAST BUT UH NO I VE NOT HEARD OF ANY PARTICULAR PROBLEMS .
THIS TIME .
IT S JUST KIND OF UH CLOU WE RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A CHANCE TO GET SOME RAIN .
THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS HERE UH WHICH WILL BE YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE TYPICAL UH AUTUMN WEATHER .
BUT REALLY IT S STRANGE .
WE HAVE NT REALLY HAD AN AUTUMN .
IT .

YES .
YOU KNOW THE POOR TREES SAID WHAT .

YEAH THERE YOU YOU KNOW USUALLY THERE S UH I HAVE A FARM .
A HUNDRED MILES EAST OF HERE IN EAST TEXAS AND YOU KNOW ALL THESE HUGE TREES JUST LIKE THE EASTERN HARD WOOD BELT .
ALL THE WAY UP TO MAINE YOU KNOW IT S THAT SAME TREES PINES AND AND HARD WOODS YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
HICKORIES AND OAKS AND STUFF AND UH I WAS UP THERE LAST WEEKEND AND THERE ARE TREES .
THAT THAT STILL HAVE THEIR LEAVES ON AND THEY RE GREEN BUT THEY RE DEAD .
YOU KNOW THE THE FREEZE JUST GOT THEM .
MUMBLEX .
THEY THEY WERE NT READY FOR IT AT ALL APPARENTLY AND AND WE HAVE NT HAD A TYPICAL FALL AT ALL .
NOT MUCH COLOR YOU KNOW CHANGES HAVE OCCURRED AT ALL .
REALLY WEIRD .
THIS YEAR .
I M NOT SURE WHAT .
THAT WHAT .
THAT MEANS .
I DO NT KNOW .
YEAH OUR LEAVES ARE ARE ALL ON ON THE GROUND NOW .
I THINK IT WAS AN ESPECIALLY GOOD WINTER FOR FALL COLORS .
SO YOU YOU .
ALL ACTUALLY HAD SOME COLOR HUH .
OH YEAH YEAH .
IT .
KIND OF CREPT IN AND .
YEAH WE WE DID FOR A TIME .
YEAH IT S USUALLY BEAUTIFUL UP THERE IS NT IT .
UHHUH .
GORGEOUS .
THAT S YOU KNOW I THINK YOU COULD DRIVE ALONG IN MARYLAND AND LOOK AT THE SWEET GUM TREES ON EACH SIDE AND THE AND THE PINES AND WHAT NOT AND YOU COULD YOU KNOW YOU COULD BE DRIVING ALONG IN EAST TEXAS AND LOOKS JUST THE SAME .
IT S ALMOST YOU KNOW IDENTICAL KIND OF COUNTRY .
UHHUH .
BEAUTIFUL .
BEEN THAT THIS YEAR .
YEAH .
FOR THE TREES .
OH .
FOR THE LEAVES .
YEAH I WAS UP I WAS UP THERE CUTTING SOME FIREWOOD .
THIS WEEKEND SO .
UM .
LITTLE LITTLE OAK TREE .
THAT WAS DEAD AND CUT IT UP AND SPLIT IT .
MUMBLEX .
YEAH THAT S BECAUSE IT IT CA NT TOLERATE A FREEZE THIS EARLY .
IS THAT RIGHT .
WELL .
IF IT WOULD CAME LATER IT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT .
UH IT THERE S SOME TREES LIKE THE OAKS LIKE THE WHITE OAKS SEEM TO BE PRETTY HARDY .
THERE S NOTHING BOTHERS THEM .
THEIR LEAVES ARE STILL GREEN AND SOME OF THE OTHER OAKS .
THERE ARE A FEW OAKS .
THAT HAVE LOST THEIR LEAVES .
UM WHAT .
I NOTICE MOSTLY IS THE RED MAPLES THAT THE LEAVES ARE JUST DEAD THE DOGWOODS STILL LOOK STILL LOOK YOU KNOW THEY GOT UH BIT ON THE ENDS OF THE LEAVES .
A LITTLE BIT BUT THEY STILL LOOK PRETTY GOOD .
UM .
IT JUST DEPENDS ON THE ON THE UH ON THE TREE .
OKAY .
UM .
WHERE DO YOU LIVE .
IN PLANO .
IN PLANO .
YES .
WHERE DO YOU LIVE .
IN DALLAS .
OH OKAY .
UH THE AIR POLLUTION IS NT TOO BAD IN OUR AREA .
SO WE RE VERY FORTUNATE .
HUH .
BUT I KNOW IN SOME AREAS IT S REALLY IT IT REALLY IS BAD .
UM I WAS TRYING TO THINK UH SOMETHING .
WE WERE WATCHING THE OTHER DAY AND THEY WERE DOING AN OVERVIEW OF LOS ANGELES UH FROM AN AREA .
THAT WAS UP HIGHER AND YOU LITERALLY COULD SEE THE BAND OF SMOG .
THAT UH I VE NEVER BEEN OUT THERE BUT .
I HAVE NT EITHER .
IT WAS IT WAS QUITE EVIDENT THAT .
UHHUH .
IT WAS A REAL BROWN AREA AND .
WELL I THINK IT WOULD BE TERRIBLE TO LIVE IN AN AREA LIKE THAT AND UNFORTUNATELY I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF AREAS .
THAT ARE THAT THAT BAD .
YEAH .
PARTICULARLY IN THE AREAS WHERE THERE ARE INDUSTRIES UH WHERE THEY ARE BURNING A LOT OF COAL .
YES .
AND OIL .
YEAH .
UP MORE UP NORTH I GUESS UH I THINK IT S A BIGGER PROBLEM .
WITH THE CAR POLLUTION ANTIPOLLUTION DEVICES I THINK UH AIR IS NT AS BAD IT ONCE WAS FROM THE CARS BECAUSE WE CERTAINLY HAVE PLENTY OF CARS IN OUR AREA .
YES .
WELL I KNOW UH THAT S BEEN THE CONCERN IN EUROPE .
THEY HAD NT UH WE HAVE FRIENDS IN GERMANY AND UH HAVE FAMILY .
THAT LIVE NEAR THE BLACK FOREST AREA AND LARGE AREAS OF THE FOREST ARE BEING HURT FROM THE CARS BECAUSE WHEN WE S UH SWITCHED TO THE UNLEADED GAS AND AND HAD THE EMISSION CONTROL ADVICE UH DEVICES REQUIRED ON THE CARS UH THAT S SOMETHING THAT EUROPE DID NT DO RIGHT AWAY AND NOW THEY RE DOING THAT AND I GUESS IT STARTED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS BECAUSE THEY HAVE FOUND THAT IN THAT PARTICULAR PART OF THE COUNTRY THAT S THE ONLY POLLUTION .
THAT S BEEN THERE .
IT S NOT AN AREA .
THAT IS INDUSTRY BUT THEY WERE LOSING A LOT OF UH TREES AND A LOT OF .
FROM ACID RAIN .
UM I GUESS .
FROM FROM SOMETHING THAT THE CAR WAS UH WAS GIVING .
I THINK IT GIVES OFF UH IN THE EMISSIONS IT GIVES OFF GASES .
WHICH COMBINE UP IN THE ATMOSPHERE UH AND FORM A A WEAK ACID .
YES AND .
IT JUST MAKES THE RAIN FALL ON THE ACID SIDE AND AFTER A PERIOD OF TIME I THINK THAT ACCUMULATES IN UH TREES BECAUSE THEY TAKE IT UP THROUGH THEIR ROOTS AS WELL AS IT LANDING ON THE LEAVES ON SURFACES LIKE YOU VE SEEN WHAT .
IT S DONE TO BUILDINGS EVEN .
YES .
WHERE IT S REALLY BAD .
YEAH .
WHAT S INTERESTING SEVERAL YEARS AGO I TOOK A COURSE UH ON UH WELL IT WAS ACTUALLY IT WAS PUT ON BY THE POWER COMPANIES AND ABOUT THE VARIOUS SOURCES OF ENERGY AND HOW MUCH POLLUTION .
THERE WAS AND THERE WAS NT FROM VARIOUS KINDS OF OF ENERGY .
AND UH AT THAT POINT IN TIME ONE PERSON .
THAT WAS A SPEAKER BROUGHT UP THE TOPIC OF ACID RAIN AND IT WAS KIND OF POOHPOOHED YOU KNOW .
OH YOU RE MAKING A MOUNTAIN OUT OF A MOLEHILL KIND OF THING .
AND IT S TURNED OUT THAT THAT S BEEN VERY TRUE WHAT .
HE WAS FORECASTING ABOUT THE ACCUMULATION OF OF THE POLLUTANTS IN THE AIR AND THE ACID RAIN AND WHAT .
IT WOULD DO TO FOLIAGE .
SO IT S KIND OF INTERESTING THE CHANGE IN PERSPECTIVE FROM WHEN I TOOK THAT COURSE .
NOW A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE REALLY AFRAID OF NUCLEAR .
UH I M NOT AFRAID OF NUCLEAR HAVING HAD THAT COURSE BECAUSE OF HOW THE NUCLEAR .
THAT UH THEY USE IS NOT BOMB QUALITY AND WE RE SO STRICT WITH ALL OUR CONTROLS IN THE UNITED STATES .
THE CHANCES OF OF AN ACCIDENT ARE SLIGHT AND IT DOES NT POLLUTE THE AIR AT ALL .
IT S SAFER TO BE AROUND A NUCLEAR PLANT THEN IT IS TO BE AROUND A COAL PLANT .
MANY MORE DEATHS HAVE OCCURRED IN AND DEALING WITH COAL PLANTS THEN EVER AROUND NUCLEAR PLANTS .
IT .
S KIND OF FUNNY BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE JUST PETRIFIED AT LEAST .
SOME ARE AT THE THOUGHT OF NUCLEAR .
YES .
SO I DO NT KNOW .
IN EUROPE THERE S A LOT OF DEPENDENCY ON NUCLEAR POWER AND THEY RECYCLE THE FUEL AND THEN INSTEAD OF OF SOME PEOPLE ARE REALLY AFRAID TO RECYCLE THE FUEL BECAUSE THEY RE AFRAID IT COULD BECOME UH BOMB QUALITY .
BUT THAT S THE ONLY SENSIBLE THING TO DO IS RECYCLE AND REUSE THE FUEL AND NOT STORE IT DOWN IN THE GROUND .
AS FAR AS I M CONCERNED WHERE IT COULD EVENTUALLY PERHAPS THERE S SOME PROBLEM UH POLLUTE THE GROUNDWATER .
SO I DO NT KNOW WHAT .
THE ANSWER IS .
THE BEST ANSWER OF COURSE WOULD BE SOLAR OR UH FUSION OR SOMETHING CLEAN .
YES .
WELL WE VE GOT A PROBLEM ON THE LINE DO NT WE .
YEAH .
I I GET THAT SOMETIMES UM MY LINE GETS SOME STATIC .
I DO NT KNOW WHY .
UHHUH .
BUT UH SOLAR OF COURSE WOULD BE THE CLEAN THE CLEANEST .
WELL I KNOW IT S MUMBLEX UM .
WE DID HAVE A SOLAR WATER HEATER WHEN WE LIVED IN HOUSTON AND UH ODDLY ENOUGH I THOUGHT OUR PART OF THE COUNTRY WAS IDEAL .
I CA NT HEAR YOU AT ALL FOR ALL THIS STATIC .
OH .
I DO NT KNOW WHAT TO USUALLY IT S THE OTHER PHONE .
I HAVE TROUBLE WITH .
IT MUST JUST .
BE ON THE LINE .
CAN YOU HEAR ME .
NOW I CAN AGAIN .
OKAY .
I DO NT KNOW WHAT UH I I DO NT KNOW WHAT .
THE PROBLEM IS BUT UH WHEN WE LIVED IN HOUSTON WE HAD A SOLAR WATER HEATER AND .
UHHUH .
WE HAD THOUGHT THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY WOULD BE IDEAL FOR SOLAR HOMES AND SOLAR ENERGY AND WE HAVE ENOUGH CLOUDS .
THAT UH THERE ARE OTHER AREAS .
THAT WOULD BE BETTER SUITED .
THAT SURPRISED ME BECAUSE I THINK .
WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF UM SUNNY DAYS .
UHHUH .
AND AND IT YES IT CAN BE USED AND IT CAN HELP BUT UH THAT WAS A PROBLEM THAT THEY WERE STILL WORKING ON .
BUT .
OH YEAH .
IT IT S STILL GOT A LONG WAY TO GO .
WELL I .
IT S JUST YOU KNOW A POSSIBLE SOLUTION .
YES .
IN THE FUTURE I THINK MAYBE TO HELP IN SOME WAYS .
IT MAY NOT IN ALL WAYS .
MAYBE THEY LL COME UP WITH FUSION .
YOU KNOW CON BE ABLE TO CONTROL IT .
I DO NT KNOW HOW LONG .
THAT LL TAKE BUT ONE OF THESE DAYS BECAUSE THAT S PERFECTLY CLEAN .
YES .
IT S JUST WE CA NT CONTROL IT .
RIGHT NOW IT TAKES MORE ENERGY TO CAUSE FUSION TO OCCUR THEN YOU GET OUT SO IT IS NT NOT AT ALL AND YOU CA NT CONTROL IT UNLESS YOU GOTTEN A HUGE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD SO THAT S NOT GOING TO WORK .
AT LEAST NOT NOW .
BUT UH WHO KNOWS WHAT .
THE FUTURE WILL HOLD .
UH AS FAR AS ENERGY GOES I I THINK WITH SOLVING SOME OF THE ENERGY FUTURE ENERGY PROBLEMS WE LL PROBABLY SOLVE SOME OF THE POLLUTION PROBLEMS AS WELL .
UH I HOPE SO .
I DO TO .
I LIKE TO BE OPTIMISTIC I DO NT LIKE TO BE PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THESE THINGS .
WELL I DO THINK UM I MEAN YOU VE ALREADY MENTIONED SEVERAL THINGS I THINK UH JUST THE CHANGE IN ATTITUDE AND THE FACT THAT MORE PEOPLE ARE AWARE THERE IS A PROBLEM AND MORE PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN UH .
WE HAVE ONE EARTH .
YES .
TO LIVE ON AND WE GOT TO TAKE CARE OF IT .
YES .
WELL .
UHHUH .
AND AND FOR THE FUTURE GENERATIONS TOO .
UH .
I VE NOTICED STUDENTS ARE ARE MUCH MORE YOU KNOW YOUNG YOUNG PEOPLE ARE MUCH MORE RECEPTIVE TO IDEAS ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT .
YES .
AND PROTECTING THE EARTH .
AND SO IF WE CAN RAISE IT UH YOU KNOW GENERATIONS WITH THOSE CONCERNS WE LL SOLVE A LOT OF OUR PROBLEMS .
I M AFRAID I KNOW I WAS PART OF THE .
ME .
GENERATION WHERE THEY DID NT MUMBLEX SO MANY OF THEM DID NT PEOPLE DID NT CARE .
YOU KNOW IT S WHATEVER YOU KNOW RECYCLE WELL IF IT S A PROBLEM FORGET THAT .
UH NOT THROW THE TRASH OUT THE CAR WINDOW AND LEAVE IT IN THE CAR AND THEN THROW IT AWAY .
HOW HORRIBLE YOU KNOW .
NOW I VE ALWAYS DONE THOSE KINDS OF THINGS BECAUSE I JUST DID NT LIKE MESSES AND .
WHAT DO YOU LIKE TO WATCH ON TELEVISION MUMBLEX .
WELL I GUESS A LOT OF THE UH SOMETHING THAT S KIND OF MORE OF A COMEDY WE DO HAVE UH CABLE AND WE HAVE PREMIUM STATIONS LIKE H B O AND SHOWTIME AND SUCH AND I GUESS A LOT OF TIMES WHEN I FIRST TURN THE T V ON I I NORMALLY GO TO THOSE BECAUSE I PAY FOR THEM .
YES .
I GUESS I I WANT TO SEE IF THERE S ANYTHING I REALLY WANT TO SEE THERE SO I DO NT END UP WATCHING THE UM PRIME TIME ON SOME OF THE STANDARD CHANNELS AS MUCH I TEND TO GO TO MY PREMIUM CHANNELS FIRST .

UM .
DO YOU EVER WATCH THAT .
YEAH THE YOU MEAN TALKING ABOUT THE FUNNY HOME VIDEOS AND STUFF .
YEAH UHHUH .
YEAH THOSE ARE PRETTY GOOD .
THAT ARE SOMETIMES SO DUMB .
BUT TRUE TO LIFE I MEAN SOME OF THE .
BUT VERY TRUE TO LIFE I MEAN I VE SEEN OUR FAMILY IN SEVERAL OF THOSE SITUATIONS .
OKAY .
WELL I TAKE IT SINCE YOU SELECTED THIS TOPIC THAT YOU HAVE CHILDREN .
NO I DO NT .
YOU DO NT .
BUT I HAVE NINE YOUNGER BROTHERS AND SISTERS .
MY GOODNESS .
SO WELL I HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS AND UM THEY RE PAST THIS THEY VE BEEN LATCHKEY CHILDREN FOR A WHILE AND THEY RE ALMOST WHERE I CAN START SAYING THEY RE YOU KNOW YOUNG ADULTS .
UHHUH .
SO I DO NT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT CHILD CARE TOO MUCH ANYMORE UM WE RE SUPPOSED TO DISCUSS WHAT CRITERIA WE WOULD ASK .
UHHUH .
OR EXPECT .
I WOULD ASSUME IT S YOU KNOW IF YOU WERE LOOKING FOR A DAYCARE CENTER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
WELL IF I WERE LOOK .
OR PROBABLY EVEN BABYSITTERS WOULD BE THE SAME THING .
EXACTLY EXACTLY UM I THINK MY MY TOP PRIORITY WOULD BE THAT IT WOULD BE SOMEONE WHO WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE AND SOMEONE THAT WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE CHILDREN .
YES I WOULD THINK SOMEONE OLDER AND I WOULD WANT TO KNOW IF THEY VE HAD ANY PAST EXPERIENCE WITH CHILDREN .
UHHUH .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK THAT VARIES I THINK A LOT OF YOUR CRITERIA VARY WITH THE AGE OF YOUR CHILD .
YES THAT S TRUE ALSO .
UM YOU KNOW IT S IT S ONCE THEY GET TO A CERTAIN AGE IT S ALMOST MORE IMPORTANT THAT IT S SOMEONE THAT CAN ENTERTAIN YOUR CHILD AS OPPOSED TO SOMEONE WHO S YOU KNOW REALLY REALLY QUALIFIED .
UHHUH .
PER SE UM WITH A WITH A BABY DEFINITELY HAVE TO BE SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO HANDLE A BABY AND WOULD KNOW HOW TO RESPOND TO AN EMERGENCY .
UHHUH .
SO .
WELL UM I DID A LOT OF BABYSITTING WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I M TWENTYTWO NOW AND I DID MOST OF MY BABYSITTING WHEN I WAS BETWEEN THE AGES OF THIRTEEN AND SIXTEEN BUT UM THE ONLY THING PEOPLE EVER ASKED ME WELL OF COURSE THEY KNEW I CAME FROM A FAMILY WITH YOUNGER KIDS BUT THEY REALLY DID NT ASK ME IF I WAS USED TO CHILDREN OR NOT THE ONLY OTHER THING THEY ASKED ME IS WHAT I WOULD EXPECT IN PAY .
OH UHHUH UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND UM I WAS PRETTY SURPRISED BECAUSE IF I HAD A CHILD AND SOMEONE YOU KNOW I WOULD WANT TO KNOW I PERSONALLY WOULD ASK FOR PEOPLE THAT THAT PERSON HAS BABYSIT FOR BEFORE .
WELL I MY EXPERIENCE I BABYSAT A LOT ALSO AT WHEN I GREW UP AND UM COMING FROM YOU KNOW THAT BACKGROUND AND THE BACKGROUND AS A PARENT NOW I THINK THE REASON THAT PEOPLE DO NT ASK A WHOLE LOT OF QUESTIONS IS A A LOT OF TIMES BABYSITTERS I KNOW I DID THIS WITH MY CHILDREN IT S YOU GET SOMEBODY WHERE YOU KIND OF KNOW THE FAMILY ALREADY .
UHHUH .
AND THAT GIVES YOU SO MUCH BASIC KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU DO NT ASK A WHOLE LOT OF QUESTIONS .
UHHUH .
BECAUS BECAUSE I HAD THREE YOUNGER BROTHERS AND SISTERS MYSELF SO THEY THEY THOUGHT OKAY SHE KNOWS HOW TO HOW TO TREAT CHILDREN .
YES WELL SEE WHEN UM I FIRST GOT MY MAI MY FIRST BABYSITTING JOB WAS PRETTY STRANGE UM THIS LADY SAW US AT CHURCH AND SHE WAS A YOU YOU KNOW SHE WAS A YOUNGER LADY SHE DID NT REALLY KNOW MY MOM SHE KNEW MY MOM BY NAME AND THAT WAS IT AND UM SHE KNEW THAT I WAS ONE OF THE OLDEST GIRLS IN MY FAMILY SO SHE JUST ASKED MY MOM IF I COULD BABYSIT .
UHHUH UHHUH .
YOU KNOW SHE REALLY DID NT KNOW MY NAME OR ANYTHING YOU KNOW I THOUGHT THAT WAS PRETTY STRANGE YOU KNOW AND SHE HAD TWO CHILDREN ONE WAS STILL IN DIAPERS WHEN I STARTED BABYSITTING .
WOW .
SO UM SHE PRETTY MUCH YOU KNOW JUST ASSUMED THAT I WOULD KNOW YOU KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THEM SO I WA YOU KNOW I ENJOY KIDS AND I GET ALONG WITH THEM VERY WELL SO THERE S NO PROBLEM BUT UH WITH TODAY S WORLD AND THE KIDS TODAY UH THERE S NO WAY I CA NT SAY THAT I WOULD JUST ASK SOMEONE YOU KNOW THAT I DID NT KNOW LIKE THAT TO BABYSIT .
OH I AGREE WITH YOU BUT THERE AGAIN SHE YOU KNOW SHE KNEW KNEW OF YOUR FAMILY .
UHHUH THAT S TRUE .
AND SHE AND SHE MET IN A SAFE SETTING SUCH AS CHURCH .
UHHUH .
SO SHE WAS GOING ON THOSE TWO INSTINCTS JUST THE SAME I KNOW MYSELF I NEVER AND I WAS VERY VERY PROTECTIVE ON WHO BABYSAT MY CHILDREN .
OH I WOULD BE TOO .
AND AND IN I IT REALLY SHOCKED ME BECAUSE JUST ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO SOMEONE CAME TO MY FRONT DOOR RANG THE DOORBELL SHE HAD JUST MOVED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD SHE HAD HER DAUGHTER WITH HER AND THE DAUGHTER WAS OH ABOUT A SECOND GRADER AND SHE WAS ACTIVELY LOOKING FOR PEOPLE WHO WOULD BABYSIT HER CHILD .
OH MY .
AND I THOUGHT WELL SHE DOES NT KNOW ME OR MY CHILDREN FROM ANYTHING .
HUHUH .
AND IT WAS I WAS ALMOST MORE RELUCTANT OF LETTING MY OLDER CHILDREN GO BABYSIT FOR HER BECAUSE I DID NT KNOW HER .
UHHUH YES .
THEN SHE WAS RELUCTANT OF LETTING STRANGERS INTO HER HOUSE .
UHHUH .
SO I MEAN PEOPLE ARE SO DIFFERENT .
OH I KNOW UM WELL I REAL I OBVIOUSLY YOU VE NEVER HAD TO LOOK FOR A DAY CARE OR ANYTHING .
WELL I DID I DID HAVE UM MY MY CHILD UH IN A DAY CARE FOR JUST A SHORT TIME A WHEN MY OLDEST WAS ABOUT TWO AND A HALF .
UHHUH .
AND I WORKED JUST A PARTTIME JOB AND UH IN IN THOSE SITUATIONS UM WHAT I DID IS I D I WENT IN AND YOU KNOW I MADE A FEW PHONE CALLS I WENT IN AND VISITED I ASKED QUESTIONS SUCH AS HOW THEY WOULD DISCIPLINE A CHILD .
UHHUH .
UM THAT WAS A CONCERN WITH ME UM YOU KNOW C YOU YOU LEARN A LOT BY GOING IN THERE AND THEY E THEY EXPLAIN TO YOU YOU KNOW WHAT THEIR DAY CONSISTS OF AND WHAT THEIR GENERAL RULES ARE AND UM THAT S YOU KNOW THAT S AS MUCH AS I KNOW YOU PROBABLY COULD GET REALLY GOOD FEEDBACK FROM A LOT OF OTHER WORKING MOTHERS .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THAT HAVE DONE THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN .
WELL .
BUT I GO AHEAD .
HOW DID YOU STUMBLE UPON THE DAYCARE CENTER DID YOU JUST LOOK IT UP IN A PHONE BOOK OR WHAT WAS IT .
UM I THINK LOTS OF PEOPLE I I THINK I WENT BY LOCATION FOR ONE THING .
UHHUH .
I THINK MOST PEOPLE DO THAT I THINK YOU START OUT WITH THE CRITERIA OF YOU KNOW DO I KNOW OF ANYTHING OR DO I KNOW ANYONE WHO HAS THEIR CHILD IN A DAY CARE AND .
YEAH THERE IS I WOULD SAY MOST PEOPLE WOULD PROBABLY GO BY WORD OF MOUTH .
RIGHT RIGHT AND THEN YOU KNOW I MEAN EVEN AT THAT YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER THE LOGISTICS OF IT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW I MEAN YOU RE NOT GOING TO TAKE YOUR CHILD SOUTH OF TOWN IF YOU WORK NORTH .
YES EXACTLY .
YO EVEN IF THAT S THE BEST ONE IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD .
UHHUH .
SO THERE THERE ARE JUST SO MANY CONSIDERATIONS .
UHHUH THEN AGAIN DID UM MONEY COME INTO PLAY WITH IT AT ALL .
OH MONEY IS ALWAYS A FACTOR IN MY LIFE .
DEFINITELY I VE NEVER YOU KNOW I VE NEVER HAD THE LUXURY OF NOT HAVING THAT BE A FACTOR UM EVEN IN SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT AS DAY CARE I KNOW IF I DID NT HAVE THAT STIPULATION I WOULD HAVE DONE THINGS DIFFERENTLY .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW UM MONTESSORI SCHOOL WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT I WOULD HAVE PURSUED BUT THAT S ALWAYS A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPENSIVE THAN WHAT I COULD LOOK AT .
UHHUH .
UM AND I WAS VERY VERY FORTUNATE IN THAT I DID NT HAVE TO DO THAT ON A FULLTIME BASIS .
YES .
SO AND AND THEN WHEN YOU GET YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GET INTO THE FULLTIME BASIS DAY CARE .
I GUESS WE ARE JUST TO DISCUSS TRIALS AND AND PUNISHMENT IF IT S TO BE GIVEN BY THE JUDGE OR NOT DID YOU DID YOU CATCH YOUR EXPLANATION OF THAT .
YES I DID IT S IT S UH .
OKAY .
THE UH MAYBE I M A HARD LINER BUT I THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOME PRESET PENALTIES IN CRIMINAL CASES RATHER THAN UH DEGREES OF SENTENCING .
YOU MEAN THE CRIMES OR THE PUNISHMENT SHOULD FIT THE CRIME .
RIGHT RIGHT .
OKAY .
UH AGAIN HAVING PARTICIPATED IN JURY DUTY MYSELF I KNOW .
YES I DID ALSO .
I KNOW HOW SUCH A DIVERSE GROUP OF PEOPLE GET TOGETHER THE DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS DIFFERENT IDEAS THAT .
RIGHT .
SOMETIMES YOU CAN HAVE ONE PERSON OR TWO .
THAT CAN HOLD UP WHAT I CONSIDER THE PROPER SENTENCING .
OF THE P PERSON .
COULD YOU HANG ON ONE MINUTE JIM .
YES MAAM .
THANK YOU .
I AM SO SORRY TO KEEP YOU ON HOLD .
NO PROBLEM .
ARE YOU AT WORK .
YES .
OKAY I AM TOO UM .
YEAH UM I THINK WHAT YOU HAVE IS THE WAY THE THE JUSTICE SYSTEM WORKS IS THEY BEND OVER BACKWARDS TRYING TO PROTECT THE GUILTY .
OH IT S INSANE .
SO MANY THINGS IN THEIR BACK PARDON .
IT S INSANE .
YES I KNOW .
MY WIFE PARTICIPATED IN A JURY TRIAL SEVERAL YEARS BACK .
YES .
WHEREIN THE INDIVIDUAL AFTER IT WAS OVER AND THEY .
HAD CAME UP WITH THE MAXIMUM SENTENCE .
YES .
IN THE JURY FORM THEY FOUND OUT THAT UH THE GENTLEMAN INVOLVED HAD A LONG HISTORY OF THE SAME TYPE OFFENSE .
RIGHT .
WHICH WAS THEFT OF .
UHHUH .
UH PROPERTY .
OH YES .
AND YET THE AS THE ATTORNEY .
FOR THE PROSECUTION COULD NOT ENTER THESE UH THE GOOD MAN S BACKGROUND INTO IT IT WAS LIKE .
THIS WAS A FIRST TIME OFFENDER .
YES .
WHEREAS UH .
I THINK THAT S .
IT SEEMS LIKE MUMBLEX .
THOSE THAT SHOULD BE IN JAIL SHOULD BE IN JAIL .
THAT S CORRECT AND THERE S TOO MUCH LENIENCY THERE S TOO MUCH UH UM UNDERHANDED UH THINGS GOING ON THAT THE PUBLIC ARE NOT AWARE OF .
YEAH .
AND IT SEEMS AS THOUGH WE ARE UH GIVING THE CRIMINAL THE BENEFIT MORE THAN THE VICTIM THE VICTIM HAS BEEN VICTIMIZED TWICE NOT ONLY BY THE PERPETRATOR OF THE CRIME BUT ALSO .
THE COURTS THAT TRY TO DO THE JUSTICE .
WELL I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT ALSO THAT ATTORNEYS HAVE SUCH A A UNSAVORY REPUTATION SHALL WE SAY .
I DO NOT HAVE ANY I DO NT HAVE AN OUNCE IN MY BODY OF CREDIBILITY TOWARD THE THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IN .
YEAH .
THE UNITED STATES .
WELL WHAT YOU GOT IS THE SITUATION WHEREIN UH IF YOU EVER GET IN TROUBLE YOU WANT TO HIRE THE SMARTEST CROOKEDEST LAWYER YOU CAN FIND .
IS NT THAT TERRIBLE .
AND UH THAT S NOT THE IDEA IT S THE IDEA IS NOT TO GET THE GUY OFF OF THE CRIME .
THAT HE COMMITTED BUT TO PUNISH HIM FOR THE CRIME HE COMMITTED .
WELL TO PUNISH HIM FOR THE CRIME BUT ALSO TO TRY AND REEDUCATE THE MAN S THINKING .
YEAH .
TO GET HIM OUT OF THAT UH UH CRIMINAL MIND THAT HE HAS AND TO DIRECT .
HIM INTO A MORE PRODUCTIVE LIFE .
YEAH WELL WE HAVE UH A SITUATION AGAIN THAT I AM FAMILIAR WITH WHERE UH THE SON OF AN ACQUAINTANCE OF MINE .
UHHUH .
WAS KILLED .
OH .
WHILE TRYING TO STOP A ROBBERY .
YES HOW SAD .
AND THE PERSON THAT KILLED HIM WAS A YOUNG WOMAN WHO HAD LEFT THE HOUSE WITH FULL INTENT TO COMMIT CRIMES CARRYING A GUN IN HER PURSE .
UHHUH .
AND ANYWAY IT D GET TO THE SHE WAS SENTENCED TO JAIL BUT THEN DUE TO TECHNICALITIES SHE WAS GOING TO BE OUT OF JAIL WITHIN EIGHTEEN MONTHS AFTER SHE WAS SENTENCED .
OH .
OF COURSE IT TOOK EIGHTEEN MONTHS FOR THE THING THE TRIAL TO HAPPEN .
RIGHT .
SO THEN UH .
THERE WAS A LETTER WRITING CAMPAIGN THAT WENT IN AND THE PAROLE BOARD RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY A THOUSAND LETTERS PROTESTING PUTTING THIS PERSON BACK ON THE STREET WITHIN EIGHTEEN MONTHS AFTER KILLING SOMEONE AND UH FORTUNATELY IT WORKED THEY UH ELIMI THEY CORRECTED THE TECHNICALITY .
WELL IF .
AND THE PERSON NOW WILL HAVE TO SERVE THREE TO FOUR YEARS OF THE SEVEN OR EIGHT THEY WERE SENTENCED TO .
YES IF ENOUGH OF THE PUBLIC .
RESPONDED TO UH THE DIR THE UH PARTIES THAT ARE INVOLVED AND IF ENOUGH THEY WILL LISTEN TO THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE I HAVE FOUND THAT OUT THAT IF ENOUGH PEOPLE RESPOND AND RISE UP AGAINST THE INJUSTICES BEING DONE SOMETHING IS GOING TO CHANGE .
RIGHT .
PEOPLE HAVE TO BE INVOLVED .
THIS IS IT .
YEAH .
AND MOST PEOPLE DO NT TAKE THE TIME .
THAT S RIGHT .
AGAIN THE ONLY REASON I TOOK THE TIME IS BECAUSE I WAS PERSONALLY ACQUAINTED .
THAT S RIGHT .
WITH THESE PEOPLE I M JUST .
YOU WERE .
AS GUILTY AS THE REST IN THAT RESPECT .
YES UH BUT AND I M NOT MAKING AN EXCUSE BUT WE OUR PRIORITIES ARE A BIT BACKWARD .
OH YES WELL THEY AGAIN THE AND I M NOT KNOCKING THE CIVIL RIGHTS PROGRAM OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT WE VE GONE .
OVERBOARD TO UH PROTECT PERSONS FROM BEING HAVING THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS .
VIOLATED TO THE POINT WHERE THE PERSON THAT IS DAMAGED .
IS NOT PROTECTED IT S AGAIN THE VICTIM GETS WORSE PUNISHMENT THEN THE PERSON .
THAT COMMITS THE CRIMES .
THAT S CORRECT .
YEAH .
YEAH YEAH .
OKAY I THINK WE RE BOTH IN AGREEMENT ON THIS SUBJECT .
WELL I AM TOO .
I MEAN I I JUST CA NT I YOU KNOW I SERVED ON A JURY FOR A LADY THAT WAS HAVING A MENTAL PROBLEM AND WE FOUND HER NOT GUILTY BECAUSE THE LADY OBVIOUSLY WAS NOT IN THEIR RIGHT MIND SO IF THE PERSON IS NOT IN THE RIGHT MIND I MEAN THEY HAD TO UH PUT HER AWAY .
YEAH .
BUT FOR HER OWN SAFETY AND FOR BECAUSE SHE DID NT KNOW WHAT SHE WAS DOING .
AND WE COULD NT WE JUST DISMISSED THE CASE .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW AND AND SHE WAS UH TAKEN CARE OF BY THE PROPER FACILITY .
YEAH WELL ANOTHER SIDE OF THE COIN THAT WITH OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM THERE ARE A LOT OF FRIVOLOUS CASES THAT GO TO COURT THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT COULD BE SETTLED OUT OF COURT .
YES THAT S TRUE .
WHICH UH OR SHOULD NEVER HAVE GONE TO COURT AND THEN THE AMAZING THING OF COURSE IS HOW UH SOME CASES CAN COME TO TRIAL IN THIRTY DAYS AND OTHERS IT TAKES EIGHTEEN MONTHS .
HELLO .
HELLO .
MY NAME IS NOLA .
I M IN PLANO TEXAS .
HI NOLA I M STEVE .
I M IN DALLAS TEXAS .
NOT TOO FAR AWAY .
NO THAT S UNUSUAL .
SEEMS LIKE USUALLY .
I VE HAD SOME FROM PLANO TOO .
OH YEAH .
I THINK ALL MINE HAVE BEEN EAST COAST PEOPLE SO FAR .
UHHUH .
OKAY .
SO .
UM LET S SEE .
S SOCIAL CHANGES .
SOCIAL CHANGES .
WHAT S THAT MEAN .
THAT SOUNDS LIKE NOT AS RECENT SOCIAL CHANGES TOO LIKE BACK TO THE SIXTIES OR FIFTIES I GUESS .
YEAH .
THINK WE CAN HANDLE THAT .
YEAH .
YEAH I DEFINITELY I MEAN THERE S PLENTY OF THINGS TO TALK ABOUT THERE .
THAT S A .
OKAY UH SHALL I GO AHEAD AND PUSH ONE .
YEAH SURE .
OKAY .
YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND START .
UH I WAS HOPING THAT YOU WOULD BUT OH .
OH .
IN SOCIAL CHANGES IS THAT UH IT SEEMS TO ME THAT UH .
THAT INVOLVES .
DOES THAT .
A LOT OF DIFFERENT .
Y .
AREAS I THINK .
YEAH .
LIKE A LOT IT SEEMS LIKE THE RICH ARE GETTING RICHER AND THE POOR ARE GETTING POORER IS EVEN MORE .
TRUE TODAY .
YOU KNOW .
YEAH THERE IS A .
S .
A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE UH ECONOMIC UM STATUS OF UH PEOPLE ALTHOUGH I THINK THAT HAS BEEN TRUE UH ALWAYS .
UM PERHAPS THERE S LESS OF THE MIDDLE RANGE THEN THERE WAS .
YEAH .
IT .
S LIKE PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO GIVE UP HOPE AND THEY START OUT VERY POOR .
LET S SEE THAT S A BAD TANGENT TO GET ON .
WHAT ELSE HAS CHANGED BETWEEN THE SIXTIES AND THE EIGHTIES .
UH .
AND THE NINETIES .
NO .
I THINK UH M IN MY SITUATION I HAVE THREE CHILDREN AND WE RE UH HOME SCHOOLING .
SO EDUCATION YOU KNOW THINGS .
THAT RELATE T TO EDUCATION UM ARE THINGS THAT I THINK ABOUT A LOT .
UM I THINK THAT AND I THINK THAT INVOLVES SOCIAL CHANGES .
A LOT .
UH FOR INSTANCE I THINK THE SCHOOLS ARE HAVING MORE AND MORE PROBLEMS BECAUSE OF UH THINGS .
THAT ARE HAPPENING SOCIALLY IN THE WORLD AROUND THEM AND IN IN T BECAUSE OF THEIR PARENTS AND THINGS .
THAT ARE BEING TAUGHT IN THE HOME ARE NOT TAUGHT IN THE HOME RATHER .
MORE NOT THAN ARE .
AND CHILDREN BEING PUT IN DAYCARE CENTERS FROM VERY EARLY AND AND I THINK THAT A LOT OF THESE THINGS .
THAT HAVE BEEN HAPPENING SUCH AS THE DAYCARE CENTERS AND THINGS ARE HAVING A BIG EFFECT ON THE SOCIAL CHANGES .
BECAUSE OF THE WAY CHILDREN ARE BEING RAISED THEY RE NOT LEARNING THE VALUES THEY NEED TO LEARN .
YEAH .
AND THEY RE NOT UM TH THEY DO NT HAVE THE SELFESTEEM THAT THEY NEED TO HAVE AND THEY DO NT HAVE THE UM A SOLID FAMILY LIFE THAT THEY NEED TO HAVE TO CONFIDENTLY AND DEAL WITH THE THINGS IN THE WORLD .
AND UH I THINK WE RE SEEING A LOT OF REBELLION AND THINGS BECAUSE OF THAT AND THE THINGS LIKE THE GANG GANG THINGS .
THAT ARE HAPPENING AND AND UM .
YEAH .
IT SEEMS SO THAT YEAH THAT IS A PRETTY BIG CHANGE .
IT SEEMS EVEN NOT JUST SINGLE PARENT FAMILIES BUT WITH NO GUIDANCE BUT IT SEEMS LIKE .
SOME OF THESE EVEN LADIES .
THAT THAT LL WORK AND HAVE .
YEAH .
A BABY AND THEN YOU KNOW AFTER TWO OR THREE MONTHS .
GO BACK TO WORK .
YEAH .
OH IT S .
YOU KNOW WELL THAT THAT I MEAN THAT S VERY YOUNG FOR A BABY .
THAT S REALLY SAD .
I THINK THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE AND THEY THINK THEY HAVE TO BUT .
YEAH .
I I THINK THAT IF THEY REALLY TRIED THEY WOULD NT HAVE TO .
AND .
YEAH .
I I THINK THAT IF THEY DID NT THAT AND IT BECAME MORE OF THE STANDARD NOT TO THAT UH I DO NT KNOW MAYBE COMPANIES WOULD START PAYING MEN MORE SO THAT THEIR WIVES COULD STAY HOME .
YOU .
YEAH .
KNOW .
AND HAVE A MORE SOLID UH FOUNDATION FOR THE KIDS .
YEAH .
I MEAN THEY RE GOING TO LIKE YOU SAID I MEAN THERE S THEY MIGHT BE SAVING MONEY I MEAN EVEN IF THEY HAD TO PAY MORE NOW I MEAN IN THE LONG RUN .
IT S GOING TO COST SOCIETY MORE TO .
THAT S RIGHT .
FORCE TWO PEOPLE TO WORK .
EVEN THOUGH .
IT S ALREADY .
IT .
S HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY IS SHORTTERM .
IT ALREADY COSTS SOCIETY MUCH MORE BECAUSE OF IT .
YOU KNOW IT TRYING TO DO ALL THESE PROGRAMS LIKE HEADSTART AND THINGS LIKE THOSE .
YOU WOULD NT HAVE TO DO THAT IF MOTHERS WOULD STAY HOME WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND DO THINGS WITH THEM YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
UM THERE S AND I THINK UH A LOT OF IT IS SELFISHNESS .
PEOPLE HAVE BECOME VERY SELFISH .
THEY DO NT WANT TO STAY HOME WITH THE KIDS .
Y YEAH .
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
THERE ARE A LOT OF TWO PARENT UM SITUATIONS WHERE THE WOMAN GOES BACK TO WORK BECAUSE THAT S WHAT .
SHE WANTS TO DO YOU KNOW .
OH RATHER THAN SHE NEEDS THE MONEY .
RATHER THAN THAT .
JUST SHE WANTS THE .
SHE HAS TO HAVE THE MONEY PARTICULARLY .
STIMULATING ENVIRONMENT .
OR MAYBE THERE S A SMALL NEED FOR MONEY SO SHE DOES IT PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE MONEY BUT PARTLY FOR HERSELF TOO .
HUH .
IT .
YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
IT S INTERESTING HOW W UH HOME STUDY .
IS THAT WHAT .
YOU SAID .
HOME SCHOOL .
HOME SCHOOL .
YEAH .
IS THAT UH IS IS IT LIKE UH A PRESCHOOL LEVEL THEN OR THROUGH .

GRADE SCHOOL OR .
I I HAVE UH ONE GOING INTO FOURTH GRADE AND ONE STARTING KINDERGARTEN AND THEN A PRESCHOOLER .
OH I S .
AND ONE ON THE WAY .
OH WELL YOU SOUND BUSY .
SO YOU RE TEACHING THEM .
YES .
COMPLETELY .
YES .
HUH .
AND I THINK UH IT S BECOMING UH MORE POPULAR THEN IT HAS BEEN FOR A WHILE I THINK .
HOME SCHOOLING S ALWAYS BEEN AROUND BUT UH I CAN SEE MORE AND MORE FAMILIES GOING TO IT BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS IN THE SCHOOLS .
UM AND A LOT OF IT IS DISCIPLINE PROBLEMS .
YEAH .
A LOT OF IT IS AND YOU CAN TELL WHICH KIDS HAVE BEEN IN DAYCARE CENTERS .
IT IT S REALLY OBVIOUS TO LOOK AT THEM AND WATCH THE WAY .
THEY ACT AND THINGS .
YEAH .
THAT UM THEY VE BEEN RAISED IN A DAYCARE CENTER .
YEAH .
THAT S PRETTY SAD BECAUSE I MEAN I DO NT KNOW SOMETHING .
S GOT TO CHANGE WITH THE SCHOOLS .
THAT S WHAT .
IT .
ALL BOILS DOWN TO IN THE END USUALLY ANYWAY .
WELL I THINK IT S GOING TO .
WHEN THEY RE YOUNG .
CHANGE IN THE HOMES BEFORE ANYTHING .
YEAH .
CHANGES ANYWHERE ELSE .
THE HOME IS THE BASE IT S THE BASIC UNIT .
AND THAT S THE WHERE IT .
ALL STARTS AND IF WE DO NT START MAKING CHANGES IN THE HOMES AND MAYBE PART OF THAT IS EDUCATING PARENTS BETTER .
YEAH .
AND EDUCATING UH YOU KNOW .
CHANGING PEOPLE S EXPECTATIONS .
I KNOW THEY DO DO SOME THEY DO HAVE SOME CLASSES IN UM HIGH SCHOOLS AND THINGS FOR KIDS TO UH GIVE THEM .
AN IDEA OF WHAT FAMILY LIFE IS LIKE AND THE UH YOU KNOW AND UH THAT KIND OF THING BUT UH .
OKAY .
YES .

BUT I I THINK ANIMALS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT IN THE FAMILY I .
I AGREE YES UM DID YOU GET YOURS AS A PET FOR YOUR CHIL DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN .
UH YEAH WE .
UHHUH .
HAVE FIVE .
UHHUH OH WELL I WAS WONDERING IF YOU GOT YOUR DOG ORIGINALLY AS A PET FOR THEM OR JUST BECAUSE YOU D HAD DOGS BEFORE OR .
WELL WE HAVE HAD WE HAD HAD A A DOG BEFORE SHE WAS FIFTEEN WHEN SHE DIED .
MY GOODNESS .
AND UH THIS ONE WE BOUGHT BY ACCIDENT .
UH .
A FARMER CALLED US AND WANTED US TO CALL THE ANIMAL SHELTER TO CO OR THE DOG CATCHER OR SOMEBODY TO COME AND GET THIS PUPPY THAT .
UHHUH .
SOMEBODY PEOPLE DROP THINGS LIKE THAT OFF .
YEAH .
UP THERE .
UHHUH .
AND I SAID GEE SHE SOUNDS LIKE A CUTE LITTLE DOG I TOLD THE KIDS LET S GO LOOK AT HER .
OH YEAH .
GO GET HER SO THAT S HOW WE GOT HER .
IS NT THAT .
QUITE BY ACCIDENT .
YES SO THAT OFTEN HAPPENS THAT WAY WELL WE HAD UM INTENTIONALLY UM PLANNED TO GET A DOG WE HAD JUST MOVED INTO THIS HOUSE AND UM DECIDED TO WAIT ABOUT A YEAR AND THEN WENT .
UHHUH .
THEN WE WENT OUT THEN AND FOUND ONE SHE WAS IN THE LITTER .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND UM SHE WAS SO CUTE BECAUSE ALL THE OTHER LITTLE PUPPIES IN THAT LITTER WERE JUST CRAZY I MEAN THEY WERE ALL OVER THE PLACE .
AND SHE WAS REAL DOCILE AND .
OH .
CAME OVER AND JUST KIND OF SAT NEXT TO US AND I THOUGHT .
OH .
THAT S THE DOG FOR ME .
SHE PICKED US .
YEAH SO SHE AND IT WHAT WAS FUNNY WAS THAT UM OUR DAUGHTER MUST HAVE BEEN LET S SEE SHE MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT EIGHT AT THE TIME I GUESS .
UHHUH .
AND UM SHE JUST LOVED THIS LITTLE DOG .
OH .
TO PIECES BUT I THINK SHE LOVED HER TOO MUCH BECAUSE THE DOG HAS NEVER BEEN REAL COMFORTABLE WITH HER I THINK .
OH .
SHE WAS ALWAYS A LITTLE BIT LEERY OF HER .
UHHUH .
OUR SON ON THE OTHER HAND WHO WAS ABOUT ELEVEN AT THE TIME WAS UM NOT VERY INTERESTED IN PETS BUT AS IT TURNED OUT HE AND THIS DOG HAVE GOTTEN TO BE REALLY GOOD PALS .
OH FOR HEAVEN S SAKE .
SO YOU JUST NEVER KNOW HOW THAT WORKS OUT .
NO BUT THEY SAY IT S REAL IMPORTANT FOR CHILDREN TO HAVE PETS BECAUSE UH WELL THEY CAN GO AND TALK TO THEM ANY TIME .
UHHUH YES .
THEY WANT TO AND TELL THEM ANYTHING THEY WANT TO AND .
YEAH .
NOBODY IS GOING TO YOU KNOW REPRIMAND THEM OR .
THAT S RIGHT .
KNOW THEIR SECRETS OR .
THAT YES THEY RE VERY .
YEAH .
UNJUDGMENTAL .
YES .
OH DEAR .
AND THE NURSING HOMES NOW THEY RE FINDING THAT IT S REAL IMPORTANT TO TAKE A PET INTO A NURSING HOME .
YES I HAVE BEEN I HAVE BEEN READING AND SEEING ABOUT THAT ON TELEVISION .
UHHUH .
UHHUH AND HOW .
OUR ONE OUR ONE NURSING HOME IN MUMBLEX HAS ONE .
UHHUH .
PERMANENT .
IS THAT RIGHT .
HE HE KIND OF HAS FREE RUN OF THE PLACE AND THERE IS SOME OR SOMEBODY TAKES CARE OF HIM .
IS NT THAT AMAZING .
BUT HE GOES OUT MUMBLEX PEOPLE AND REAL NICE DOG UH AND UH .
UHHUH YES IT S FUNNY HOW UM HOW PETS CAN KIND OF UM OH TAKE ON A CERTAIN STATUS IN CERTAIN AREAS .
UHHUH .
I MEAN UM THAT MADE ME THINK OF UH WHEN OUR DAUGHTER WAS LOOKING AT COLLEGES WE VISITED A CAMPUS IN UM SAINT LOUIS AND .
UHHUH .
UM THERE WERE SEVERAL DOGS ON THE CAMPUS AND .
OH REALLY .
AND THE WHAT WAS INTERESTING ABOUT IT WAS THAT THEY WERE VERY FRIENDLY BUT THEY DID NT APPEAR TO BELONG TO ANYONE AND UM .
OH .
I M SURE SOMEONE YOU KNOW FED THEM THEY WERE HEALTHY .
YEAH .
LOOKING DOGS BUT UM OUR GUIDE THAT DAY SAID THAT THE LA ONE WOMAN MANY MANY YEARS AGO HAD GIVEN A HUGE SUM OF MONEY TO TO THE UNIVERSITY ON THE CONDITION THAT THERE BE UM DOGS JUST KIND OF LEFT TO ROAM ARO AROUND THE CAMPUS .
IS THAT RIGHT .
WHICH IS THE STRANGEST THING I HAD EVER HEARD .
YEAH BECAUSE MOST CAMPUSES DO NT ALLOW PETS .
I KNOW .
YOU KNOW THEY JUST DO NOT ALLOW THEM .
YES I KNOW .
THAT S THAT S KIND OF GREAT .
YES IT REALLY WAS IT WAS JUST A NICE TOUCH .
YEAH .
AND IT KIND OF MADE IT SEEM MORE HOMEY TOO .
YES YEAH .
BUT UM TH I THOUGHT THAT WAS MOST UNIQUE AND IT JUST YOU KNOW KIND OF GOES ALONG WITH WHAT YOU WERE SAYING .
UHHUH .
ABOUT THE DOG HAVING SORT OF FREE RUN OF THE THE NURSING HOME .
UHHUH .
SO UM BUT UH I THIS IS THE ONLY PET WE VE HAD SIN .
UM .
YOU KNOW IN ALL OUR YEARS OF MARRIAGE UM AND IT S BEEN UH SORT OF A A CHANGE FOR MY HUSBAND BECAUSE AS A A A BOY GROWING UP HIS FATHER HAD DOGS BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS HUNTING DOGS .
OH UHHUH .
AND SO THEY WERE NEVER ALLOWED IN THE HOUSE YOU KNOW .
UHHUH UHHUH .
THEY WERE ALWAYS KIND OF .
YEAH WE VE RUINED THEM .
YEAH RIGHT THAT S WHAT HE SAID .
THEY SAY MUMBLEX RUINED THEM .
YES .
MUMBLEX .
SO HAVING A PET WAS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FOR HIM .
WELL WE VE HAD A LOT OF DIFFERENT PETS WE HAD THE KIDS HAD RABBITS FOR PETS .
UHHUH .
AND WE ALSO RAISED THEM FOR FOOD .
YEAH .

AND SINCE THEY VE MOVED TO WHERE THEY ARE THEY LET THE CAT OUT .
UHHUH .
AND IT HAS IMPROVED THE PERSONALITY .
AND I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT WE JUST MOVED TO PLANO RECENTLY AND THAT I HAD NT VOTED IN AN ELECTION YET AND ALTHOUGH I DID GO DOWN AND REGISTER AND I THAT S THE FIRST TIME I VE EVER DONE THAT HAS WHAT S BEEN YOUR VOTING EXPERIENCE .
MY VOTING EXPERIENCE .
WELL DO YOU FEEL LIKE UH I MEAN I .
I I WELL PERSONALLY I VE BEEN VERY DILIGENT .
UHHUH .
UNTIL RECENT YEARS .
UHHUH .
WHEN I FELT MY VOTE WAS ABSOLUTELY KIND OF WASHED DOWN THE DRAIN .
YES .
FOR THE ISSUES THAT YOU KNOW THAT I FELT REALLY STRONG FOR UH I THINK APATHY HAS SET IN TO A LOT OF PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE OF THE WAY OUR POLITICIANS ARE AND THE WAY OUR COUNTRY IS BEING RUN .
THAT S REALLY TRUE THAT S KIND OF THE WAY I HAVE FELT I I ALSO FEEL GUILTY UH NOT KNOWING AND NOT GOING THE EXTRA MILE MYSELF AND STUDYING OUT THE ISSUES AND STUDYING OUT THE CANDIDATES COURSE WE ONLY HAVE MOSTLY THE REPRESENTATION GIVEN IN THE MEDIA BUT UH I HAVE FELT SINCE I VE BEEN HERE THAT I HAVE NT KNOWN WHAT THE ISSUES WERE AND THAT I BECAUSE IT WAS A NEW COMMUNITY .
YOU REALLY DO HAVE TO STUDY TO GET YOURSELF UH UP TO PAR WITH WHAT IS TRULY GOING ON .
UHHUH .
AND THAT TAKES A LOT OF RESEARCH AND .
IT DOES .
AND PEOPLE TODAY ARE VERY BUSY AND .
YES .
UH AND THAT IS AN EXCUSE BECAUSE WE ARE WE ARE ALWAYS UH INVO I KNOW I M HEAVILY INVOLVED IN OTHER THINGS .
UHHUH .
AND AND TO TAKE TIME OUT AND UH STUDY THE ISSUES IN DEPTH WOULD TAKE QUITE A BIT OF TIME .
UHHUH .
AND I DO NT HAVE THE TIME TO DEVOTE TO THAT .
NO .
AND UH YOU HOPEFULLY FIND THAT YOU WANT THE CANDIDATES THAT ARE RUNNING TO BE HONEST AND ABOVEBOARD .
UHHUH .
AND UNFORTUNATELY THEY ARE NOT .
NO .
AND UH IT S REALLY A DILEMMA UH THAT WE FIND OURSELVES IN I BELIEVE UH .
RIGHT .
SO I KIND OF JUST HAVE TAKEN A BACK STEP AWAY AND UH HOPEFULLY THAT SOMEONE WILL CLEAN UP THE MESS THAT S THERE .
UHHUH .
TAKE IT BECAUSE IT IS A TASK THAT IS TO ME KIND OF OVERWHELMING .
YES AND UH AND UH I ALSO FEEL ESPECIALLY IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS THAT UH SINCE WE RE S BACK ON THE OLD SYSTEM OF ELECTORAL VOTES AND OR THAT AND THAT YOU DO NT NECESSARILY YOUR VOTE DOES NT NECESSARILY ELECT PRESIDENT .
RIGHT THEY JUST WANT TO SEE HOW CLOSE THE ELECTORAL VOTES ARE WITH THE PUBLIC VOTES .
RIGHT AND IT S .
YEAH .
KIND OF IT S AWFUL AND AND IT S HARD TO FEEL LIKE ONE PERSON BUT I KNOW THAT IT S IMPORTANT AND I FEEL GUILTY THAT I HAVE NT DONE THAT HERE HAVE NT TAKEN THE TIME AND I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE BUT IT S HARD TO TO FACE THE CORRUPTION LIKE YOU SAY AND UH AND TO KNOW WHAT YOU RE UP AGAINST AND IT MAKES ME FEEL BAD THAT I M GLAD I MEAN I AM THANKFUL FOR THE UH NINETEENTH AMENDMENT IS IT THAT GIVES WOMEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE AND UH .
I M GLAD THAT THAT .
YES .
HAPPENED AND EVERYTHING AND I HOPE THAT I WILL BECOME A BETTER MAKE A BETTER DIFFERENCE IN BUT I HAVE NT DONE THAT SO FAR .
WELL I KNOW THAT WHEN YOU RE IN A SMALLER COMMUNITY I LIVE IN MESQUITE .
UHHUH .
AND UH WHEN WE HAVE UH A LOCAL ELECTION SAY FOR OUR MAYOR AND SO FORTH .
UHHUH .
THEY REALLY UH GIVE A LOT OF INFORMATION IN THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER NOT IN THE NOT IN THE BIGGER CITY DALLAS NEWSPAPER I MEAN THEY THEY JUST GIVE IT A SMALL PORTION OF THE NEWSPAPER BUT THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER REALLY GOES INTO UH QUITE A BIT OF HISTORY ABOUT THE CANDIDATE .
UHHUH .
AND UH AND THEN THEY HAVE THEY RAISE A THEY RAISE TWO SIDES AND UH THERE S A PRO AND A CON SIDE .
UHHUH .
AND UH YOU CAN REALLY UH FEEL COMFORTABLE IN UH EVALUATING THAT UH CANDIDATE BY UH THAT METHOD .
UHHUH .
UH I FEEL PRETTY CONFIDENT ABOUT THE WAY IT S PUT FORTH NOW I WOULD NT SAY THAT ABOUT THE LARGER CITIES .
UHHUH .
THOUGH AND THE AND THE COUNTRY ON LIKE THE PRESIDENTIAL .
RIGHT .
UH I MEAN THEY VE GOT PEOPLE THAT ARE RUNNING THAT ARE ADMITTED UH CRIMINALS AND ADMITTED .
RIGHT .
CROOKS .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW I M SORRY BUT I DO NT BELIEVE IN THEM TURNING A GOOD UH UH A NEW LEAF .
UHHUH .
UNLESS THEY HAVE THE LORD THAT HAS DONE THAT TO THEM .
RIGHT .
AND UH WITHOUT THE LORD THEY CA NT DO IT .
YEAH AND IT S NOT VERY LIKELY I MEAN IT SEEMS LIKE TH .
SO UTAH .
YES .
THAT THAT S THAT S THE STATE THAT GOT WAS FAMOUS WHEN THEY EXECUTED SOMEBODY .
GARY GILMORE .
GARY GILMORE .
YEAH .
BY FIRING SQUAD AS I RECALL .
THAT S RIGHT AND WE STILL HAVE A DEATH PENALTY .
UHHUH .
SOME A GENTLEMAN UH THAT WAS ONE OF THE HIFI MURDERERS JUST HAD HIS CONVICTION OVERTURNED WELL APPEALED AGAIN I GUESS WE HAVE THE LONGEST UH RUNNING INMATES FOR DEATH ROW TOO .
UHHUH .
AND THEN WE HAD ANOTHER GUY UH RONALD LAFFERTY THAT THOUGHT GOD TOLD HIM TO KILL HIS SISTERINLAW .
YEAH .
HE JUST GOT A A NEW TRIAL BECAUSE .
THE JUDGE FELT THAT HE WAS INCOMPETENT .
UHHUH .
UH HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE DEATH PENALTY .
WELL I YO YOU KNOW UNTIL RECENTLY I VE BEEN SORT OF COULD GO EITHER WAY YOU KNOW IT IT SORT OF DOES NT MUCH YOU KNOW IT DID NT IT WAS NT A STRONG ISSUE UM I GUESS IT STILL IS NT A STRONG ISSUE BUT I MUST SAY I FIND IT VERY SILLY THE WAY POLITICIANS ARE RUNNING AROUND CREATING MORE AND MORE CAPITAL CRIMES UM .
OH .
INSTEAD OF DEALING WITH RE YOU KNOW THE REAL PROBLEMS THAT YOU KNOW THAT THEY RE THEY RE GETTING VOTES PRESUMABLY BY UM I ASSUME THEY RE DOING IT FOR THAT REASON .
WELL I M SURE THAT S MUMBLEX .
BY BY BY SAYING WELL THIS DOING TH THIS PARTICULAR CRIME IN THIS PARTICULAR WAY IS A CAPITAL CRIME NOW .
WELL I KIND OF A AGREE WITH TERRORISM I THINK THOSE GUYS SHOULD BE DONE AWAY WITH THAT S ONE OF THE WORST .
CRIMES IN MY BOOK AND UH DRUG DEALING UM .
THAT S CLOSE BUT UH .
TERRORISM DEFINITELY AND .
UHHUH .
UH SELLING OUT YOUR COUNTRY .
IT S NOT IT S NOT ENOUGH JUST TO LOCK THEM UP FOREVER .
UH NO IT S GOT TO BE SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO COST THEM BECAUSE WE NEVER LOCK ANYBODY UP FOREVER .
NOT OFTEN .
NOT VERY OFTEN AT ALL WE VE GOT THESE GUYS IN NEW YORK THAT UH I M SURE YOU HEARD ABOUT THE ONES THAT KILLED UH THE GENTLEMAN THAT CAME FROM UTAH TO WATCH THE TENNIS .
YEAH .
PEOPLE .
YEAH .
AND I GUESS THEY GOT CONVICTED THE FOUR OF .
UHHUH .
UH MURDER .
RIGHT .
SO YOU VE COME TO A DEFINITE OPINION ON IT NOW .
WELL I I VE IT IT SEEMS LIKE IT S GONE GOTTEN CARRIED AWAY UM AND I I DO FIND IT HARD TO DR KNOW WHERE TO DRAW A LINE AND SO IF I HAD TO DRAW A LINE I D SAY JUST NO CAPITAL PUNISHMENT I MEAN I DO NT I DO NT I DO NT SEE THAT IT ACCOMPLISHES A WHOLE LOT WHEREAS I DO THINK THAT CONVICTING PEOPLE AND AND INCARCERATING THEM FOR A LONG TIME IF THAT COULD BE IMPROVED UPON THAT WOULD HAVE MORE IMPACT I THINK .
YEAH YOU KIND OF HATE TO .
NO WH WHAT ABOUT THE ARGUMENT WHERE WHERE SOMEBODY WHO IS COMMITTING ONE CAPITAL CRIME CHOOSES TO COMMIT A A MORE SERIOUS CAPITAL CRIME I MEAN MURDER UM BECAUSE THAT ONE AT LEAST YOU MIGHT ESCAPE FROM BECAUSE HIS VICTIM YOU KNOW HIS WITNESSES WILL BE GONE DOES NT THIS DOES NT THIS ENCOURAGE .
YOU MEAN .
UH .
UH VIOLENCE .
MORE MUMBLEX DOES NT THIS YEAH I MEAN DOES NT THIS ENCOURAGE MURDER IN ORDER TO WIPE OUT THE .
THE WITNESSES .
THE WITNESSES .
WELL MAYBE IT WOULD UH I KIND OF HAVE A PROBLEM WITH OUR LEGAL SYSTEM AT THE MOMENT UH AS IT IS I THINK THAT PEOPLE WHO UH INFRINGE ON OTHER PEOPLE S RIGHTS UH AND SCREW UP THEIR WHOLE LIVES WITH RAPE UH CHILD MOLESTING UH TERRORISM JUST UH .
YEAH .
THERE S JUST LIKE FIVE THINGS THAT I THINK THEY OUGHT TO BE SNUFFED FOR BUT I M I M FOR IT FOR CERTAIN REASONS .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK THAT THINGS LIKE RAPE UH YOU CA NT GET OVER UH IT TAKES A LIFETIME .
I SEE SO SO IF IF WILLIAM KENNEDY SMITH HAD BEEN FOUND GUILTY YOU BELIEVE HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN UH EXECUTED .
UH IF IT WAS .
A SIX PERSON JURY COULD HAVE DECIDED EITHER WAY OF COURSE .
YEAH IF IT WAS IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO BE A PATTERN YOU KNOW WE HAVE PLENTY OF CONVICTED GUYS THAT GO INTO JAIL AND COME BACK OUT DO THE SAME THING AND GO BACK AND UH IF THEY RE HABITUAL LIKE THREE TIMES CAUGHT FOR RAPE OR CHILD MOLESTING .
UHHUH .
THEN SNUFF THEM .
WELL THE MUMBLEX PROBLEM IS THAT THEY VE JUST BEEN LET OUT OF JAIL .
PARDON .
THE PROBLEM THERE IS THAT THEY VE BEEN LET OUT JAIL IF THEY VE BEEN THRICE CONVICTED THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN KEPT IN LONGER .
YEAH BUT WE DO NT SEEM TO KEEP THEM LONG ENOUGH AND THEN THEY LEARN SUCH BAD THINGS IN JAIL THAT IS NT .
YEAH WELL .
A PLACE OF REHABILITATION .
YEAH THAT S THAT S FOR SURE .
YEAH IT S A TOUGH QUESTION IS NT IT ON WHETHER AT WHAT POINT DO THEY BECOME SO DETRIMENTAL TO SOCIETY THAT SOCIETY CA NT AFFORD TO KEEP THEM AROUND TO .
UHHUH .
KEEP GIVING THEM CHANCES .
YEAH .
UH LET S SEE SO THE OTHER QUESTION THAT THEY WANTED WAS WHETHER THE PLACE THAT WE LIVE IN UH COMPARES TO HOW WE FEEL WHAT S THE LAWS THERE IN D C .
WELL ARE YOU IN THE MARKET FOR A NEW CAR .
UH WELL YEAH I AM AS A MATTER OF FACT WELL ACT ACTUALLY I M LOOKING FOR ANOTHER CAR BUT UH UH NEW PROBABLY NOT .
OH WHAT SORT OF REQUIREMENTS TO YOU HAVE FOR YOUR CAR .
UH SPORTS CAR .
UHHUH .
UH USUALLY EITHER BLACK OR RED .

NOW .
TOP OF TOP OF THE LINE .
WELL NOT SO MUCH THAT AS IT IS I VE HAD SO MANY TIMES WHEN UH UH YOU KNOW I LL HAVE A FRIEND NEXT TO ME OR I SEE SOMEBODY UH GUY BROKEN DOWN ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND TRY TO LEAN OVER AND ROLL DOWN THE WINDOW .
OH .
IT IS JUST A REAL PAIN OR YOU KNOW IF I M DRIVING ALONG AND THERE S SOMEBODY NEXT TO ME AND UH SOMEBODY THAT I KNOW AND YOU TRY TO TALK TO THEM .
UHHUH .
IT S REAL DIFFICULT TO DRIVE REACH OVER AND TRY TO ROLL DOWN THE WINDOW .
RIGHT RIGHT .
AND UH SO POWER LOCKS POWER WINDOWS ARE JUST JUST THINGS THAT UH JUST REALLY HELP A LOT .
UHHUH UHHUH .
WHAT ABOUT YOU .
WELL I GUESS I M UH MORE TRADITIONAL IN THAT I DO NT LIKE P POWER WINDOWS OR POWER LOCKS .
BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT I KNOW H WHO HAVE THEM ALWAYS SEEM TO HAVE TROUBLE WITH THEM .
OH .
AND UH SO I DO NT I JUST DO NT LIKE ANYTHING THAT I CA NT FIGURE OUT WHY IT DOES NT WORK .
SURE .
AND THEN I WANT YOU KNOW GOOD UH GAS MILEAGE AND I WANT AN AIR BAG AND UH I GUESS .
HAVE YOU EVER HAD A CAR WITH AN AIR BAG .
NO I HAVE NT HAVE YOU .
NO .
SOMEHOW I JUST THINK YOU KNOW I LIKE THE IDEA .
WELL IT IT SEE SURE SEEMS TO SAVE LIVES AND .
RIGHT .
UH YEAH I ACTUALLY I LIKE THE ANTILOCK BRAKES .
RIGHT THAT S A GOOD IDEA .
AND I HAVE NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO I HAVE BEEN IN CARS THAT HAVE HAD THEM BUT I VE NEVER TROMPED ON THE BRAKES TO SEE UH YOU KNOW ON ICE OR WATER JUST TO SEE IF THEY DID NT LOCK UP .
UHHUH UHHUH .
BUT UH YOU THINK YOU D BUY UH AN AMERICAN CAR OR A EUROPEAN OR JAPANESE .
WELL I ACTUALLY I DO NT KNOW A LOT ABOUT DIFFERENT BRANDS I TEND TO HAVE YOU KNOW MY REQUIREMENTS LIKE THE LAST TIME I BOUGHT A CAR I I GUESS I DID SORT OF PREFER AMERICAN AND MY REQUIREMENTS WERE BASICALLY YOU KNOW GOOD REPAIR RECORD GOOD MILEAGE UH AND I NEEDED AIRCONDITIONING AND UH CA NT REMEMBER WHAT MY OH I WANTED S UH STICK SHIFT AND SO I DID NT HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF CHOICE THERE WAS ONE CAR IN ALL OF THE THE METROPOLITAN AREA THAT I COULD FIND THAT YOU KNOW WAS SORT OF A MEDIUM PRICED CAR WITH A STICK SHIFT IN IT .
WHAT WAS THAT .
IT IT TURNED OUT TO BE A A CHRYSLER UH LANCER .
HUH STICK SHIFT HUH .
YEAH .
DID IT HAVE WHAT A THREE SPEED OR A FOUR SPEED .
NO A FIVE SPEED AND IT BASICALLY IT WAS SOMETHING THAT A MILITARY GUY HAD ORDERED AND HAD NT PICKED UP AND SO IT HAD BEEN ON THE LOT THREE MONTHS AND THEY WERE REALLY EAGER TO SELL IT .
WOW .
SO I GUESS IN THIS AREA AT LEAST YOU KNOW IF IT S NOT AUTOMATIC IT DOES NT MOVE .
WELL ACTUALLY I MUCH PREFER A STICK SHIFT AND WHAT I M I M CURIOUS I I KNOW WHY I LOVE A STICK SHIFT WHY D WHY DID YOU WANT ONE .
WELL I JUST WANTED IT BECAUSE AGAIN I HAD I GUESS TRADITIONALLY ALWAYS HAD A CAR THAT HAD ONE AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE MORE RELIABLE .
UHHUH .
UH .
IT S HARD TO FIND STICK SHIFT CARS ANYMORE .
I FOUND THAT OUT .
I MEAN YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE WOULD JUST SORT OF LOOK AT ME LIKE YOU MUST BE CRAZY WHEN I .
WENT IN TO AND ASKED AND THAT WAS A REQUIREMENT SO .
HUH YEAH .
SO .
NO I MEAN MOST OF THE SPORTS CARS ARE STICK SHIFT .
WELL I M NOT EVEN SURE ALL OF THEM ARE ANYMORE AT LEAST IN THIS AREA .
HUH .
NOT THAT I WAS LOOKING FOR SPORTS CARS BUT NOW THE PEOPLE I VE TALKED TO DO NT SEEM TO HAVE STICK SHIFT .
HUH .
AND SO WHY DO YOU LIKE STICK SHIFT .
UH I GUESS I I GREW UP ON IT AND IT S FUN IT S IT S AN ENJOYABLE PART OF DRIVING I DO FEEL LIKE I HAVE UH MORE CONTROL .
UHHUH .
OVER THE CAR AND IT IT TO ME IT GIVES ME MORE A LOT MORE CONTROL IN SNOW AND ICE .
UHHUH .
AND SLICK CONDITIONS .
RIGHT .
UH IT I IT DOES UH I DO NT KNOW IT IT S REALLY MORE FUN THAN ANYTHING ELSE AS LONG AS YOU RE NOT STUCK IN HEAVY TRAFFIC IT S FUN .
RIGHT AND ACTUALLY IT S PROBABLY SAFER ON YOU KNOW AT LONG TRIPS BECAUSE IT KEEPS YOU MORE ACTIVE .

MUMBLEX .
I HATE TO SAY IT BUT I HATE DALLAS .
THAT S OKAY .
WELL I YOU KNOW I I WAS NEVER REALLY A BIG DALLAS FAN .
YEAH .
UNTIL WE MOVED HERE AND THEY JUST KIND OF GREW ON ME .
YEAH I IMAGINE .
THAT S THE WAY I VE NEVER BEEN A BIG SAINTS FAN UNTIL THE LAST YEAR OR TWO AND THEY THEY VE ACTUALLY STARTED DOING SOMETHING .
YEAH .
YEAH .
SO I VE ACTUALLY PL PAID ATTENTION TO THEM .
WELL .
WELL DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE EXPANSION TEAMS THEY RE THINKING ABOUT BRINGING IN .
TO TELL YOU .
THE TRUTH .
I HAVE NT PAID TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO THAT .
REALLY .
UM WHAT CITIES ARE THEY LOOKING AT .
UH RIGHT NOW I THINK THIS MEMPHIS THEY RE THEY RE TRYING TO GET THE TEAMS .
UHHUH .
AND THAT S THAT S WHERE I WAS WHEN I SAW UH .
UHHUH .
HOUSTON PLAY .
SAINT LOUIS IS TRYING TO GET A TEAM .
UH BALTIMORE IS TRYING TO GET A TEAM AND THERE S SOME OTHER CITY .
I M WANTING TO SAY RALEIGH DURHAM BUT I M NOT SURE .
YOU KNOW I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT .
I THINK IT IS RALEIGH .
THINK SO .
I THINK I REMEMBER HEARING THAT .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE I KNOW THEY VE GOT A MUMBLEX FOOTBALL TEAM BUT I THINK IT MIGHT BE THEM .
THAT WOULD BE FUN .
I D LIKE TO SEE SOME MORE TEAMS GET IN .
I WOULD DEFINITELY .
I THINK THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO PUT TWO IN BY EITHER NEXT YEAR OR THE YEAR AFTER .
AND RIGHT NOW I THINK MEMPHIS AND IT S MEMPHIS AND I THINK BALTIMORE HAVE A REALLY GOOD SHOT AT IT .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE I KNOW SAINT LOUIS IS MUCH BIGGER THAN MEMPHIS AND WHEN I WENT UP THERE .
THEY WERE SAYING THAT MEMPHIS SOLD MORE TICKETS THAN SAINT LOUIS DID .
OH REALLY .
YEAH .
IT .
S LIKE THE LIBERTY BOWL OR LIBERTY STADIUM IN MEMPHIS HOLDS ABOUT SIXTYTWO .
OKAY .
SO WHAT DO YOU UH THINK IS THE UH THE WORST CULPRIT FOR AIR POLLUTION .
WELL I THINK IT S IT S PROBABLY A COMBINATION OF THINGS .
UM FACTORIES .
THAT THAT BURN COAL AS A AN ENERGY SOURCE WITH SULFUR AND NITROGEN CONTAMINANTS YOU KNOW AND YOU GET SULFUR OXIDES AND NITROGEN OXIDES .
UHHUH .
UH THOSE ARE THE ONES I THINK PRIMARILY CONTRIBUTE TO ACID RAIN AND I THINK THAT S THAT S PROBABLY HURTING US .
A LITTLE BIT .
IT S HURTING YOU KNOW IT S HURTING GERMANY FOR EXAMPLE TOO AND SOME OTHER PARTS OF EUROPE WHERE THEY WHERE THEY HAVE HIGH INDUSTRY .
SO WE RE NOT THE LONE RANGER HERE .
YEAH .
I UH I IT S HARD TO PUT THE FINGER ON UH WHAT S WORSE YOU KNOW THE ACID RAIN SITUATION OR THE OZONE DEPLETION UM WITH UH YOUR HYDROCARBONS UH .
YEAH .
CAUSING THE DAMAGE IN WHICH .
HOPEFULLY WE RE BACKING OFF FROM THAT A LITTLE BIT BUT I KNOW WE HAVE NT CURED IT YET BY A LONG SHOT .
WELL I NOTICE ON ONE OF THESE UH HOME SHOPPING NETWORKS THEY WERE SELLING THESE UH HALOGEN UH FIRE EXTINGUISHERS .
YEAH .
AND THE HALOGEN IS UH AN OZONE DEPLETER AND IT GOT HYDROCARBONS IN THERE .
IT S A VERY CLEAN UH FIRE EXTINGUISHER BUT IT S YOU KNOW REALLY BAD ON THE ENVIRONMENT .
YEAH .
HUH .
YEAH I GUESS I MISSED THAT ONE .
UH .
YEAH .
AUTOMOBILES OF COURSE ARE CONTRIBUTING TOO AND YOU KNOW HOW HOW WE ARE WITH OUR LOVE AFFAIR WITH THE AUTO .
YEAH .
KIND OF HARD TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT THAT I GUESS .
I KNOW UH IN THE TWIN CITIES AREA I JUST MOVED OUT OF THERE AND WAS KIND OF HAPPY I TIMED IT JUST RIGHT BUT THEY HAD A NEW POLICY WHERE IN ORDER TO GET YOUR UH YOUR LICENSE UH YOUR CAR LICENSE UH RENEWED YOU HAD TO MEET THE POLLUTION STANDARDS .
YEAH .
AND UH .
WE HAVE THAT HERE TOO BUT IT S PART OF THE INSPECTION STICKER YOU KNOW THEY PUT A PROBE IN YOUR EXHAUST PIPE AND AND THE COMPUTER READS WHATEVER .
THE IONIZATION IS COMING OUT AND .
YEAH .
SO THAT S YOU KNOW THAT S THE WAY .
THEY RE DEALING WITH IT HERE .
YEAH UH YEAH I GUESS THAT WAS JUST MAINLY IN THE CITIES THERE AND AS FAR AS WHERE I LIVE I DO NT HAVE TO DO THAT BUT .
YEAH .
I HAVE AN OLD CAR .
WHICH .
I DOUBT WOULD UH WOULD UH PASS THE INSPECTION A SEVENTYSIX AND UH YOU KNOW THERE S NO WAY .
I WOULD PUT IN A LOT OF MONEY TO TO REPAIR IT .
YEAH .
TO MEET STANDARDS .
IT D PROBABLY BE DIFFICULT ANYWAY .
YEAH .
SO ALTHOUGH I DO WHAT .
I CAN TO TO CUT DOWN POLLUTION BUT UH .
I WAS JUST READING AN ARTICLE IN UH MOTHER EARTH NEWS MOTHER EARTH NEWS MAGAZINE .

WELL YEAH YEAH IT S UH SO I KEEP HOPING THE RANGERS ARE GOING TO DO .
YEAH ONE ONE YEAR .
THEY MAYBE THEY LL MAKE IT I DO NT KNOW .
RIGHT .
SO BUT UH YEAH I LIKE SPORTS PROGRAMMING QUITE A BIT BUT UH I GUESS MY MY FAVORITE SHOWS ARE THE AND YOU KNOW THAT GETTING BACK TO THE POINT THAT YOU MADE THAT S REALLY TRUE WE WERE WATCHING ROSEANNE I GUESS COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AND HER DAUGHTER WAS TALKING ABOUT BIRTH CONTROL YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
AND MY DAUGHTER WAS KIND OF WALKING IN DURING THAT TIME AND YOU KNOW SHE S ONLY SEVEN YEARS OLD SO .
WELL IT S SO MANY OF THEM NOW UM YOU KNOW IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE TO STICK THAT STUFF IN AND .

AND I HAVE ADULT TASTES NOW BUT I DO NT NEED THAT .
YEAH YEAH .
UH I I LIKE THINGS .
THAT UH ARE ARE WHOLESOME I GUESS .
YEAH WELL THAT THAT SEEMS TO BE MORE OUR VALUES TOO LIKE THE WONDER YEARS I I MEAN IT S KIND OF RISQUE STUFF FOR MAYBE FOR TEENAGERS YOU KNOW OR AND YOU CAN KIND OF RELATE TO IT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW I DO NT KNOW THAT S I ENJOY THAT A LOT .
YES YES .
BUT UH YOU KNOW I AGREE WITH YOU THE AND IT S FUNNY BECAUSE THE SHOWS LIKE A LOT OF THEM THAT USED TO BE CONSIDERED RISQUE LIKE THREE S COMPANY AND STUFF I THINK THEY THEY MAINTAINED PEOPLE WOULD WATCH THEM BECAUSE THERE WAS THAT UH YOU KNOW THERE WAS REALLY THE PERIOD .
THAT WAS GOING ON THERE I MEAN HE REALLY WAS NT MESSING AROUND WITH THE GIRLS BUT EVERYBODY PERCEIVED HIM .
THAT WAY AND STUFF .
UHHUH .
BUT AS SOON AS YOU KNOW HE WENT TO MOVE IN WITH ANOTHER GIRL THE SHOW JUST DIED .
YEAH .
AND IT S IT S INTERESTING THAT A LOT OF THE SHOWS ARE THAT WAY .
OKAY AS FAR AS UH UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE .
UHHUH .
UM I GUESS I M ALL FOR IT I THINK IT S TIME THAT WE START LOOKING AT UH GETTING INTO THAT UM HEALTH COST HAS CONTINUED TO RISE AND I THINK UH THERE S PEOPLE THAT TO ME IT S THE FUNDAMENTAL UH .
LIFE OF A PERSON UH IT DOES NT MATTER IF YOU HAVE MONEY OR NO MONE OR ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD UM YOU WOULD .
YOU SHOULD STILL BE .
EVERYBODY SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE SURGERIES THAT WILL SAVE THEIR LIVES OR THINGS THAT WILL MAKE THEIR LIFE MORE COMFORTABLE VERSES THAN JUST THE RICH PEOPLE THAT CAN AFFORD TO PAY OR TO WORK FOR CORPORATIONS THAT HAVE WONDERFUL HEALTH BENEFITS UM I THINK IF UH THEY LOOKED AT IT AS A WAY OF BUSINESS HELPING OUT FINANCIALLY FOR UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE AND UH INDIVIDUALS UM HELPING OUT IN SOME SORT OF WAY WHETHER IT BE TAXES OR SOME HOW BUT UH THE EXPENSES RIGHT NOW FOR HEALTH CARE UM ARE JUST UNREAL .
WELL THEY REALLY ARE EVEN FOR EVEN WHEN YOU RE NOT TALKING ABOUT SURGERY IF YOU RE JUST TALKING ABOUT BASIC CARE WE VE .
YES .
WE VE GOT FOUR CHILDREN AND YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
IN THE PAST MONTH .
OH SURE .
THEY IT JUST THEY PASS THINGS FROM ONE TO ONE AND IT JUST CAN DEVASTATE .
AND YOUR CONSTANTLY .
YOUR BUDGET YOU KNOW .
EXACTLY .
UM .
YEAH THE ONLY I I KNOW THAT UM UH I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE UH EUROPEAN UH UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE AND THERE S SOME PROS AND CONS ONE OF THE THINGS OF COURSE IS EVERYBODY GETS HEALTH CARE BUT UH SOMETIMES HEALTH CARE UH WHEN YOU GET INTO A UNIVERSAL SYSTEM LACKS IN UH WHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED UH HOW CAN I SAY IT UM OVER LIKE IN POLAND UH WHERE MY FATHERINLAW LIVED FOR YEARS THERE THEIR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IS UM BECAUSE NO FINANCIAL GAINS ARE AVAILABLE FOR DOCTORS UH THEY MAY JUST GO INTO BEING A DOCTOR JUST CLEARLY JUST TO BE A DOCTOR FOR THE FULL REASON BUT MOST PEOPLE THAT GO IN TO BEING A PHYSICIAN HERE IN THE U S DO IT FOR FINANCIAL GAIN .
YEAH .
THEY SAY WELL JEEZ IF I GET INTO THIS AREA OF DERMATOLOGY I DO NT HAVE TO DO THIS I CAN DO THIS AND I CAN YOU KNOW .
CAN STILL MAKE BIG BUCKS .
YEAH OR PLASTIC SURGERY OR UH IF I BECOME A UH HEART SPECIALIST I M GOING TO MAKE THIS KIND OF MONEY UH AND THERE S YOU KNOW FINANCIAL GAINS TOWARD THAT AND IN A UNIVERSAL SYSTEM I DO NT THINK THERE IS A FINANCIAL GAIN FOR THE DOCTORS .
DO YOU THINK THAT THE QUALITY UM .
THE QUALITY .
IT WOULD .
I THINK .
WOULD BE AS HIGH .
GOES DOWN UHHUH .
YEAH .
WHEN YOU HAVE A UNIVERSAL SYSTEM .
YEAH .
UM THE ONLY WAY THEY COULD DO THAT IS BY HAVING A REAL GOOD QUALITY CHECK UM AND ALSO OFFERING SOME KIND OF BECAUSE I THINK UH ALL PHYSICIANS WELL ANYBODY UM LIKES THE ABILITY TO KIND OF UH GET THEMSELVES FINANCIALLY UH SITUATED UH I GUESS THAT S THE WHOLE U S CONCEPT .
RIGHT .
IS TO COME HERE AND .
MORE MOTIVATION .
YEAH AND I DO NT KNOW IF YOU CAN HAVE THAT WITH A UNIVERSAL SYSTEM MAYBE YOU KNOW THERE S A WAY OF WORKING THAT OUT BUT I KNOW THAT IN POLAND IN PARTICULAR THE DOCTORS JUST GO TO DO THEIR JOB AND THAT S IT THAT S WHAT THEY LOOK AT IT AS .
YEAH .
THERE S NO UH AND THAT S SAD BECAUSE IF THAT S THE CASE IF DOCTORS ARE NT GOING IN TO BE DOCTORS TO HELP PEOPLE THEN MAYBE THEY SHOULD NT BE IN THAT AREA ANYWAY .
RIGHT .
BUT .
YEAH .
THAT MIGHT BE ONE WAY OF WEEDING OUT THOSE THAT ARE GREEDY FOR THE MONEY AND THOSE THAT REALLY WANT TO HELP MANKIND .
THAT S TRUE YEAH .
SO .
I UH .
BUT I I THINK WE HAVE TO HEAD TOWARD THAT WAY .
WELL WE RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING BECAUSE THERE S JUST TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY THAT ARE UNINSURED .
UHHUH .
AND AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN NOT I MEAN IT S JUST .
I M WORRIED WHEN I GET OLDER .
OH SURE .
YOU KNOW AND UH LET S SAY FOR INSTANCE YOU UH GET FIRED OR NOT FIRED BUT MAYBE LAID OFF FROM YOUR JOB YOU NO LONGER HAVE INSURANCE .
RIGHT .
I MEAN AND YOU RE SIXTY SOME OR .
UHHUH .
FIFTY SOME YEARS OLD YOU TRY TRY TO FIND INSURANCE .
OH YEAH .
I MEAN Y YOU RE UNINSURABLE .
THAT S RIGHT .
UNLESS YOU WANT TO PAY FIVE HUNDRED SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH AND I KNOW PEOPLE THAT ARE PAYING TWO HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH FOR INSURANCE .
YEAH .
AND HOW THEY CAN DO IT I HAVE NO IDEA UM I KNOW WORKING FOR SMALL CORPORATIONS AND HEALTH INSURANCE UM MYSELF UM IT WOULD COST FOR A FAMILY AND THIS WAS BACK THREE FOUR YEARS AGO TO PUT MY ENTIRE FAMILY UP AND THIS WAS WORKING FOR LIKE A MED CENTER UH HEALTH PLAN UM IT WAS LIKE EIGHTY DOLLARS OUT OF MY PAYCHECK .
YEAH .
SO .
WELL OUR OURS IS THREE HUNDRED FOR OUR FAMILY AND I MEAN WE THAT IS WE PAY THAT INSTEAD OF A CAR PAYMENT .
SEE .
YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
I MEAN I M DRIVING A PIECE OF JUNK YOU KNOW .
WELL WE DO THE SAME I MEAN IT S I THINK UH PEOPLE ARE CHANGING THEIR VIEWPOINTS OF YOU KNOW IT S GETTING HARDER AND HARDER TO SURVIVE .
RIGHT .
AND UH .
RIGHT .
AND THAT S WHY UH IF THEY DO NT GO TO A UNIVERSAL SYSTEM SOMETHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN .
YEAH .
WE RE GOING TO HAVE UH A LARGER AMOUNT OF PEOPLE DYING .
IS UH KIND OF FUN .
IT S BEST DONE WHEN YOU HAVE LEISURE TIME AND I HAD MORE OF THAT IN MY CHILDHOOD DAYS THAN I HAVE NOW .
AND I GREW UP IN AN AREA THAT UH WAS JUST A FEW FEET FROM A RATHER LARGE LAKE AND A FEW MORE MILES FROM THAT WAS A EVEN LARGER LAKE AND WE HAD A VARIETY OF BOATS AT OUR DISPOSAL .
UH I WORKED FOR A CAMP FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS .
MY FATHER WAS ON STAFF THERE AND WE HAD EVERY KIND OF THINGS FROM CANOES TO PADDLE BOATS SAILBOATS SPEEDBOATS YOU NAME IT THEY HAD IT AND WE DID A LOT OF WATERING WATER SPORTS .
BUT I THINK UH THE THING .
I LIKED THE BEST WAS UH WE SPENT ABOUT A SUMMER COUPLE OF GUYS UH RESTORED AN OLD WOODEN BOAT .
THAT WAS BUILT BACK IN THE MIDTHIRTIES AND GOT A NEW CANVAS SAIL FOR IT AND HAD A REAL H BIG OLD FOUR FOOT CENTER BOARD .
THAT WENT DOWN IN THE MIDDLE TO KEEP YOU UPRIGHT WHEN THE WAVES OR THE WIND CAME FROM THE SIDE AND WE GOT THAT THING IN THE WATER AND HAD A REAL GOOD TIME WITH IT .
IF YOU EVER GOT IT DUMPED OVER THOUGH IT WAS A MESS TO GET BACK UP .
IT .
WAS NT LIKE THE NEWER ONES .
THAT HAVE NICE CHAMBERS .
THAT KEEP IT AFLOAT OR KEEP IT UH UPRIGHT AGAIN .
THIS ONE .
YOU HAD TO WORK WITH .
YOU GET OUT OF THE WATER AGAIN AND GET IT UPRIGHT .
AND UH SAILING WAS WAS KIND OF NICE TO LEARN THE MANEUVERS YOU HAD TO MAKE TO WORK YOUR WAY DOWN A LAKE OR WORK BACK UP AGAINST THE THE WIND AS IT WERE TACKING BACK AND FORTH AND UH MORE THAN ONCE WE D GET OUT THERE ON A REALLY STORMY DAY AND UH THE STORM OR THE WIND WAS DUE TO THE FRONT BLOWING AND AS SOON AS THE FRONT CAME OVER IT WAS CALM .
SO YOU RE OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE WITH A PADDLE AND YOU PADDLE YOUR WAY BACK IN AND HOPE IT DOES NT START RAINING ON YOU RIGHT AWAY .
AND THAT DID NT ALWAYS WORK .
WE OFTENTIMES GOT WET .
BUT UH IT S IT S A NICE NICE HOBBY TO HAVE .
NOWADAYS I DO NT THINK I COULD AFFORD THE BOAT OR THE TIME NOR DO WE LIVE THAT CLOSE TO A LAKE ANYMORE SO THINGS CHANGE I GUESS .
WHAT ARE YOUR MEMORIES OF BOATING OR CURRENT .
UH ABOUT THE ONLY MEMORIES THAT I HAVE OF BOATING UH MY HUSBAND S FAMILY HAD A A MOTOR BOAT UH WHEN WE GOT ENGAGED AND THEY TOOK US OUT ON THE LAKE SEVERAL TIMES .
AND UH I REALLY DID ENJOY THAT .
I I DO NT KNOW THAT I EVER LEARNED TO DRIVE IT OR ANYTHING BUT UH WE DID SOME WATER SKIING OF COURSE AND AND UH DRIVING AROUND THE LAKE IN THE BOAT AND AND JUST THE BASIC SAFETY RULES AND THINGS I FOUND REAL INTERESTING .
UH YOU KNOW THEY THEY JUST DID NT PATROL YOU LIKE THEY DID WITH THE AUTOMOBILE OR WHATEVER .
THE THE LAWS WERE THERE AND IF YOU DID NT OBEY THEM UH .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW THERE WERE A LOT OF ACCIDENTS I GUESS .
THAT S TRUE .
BUT UH I FOUND THE MOTOR BOATING WAS REAL FUN .
YEAH I REMEMBER LEARNING HOW TO SKI OH I GUESS I WAS SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS OLD AND THE LAKE THAT WE LEARNED ON WAS THE SMALLER OF THE TWO THAT WE HAD ACCESS TO AND IT WAS MAYBE FIFTEEN TWENTY ACRES AND IT WAS UH IT HAD A LOT OF UH TURTLES IN IT .
AND I GOT ALL READY TO GO AND I WAS DOWN IN THE WATER AND AND SET TO GO AND UH AND JUST AS THAT BOAT TOOK OFF A TURTLE BIT ME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BACK .
OH .
IT DID NT HURT TOO MUCH BUT IT BIT ENOUGH TO WHERE I LET GO .
AND THE BOAT WENT OFF WITHOUT ME AND I REACHED BACK THERE AND S PUSHED HIM AWAY AND GOT OUT OF THE WATER .
A A WHILE AND AND UH IT DID NT EVEN LEAVE A MARK .
IT WAS JUST A LITTLE NIBBLE AND SO I TOLD EVERYBODY .
WHAT HAPPENED AND THEY GO OH YEAH SURE YOU KNOW .
AND SO I GET BACK DOWN IN THERE AND AND I LL BE IF HE DID NT DO IT AGAIN .
THIS TIME .
A LITTLE EARLIER AND AND I HAD LET GO BEFORE THEN AND BEFORE THEY TOOK OFF THIS TIME AND AND SWATTED HIM AWAY .
SO I MOVED OVER A A FEW FEET IN THE WATER AND GOT OUT OF HIS LITTLE REALM WHERE HE WAS LIVING UNDERNEATH THE DOCK AND UH MANAGED TO GET UP .
DID NT GO VERY FAR BUT I GOT UP .
AND IT IT WAS A NICE UH NICE LONG SKIING CAREER BUT NOW I VE GOTTEN TO WHERE SKIING IS JUST KIND OF WEARS ME OUT MORE THAN IT DOES THRILL ME .
I VE I VE UH DONE ABOUT ALL .
I DARE DO ON SKIS .
YOU KNOW SKIING ON ONE AND JUMPING AROUND HERE AND THERE AND I I I KNOW HOW YOU CAN GET INJURED DOING MUCH MORE THAN THAT AND I JUST CA NT RISK IT RIGHT NOW BEING A HEAD OF THE FAMILY AND THE BREADWINNER AND ALL THAT .
JUST UH CA NT TAKE THE RISK .
I DID AS A DUMB TEENAGER I GUESS .
SO LIFE JUST CHANGES A LITTLE BIT IN THAT RESPECT .
I D KIND OF LIKE SOMEDAY TO MAYBE END UP ON A PAIR OF SKIS .
THAT THAT DOES NT HAVE A UH WELL WHAT .
THEY CALL TRICK SKIS .
THEY LL ALLOW YOU TO SKI BACKWARDS .
I HAVE NT CR MANAGED TO GET A HOLD ON THAT UH CRAFT YET BUT UH .
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A REAL CHALLENGE .
YEAH IT IT WOULD BE KIND OF NICE .
I HAD NT QUITE FIGURED OUT I DO NT HAVE ANYBODY TO TEACH ME EITHER .
THAT S ANOTHER LITTLE THING .
YOU NEED SOMEBODY TO KIND OF TELL YOU .
WHAT TO DO BUT JUST FROM WHAT .
I VE SEEN YOU JUST KIND OF WORK YOUR WAY UP TO IT AND TURN AROUND REAL QUICK YOU KNOW .
GRAB THE ROPE BEHIND YOU AND THEN JUST LET GO REAL QUICK AND LET IT WHIP YOU AROUND .

I KNOW .
SO JUST YOU KNOW DO NT DO NT BE IN ANY HURRY .
I M NOT I M NOT .
YOU REALLY SHOULD GO TO EUROPE .
I WENT TO EUROPE FOR SIX WEEKS AFTER I GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE AND THAT WAS JUST I I MEAN I COULD HAVE HAD THAT OR A DOWN PAYMENT ON A NEW CAR AND I TOOK THE TRIP .
AND .
AND IT WAS GREAT .
UH I TRAVELED WITH A GROUP OF SIXTEEN OTHER STUDENTS .
ACTUALLY THEY THERE WAS TWO OTHER GRADUATING SENIORS BESIDES MYSELF AND WE JUST HAD A BALL .
WE STAYED AT .
HOW LONG DID YOU GET TO STAY THERE .
UH SIX WEEKS .
OH REALLY .
YEAH .
IT WAS WONDERFUL SO YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
UHHUH I JUST HAD A FRIEND .
THAT GOT BACK FROM EUROPE AND SHE WAS THERE LIKE ALL WINTER SEMESTER .
OKAY UH WHAT KIND OF HOBBIES DO YOU HAVE LORI .
UH I GUESS I UH I LIKE TO PLAY GOLF .
UHHUH .
AND UH I ALSO LIKE TO PLANT FLOWERS AND DO DO SOME GARDENING AND DO ARTS AND CRAFTS .
UHHUH .
WHERE DO YOU PLAY GOLF IN THIS AREA .
WELL WE LIVE UH PRETTY CLOSE .
TO THE MESQUITE GOLF COURSE .
UHHUH .
SO WE WILL PLAY EITHER OUT THERE OR AT FIREWHEEL .
THAT IS USUALLY WHERE WE PLAY BUT I HAVE PLAYED YOU KNOW DIFFERENT COURSES IN IN THE DALLAS AREA .
DO YOU UH DO YOU RIDE OR DO YOU PULL A CART WHEN YOU PLAY GOLF .
UH BOTH .
OH .
NOT AT THE SAME TIME .
I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT COULD BE DIFFICULT .
NO SOMETIMES WE RIDE AND SOMETIMES UH WE PULL WE LIKE TO TO UH A LOT OF THE TIMES JUST WALK UH FOR THE EXERCISE .
BUT .
UHHUH .
I FIND THAT WHEN I RIDE IN A CART I PLAY BETTER AND I THINK IT IS CAUSE .
I DO NT GET AS TIRED .
I THINK THAT MIGHT BE TRUE .
YEAH .
I DO NT LIKE PULLING A CART ON FIREWELL GOLF COURSE BECAUSE THEY WANT YOU TO PULL THE CART ON THE PATH .
I KNOW AND THAT MAKES ME SO MAD .
YOU KNOW IT IS LIKE IT IS NOT GOING TO DO THAT MUCH DAMAGE TO THE COURSE BUT APPARENTLY THEY THINK DIFFERENTLY .
THAT IS THE REASON I DO NT PLAY OVER THERE .
YEAH .
I LIKE THE COURSE BUT I DO NT PLAY OVER THERE BECAUSE YOU THEY DO NT UH YOU KNOW DO NT ALLOW YOU TO PULL A CART .
RIGHT .
AND I DO NT THINK A CART DAMAGES THE TURF .
RIGHT .
WELL THE REASON WHY WE PLAY OVER THERE IS BECAUSE ITS WHERE SINCE WE ARE A GARLAND RESIDENT THEY GAVE US .
A SPECIAL DEAL WHERE YOU CAN GET UH TEN ROUNDS OF GOLF FOR A HUNDRED DOLLARS YEAH A HUNDRED DOLLARS CAUSE IT IS HALF PRICE .
WHAT .
THE NORMAL GREEN FEES ARE .
UHHUH .
SO THAT IS WHY WE .
YOU KNOW PLAY OVER THERE CAUSE WE HAVE GOT OUR CARD .
WELL I GUESS I COULD USE A CARD TOO .
I LIVE UH VERY NEAR UH VERY CLOSE TO THE FIREWHEEL GOLF COURSE .
OH DO YOU .
SO YOU LIVE IN GARLAND THEN .
YES I LIVE IN NORTHWEST GARLAND .
RIGHT UP THERE NEAR THE GOLF COURSE .
OKAY WELL WE ARE IN SOUTH GARLAND BUT YEAH NEXT TIME .
YOU GO UH YOU KNOW CHECK INTO IT THEY HAVE UH IT IS JUST LIKE UH A BUS CARD AND THEY JUST PUNCH IT .
YOU KNOW IT HAS GOT ONE THROUGH TEN ON IT AND EVERY TIME .
YOU GO THEY JUST PUNCH IT FOR YOU .
WELL IN THE LAST TWO YEARS I HAVE NOT PLAYED VERY MUCH GOLF BECAUSE I AM INVOLVED IN BOY SCOUTS .
OH OKAY .
SO I HAVE UH I HAVE UH I HAVE CHILDREN .
YOU MUST HAVE A A SON .
BOY SCOUT AGE .
I HAVE TWO BOYS .
THAT ARE BOY SCOUT AGE AND UH SO .
OH OKAY .
I AM VERY ACTIVE IN BOY SCOUTS SO I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT CAMPING AND HIKING AND CANOEING AND BOY SCOUTS IS MY HOBBY .
YEAH .
BUT I .
OH WELL THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN TOO .
BUT MY GOLF CLUBS WILL PROBABLY RUST BEFORE I GET TO USE THEM AGAIN BECAUSE MY BOYS ARE STILL RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING AGE AND IT IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE SIX TO EIGHT YEARS BEFORE THEY GO TO COLLEGE .
UHHUH .
WELL YOU NEED TO UH TEACH THEM HOW TO PLAY AND TAKE THEM OUT ON THE COURSE WITH YOU .
THAT S RIGHT .
LESSONS ARE EXPENSIVE THOUGH .
OH YEAH .
WELL YOU CAN TEACH THEM .
WELL THEY WOULD PROBABLY NEVER MAKE IT THEN BECAUSE I DO NT THINK UH I ONLY TOOK LESSONS FOR GOLF WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE .
UHHUH .
UH AS A COURSE FOR P E YOU KNOW .
RIGHT RIGHT .
SO I COULD GRADUATE .
UHHUH .
BUT UH THAT IS THE ONLY TIME .
I THINK I HAVE EVER REALLY TAKEN GOLF LESSONS AND THAT WAS KIND OF A GROUP .
UHHUH .
SCENARIO .
RIGHT .
AND NOT INDIVIDUAL .
RIGHT .
I TOOK ONE LESSON ONE OTHER TIME .
BESIDES THAT UH I JUST UH TRY TO MAKE THE CLUB HIT THE BALL .
RIGHT .
YEAH I KNOW WHAT .
YOU MEAN .
I DO NT WANT TO PLAY STRIKE OUT YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
BUT I HAVE FUN DOING IT SOME UH YOU KNOW I HAVE SOME GOOD SHOTS AND SOME BAD SHOTS .
OH YEAH .
IT IT IS JUST NICE TO GET OUTDOORS AND DO SOMETHING .
SO YOU SAID YOU .
WORK UH IN THE GARDENS TOO .
DO YOU HAVE UH A SPECIAL FLOWERS .
WELL FLOWER GARDENS .
I LIKE TO HAVE MATTER OF FACT .
THIS PAST WEEKEND .
I JUST GOT FINISHED PLANTING A BUNCH OF TULIPS AND DAFFODIL BULBS .
SO THOSE OUGHT TO BE COMING UP AROUND SPRING TIME .
MY WIFE HAD UH JUST PUT IN A BUNCH OF I WANT TO SAY THEY ARE PANSIES .
UHHUH .
SHE PUT THEM IN LIKE TWO MONTHS AGO CAUSE THEY ARE WINTER PLANTS .
RIGHT .
AND THEY HAVE BEEN WE THOUGHT EVEN WITH ALL THE COLD WEATHER WEATHER .
WE HAVE HAD THEY HAVE BEEN BLOOMING JUST FINE .
OH THEY DO GREAT .
I PUT MINE IN PROBABLY IN NOVEMBER .
THAT IS WHEN SHE DID I THINK .
YEAH I THINK IT WAS NOVEMBER AND I DO NT DO ANYTHING TO MINE WATER THEM OR ANYTHING .
AND THEY JUST THEY DO REALLY GOOD AND I EVEN HAD UH I GUESS IT WAS LAST YEAR OR THE YEAR BEFORE I HAD SOME OUT AND IT FROZE AND THE PANSIES LOOKED TERRIBLE BUT THEY CAME BACK LATER .
I DID NT DO ANYTHING TO THEM SO THEY ARE UH THEY ARE GOOD TO PLANT IN THE WINTER TIME .
THEY LAST FOR A LONG TIME THEN .
SO IF YOU START PUTTING THEM YOU KNOW YOU CAN PUT THEM OUT IN THE SPRING TOO BUT ONCE IT STARTS GETTING REAL HOT .
UHHUH .
THEN IT JUST KILLS THEM CAUSE THEY CA NT STAND THE HOT WEATHER .
DO THEY SURVIVE LONGER IF YOU PLANT THEM IN THE WINTER TIME .
WILL THEY MAKE IT THROUGH THE SUMMER SUN .
NO THEY WO NT MAKE IT THROUGH THE SUMMER BECAUSE IT GETS TOO HOT BUT THEY MAKE IT THROUGH PROBABLY WINTER AND SPRING .
SO .
WELL .

I KNOW WHAT I LIKE BUT I .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND I LOVE TO LISTEN TO IT LOVE TO SING AND I MY KIDS WHEN I WAS LITTLE AND THEY WERE LITTLE AND I WAS ROCKING THEM SINGING TO THEM .
UHHUH .
WELL I DO NT KNOW IF THERE S GOING TO BE SOLUTIONS TO THE U S BUDGET .
WELL NOW IT S IN PRETTY DISASTROUS SHAPE FOR SURE .
UHHUH .
IT S ONLY GETTING WORSE EXPONENTIALLY .
YES .
IT SEEMS .
EXACTLY .
UM .
THERE S UH MAYBE SOME SHORTTERM THINGS THAT THEY CAN DO AND IT HURTS EVERYBODY S POCKET OF COURSE BUT UM I KNOW THAT STATE HAS UH CUTBACK UH RAISES FOR A YEAR TO HELP UH THE UH STATE FINANCIAL OR WHATEVER YOU MIGHT WANT TO SAY TO GET BETTER .
UHHUH .
IN A BETTER CONDITION THAT .
OH WHICH STATE IS THAT .
UH STATE OF MINNESOTA .
UHHUH .
SO THERE S THE POTENTIAL THAT PERHAPS YOU KNOW THE U S BUDGET MIGHT WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT S UH FEDERAL EMPLOYEES OR AND TAKE A LOOK AT SAYING WELL LET S FREEZE WAGES I MEAN EVERYBODY S DOING IT SO IT IS NT .
UHHUH .
LIKE UH PRIVATE BUSINESS HAS HAD TO DO IT SO .
RIGHT .
IT MIGHT HAVE TO BE SOMETHING THAT THEY MIGHT CONSIDER DOING AS A SHIR THAT S GOT TO BE VERY SHORT TERM .
RIGHT .
AND THE ONLY OTHER AVENUE THAT I CAN THINK OF IS UH LOOKING AT WHERE THEY RE SPENDING THE MONEY AND NOT SO MUCH AS SAYING WELL WE RE SPENDING TOO MUCH IN THAT AREA AS PERHAPS LOOKING AT WHAT IS COSTING THEM THE MONEY AS .
YEP .
FOR FOR INSTANCE I THINK YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER THE MILITARY GETTING CAUGHT UM WITH TOILET SEATS THAT COST THEM FOUR HUNDRED FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS .
RIGHT .
AND IT WAS JUST .
I MEAN YOU CAN GO TO KMART AND BUY THEM FOR UH EIGHT DOLLARS OR I THINK .
YEAH .
SIX DOLLARS OR WHATEVER FOR TOILET SEATS SO .
YEAH DEFINITELY .
SO IT GIVES YOU A .
I THINK THAT THERE S .
IDEA THAT .
PROBABLY A LOT OF WASTE IN DEFENSE AND IN GOVERNMENT FUNDED RESEARCH IN THE FIRST PLACE .
SURE SURE SO .
I MEAN THERE WAS UM PEOPLE AT STANFORD WHO WERE SOAKING THE GOVERNMENT YOU KNOW USING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF RESEARCH MONEY .
UHHUH .
TO UH FOR THE PRESIDENT TO BUY BEACH HOMES OR WHATEVER IT WAS .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK THAT THAT MAYBE MORE WIDESPREAD .
THAN WE THINK .
THAN .
SURE .
WELL THAN WE D LIKE TO HAVE THINK .
SURE .
BUT BUT THEN IT S SOMETHING THAT S HARD TO ENFORCE TOO I M SURE .
UHHUH IT SURE IS THE YOU KNOW AS FAR AS I THINK THERE WAS SOMETHING WITH THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL THAT WENT ON CONFERENCES FOR TWO DAYS AND ACTUALLY UH THE CONFERENCES WERE NOTHING BUT UH YOU KNOW THEY RE GETTING PAID FOR THIS AND IT WAS SOMETHING MORE THAN JUST THE CONFERENCES THEY WERE USING IT AS EATING OUT UH WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT PEOPLE UH TAKING VACATIONS THESE BIG GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TAKING DESCENDANTS IN CONGRESS .
UHHUH .
THE REST OF THEM TAKING THESE VACATIONS AND USING THE TAXPAYERS MONEY FOR THAT .
RIGHT .
AND IT S A REAL BIG CRUNCH UH .
UHHUH .
OF COURSE WHEN THEY GET CAUGHT THEN THEY RE YOU KNOW THEY RE GUILTY OF COURSE BUT UH DURING THAT TIME I M SURE THERE S HUNDREDS OF UH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE UH SPENDING MONEY THAT DOES NOT BELONG TO THEM SO .
WELL THAT S RIGHT UH I THINK THAT OH POLITICIANS TALK A LOT ABOUT WASTE .
UHHUH .
BUT I M NOT SURE THAT THAT S REALLY THAT MUCH OF THE PROBLEM .
SURE .
I MEAN WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE THE GULF WAR .
UHHUH .
IT COST US GOD KNOWS HOW MUCH YOU KNOW AT A MILLION DOLLARS .
A POP FOR PATRIOT MISSILES .
EXACTLY AND I DO NT THINK UH IT S ENDED UP BEING I MEAN IT GAVE PEOPLE JOBS .
YEAH .
BUT I THINK IT ALSO COST UM QUITE A BIT AS FAR AS BECAUSE AFTER THEY RE DONE WITH THE WAR A LOT OF THINGS WERE NO LONGER PUT TO USE I MEAN IT WAS KIND OF LIKE OKAY WE LL DO THIS DURING THIS POINT AND TIME BUT AFTER THAT THAT S YOU KNOW UH .
RIGHT .
THEY DID NT WANT TO DO IT ANYMORE .
UHHUH .
SO A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE SAYING THAT THEY RE NO LONGER GOING TO BE DOING FOR NEXT WARS THAT ARE COMING UP THAT THEY DID FOR THIS ONE IN GETTING RID OF A LOT OF THINGS SO .
UHHUH .
I DO NT KNOW .
RIGHT .
OKAY WELL IT WAS GOOD TALKING TO YOU AND .
OKAY .

I THOUGHT I THOUGHT THEY WOULD GET BEAT TODAY BECAUSE I MEAN THEY RE SO YOUNG YOU KNOW PLAYOFFS .
SO HAVE YOU DONE ANY PAINTING PROJECTS LATELY .
YEAH THIS IS A GREAT TOPIC FOR ME .
BECAUSE I JUST DID MY FIRST TWO PAINTING PROJECTS EVER .
OH REALLY .
WAS NOT NOT A BIG DEAL .
WHAT KIND OF .
TWO LITTLE DEALS .
PAINTING WAS IT .
THE FIRST ONE UM I HELPED SOMEONE REPAINT AN APARTMENT AND IT WAS VERY EASY .
UHHUH IT WAS IT .
YEAH AND I VE NEVER PAINTED ANYTH I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SO YOU KNOW YOU D HAVE TO HIRE SOMEONE IF YOU NEEDED TO PAINT INSIDE YOUR HOUSE OR SOMETHING .
YEAH .
BUT I KNOW I CAN DO IT .
OH UHHUH .
AND THE SECOND ONE WAS I BOUGHT SOME TOYS AT A UM AT A CRAFT FAIR .
UHHUH .
THEY RE UNFINISHED WOODEN BOOK ENDS AND STUFF FOR A LITTLE GIRL FOR CHRISTMAS AND SO I DECIDED TO PAINT THEM AND THAT WAS NT AS EASY AS PAINTING THE APARTMENT .
OH WELL WHAT KIND OF PAINT DID YOU USE FOR THE UM BOOKENDS .
WELL IT S UH IT THAT S HALF THE PROBLEM RIGHT THERE IS THAT IT .
WAS NT IT WAS A OIL BASE SO I HAD TO GET AND WHEN I PAINTED THEM I DID NT REALIZE THAT WE DID NT HAVE ANY TURPENTINE OR PAINT THINNER OR ANYTHING IN THE HOUSE .
SO I HAD IT HAD IT .
ALL OVER MY HANDS .
AT FIRST .
I DID NT REALIZE YOU KNOW I HAD NEVER PAINTED ANYTHING SO I DID NT REALIZE .
UHHUH .
THAT I NEEDED THAT .
I MEAN I .
KIND OF KNEW IN THE BACK OF MY MIND .
SO YOU CA NT USE OIL ON WOOD .
WELL NO YOU CAN USE IT ON WOOD BUT I JUST HAD IT .
ALL OVER MY HANDS AND I WENT TO WASH THE BRUSHES OUT AND UH WASH MY HANDS AND YOU CA NT WASH IT OFF WITH WATER .
YOU HAVE TO GET THE UH A SOLUTION AND .
OH SO YOU HAD TO GO AROUND WITH PAINT .
ALL OVER YOU .
YEAH I HAD TO DRIVE TO THE STORE .
TEMPORARILY ANYWAY .
YEAH I HAD TO DRIVE TO THE STORE WITH PAPER TOWELS ALL OVER MY HANDS TO GO BUY .
OH .
SOME PAINT THINNER AND MUMBLEX AND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT AND THEN UM DOWNSTAIRS IN THE APARTMENT I JUST US WE JUST USED A LATEX BASE AND SO YOU CAN DRIP IT ON YOU KNOW IF YOU DRIPPED IT ON SOMETHING AS LONG AS YOU WIPED IT UP IT WAS REAL EASY TO CLEAN .
OH IS IS THAT WHAT .
YOU USUALLY USE IN THE HOUSE IS LATEX .
YEAH AND AND .
UM .
IT IT JUST LIKE THE SAME WITH THE TOYS IT S JUST IMPORTANT TO LOOK FOR ONE .
THAT DOES NT HAVE LEAD IN IT YOU KNOW IT SAYS SAFE FOR CHILDREN AND ALL THAT .
UHHUH YEAH I HEARD ABOUT THAT .
I GUESS A FRIEND OF MINE HAD A UH WELL SHE SHE JUST STARTED UP A DAY CARE CENTER AND UH THE ONE OF THE REAL STRICT UH RESTRICTIONS WAS THE FACT THAT SHE HAD TO HAVE A SPECIAL KIND OF PAINT .
THAT WAS FIRE PROOF AND LEAD FREE AND ALL THAT OTHER GOOD STUFF .
YEAH .
SO UH SHE HAD THAT DONE .
BUT UH .
HAVE YOU PAINTED ANYTHING RECENTLY .
WELL UM SO TO SPEAK I HAD TO PAINT THIS UH THE INSIDE OF THIS WAREHOUSE THING .
WOW WAS IT HUGE .
THAT YOU KEEP SOME UM FARM EQUIPMENT IN .
UHHUH .
AND UM WHAT .
I HAD TO DO IS JUST COAT THIS BARE WOOD WITH A SEALER AND UH I HAD THIS BIG FIVE GALLON JUG AND IT WAS LIKE PAINT THINNER .
I MEAN I YOU KNOW IT LOOKED JUST LIKE IT WAS THE VISCOSITY OF PAINT THINNER .
YEAH .
BUT UH YOU JUST TOOK A ROLLER AND PUT IT ON THERE AND UH IF YOU SAW THAT THE WOOD WAS GETTING WET YOU KNOW THAT WAS THAT WAS ALL .
YOU NEEDED .
SO .
WOW .
YEAH IT WAS IT USED ALL OF IT .
I GUESS IT WAS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED YARDS WORTH .
SO .
WELL I GUESS IT WORKED OUT .
IT WAS PRETTY EASY ACTUALLY .
YEAH I THINK THOUGH UM WE RE LUCKY THAT WE DID NT HAVE TO DO ANY DETAIL WORK BECAUSE I DO NT KNOW IF I COULD YOU KNOW I DO NT KNOW .
I DO NT KNOW MUST BE DIFFICULT .
WELL WHAT ABOUT THE TRIM IN YOUR HOUSE .
DID YOU HAVE TO DO THAT .
NO IT WAS J IT WAS REALLY EASY I JUST LIKE WHAT WE HAD A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT SIZE BRUSHES .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW REAL EASY I WENT AROUND THE TRIM AND IF IT AND THERE WAS WALL PAPER LIKE I WAS DO JUST DOING JUST THE TRIM OUTS .
THAT AROUND THE DOORS AND WINDOWS AND THERE WAS WALL PAPER AND .
UHHUH .
IF WE GOT IT ON THE WALL PAPER .
A LITTLE BIT WE JUST WIPE IT RIGHT AWAY BEFORE IT DRIED IT CAME RIGHT OFF .
OH YEAH .
SO THERE WAS NO MAJOR MISTAKES THERE WAS .
DID YOU HAVE UH ONE COAT OR TWO .
UH TWO ACTUALLY .
UHHUH .
UM AND IT THERE WAS UM YOU KNOW AROUND THE WINDOWS IF YOU GOT IT ON THE GLASS WE LET IT DRY AND SCRAPED IT AFTER THAT BUT THAT .
YEAH THAT WOULD BE REALLY TIME UH A TIME SAVER .
WELL YEAH IF YOU JUST YOU KNOW WE DID NT TAPE .
ANYTHING .
WE WERE NT THAT CAREFUL BUT IT .
WAS NT YOU KNOW I DO NT KNOW IT S IT S FUNNY IT S LIKE IF YOU JUST GO SLOW YOU DO NT GET OR AT LEAST I DID NT GET THAT MANY MISTAKES .
UHHUH .
I DID NT MAKE THAT MANY MISTAKES .
OH ME I WOULD HAVE HAD TO HAVE TAPED THE WHOLE THING AND THEN BRUSHED AROUND THE EDGES AND AND THEN I D HAVE PROBABLY ROLLED IT ON .
I D IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN ME FOREVER .
WHY .
JUST BECAUSE YOU D BE AFRAID TO DO IT OR HAVE YOU DONE IT BEFORE .
YEAH WELL THE FIRST TIME .
IT D PROBABLY WOULD HAVE TAKEN ME FOREVER SO .
WELL IT .
WAS NT IF IT WAS MY OWN I WOULD HAVE BUT MY FRIEND SAID OH JUST GO AHEAD YOU JUST GO AHEAD .
IT S EASY .
I SAID OKAY IT S YOUR PLACE .
WELL HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU .
ALL .
WELL A COUPLE OF WEEK ENDS WE WOULD GO DOWN .
UHHUH .
TWO OR THREE HOURS ON THE WEEKENDS AND .
SO THERE WAS TWO OF YOU .
ALL .
NO THERE WAS THEY WERE DOING ALL SORTS OF REPAIRS AND THERE WAS I WAS JUST PAINTING BECAUSE I DO NT KNOW HOW TO DO ANYTHING ELSE .
WELL THAT S EASY ENOUGH .
SO THERE S A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE .
UM .
SO NOW I FEEL LIKE IF I EVER BUY A HOUSE I CAN PROBABLY PAINT IF NOTHING ELSE .
I THINK I COULD PROBABLY DO IT .
YEAH .
UH AS LONG AS THE HARDWARE STORE TOLD ME .
WHAT TO BUY THEN I COULD DO IT .
BUT YOU KNOW I WENT IN TO A HARDWARE STORE TO GET PAINT FOR THOSE TOYS AND THE GUY SAID OH GET THIS IT S A NICE SHINY GLOSS WHICH WAS TRUE .
BUT I DID NT REALIZE WHAT YOU KNOW PAIN IT IS TO CLEAN THE BRUSHES AND EVERYTHING IF YOU DO NT HAVE LATEX .
I DO NT IF IT S WORTH THE SHINE .
UHHUH .
WELL CREDIT CARDS .

HI PAT .
HI ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS THAT I HAVE CONSIDERED ABOUT THE ROLE CHANGE FOR WOMEN IS THAT WOMEN OF MY AGE MY GENERATION WERE TRAINED AND TAUGHT AND BROUGHT UP TO BE THE LEAVE IT TO BEAVER HOUSEWIVES .
UHHUH .
BUT WE ARE NOT LIVING IN THAT WORLD .
WE ARE CERTAINLY NOT OUR FAMILIES HAVE CHANGED .
UHHUH FAMILIES UHHUH .
SOCIETY HAS CHANGED .
OH YEAH SURE .
EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED YEAH YEAH .
UHHUH THAT S ONE OF THE AND IT MAKES YOU REALLY CONCERNED I AM GLAD I RAISED GUYS .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW LET THE WORLD TRAIN THEM WHAT TO DO BUT CHARACTERISTICALLY YOU KNOW THE WOMEN ARE TRAINED OR HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST TRAINED IN THE HOME .
UHHUH .
AND I REALLY WOULD BE AT A LOSS TO TO RAISE AND TRAIN A GIRL I THINK I WOULD .
YEAH IT S WELL EVEN EVEN RAISING BOYS TODAY IS DIFFERENT THOUGH BECAUSE .
OH SURE .
THEY ARE EXPECTED TO DO SO MUCH MORE THAN THEY USED TO .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW USED TO BE THEY WOULD JUST GO OFF TO WORK AND COME HOME AND YOU KNOW EVERYTHING WAS DONE AND IT IT S A DIFFERENT WORLD IT S .
OH SURE .
SOME GOOD SOME BAD UH .
UHHUH .
IT S NICE THAT THERE S A CHOICE .
I I HAVE CHOSEN TO STAY AT HOME .
UHHUH .
AND RAISE MY CHILDREN .
UHHUH .
AND I HAVE A TEN YEAR OLD AND A TWELVE YEAR OLD .
UHHUH .
AND I WAS A SINGLE PARENT FOR AWHILE AND WORKED .
UHHUH .
AND THAT WAS GREAT I WAS ABLE TO AND I WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR MY CHILDREN AND AND YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
THAT WAS WONDERFUL .
UHHUH .
BUT I I THANK GOD EVERYDAY NOW THAT I HAVE THAT CHOICE .
SURE .
AND THAT I AM ABLE TO DO THINGS AT HOME AND AND UH I VOLUNTEER A WHOLE LOT .
UHHUH .
AND UH THAT S MY JOB RIGHT NOW .
UHHUH .
AND I I LOVE IT .
OH YEAH .
I REALLY LOVE IT .
I DID VERY MUCH THE SAME THING UNTIL MY BOYS GOT INTO HIGH SCHOOL AND SAID MOM PLEASE DO NOT BE INVOLVED .
RIGHT RIGHT .
THEN I WENT BACK TO WORK .
RIGHT AND THAT WILL COME .
YEAH .
I KNOW THAT DAY WILL COME .
SURE .
AND I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT TOO .
RIGHT .
BUT THAT S A DIFFERENT PHASE IN MY LIFE .
RIGHT .
AND I AM I AM GLAD THAT I AM ABLE TO DO WHAT I WANT TO DO RIGHT NOW .
WELL YOU KNOW THERE S A LOT OF THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED ACTUALLY AND AND IT S IT S LIKE THE IT S LIKE OIL ON TOP OF WATER IT CHANGES BUT IT S NEVER DIFFERENT .
UHHUH .
IN A LOT OF WAYS .
UHHUH .
UH WOMEN AT ONE TIME DID VERY HEAVY PHYSICAL LABOR .
UHHUH .
AND WERE EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN A HOUSEHOLD .
UHHUH .
THEN AS TIMES CHANGED UH AS IT IS TODAY WE DO NOT DO A LOT OF PHYSICAL LABOR .
UHHUH .
EVEN IN HOUS EVEN IN HOUSEKEEPING .
RIGHT .
AND HOMEMAKING .
RIGHT .
THERE S NOT A LOT OF PHYSICAL LABOR .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE THERE ARE .
YOU ARE NOT BEATING RUGS .
UHHUH .
YOU ARE NOT RIGHT .
RIGHT .
DOING LAUNDRY BY HAND AND THAT KIND OF THING .
AND IN THAT RESPECT WE HAVE TO MAKE OURSELVES BECOME INVOLVED IN PHYSICAL EXERTION .
UHHUH .
OR WE REALLY DO DEVELOP SOME HEALTH PROBLEMS .
UHHUH .
SO IN IN THAT IN THAT RESPECT I AM NOT SO SURE THAT THE HARD WORK OF YEARS PAST WAS NOT BETTER FOR US THAN WE ARE WILLING TO ADMIT .
YEAH YEAH .
AND UH .
BUT DO NT YOU THINK IT S THAT WAY WITH MEN TOO I MEAN YOU KNOW MEN ARE SITTING BEHIND DESKS A WHOLE LOT MORE .
OH ABSOLUTELY TRUE IT S .
THAN THEY USED TO .
THAT S TRUE WITH SOCIETY .
YEAH YEAH .
IN GENERAL BUT SPECIFICALLY THE WOMAN S ROLE .
UHHUH .
IN SOCIETY HAS CHANGED AND YOU KNOW MEDICAL REPORTS TELL US THAT WOMEN ARE DEVELOPING DISEASES NOW THAT USED TO BE PREDOMINATELY MALE DISEASES .
RIGHT RIGHT .
HEART DISEASE WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF MEN .
RIGHT .
NOW THERE S ALMOST EQUALLY PREDOMINANT IN WOMEN .
RIGHT .
AND I .
AND STRESS DISORDERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
UHHUH .
UHHUH .
UHHUH .
RIGHT AND I THINK THAT THAT S A THAT S A SYMPTOM OF OUR SOCIETY IT S A SYMPTOM THAT THERE S THERE S A GENERAL ILLNESS THAT NEEDS TO BE HEALED .
UHHUH .
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE HEALING PROCESS WOULD BE OR WHAT WAS CAUSING THE PROBLEM .
I AM NOT I AM NOT GOD .
YEAH YEAH .
BUT I I DO KNOW THAT IN RAISING MY BOYS I REALLY DID MEET A LOT OF PRESSURES SAYING YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO GET THEM INTO MUSIC LESSONS YOU NEED TO GET THEM .
UHHUH UHHUH .
INTO SPORTS YOU NEED TO GET THEM INTO THIS THEY NEED TO BE BUSY AND THEY NEED TO BE ACTIVE AND I FOUGHT ALL OF THOSE THINGS I SAID IF THOSE BOYS WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN THAT THEY WILL COME TO ME AND THEY WILL SAY MOM THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ME I WANT TO DO IT .
RIGHT RIGHT .
OTHERWISE I WILL GUARD THEIR ABILITY TO HAVE QUIET TIME .
YOU KNOW IT S FUNNY .
I REFUSED TO CRAM THEIR LIVES FULL .
YEAH YEAH IT S FUNNY IT S FUNNY I WAS REA .
AND THAT S THE WAY IT IS WITH A WOMAN TOO .
I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO SUMMER THINKING OH WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SOME TIME OFF .
UHHUH .
AND IT S BEEN REAL BUSY AND ACTUALLY TODAY IS REALLY THE FIRST AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED THE FIRST DAY OF SUMMER .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD SO MUCH GOING ON THE PAST FEW WEEKS .
UHHUH .
AND UH YOU ARE RIGHT .
UHHUH .
UH WELL THAT S HOW SOCIETY HAS CHANGED UH .
UHHUH UHHUH .
YOU KNOW UH THE FAMILY HAS CHANGED WE YOU KNOW WE FIND OURSELVES DOING THINGS THAT .
WE NEVER DID AS KIDS .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW I DO NOT REMEMBER .
WELL .
BEING INVOLVED IN THINGS LIKE THIS .
UHHUH .
IT S IT S DIFFERENT .
UHHUH .
IT S JUST I DO NOT KNOW ONLY TIME WILL TELL WHETHER IT S BETTER OR WORSE .
UHHUH .
THAN THE WAY WE GREW UP BUT UH .
OF COURSE .
IT S IT S JUST VERY DIFFERENT .
UHHUH .
UM .
WELL I JUST AM VERY MUCH A BELIEVER IN QUIET PERSONAL TIME IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE TIME TO TALK TO YOURSELF WHO ARE YOU GOING TO TALK TO RIGHT .
YEAH YEAH YEAH .
AND I GUARDED MY CHILDREN S RIGHTS FOR THAT AND I THINK THAT THAT S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WOMEN ARE SACRIFICING THAT THEY SHOULD NOT DO .
UHHUH .
THEY ARE SACRIFICING THEIR TIME WITH THEMSELVES THERE S NOTHING WRONG WITH SITTING AND BEING BORED .
IF YOU THINKING INTERNALLY .
RIGHT .
AND YOU ARE .
RIGHT .
WORKING ON YOUR OWN SELF .
RIGHT .
YOU ARE FINDING OUT WHO YOU ARE .
BUT IS NOT THAT DIFFICULT TO DO WHEN YOU ARE WORKING FULL TIME AND HAVE TO COME HOME AND PREPARE A MEAL AND .
WELL I THINK .
GET HOMEWORK DONE AND YOU KNOW WHERE DO YOU FIND THE TIME .
UM WELL IN THE FIRST PLACE IT S NOT YOUR HOMEWORK IT S YOUR CHILDREN S HOMEWORK .
UHHUH .
AND I WAS ALWAYS VERY CAREFUL TO BE THERE ONLY WHEN THEY CAME TO ME AND ASKED ME FOR HELP .
UHHUH .
I HELPED THEM WITH EXACTLY WHAT THEY ASKED FOR AND THAT S ALL .
YEAH .
THAT S A PART OF THE PROBLEM THAT WOMEN HAVE ALWAYS HAD AND THAT IS ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THINGS THAT REALLY ARE OTHER PEOPLE S RESPONSIBILITIES .
THAT S VERY TRUE .
THEY .
AND THEN THAT WAY WE HAVE NOT CHANGED IN .
THEY .
HUNDREDS OF YEARS HAVE WE .
THAT S RIGHT .
YEAH .
THAT WAY HUSBANDS ARE CRIPPLED .
YEAH .
THEY ARE INTELLECTUAL CRIPPLES .
UHHUH .
AND SO ARE CHILDREN .
UHHUH .
THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO THINK FOR THEMSELVES AND BE RESPONSIBLE .
UHHUH .
FOR THEMSELVES I DO NOT KNOW WHY GOD MADE WOMEN BRILLIANT I .
DID NT HE THOUGH .
YES BUT I DO NOT KNOW THEY TEND TO LOOK AT THE MOTHER AS THE ONE WHO SOLVES ALL PROBLEMS THEY .
THAT S VERY TRUE .
ARE ALL THINGS TO ALL PEOPLE AND THAT S NEVER CHANGED .
THAT S THAT S VERY TRUE I AS A MATTER OF FACT I WAS TALKING TO A FRIEND YESTERDAY WHO SAID SHE HAS A NEW POLICY IN HER HOME AND WHEN HER HER FAMILY COMES TO HER AND SAYS FIX THIS YOU KNOW I AM HAVING A PROBLEM WITH .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE FAMILY .
UHHUH .
SHE SAID I HAVE TAKEN A NEW STANCE AND I SAY NO I WILL NOT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW YOU WORK IT OUT FOR YOURSELF .
UHHUH .
AND SHE SAID IT S AMAZING SHE SAID .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS FAMILY EXPECTS ME TO GET AND THEY DRA SUCK ME INTO THESE ARGUMENTS AND .
THAT S RIGHT .
THESE CONVERSATIONS AND I HA I AM SUPPOSED TO BE THE ONE WHO IS GOING TO FIX IT ALL AND AND SOOTHE EVERYBODY AND SHE SAID I AM NOT DOING IT ANYMORE I I JUST .
YOU KNOW I THINK THAT S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TODAY THAT IS VERY USEFUL AND I THINK EVERY WOMAN OUGHT TO DEAL WITH IT OR OUGHT TO AT LEAST BE EXPOSED TO IT AND THAT IS MEDIATION TRAINING .
UM UHHUH .
UH WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT STRIKES OR THINGS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MEDIATORS WHO GET INVOLVED IN FAMILY CRISES .
UHHUH .
PARENTS AND CHILDREN HUSBANDS AND WIVES .
UHHUH .
UH YOU KNOW BOSS AND EMPLOYEE THOSE KINDS OF THINGS INTERPERSONAL MEDIATION .
YEAH YEAH .
BECAUSE THE MEDIATOR IS AN UNBIASED BYSTANDER WHO .
OKAY WE RE TALKING ABOUT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT .
RIGHT .
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT LENORE .
I AM VERY MUCH FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT .
WELL WONDERFUL I AM TOO ONE HUNDRED PERCENT .
MY DAD RETIRED FROM THE FEDERAL PRISON OF BUREAUS .
UHHUH .
AND I VE BEEN RAISED AROUND PRISON .
ALL YOUR LIFE .
PRISONS ALL MY LIFE .
UHHUH .
AND I BELIEVE IF YOU DO NT HAVE A PUNISHMENT BEFITTING THE CRIME THERE S .
THERE S NO DETERRENT .
NOT ANY DETERRENT .
THAT S RIGHT THERE S JUST NO DETERRENT .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND SO MANY OF THOSE KIND OF PEOPLE THEY GOT THEY HAVE A BETTER LIFE IN PRISON THAN THEY HAVE ON THE STREET ANYWAY SO YOU KNOW UNLESS THEY REALLY MAKE IT ROUGH ON THEM THAT S NOT A GOING TO PRISON FOR A LITTLE WHILE IS NOT MUCH OF A DETERRENT I DO NT THINK .
ESPECIALLY NOT A FEDERAL PRISON .
RIGHT WELL I DO NT KNOW WHAT OKLAHOMA S LAWS ARE BUT TEXAS S I DO NT KNOW ARE I DO NT KNOW IT S IT S NO ONES F I MEAN IT S NOT THE JUDGES FAULT I DO NT THINK IT S JUST THE WAY THE LAW IS DOWN HERE MAN OUR CR OUR UH PRISONS ARE SO CROWDED THAT UH THEY CAN COMMIT SOME PRETTY SERIOUS CRIMES AND BE SET FREE WITHIN A YEAR TO TWO .
WELL SEE WE WERE UNDER UH THE STATES PRISONS WERE UNDER A MANDATE TO UH IT WAS OVER CROWDED AND THE FEDERAL CAME IN AND SAID HEY YOU KNOW YOU HAVE EITHER GOT TO BUILD MORE PRISONS OR LET PEOPLE GO .
WELL THAT S WHAT OURS DID SAME THING .
AND FINALLY OUR GOVERNOR AT THE TIME WHICH WHO IS NOT IN OFFICE NOW CAME IN AND SAID OKAY WHERE WE DRAW THE LINE IS NO SEX OFFENDERS WILL BE LET LOOSE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
UNDER EARLY BAIL YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
OR EARLY UH .
UHHUH .
GET OUT .
UHHUH .
BUT UH WE HAVE THE DEATH PENALTY IS NOT GIVEN OFTEN .
HUHUH .
BUT THERE HAVE BEEN W .
IT S NOT HERE EITHER REALLY .
AND YOU KNOW I MAYBE IT SHOULD BE UH WELL IT SHOULD BE GIVEN YOU KNOW I I WO NT SAY SPARINGLY BUT I DO BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE BEFITTING THE CRIME .
I DO TOO AND AND YOU KNOW BUT THE WAY THE COURTS ARE SET UP THEY VE THEY VE GOT SO MANY CHANCES FOR APPEAL BUT I THINK TH I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE EXPEDITED YOU KNOW IF THEY VE BEEN CONVICTED AND GIVEN AN APPEAL AND THEY RE STILL CONVICTED OF OF A CRIME THAT S DESERVING OF OF A LETHAL INJECTION LET S DO IT AND NOT WASTE SO MANY YEARS TO DO IT .
RIGHT OF COURSE YOU KNOW THEY RE THEY RE ENTITLED TO A SPEEDY TRIAL .
THAT S RIGHT .
BUT THEN THEY RE THEY RE ALSO ENTITLED TO DRAG IT THROUGH THE COURTS .
UHHUH .
FOR YEARS AND YEARS .
UHHUH .
AND YEARS ON APPEALS SO .
YEAH .
SOMEHOW YOU KNOW IT DOES NT REALLY BALANCE OUT TOO MUCH .
THAT S RIGHT SOMEHOW IT JUST DOES NT IT WORKS AND THEN AGAIN IT TAKES TOO LONG FOR IT TO WORK .
AND IT SEEMS EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW THAT THEY GOT THE PRISONER HIMSELF CAN COME TO THE POINT THAT HEY I M TIRED I JUST WANT OUT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW I M TIRED OF FIGHTING IT .
UHHUH .
THEN THE SYSTEM JUST KEEPS ON .
UHHUH YEAH YEAH IT EQU .
AND AT THAT POINT YOU KNOW I I REALLY THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE MAYBE A SHORTER APPEAL PROCESS .
I DO TOO I THINK THAT NEEDS TO AND I DO NT SEE WHY IT COULD NT BE SHORTENED CONSIDERABLY BUT YOU KNOW .
WELL PART OF THAT IS THE OVERCROWDING OF THE COURT SYSTEM .
YEA THAT S TRUE IT IS OVERCROWDED BECAUSE THERE S SO MUCH DRUG UH PROBLEM WITH THE PEOPLE ON DRUGS BECAUSE THAT HA THEY WITH THE DRUGS THEY RE THEY RE ROBBING AND KILLING AND UH THAT S WHY IT S FILLED THE PRISONS UP SO MUCH I THINK .
UH IT DOES NT IT DOES NT HELP THEM ANY AT ALL .
NO IT DOES NT .
AND OF COURSE YOUR COURT SYSTEM WHEN YOU GET INTO THE APPEALS I DO NT BELIEVE CRIMINAL IS IN A COURT BY ITSELF AND THE WHOLE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS BACKED UP WITH A LOT OF JUNK THAT SHOULD NT BE IN THERE .
YEAH THAT S TRUE WITH ALL THESE LAWSUITS AND PEOPLE SUING PEOPLE OVER RIDICULOUS THINGS BUT .
WE VE GOTTEN INTO A VERY LITIGIOUS UH TYPE OF LIFE .
BOY HAVE NT THAT WE THOUGH WE REALLY HAVE BUT ANYWAY I M GLAD TO HEAR THAT YOU AGREE WITH ME ON THE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT .
WELL I JUST .
I M I M VERY MUCHLY FOR IT ALWAYS HAVE BEEN .
ALWAYS WILL BE .
I JUST FEEL LIKE THEIR CRIME AND PUNISHMENT AND IF IF YOU DO NT HAVE THE PUNISHMENT YOU DOUBLE YOUR CRIME AND THE YOU KNOW THAT IS JUST PERSONAL FEELING IT S NOT GOING ON FACTS I THINK .
IT COULD BE SUPPORTIVE IT IT S .
THE FACTS WOULD PROBABLY BACK IT UP BUT .
IT S SUPPORTED WITH FACTS THOUGH .
WHAT .
IT COULD VERY EASILY BE SUPPORTED WITH FACTS .
WELL YES I .
OKAY DO YOU WANT TO START .
OKAY UH I HAVE NT I DO NT KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT THE POSSI WHAT THE POSSIBLE CHOICES COULD BE ABOUT REORGANIZING THE TRIAL BY JURY BUT UH I THINK IT WORKS BETTER THAN MANY OTHER SYSTEMS LIKE HAVING A JUDGE DECIDE .
UHHUH .
I CA NT THINK OF MANY ALTERNATIVES THAT COULD BE MORE FAIR THAN HAVING TWELVE PEOPLE DECIDE ALTHOUGH IT S DIFFICULT BECAUSE THEY ALL HAVE TO BE NEW UNANIMOUS .
NOW THAT DO YOU DO YOU AGREE THAT THEY SHOULD ALL BE UNANIMOUS .
I DO NT .
OR EVEN EVEN IN UH LIKE THEY SAID YOU KNOW LESSER YOU KNOW TRIALS YOU KNOW LESSER CONVICTIONS DO YOU THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE ALL UNANIMOUS STILL .
I DO NT KNOW I DO NT KNOW IF I FEEL I DO NT FEEL REAL STRONGLY ABOUT THAT IF THE UH THE THING IS THOUGH I I DID NT THINK EVEN IF IT WAS A LOWER CONVICTION I DID NT THINK THAT YOU COULD UH I DID NT THINK THAT YOU REALLY HAD TO HAVE A A JURY .
UHHUH .
UNLESS I GUESS IF YOU REQUEST ONE YOU CAN BUT I THINK YEAH MAKING IT UNANIMOUS SOMETIMES MIGHT UH LET THE ONLY THING IT MIGHT LET MORE PEOPLE GET OFF I DO NT THINK IT WOULD CONVICT ANY MORE PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
AND WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE ALREADY YOU KNOW THE JAILS ARE ALREADY OVERLOADED .
WELL THE THING IS THEY STAY UNTIL THEY ALL ARE UNANIMOUS I MEAN IF ONE IS DETERMINED THAT IT S YOU KNOW THAT HE FEELS THAT HE S YOU KNOW GOING AGAINST THE OTHER ELEVEN THEY ALL STAY UNTIL EVERYONE AGREES SO I DO NT KNOW IF IT WOULD LEAVE ANYONE GETTING OFF MORE UNLESS SOMEONE JUST GETS TIRED OF FIGHTING YOU KNOW JUST GIVES IN .
YEAH WELL IF IT S NO BUT THEY THEY WHAT IF THEY NEVER AGREE DOES NT IT JUST UH DO THEY HAVE TO GO BACK AND DO A WHOLE NEW TRIAL OR .
AND THEY HAVE TO STAY IN UNTIL THEY ALL AGREE .
AGREE .
YEAH I DO NT KNOW I M NOT SURE IF THEY GO I MEAN TO TWELVE NEW PEOPLE OR WHAT THEY DO EXACTLY BUT I DO KNOW FOR SURE THAT ALL TWELVE HAVE TO AGREE BEFORE HE CAN EITHER YOU KNOW EITHER HE OR SHE CAN EITHER GO FREE OR TO JAIL EITHER ONE .
YEAH AND THAT MAYBE ON THE LESSER CRIMES THAT ARE NT TOO SEVERE THAT S A LITTLE STRINGENT .
UHHUH .
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THERE S TWELVE THE THING ABOUT IT IS I THINK JURY SELECTION TOO A LOT OF TIMES UH THE LAWYERS ARE ABLE TO PICK AND CHOOSE WHO THEY WANT ON THE JURY AND THEY CAN SWAY THEM THAT WAY TOO .
THAT S THAT S JUST IT I DO NT UNDERSTAND YOU RE SUPPOSED TO YOU KNOW GO IN IF YOU HAVE YOU KNOW LIKE IF YOU VE NEVER HEARD OF THE PEOPLE BEFORE OR ANYTHING BUT I DO NT UNDERSTAND WITH RACIALISM AND THE WAY RELIGION IS AND EVERYTHING ELSE HOW YOU CAN GET PEOPLE THAT ARE TOTAL TOTALLY IMPARTIAL TO IT .
I KNOW I DO NT THINK WELL I GUESS YOU REALLY CA NT BUT THE OTHER THING IS WHEN THEY HAVE THE SENSATIONAL TRIALS HOW THEY GET PEOPLE WHO ARE NT SWAYED BY THE NEWS EITHER .
UHHUH .
SO UH BUT THEN AGAIN YOU KNOW THEY THE ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THEY ASKED IS SHOULD IT JUST BE DECIDED BY A JUDGE AND THAT S KIND OF TRICKY TOO BECAUSE A LOT OF POSITIONS THE JUDGES ARE IN THEY THEY CA NT BE FIRED YOU KNOW THEY HAVE TO THEY STAY TILL THEY RETIRE .
UHHUH .
AND SOMETIMES THEY RE PRETTY PARTIAL IN THEIR JUDGEMENTS TOO .
YEAH I AGREE I DO NT THINK IT SHOULD BE LEFT UP TO THE JUDGE ALONE NOT ONLY YOU KNOW THAT THEY HAVE TO STAY IN THERE BUT HEY HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU HEARD OF JUDGES BEING BOUGHT OVER .
I KNOW .
YOU KNOW SO IT IT S I I THINK I THINK IN IN THE END THE JUDGE HAS THE PRESIDING YOU KNOW UH VOTE I THINK HE CAN BE YOU KNOW I I DO NT KNOW IF IT S THE WAY IT IS IN REAL LIFE BUT I VE SEEN IT ON T V WHERE THE JURIES GO ONE WAY AND THE JUDGE TO TOTALLY FINDS IT OBNOXIOUS AND HE COMPLETELY YOU KNOW GOES THE OTHER WAY .
YEAH .
NOW I M NOT SURE IF THE JUDGE IS ALLOWED TO DO THAT IN EVERYDAY LIFE OR WHAT .
I THINK IN SOME CASES THEY ARE .
UHHUH .
BUT THEY KNOW THEY GET TO DECIDE HOW SEVERE THE SENTENCE IS .
YEAH .
IF IT S YOU KNOW SO THAT S ANOTHER THING WHERE THEY HAVE THE POWER BUT MAYBE JURIES COULD BE LESS THAN TWELVE PEOPLE OR WOULD THAT BE MORE FAIR OR LESS FAIR MAYBE THERE SHOULD BE MORE THAN TWELVE PEOPLE I DO NT .
OH OH MY GOD IF THERE WERE MORE THAN TWELVE CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW LONG THEY D BE SITTING .
I KNOW I DO NT KNOW .
I I THINK IT S JUST I DO NT I MEAN I THINK IT S AS FAIR AS IT CAN POSSIBLY GET BUT I JUST THINK IT S REALLY HAR YOU KNOW I MEAN SOME CASES GO ON FOR YEARS YOU KNOW .
THAT S TRUE AND I VE NEVER BEEN ON JURY DUTY BUT THEY HAVE TO KEEP GOING AND GOING AND GOING .
UHHUH .
AND LOSE THEIR NOT LOSE THEIR JOBS BUT NOT GO TO WORK .
YEAH I I DO NT KNOW HOW IT COULD BE MORE FAIR COURSE I DO NT KNOW MAYBE .
IT COULD BE .
MAYBE THEY SHOULD BE ASKING SOMEONE THAT S BEEN ON ON TRIAL BEFORE .
REALLY I VE NEVER SEEN ONE IN REAL LIFE EITHER SO I DO NT HAVE YOU KNOW I DO NT KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT IT BUT I THINK IT SEEMS THAT WE HAVE A A PRETTY FAIR SYSTEM COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTRIES I DO NT KNOW HOW WE COULD MAKE IT MORE FAIR I REALLY DO NT .
UHHUH .
THE UNANIMOUS VOTE IS QUESTIONABLE THOUGH AND AND HOW HOW MANY CASES GET JURIES MIGHT .
UHHUH .
WANT TO BE REVIEWED TOO .
YEAH .
BECAUSE UH I DO NT KNOW IF YOU SHOULD REALLY HAVE A JURY FOR S A SMALL INFRACTION BUT I M NOT SURE WHO GETS THEM .
UHHUH .
I DO NT KNOW ANYTHING .
I KNOW I DO NT KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT IT EITHER I JUST I DO NT KNOW I I GUESS MAYBE IF THEY D GO AND THEY D ASK SOMEONE IN JAIL YOU KNOW HOW THEY CAN MAKE IT MORE FAIR FOR THEM OR NOT BUT THEN AGAIN MAYBE THEY SHOULD BE THERE SO THAT IS FAIR .
RIGHT .
I DO NT I I DO NT THINK ANYONE S GOING TO COME UP WITH A BETTER WAY .
NO WHOEVER CAME UP WITH THIS WAS PRETTY SMART BECAUSE IT WAS PRETTY UH UNIQUE .
UHHUH .
I THINK WHEN THEY STARTED IT .
YEAH .
SO HOW LONG DO WE NEED TO TALK DO YOU KNOW .
OH I THINK WE CAN HANG UP ANYTIME .
OKAY UH IN UH WHAT DO I DO NOW DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING OR JUST .
NO I DO NT .
WAIT FOR SOMEONE ELSE .
WHAT ELSE TO SAY SO .
OKAY WELL IT WAS NICE TALKING WITH YOU .
IT WAS NICE TALKING TO YOU TOO BYE .
THANKS BYEBYE .
OKAY .
OKAY .
WELL I UH I GUESS BECAUSE I WORK QUITE A BIT WITH LAWYERS I M NOT A LAWYER UH THAT I FIND A LOT OF THINGS ARE SO SPECIALIZED THAT I M NOT SURE AND I I LOOK AT IT MORE FROM THE CIVIL SIDE OF THINGS THAT JURIES HAVE ANY SENSE OF OF THE VALUE OF AND WORTH SO THAT THEY HAVE REAL PROBLEMS WHEN IT COMES TO UH UH THEY CAN FIND GUILT OR INNOCENCE .
RIGHT .
UH BUT THEN WHEN YOU QUANTIFY THINGS AND THAT MIGHT ALSO HOLD CRIMINAL TRIALS FOR HOW MANY YEARS IS APPROPRIATE UH THAT THEY MIGHT LEAVE IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE WHO UH HAS EXPERTISE IN THAT .
RIGHT I AGREE TOO .
I DO NT THINK THE JURY SHOULD BE THE ONES .
THAT THAT PUT THE SENSE SENTENCINGS DOWN .
I THINK THE JUDGES SHOULD OR EVEN A PANEL OF OF LAWYERS IF IF IT GOT TO THAT POINT .
MIGHT BE BETTER AT THAN JUST REGULAR CIVIL PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
NOT KNOWING YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THINGS ARE FROM FROM MURDER ON UP TO LIKE TAX STUFF YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
BECAUSE I FIND THAT UH I VE BEEN ON A FEW JURIES AND UH AS A SAY I I TEND TO BE AROUND UH CIVIL CASES BECAUSE I VE BEEN AN EXPERT WITNESS SOME AND UH MANY MATTERS ARE SO COMPLICATED THAT IT S SO HARD TO UH COME UP WITH THE FAIR VALUE UH OR THE FAIR SENTENCE AND ONE THING THAT YOU GET IF YOU HAVE SOME EXPERTISE IS UH YOU KNOW THE RANGE OF OF POSSIBLE VALUES OR TERMS OR YOU KNOW HOW HEINOUS WAS THE CRIME .
RIGHT .
UH THAT UH WHEN I ONLY DO SOMETHING .
ONE TWO OR THREE TIMES I M HARDLY AN EXPERT ON IT AND MOST JURIES OVER A PERIOD OF FIVE OR TEN YEARS YOU MIGHT SIT ON THREE .
YEAH AND .
AND SO HOW DO YOU RELATE AS TO WHETHER THIS PARTICULAR ARMED ROBBERY WAS A YOU KNOW WORTH FIVE YEARS OR TWENTYFIVE .
RIGHT THAT S YEAH .
AND AND MOST PEOPLE .
THAT DO SIT ON JURIES SOME PEOPLE JUST SIT ON THEM ONCE IN THEIR LIFETIME YOU KNOW IF THEY RE THAT LUCKY SOMETIMES .
UHHUH .
OR YOU KNOW WHAT WHATEVER .
THE CASE MAY BE .
AND AND MAY NOT HAVE ANY IDEA OF WHAT WHAT .
THE STANDARD PUNISHMENT WOULD BE FOR IT .
YEAH .
AND IT THEY MAY HAVE SOME DIFFERENT IDEA I MEAN IT MIGHT BE MORE IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO PUT A SEN SEN SENTENCING DOWN THAT WAS UH LONGER YOU KNOW THAT DID NT FIT THE PUNISHMENT DID NT FIT THE CRIME .
UHHUH .
OR NOT LONG ENOUGH OR YOU KNOW WHATEVER .
THE CASE MAY BE .
YEAH .
I I THINK THE JUDGES DO HAVE THAT THAT BETTER KNOWLEDGE OF IT .
THE ONLY THING .
I WORRY ABOUT SOMETIMES IS IF IF YOU GET SOMEBODY IN THERE .
THAT THAT HAS A NAME THAT IS THE DEFENDANT AND YOU KNOW SOMETIMES MIGHT HAVE MORE PULL WHICH .
THAT DOES HAPPEN .
UHHUH .
I MEAN WE CA NT SAY IT DOES NT BECAUSE IT DOES HAPPEN .
I MEAN NOT EVERYBODY IS YOU KNOW HAS HAS THE RIGHT MORALS SOMETIMES .
PEOPLE CAN BE PAID OFF OR POLITICALLY .
UHHUH .
OR WHATEVER .
THE CASE MAY BE AND SOMETIMES THAT S NOT REAL FAIR EITHER THOUGH SO .
WELL ONE OF THE OTHERS THINGS .
THAT GETS ME ON ON THE JURIES IS THAT OFTEN IN THE NEWSPAPER I I TEND TO HEAR TWO THINGS THAT WELL THAT GO ON .
ONE IS YOU OFTEN SEE IN THE HEADLINES .
THE BIG NUMBERS .
UHHUH .
UH AND MANY OF THOSE GET OVERTURNED OR GET REDUCED IN TERMS OF SENTENCES OR GET CHANGED .
RIGHT .
BY A JUDGE OR AN APPEALS COURT AND THAT NEVER MAKES THE THE PRESS AND SO WHEN UH YOU OR I AS AN INDIVIDUAL GETS ON A JURY .
WE TEND TO HAVE CERTAIN MENTAL IMAGES OF WHAT S WHAT BECAUSE WE SEE THE HEADLINES UH AND WE DO NT HAVE A AGAIN A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE SO WE DO NT KNOW WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON WHAT IS UH REALLY THE RANGE OF SENTENCES OR AWARDS .
THAT ARE UH ARE ACTUALLY UH IN THE END .
RIGHT .
APPLIED .
RIGHT .
WELL WELL ALSO WHAT .
I DO NT THINK IS FAIR EITHER IS WHEN YOU HAVE LIKE A SAY A RAPIST COME IN AND AND HIS ATTORNEY GETS HIS SENTENCES SENTENCING REDUCED BECAUSE HE S GONE TO A LESSER CHARGE LIKE I DO NT KNOW WHAT ASSAULT OR SOMETHING OR .
UHHUH .
BUT WHICH .
THAT DOES NT MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME EITHER .
I KNOW IT S HARD TO PROVE RAPE AND WHATNOT AND AND AND THE PERSON .
THAT WAS RAPED OR WHATEVER DOES NT I MEAN IT S EMBARRASSING .
UHHUH .
AND ALL THIS OTHER STUFF AND THEY THEY RE PUT ON LIKE THEY WERE THE ONES .
THAT CAUSED IT OR WHATEVER BUT TO ME WHEN YOU DO THE CRIME THEN YOU SHOULD PAY FOR WHATEVER .
YOU DID AND AND YOU SHOULD NT BE ABLE TO GO ON THE LESSER CHARGE .
I DO NT I DO NT THINK THAT S RIGHT BECAUSE ALL .
S .
THAT S GOING TO DO IS SAY OH WELL YOU KNOW THAT WAS A BREEZE I CAN GO OUT AND DO IT AGAIN AND YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
HAVE THE SAME THING HAPPEN .
THAT S THAT S NOT RIGHT .
WELL THAT S WHERE UH THE ROLE OF JURIES IS IS RESTRICTED AND I M NOT SURE I D WANT TO CHANGE THAT ASPECT OF IT ONE IS IT S RESTRICTED IN THE SENSE THAT JURIES ONLY DECIDE THE CHARGES .
THAT ARE ACTUALLY UH BROUGHT YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
IF IT S FIRST DEGREE RAPE SECOND DEG DEGREE RAPE OR WHATEVER THEY ONLY GET TO DECIDE ON THAT WELL OKAY THIS PERSON HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH FIRST DEGREE RAPE UH AND YOU CAN DECIDE GUILT OR INNOCENCE ON THAT .
UHHUH .
UH SUCH LIKE MAYBE IN MURDER .
THEY GET TO CHOOSE WHETHER IT S UH PREMEDITATED OR ONE OR TWO OF THE LESSER DEGREES .
THE OTHER THING THAT JURIES ARE RESTRICTED ON AND AND AT LEAST TO ME .
THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE FRUSTRATING THINGS IN MY EVEN IN MY OWN EXPERIENCES THAT YOU USUALLY DO NT GET TO HEAR ALL THE INFORMATION .
YEAH .
IT .
S .
WHAT INFORMATION IS PRESENTED AND UH I DO NT KNOW THAT JURIES HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW MORE BECAUSE IN A SENSE .
WE CALL THOSE SAFEGUARDS BUT OFTEN JURIES HEAR ONLY A FRACTION OF THE OF THE STORY WHEN THEY HAVE TO DECIDE GUILT OR INNOCENCE .
AND TO ME HOW CAN YOU HOW CAN YOU MAKE A DECISION IF YOU DO NT HAVE ALL OF THE EVIDENCE IN FRONT OF WHETHER IT BE WHETHER IT PERTAINS TO THE CASE OR NOT SOMEBODY THINKS IT IT HAD BECAUSE THEY VE GOT IT THERE .
UHHUH .
SO THE LAWYERS THE TWO LAWYERS ARE THE ONES .
THAT HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION .
YEAH AND .
DO NT THEY .
THE TRUTH .
THAT S BROUGHT OUT IS UH AS I SAY WHEN I VE HEARD ABOUT YOU KNOW THE OATH IS TO TELL THE TRUTH THE WHOLE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT THEY WANT UH THEY DO NT WANT UH THE WHOLE TRUTH .
I MEAN .
THEY ONLY PUT PART OF IT .
YOU CAN SAY YEAH .
YEAH .
THE BECAUSE STORIES LOOK VERY DIFFERENT WHEN YOU HEAR DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE OF THE TRUTH .
RIGHT .
WELL THAT S JUST LIKE THAT OLD WITNESS GAME WELL IT S A GAME KIDS PLAY TOO BUT UH SOMEBODY DID IT JUST FOR YOUR TRAIN OF THOUGHT WHERE THEY THEY SHOWED SOMETHING AND THEY ASKED THEY THERE WERE UH LIKE FOUR PEOPLE .
ALL RIGHT AND AND YOUR OCCUPATION IS TEACHING .
I M A I M A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER .
SUBSTITUTE TEACHER .
IS IS THIS PAT I M TALKING TO NOW .
YES IT IS IT IS .
YEAH I M A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER IN I BELIEVE THE SAME SCHOOL SYSTEM .
WE .
BOTH WORK IN .
RIGHT .
WELL I WAS JUST TRYING TO MAKE AN INTRODUCTION HERE .
OH OKAY .
BUT OH AND AND I HAVE NT TOLD YOU .
I M GOING TO BE AT A DIFFERENT SCHOOL .
THIS YEAR NOW .
OH .
I VE JUST GOTTEN A ANOTHER JOB AT AN ELEMENTARY LIBRARY AT BARRON .
WELL I BET YOU RE YOU RE YOU MAY DRESS DIFFERENTLY THEN FOR THAT .
RIGHT .
I WELL NOT REALLY .
I VE GOT THE EVERY DAY .
I VE GOT TO UH READ TO KINDERGARTNERS SO I M GOING TO BE DOWN ON THE FLOOR WITH THEM .
I VE GOT ABOUT FORTY KINDERGARTNERS I M GOING TO BE DOING WORKING WITH EVERY DAY FOR UH YOU KNOW A HALF HOUR .
SO I LL BE I LL PROBABLY BE WEARING SLACKS AS OFTEN AS I DO BECAUSE I M I M IF I M GOING TO BE DOWN ON THE FLOOR MESSING WITH THEM I M NOT GOING TO WEAR NYLONS AND YOU KNOW .
WELL .
NICE NYLONS AND DRESSES .
WHAT .
I WEAR SOMETIMES DEPENDS ON ON HOW COLD I THINK THE SCHOOL MIGHT BE OR WHAT ROOM .
I MIGHT BE IN .
RIGHT .
SINCE I M A SUB AND HAVE DIFFERENT ROOMS TO GO TO .
AND ALWAYS CARRY A SWEATER .
WELL OF COURSE YOU VE BEEN AT CLARK ENOUGH THAT YOU KNOW IT S ALWAYS COLD .
YES .
BUT YOU DO NT KNOW UH I GUESS AT SOME OF THE OTHER SCHOOLS YOU GO TO UNLESS YOU VE BEEN THERE .
NO YOU TRY TO LAYER SO YOU CAN ADD OR OR .
SUBTRACT .
OR TAKE OFF .
RIGHT .
AND IT S IT S INTERESTING TO NOTICE WHEN YOU GO TO DIFFERENT SCHOOLS THAT SOME ARE A LITTLE MORE FANCIER THAN OTHERS AND HAVE A VERY CASUAL UH .
I I THINK SOME OF THE DRESS CODES ARE DIFFERENT AT DIFFERENT SCHOOLS .
THAT S ONE OF THINGS ONE OF THE THINGS I ASK ABOUT YOU KNOW WHETHER WHETHER SHE WOULD ALLOW SLACKS AND SHE SAID SHE DOES NT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT SHE JUST DID NT LIKE SLOPPY DRESSING .
UHHUH .
AND AND I SAID WELL YOU KNOW THAT WAS OKAY .
AND I M BASICALLY I JUST YOU KNOW I WEAR SLACKS YEAR ROUND EXCEPT EVERY ABOUT ONCE A WEEK .
I TRY TO WEAR A SKIRT .
AND AND IN THE WINTER YOU KNOW I JUST ADD A MAYBE WEAR LONGER SLEEVE SHIRTS THAN I DO IN THE SUMMER .
AND ADD A HEAVIER JACKET OR YOU KNOW WEAR JACKETS MORE IN THE WINTER THAN I DO IN THE SUMMER .
UHHUH .
THAT S ABOUT I DO NT I DO NT REALLY WORK IN A PROFESSION .
THAT REQUIRES THAT I WEAR A BUSINESS SUIT AND YOU KNOW LOOK REALLY .
RIGHT AND WELL FOR ME SOMETIMES THEY EVEN HAVE DRESS UP DAYS OR THEY YOU KNOW HAVE HAVE SPIRIT WEEK THAT THAT YOU WEAR YOUR DIFFERENT OUTFITS .
YEAH .
AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE COLOR FOR THAT PARTICULAR SCHOOL IF YOU IF YOU CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE IN .
RIGHT .
SPIRIT WEEK .
AND ONE MIGHT BE A HAT DAY WHERE YOU HAVE TO COME UP WITH SOME .
AND YOU NEVER KNOW THAT THOUGH .
SORT OF HAT .
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU RE GOING IN DO YOU .
NO BUT BECAUSE I SORT OF STICK TO SEVERAL SCHOOLS UH I M USUALLY AWARE THAT THERE MIGHT BE A SPIRIT WEEK GOING ON AND AND MIGHT MIGHT REMEMBER TO DO IT .
RIGHT RIGHT .
AND THEN MANY SCHOOLS ON A PARTICULAR DAY DURING UH I GUESS FOOTBALL SEASON MAYBE ALL YEAR LONG THEY WEAR THE SCHOOL COLORS FOR UH GAME DAY .
RIGHT .
WHICH .
ON WHAT THURSD THURSDAY .
RIGHT IT MIGHT BE THURSDAY FOR THE HIGH SCHOOLS AND IT MAY BE FRIDAY FOR THE SENIOR HIGH SCHOOLS .
RIGHT RIGHT .
SO THAT WOULD KIND OF GIVE YOU .
A A CLUE I GUESS AND AND SOMETIMES YOU GET THE LONG TERM STUFF SO YOU RE AWARE AHEAD OF TIME .
YEAH .
OF WHAT S GOING ON .
THAT SO THAT S AND I DO NT KNOW YOU KNOW I I THINK ABOUT WELL THE DRESS CODE .
THEY HAVE FOR THE KIDS YOU KNOW .
ARE THEY PUT ONE ON THE PARENTS OR THE TEACHERS AND SAY THEY HAVE TO THE MEN HAVE TO WEAR TIES AND THERE CAN BE NO BLUE JEANS WORN AND BECAUSE SOME OF THE TEACHERS I KNOW WEAR UH DRESS UP JEANS NOT SLOPPY LOOKING JEANS .
UHHUH .
BUT TAPERED JEANS THAT THEY VE HAD DRY CLEANED SO THEY HAVE GOT THE CREASE AND UH YOU KNOW THEY LL WEAR IT WITH A NICE TOP .
AND AND UH I DO NT KNOW THAT THAT LOOKS THAT BAD .
BUT IF YOU RE GOING TO TELL THE KIDS THEY .
C HAVE TO DRESS UP I GUESS YOU CAN TELL THE TEACHERS THAT TOO .
YEAH IT IT I SEE THAT THE I THINK THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHERS OR MAYBE EVEN THE MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHERS DRESS A LITTLE FANCIER THAN THAN SOME OF THE HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS I THINK .
UHHUH .
BUT IT I THINK IT VARIES IT IT JUST SO MUCH .
ANYTHING ANYTHING CAN GO .
UHHUH .
AND YOU CAN SEE IN SOME OF THE DEPARTMENTS IN SOME OF THE SCHOOLS LIKE HISTORY AT CLARK THEY RE ALL PRETTY FANCY .
BUT THEY RE JUST SORT OF INTO CLOTHES AND THEN THERE .
S OTHER DEPARTMENTS .
RIGHT .
THAT ARE NT .
RIGHT RIGHT .
AND THEY LL JUST WEAR YOUR COMMON ORDINARY YOU KNOW WHATEVER .
YOU MIGHT .
YEAH THERE S A COUPLE .
MIGHT SAY .
TEACHERS UP THERE .
THAT THAT DO DRESS UP MORE THAN OTHERS .
RIGHT .
RIGHT .
AND SO YOU TRY TO MAYBE FOLLOW THOSE IF YOU KNOW YOU RE GOING THERE YOU DO NT WANT TO DRESS TOO TACKY BECAUSE YOU RE GOING TO BE IN THE SAME ROOM WITH THEM .
RIGHT .
WELL AND YOU ALWAYS COURSE IT S A STANDING JOKE YOU KNOW WHEN THE WHEN THE MEN COME IN IN A A TIE AND A SUIT COAT YOU SAY YOU KNOW WHAT HAVE YOU GOT A JOB INTERVIEW TODAY OR .
OR YOU RE GOING .
THERE THERE S .
TO BE OBSERVED .
THERE S USUALLY YEAH THERE S USUALLY SOMETHING GOING ON THAT THAT UH AND WOULD WOULD UH CAUSE THAT TO HAPPEN .
YEAH .
AND I I DO NT KNOW HOW A COACH WOULD FEEL IF THAT TEACHES HEALTH OR ENG YOU KNOW ENGLISH OR WHATEVER THAT THEY HAD TO WEAR A TIE .
I SOME OF THOSE MALE COACHES THAT MIGHT REALLY .
RIGHT .
THEY GO AROUND IN THEIR LITTLE COACHING SHORTS OR .
RIGHT AND A TSHIRT .
PARACHUTE PANTS .
RIGHT .
THAT I DID NT EVER UNDERSTAND .
I MEAN WE VE GOT COACHES .
THAT TEACH HEALTH FOR FIVE PERIODS AND THEN HAVE ATHLETICS SIXTH PERIOD SO .
YEAH WELL AT .
WHETHER .
VINES THE COACHES DO NT DO THAT .
THEY THEY DRESS PRETTY GOOD I WOULD SAY AND THEN THEY GO TO THEIR COACHING AND THEY THEY PUT THEIR SHORTS .
CHANGE THEN .
ON THERE .
WELL SEE THAT S WHAT .
I WOULD THINK .
UHHUH .
THAT S WHAT .
I WOULD THINK .
BUT THEY THEY DO NT LOOK YOU KNOW THEY DO NT WEAR THEIR SWEAT PANTS OR OR ANYTHING .
THEY RE THEY DRESS LIKE ANY OTHER TEACHER WOULD IN .
RIGHT .
IN A CLASSROOM SITUATION NOT IN P E .
COURSE WE HAD HAD ONE COACH ONE PERIOD .
HE D TEACH P E AND THE NEXT PERIOD HEALTH AND THEN A PERIOD OF P E .
THOSE .
I CAN UNDERSTAND .
AND AND THAT S HARD .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW SO HE JUST LEFT WARMUPS ON BUT BUT UH NO I THINK REALLY PROBABLY THEY COULD THEY COULD UH REALLY AND I DO NT KNOW IF IF THEY PUT MAKE UNIFORMS .
THE THING FOR THE KIDS I GUESS THE TEACHERS WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW SUIT WITH A DARK SKIRT AND A WHITE TOP AND .
I DO NT THINK WE LL EVER GET TO THAT .
YOU DO NT THINK SO .
NO I DO NT THINK .
I THINK WE RE GOING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION .
IT S THE PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS THAT I GUESS MANY TI THEY VE HAD UNIFORMS FOR YEARS I R DO NT REALLY KNOW IF THEY STILL DO .
WELL SOME OF THEM YES THEY DO AND AND IT S NOT .
IT CERTAINLY MAKES IT EASIER TO DRESS .
AT SOME OF THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS BUT EVEN THERE S A COUPLE PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN DALLAS WHERE WHERE THE KIDS WEAR UNIFORMS AND THE TEACHERS YOU KNOW DRESS .
UHHUH .
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THAT .
WELL IT S CERTAINLY CHEAPER AND EASIER IN THE LONG RUN I THINK THAT YOU DO NT HAVE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR WARDROBE .
UHHUH .
WELL I I THINK IT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE AT SCHOOL .
I I DO NT THINK WE SHOULD BE SPENDING TIME SAYING SOMEBODY .
S WEARING TORN CLOTHING OR WEARING SH TOO SHORTS TOO SHORT OR THEY VE GOT THE REALLY SHORT SKIRT AND THE BLACK NYLONS AND THE HIGH YOU KNOW I MEAN .
UHHUH .
IT S A LOT OF TROUBLE TO TO TAKE CARE OF THAT .
AND OF COURSE THE KIDS SAY THEN WHY BOTHER JUST LET ME WEAR WHAT .
I WANT .
AND AND YET WE CA NT TO THAT EITHER .
I D LIKE TO SEE THEM GO TO TO NOT NECESSARILY A UNIFORM BUT SAYING THAT THEY VE GOT TO WEAR A BUTTON DOWN SHIRT .
YOU KNOW THAT WOULD THAT WOULD ALLEVIATE ANY TSHIRTS WITH SAYINGS ON THEM .
BUT IF THEY COULD WEAR A BUTTONDOWN SHIRT AND A PAIR OF DARK SLACKS AND THEY COULD BUY THEM ANYWHERE THEY WANTED AND .
YEAH BUT I DOUBT THAT THAT WOULD COME AB .
AND THEN THE GIRLS .
THAT THAT WILL COME ABOUT .
JUST .
RIGHT .
YEAH I I .
I DO NT NO NOT IN PLANO .
NO NOT .
THEY MAY GET A .
YEAH .
BUT THEY SAID IN THE DALLAS SCHOOLS THAT THAT HELPS THEIR EDUCATIONAL PROCESS THERE .
WELL I THINK IT DOES .
IT IT TAKES THEIR MINDS OFF OF OF TRYING TO COMPETE .
HIGHLAND PARK S THINKING ABOUT GOING THAT ROUTE .
UHHUH .
SO IT AND THEN I THINK THAT S GOING TO PUSH TEACHERS TO DRESS A LOT MORE PROFESSIONALLY THAN THEY DO .
YEAH I I DO NT THINK A LOT OF TEACHERS ARE VERY PROFESSIONAL BUT .
YEAH I AGREE WITH YOU ON .
OKAY .
ALL RIGHT .
UM WE HAVE SMALL CHILDREN TWO AND FOUR .
UHHUH .

I VE GOT A FORD MUSTANG NOW AND I HATE IT .
DO YOU REALLY .
YEAH .
WHAT YEAR IS IT .
IT S A EIGHTYEIGHT .
AND WHY DO NT YOU LIKE THE MUSTANG .
IT S UM I VE HAD ONE PROBLEM WITH IT AFTER THE OTHER .
I LL BE DARNED .
THE PA THE PAINTS PEELING OFF OF IT AND THERE S NO REASON FOR IT YOU KNOW .
WELL YOU KNOW THE OLD SAYINGS ABOUT FORDS WHAT .
THEY STAND FOR .
FIX OR REPAIR DAILY .
THERE YOU GO .
OR FIND THEM .
RE ROAD DEAD .
WELL UH .
THAT UH I UH IT S MY ELECTRICAL SYSTEM SHORTED OUT LIKE TWO OR THREE TIMES AND IT S BEEN TORN UP SINCE APRIL AND I AND LUCKILY EVERYTHING WAS UNDER WARRANTY SO IT S ONLY COSTING LIKE A HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS TO GET IT FIXED .
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE TWO THOUSAND .
WELL WE VE ALWAYS UH WE VE ALWAYS HAD OLDSMOBILES AND UH BEEN VERY UH HAPPY WITH OLDSMOBILES BUT UH MY WIFE THOUGHT SHE WANTED TO GET A FORD MUSTANG AND THEN SHE .
KIND OF CHANGED HER MIND AND THINKS HER NEXT CAR OUGHT TO BE ONE OF THOSE UH MITSUBISHI ECLIPSES .
SHE .
REAL .
THOSE THOSE ARE NICE CARS .
SHE LIKES UH LIKES THOSE .
SHE HAS A SISTER .
THAT LIVES IN UH PHOENIX .
THAT HAS ONE AND UH REALLY UH ENJOYS IT .
WELL WHAT UH WHAT THINGS DO YOU CONSIDER WHEN YOU BUY A CAR .
UM THE GAS MILEAGE FOR ONE THING AND I VE I VE I VE ALWAYS HAD LIKE STICK SHIFT .
I WANT TO THE NEXT CAR .
I GET I WANT IT TO BE AUTOMATIC .
I SEE .
I UH I I HATE DRIVING ANYWAY AND THEN AND CHANGING GEARS AT STOP LIGHTS AND STUFF IS REALLY GETTING ON MY NERVES NOW .
YEAH ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU RE IN HIGH TRAFFIC AREAS .
YEAH .
AND HAVE TO MESS WITH THAT ALL THE TIME .
AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WORK NINE TO FIVE OR EIGHT TO FIVE AND YOU RE IN RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC TO AND FROM WORK UNFORTUNATELY .
THAT MAKES IT VERY FRUSTRATING .
AND I LOOK AND ONE OF THE THINGS WITH CHRYSLER RIGHT NOW IS IS THEIR THE WARRANTIES THAT THEY HAVE AND I I FEEL LIKE THEIR EVERYBODY .
I VE TALKED TO THAT OWNS ONE HAS HAS HAS BEEN REAL PLEASED WITH IT AND I LIKE THE THE DRIVER S AIR BAG I LIKE THAT .
NOW THIS IS A LEBARON .
UH YEAH WELL ALL CHRYSLER PRODUCTS HAS IT IN THERE BUT LEBARON WOULD BE THE NEXT CAR .
I GET YEAH .
I SURE LIKE THE UH CONVERTIBLE THOSE RAG TOP LEBARONS THEY REALLY LOOK SPORTY .
YEAH YEAH I LIKE I LIKE THAT TOO HUH BUT UH I I COULD NT AFFORD THE INSURANCE ON ONE OF THOSE .
WELL UH WE ALWAYS THIS LAST OLDSMOBILE .
WE BOUGHT UH IT S AN EIGHTYSEVEN BUT WE BOUGHT IT IN EIGHTYEIGHT YOU KNOW RIGHT AT THE END OF THE YEAR WHEN THEY WERE TRYING TO GET RID OF THEM .
YEAH .
AND UH WE FOUND THAT UH WE FOUND A REAL GOOD INTEREST RATE YOU KNOW WHEN THEY RE TRYING TO GET RID OF THOSE CARS AT THE END OF THE YEAR LIKE THAT THEY REALLY COME DOWN ON THEIR PRICES AND UH UH YOU KNOW WE LOOKED AROUND AT USED CARS AND WE REALLY COULD NT UH AFFORD THE PAYMENTS ON A USED CAR BECAUSE UH IF YOU GO TO THE BANK AND TRY TO GET A LOAN THEY WANT TO CHARGE TWELVE THIRTEEN PERCENT YOU KNOW AND WE ENDED UP I THINK WITH LIKE A FOUR AND A HALF PERCENT INTEREST RATE ON A BRAND NEW CAR AND THE PAYMENTS .
WELL THAT S WHAT .
I M PAYING ON MINE NOW .
I HAD TO GET LIKE A FIRST TIME MY DAD S ALWAYS COSIGNED ON ON MY MY LOANS OR WHATEVER AND THIS IS ONE WHEN I BOUGHT I GOT MY MUSTANG .
THIS TIME WAS BY MYSELF BECAUSE I GOT ON MY OWN OR WHATEVER AND UM I HAD SAID THEY THEY SAID IT HAD TO BE LIKE A FIRST TIME BUYER S CAR OR WHATEVER AND THEY RE CHARGING ME UNREASONABLE MUMBLEX INTEREST BUT I VE GOT EIGHT MORE PAYMENTS AND IT S PAID FOR .
WELL THAT S GREAT .
BUT I GOT IT WHEN I GOT IT WHEN THE EIGHTYEIGHTS FIRST CAME OUT IT S A IT S IT S A GOOD CAR I MEAN I GOT IN EIGHTYSEVEN I GUESS IN LIKE NOVEMBER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND .
UHHUH .
WELL WHEN OUR KIDS WERE YOUNGER WE REALLY WANTED A TWO DOOR .
OUR FIRST CAR WAS AN OLDSMOBILE BACK IN SEVENTYSEVEN .
IT WAS A TWO DOOR CUTLASS SUPREME AND UH IT JUST HAPPENED THAT WHEN WE LOOKED FOR OUR OUR NEW CAR THEY HAD A THING GOING WITH OLDSMOBILE AND IF YOU D BUY A A NEW OLDSMOBILE THEY D GIVE YOU .
FOUR HUNDRED REBATE BECAUSE IT WAS THEIR SEVENTYFIFTH ANNIVERSARY .
UHHUH .
I BELIE YEAH SEVENTYFIFTH ANNIVERSARY .
SO IN ADDITION TO EVERYTHING ELSE WE GOT OFF THE CAR ALL .
WE HAD TO DO IS SHOW THEM OUR UH PAPERS ON OUR FIRST CAR AND THEY GAVE US .
ANOTHER FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS OFF ON IT .
SO WE WE GOT A FOUR DOOR .
THIS TIME AND I SORT OF WENT MORE FOR THE UH THE COMFORT FACTOR AND UH I LIKED THE SMALLER CARS BUT I M A BIGGER PERSON AND I I REALLY LIKE COMFORT YOU KNOW DRIVING ALONG THE ROAD AND STUFF .
WELL THAT S ANOTHER BIG FACTOR OF MINE .
NEXT NEXT CAR .
I GET S GOING TO BE A FOUR DOOR TOO .
SOMETHING WITH SOME ROOM .
YEAH .
BECAUSE I UH MY MUSTANG IS IS IS TWO DOOR WITH BUCKET SEATS AND YOU BUY GROCERIES AND STUFF LIKE THAT .
AND IF YOU TRY TO TAKE ANYBODY YOU KNOW GO TO THE SHOW OR GO OUT FOR SUPPER AND YOU GO AS A FOURSOME .
UH NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE I THINK IS A PROBLEM INASMUCH AS THE QUALITY OF HEALTH CARE THAT PEOPLE WOULD RECEIVE .
RIGHT .
YEAH BECAUSE UH THE ARTICLES THAT I VE READ REGARDING NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE IN CANADA AND ENGLAND HAS INDICATED THAT UH WHAT I STAY STAY IN LINE FOR UH FOUR HOURS TO GET AN ASPIRIN FROM A DOCTOR .
RIGHT .
YEAH I M I M SORT OF MIXED ON THIS .
I THINK THAT THE THE ANSWER MAY LIE IN UH NOT IN SO MUCH A UH NATIONAL KIND OF MEDICAL THING THAT LI LIKE ENGLAND HAS BUT MORE OF A UM NATIONAL INSURANCE UH SORT OF CLEARINGHOUSE OR WHATEVER .
I THINK THAT UH TOO MANY UH THE PROBLEM WITH WITH RIGHT NOW IS W THAT WE VE GOT TOO MANY DIFFERENT HEALTH INSURANCES THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO GO THROUGH AND AND I THINK THAT I THINK YOU YOU MENTIONED CANADA .
I THINK THAT THEY HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE UH THEY THE GOVERNMENT DEALS WITH THE WITH I MEAN YOU YOU GO TO WHOEVER .
YOU WANT BUT FILE THROUGH ONE ONE S PARTICULAR .
UM I SEE .
UH SETUP AND THAT WAY .
THEY THEY ARE ABLE TO REDUCE PRICES BECAUSE THEY VE YOU KNOW IT S IT S ALL ONE ONE CENTRALIZED THING .
YEAH .
WELL I I THINK THAT UH AGAIN HAVING GONE THROUGH A PERIOD WHEN I WAS OUT OF WORK AND HAD TO BUY HEALTH INSURANCE ON MY OWN .
IF YOU DO NT HAVE A COMPANY SUPPORTING YOU IN THE UH PICKING UP THE MAJOR PORTION OF YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE .
UHHUH .
THE COST IS P ALMOST PROHIBITIVE .
RIGHT .
UH I I WAS LISTENING UH ON THE RADIO .
THE OTHER DAY AND THEY WERE TALKING THAT S S SOMETHING LIKE THIS I THINK THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT UM THE MONEY .
THAT COULD BE SAVED UM IN ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND SO FORTH NATIONWIDE BY CONSOLIDATING INTO SORT OF A NATIONAL INSURANCE PROVIDER UM COULD UH COULD THEY COULD MAKE IT I I PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE TO TO PEOPLE .
WHO COULD NT AFFORD IT JUST BY THE MONEY .
THEY WOULD SAVE .
YEAH .
UH WE RE CURRENTLY WHERE I M WORKING NOW UNDER BLUE CROSS .
I DO NT KNOW WHAT .
THE TOTAL COST OF THE PROGRAM IS BUT FOR DEPENDENT COVERAGE .
I M PAYING A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DOLLARS .
A A MONTH OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
RIGHT .
SO I ASSUME THAT PROBABLY THE TOTAL COVE COST IS PROBABLY .
THREE FIFTY TO FOUR HUNDRED .
THEY RE PROBABLY PICKING UP ABOUT HALF OF IT .
RIGHT .
AND THAT S A PRETTY GOOD POLICY BUT IF YOU HAD SOMETHING LIKE ONE OF THESE UH .
HEALTH MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS .
OR ONE OF WHATEVER .
THE TYPE NAME IS .
YEAH H M O .
H M O UH WHERE THE UH WHERE YOU GO TO THE DOCTOR AND IT ONLY COSTS YOU .
TEN DOLLARS AND THE INSURANCE PICKS UP THE REST .
IF YOU TRIED TO BUY SOMETHING LIKE THAT I M PROB IT WOULD PROBABLY BE FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS .
A MONTH FOR JUST THE COST OF SOMETHING .
YEAH AND THEY RE THEY RE FAIRLY EXPENSIVE .
I I UM I HA I WAS ON AN H M O UH UP UNTIL LAST YEAR .
YEAH .
AND UH THROUGH WORK .
AND IT WAS I FORGET HOW MUCH I PAID A MONTH BUT IT WAS MUCH YOU KNOW IS AT LEAST TWICE IF NOT MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE REGULAR HEALTH CARE .
YEAH .
AND UH THE REASON .
I I QUITE WAS BECAUSE OF UH NOT BECAUSE I DID NT LIKE IT I I REALLY KIND OF DID .
UH THE REASON .
I QUITE WAS JUST BECAUSE THE THE DOCTOR .
A A CERTAIN DOCTOR THAT WE EN ENJOYED GOING TO WAS NO LONGER ASSOCIATED WITH THAT H M O SO WE MY WIFE DECIDED SHE WANTED TO TO STAY WITH THAT DOCTOR .
YEAH .
SO WE WENT TO THE TO THE THE MEDICAL INSURANCE THAT WE HAVE AT HERE AT WORK .
YEAH .
AND UH I UH I LIKE THE I LIKE THE CONVENIENCE OF THE H M O IN IN A CERTAIN RESPECT BECAUSE IT UH EVEN THOUGH YOU RE ONCE YOU FIND THE DOCTOR THAT YOU LIKE IT S NOT A PROBLEM .
YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE COMPLAIN SAYING WELL I DO NT WANT TO UH HAVE TO BE TOLD WHO .
I NEED TO GO TO BUT YOU KNOW IF YOU DO NT HAVE A DOCTOR ANYWAY NORMALLY IT DOES NT REALLY MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE .
YEAH THAT S RIGHT .
BECAUSE YOU CAN YOU KNOW IF IF YOU FIND SOMEONE .
YOU REALLY LIKE AND THEN WE DID FIND SEVERAL GOOD DOCTORS .
AND UM LIKE YOU SAY IT S UH FIVE DOLLARS .
AN OFFICE VISIT .
AND UM MY WIFE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL HAD OUR HAD OUR DAUGHTER AND I THINK HER TOTAL BILL WAS AROUND THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS .
OH GOODNESS .
FOR EVERYTHING .
UH THAT INCLUDED UH YOU KNOW THE DOCTORS THE TIME THE THE HOSPITAL A AN EVERYTHING .
DELIVERY ROOM AND EVERYTHING .
DELIVERY ROOM AND EVERYTHING .
YEAH .
INCLUDE INCLUDING A PRIVATE ROOM BECAUSE THERE WAS A LITTLE EXTRA THAT SHE HAD TO PAY BUT THAT WAS THAT WAS STILL INCLUDED IN THAT PR THAT COST SO .
YEAH .
IT S REALLY NICE BECAUSE THEY TH YOU KNOW THEIR THEIR ATTITUDE IS DIFFERENT THAN THAN A REGULAR UH INSURANCE UH HEALTH INSURANCE UH THE IN IN A H M O YOU KNOW THEY RE TRYING TO PREVENT A PROBLEM BY BY KEEPING THE COST DOWN AT THE FRONT END .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW AND HAVE YOU COME IN YOU KNOW THEY THEY CHARGE FIVE DOLLARS .
A S .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW POP YOU RE MORE WILLING TO GO IN AND TRY .
MUMBLEX .
TO TAKE CARE OF A PROBLEM BEFORE IT GROWS BIG .
AS TO A COMPANY S BENEFIT .
TO HAVE A PROGRAM LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT KEEPS THEIR EMPLOYEES HEALTHY AND ON THE JOB .
YEAH .
BECAUSE THEY DO NT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT GOING IN AND AND PAYING .
UH SEVENTYFIVE DOLLARS TO HAVE THE DOCTOR LOOK AT YOU FOR TEN MINUTES .
RIGHT .
THAT S A .
YEAH I I UH I I REALLY LIKED IT .
WE .
BOTH MY WIFE AND I .
BOTH DID .
YOU YOU DO NT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT FILLING OUT FORMS UH YOU KNOW FOR REIMBURSEMENT AND ALL OR YOU KNOW GETTING PAID EIGHT PERCENT OF OF WHATEVER .
YOU JUST PAY THE THE FIVE DOLLARS RIGHT THEN AND THEN YOU RE DONE WITH IT .
YEAH .
BUT HERE AGAIN THE THE DOCTOR S PRACTICES IN HOSPITALS .
HAVE GON BECOME FAIRLY SIZABLE BUSINESSES UNDER THEMSELVES NOW .
UHHUH .
UH YOU TAKE A HOSPITAL UH THE PHYSICAL PLANT .
ITSELF YOU HAVE TO PAY YOUR SHARE OF THE OPERATING OF THAT EIGHT STORY BUILDING UH WHEN THE E ROOMS ARE EMPTY .
RIGHT .
SO THEY SPREAD THE COSTS OUT OVER UH ALL THE PATIENT COSTS AND UH THAT S HOW YOU COME UP WITH ASPIRIN .
THAT COSTS FOUR DOLLARS APIECE AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
RIGHT .
THE HORROR STORIES THAT YOU HEAR ABOUT PEOPLE GOING INTO THE HOSPITAL FOR A WEEK AND UH IT BEING .
A FOUR THOUSAND DOLLAR BILL .
WELL THEY AND YOU KNOW THEY RE ALSO P TAKE THEY RE TAKING UP THE COST OF PEOPLE .
WHO CA NT PAY .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW THEY THEY GET A LOT OF UH A LOT OF UH PEOPLE .
WHO ARE J JUST HAVE TO BE THERE AND CA NT AFFORD IT AND SO THEY THEY KNOW THEY RE NOT GOING TO GET PA .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW GET MONEY FROM THEM SO THEY .
YEAH .
HAVE TO ABSORB IT SOMEWHERE ELSE .
YEAH .
MY DAUGHTER AND SONINLAW HAD A BABY .
HERE ABOUT UH WHAT HE HE LL BE THREE IN AUGUST .
UHHUH .
AND UH THEIR INSURANCE PLAN THAT THEY RE UNDER ENCOURAGES YOU TO SHORTEN YOUR STAY IN THE HOSPITAL .
RIGHT .
AND LIKE SHE WENT IN SHE HAD THE BABY AND SHE WAS OUT IN TWO DAYS TIME .
RIGHT .
AND IT WAS TREATED ALMOST LIKE IT WAS AN OUTPATIENT VISIT TO THE HOSPITAL .
RIGHT .
THE THE DEDUCTIBLES DID NT APPLY .
RIGHT .
AND SO THAT S ONE WAY ONE WAY .
THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE TRYING TO HOLD COSTS DOWN IS BY UH OKAY IF YOU LL SHORTEN YOUR STAY THEN WE WILL UH WAIVE THE DEDUCTIBLE .
RIGHT .
OUR OUR INSURANCE IS UH IS DOING SOMETHING SIMILAR WHERE THEY RE ALSO GOING TO MOR .
OKAY UH .
DO YOU HAVE ANNUAL FAMILY REUNIONS OR .
UH YEAH UH OUR THE MY MOTHER S SIDE OF THE FAMILY IS QUITE LARGE OR WELL WAS QUITE LARGE AT ONE TIME AND UH THEY UH FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER HAVE HAD UH A YEARLY REUNION UM BACK UH EARLY ON THEY USED TO TO ROTATE THEM FROM HOU FROM SOM TO TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE S HOUSES .
UHHUH .
IN THE FAMILY .
AND .
ALL LOCAL .
WERE .
THEY LIKE ALL IN DALLAS .
UH NO NO NOT NO THIS WAS WELL I AM ACTUALLY FROM MISSISSIPPI AND .
OH .
SO THAT S IT IT WAS AROUND THERE GENERALLY .
UHHUH UHHUH .
UH THAT S WHERE THE FAMILY .
JUST FROM CITY TO CITY THEN MUMBLEX .
GREW .
YEAH AND IT WAS NOT ONLY IN MISSISSIPPI IN SOME OTHER PLACES .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AS WELL SO .
IT WAS UH IT WAS A BIG DEAL BUT UH THEY TRIED TO TO CENTRALIZE IT IN ONE SPOT .
SO IN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS THEY HAD IT AT A STATE PARK .
EVERY YEAR .
UHHUH UHHUH .
WE RENT A PAVILION AND AND DO THAT AND THAT S USUALLY WORKS OUT TO BE PRETTY GOOD .
AND UH THEY WILL RENT A PAVILION ON A WEEKEND AND UH .
DO YOU GO BACK .
I HAVE NOT GONE BACK LATELY .
IN FACT UH THIS PAST SUNDAY WAS THE WAS THE REUNION BUT I DID NOT GET TO GO .
UH I HAVE .
IS IT CHOICE OR JUST BUSINESS OR .
NOT GETTING TO GO .
UHHUH .
UH JUST UH THE DISTANCE INVOLVED AND .
UHHUH UHHUH .
UH JUST NOT I HAVE A YOUNGER DAUGHTER NOW AND UH I IT S KIND OF HARD TO GET HER GET HER THERE .
UHHUH .
AND EVERYTHING .
BUT I AM GOING TO TO UH HOPEFULLY NEXT YEAR GET TO GO BACK CAUSE UH A LOT OF THE FAMILY HAS NOT UH ON HER SIDE MY MOTHER S SIDE HAS NOT SEEN YOU KNOW MY DAUGHTER SO .
OH .
DO YOU HAVE BROTHERS AND SISTERS .
I HAVE ONE BROTHER SO .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND IS YOUR MOTHER STILL LIVING .
YES .
OH SO SO YOU GO BACK AND VISIT WITH HER ANYWAY .
WOULD YOU NOT .
RIGHT YEAH .
I MEAN EITHER WAY .
THERE WAS FAMILY REUNION TIME .
RIGHT I I USUALLY SEE HER .
A .
OR NOT .
COUPLE TIMES .
A YEAR SO THAT S NO NO BIG THING .
BUT UH I UH I DO I DO ENJOY THE REUNIONS .
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT NOW UH ORIGINALLY WHEN WE HAD THEM UH THEY WERE MAINLY MY MOTHER S .
RELATIVES RIGHT .
UH FATHER S .
MY MOTHER S FATHER S FAMILY HAD QUITE A FEW .
UHHUH .
UH BROTHERS AND SISTERS .
SO IT WAS A LARGE REUNION OF OF OF THAT GROUP UH FROM THAT DESCENDANTS .
UHHUH .
AND UH A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE HAVE AND AT TIME YOU KNOW THEY .
ALL KNEW ONE ANOTHER .
RIGHT RIGHT .
AND NOW IT HAS GOTTEN UH THAT UH A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE D HAVE UH HAVE DIED OFF OR YOU KNOW WHAT .
WE ARE LEFT WITH IS THE THE RELATIVES OF OF .
THE NEXT GENERATION UHHUH .
OF THAT GROUP .
AND SO UH IT S NOT QUITE AS CLOSE AS IT USED TO BE .
SO I THINK PEOPLE FEEL LESS OF A DESIRE TO REALLY GO .
I KNOW THAT .
WH WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IT S LESS CLOSE THAN IT USED TO BE .
WELL I I JUST THINK THAT UH YOU KNOW AT THAT TI WHEN WHEN THEY WERE A YOU KNOW THE THOSE WERE ALL BROTHERS AND SISTERS .
A LOT AND OR THEY WERE ALL IN THE SAME AR GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION .
UHHUH UHHUH UHHUH .
YOU KNOW BACK AROUND YOU KNOW IN THE TWENTIES AND THIRTIES WHEN THEY WERE GROWING UP UH YOU KNOW THEY WERE ALL LOCATED TOGETHER .
RIGHT RIGHT .
IN ONE SMALL COMMUNITY .
RIGHT .
AND AS AS TIME GREW I MEAN WHEN TIME WENT ON THE FAMILY GREW AND MOVED AWAY AND SO FORTH .
AND NOW WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER IT S IT S GENERALLY YOU KNOW LIKE SAY THE KIDS OF THOSE PEOPLE .
WHO ARE NOT YOU KNOW ANYWHERE NEAR ONE ANOTHER AND I DO NOT THINK THEY FEEL THE THE CLOSENESS THAT THEY USED TO BE THERE .
UHHUH .
WHICH IS A SHAME BUT THAT S JUST HOW IT IS .
MY MOTHER WAS COMPLAINING LAST YEAR ABOUT TH YOU KNOW IT S DWINDLING DOWN EVERY YEAR YOU KNOW THAT S JUST I THINK .
IS THAT JUST FAMILY S LACK OF PRIORITY ANYMORE MAYBE YES .
THAT S JUST .
WE GET SO INVOLVED IN OUR WORK LIVES AND JUST .
WELL YEAH .
SOCIAL LIVES AND SO FORTH .
YEAH THAT S UH YEAH I THINK THAT S .
SOME OF IT .
BUT YOU KNOW I HAVE UH I I IT S JUST THE WAY YOU KNOW I THINK SOCIETY IS NOW IS THAT WE ARE NOT WE DO NOT HAVE THE EXTENSIVE FAMILY .
WE USED TO .
UHHUH .
IT S MORE OF A YOU KNOW A SMALLER SMALLER UNIT AND YOU KNOW WE WE TEND TO TRY TO DO THINGS I THINK WITH OUR IMMEDIATE FAMILY .
RIGHT RIGHT .
AS OPPOSED TO THE EXTENDED FAMILY .
OF PEOPLE THAT WE MAY OR MAY NOT REMEMBER OR KNOW YOU KNOW VERY WELL .
UH .
MUMBLEX .
IT REALLY MAKES AN EFFORT ON TO .
RIGHT .
DO THIS ANYMORE .
IT REQUIRES A LOT OF EFFORT TO TO .
RIGHT RIGHT .
TO DO THAT SORT OF THING .
I MEAN I I USED TO ENJOY GOING I MEAN I STILL DO KIND OF ENJOY IT BUT UH IT S IT DOES NOT IT S NOT AS MANY PEOPLE THERE THAT I REALLY REALLY ENJOY SEEING .
RIGHT RIGHT .
YOU KNOW I IT S GOING JUST FOR THE SAKE OF GETTING TOGETHER I THINK FOR THE FAMILY .
AND .
DO YOU CORRESPOND WITH ANYBODY OTHER THAN YOUR MOTHER AND BROTHER THAT S IN THAT GROUP .
UH .
ON A REGULAR BASIS NOT JUST CHRISTMAS CARDS .
UM UM NO NOT REALLY .
THA IN THAT BUT THEN AGAIN UH WELL I YOU KNOW I HAVE SOME AUNTS .
THAT UH I I I DO .
THAT S ABOUT TH MY MOTHER S SISTERS .
UHHUH UHHUH .
YOU KNOW BUT I FEEL CLOSER TO THEM BECAUSE I .
KIND OF GREW UP WITH THEM .
BUT .
RIGHT .
BUT UH AS YOU KNOW FOR THE REST OF THAT GROUP NO NOT REALLY .
UH YOU KNOW AND AND GENERALLY WHEN I WAS GROWING UP A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE THE ONLY TIME .
I EVER SAW THEM WAS AT THE REUNION SO UH .
RIGHT RIGHT .
YOU DO NOT REALLY FEEL THAT THAT REALLY CLOSE TO THEM .
RIGHT .
IN MY MY UH FATHER S FAMILY WE GET TOGETHER EVERY YEAR AT A DIFFERENT LOCATION EITHER DALLAS OR OKLAHOMA CITY .
THEY HAD CHOSEN SANTA BARBARA CALIFORNIA FOR THIS SUMMER AND AND DID NOT GET ENOUGH PEOPLE .
THAT WERE WILLING TO GO THAT FAR .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE MOST OF US LIVE EITHER IN THE MIDWEST OR LIKE IN THE TEXAS OKLAHOMA AREA .
AND UH SO THEY CANCELLED THAT ONE AND UH ARE LOOKING NEXT YEAR BRINGING IT BACK CLOSER BUT WE HAVE A LETTER A FAMILY LETTER .
UHHUH .
THAT CIRCULATES AND IT USUALLY GOES THROUGH ME TWICE A YEAR AND WHAT .
YOU DO IS TAKE OUT THE LAST LETTER .
YOU WROTE THAT S ON THE BOTTOM AND PUT THE YOUR NEW LETTER ON THE TOP AND THEN THAT S THE WAY .
IT S KEPT IN ORDER .
AND THEN ABOUT TWICE A YEAR THEN YOU ARE KEPT UP WITH WHAT IS GOING ON AND WHEN YOU MEET THEM AT THE REUNION YOU DO NOT FEEL LIKE I DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS PERSON .
YOU HAVE .
THAT S A GOOD IDEA .
READ SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON AND ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN AND SO FORTH .
SO YOU ARE KIND OF .
RIGHT .
HALF WAY ACQUAINTED THAT WAY .
AND THAT .
YEAH .
THAT S BEEN A THAT S BEEN A NICE WAY OF KEEPING US ALL AWARE OF EACH OTHER I THINK .
RIGHT .
WE TRIED TO START THAT IN MY HUSBAND S FAMILY .
HIS MOTHER S SIDE DECIDED THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE A REUNION .
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND I SAID WELL LET S START THIS LETTER AND IT JUST NEVER MUMBLEX MY HUSBAND S SISTERS STARTED IT AND SENT IT TO US AND THAT S AS FAR AS IT GOT .
I SENT IT .
YEAH .
ON TO THE NEXT ONE AND AND BUT WE ARE GOING IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO THE NEXT ONE IN SCOTTSDALE ARIZONA .
UHHUH .
FOR THAT FAMILY .
WE ARE REAL GLAD WE GOT TOGETHER BECAUSE SINCE THAT THAT TIME .
THERE WERE ONLY LIKE TWO OF THE ONE SISTER AND ONE SISTERINLAW OF THE ORIGINAL FAMILY LEFT .
AND THE SISTERINLAW DIED AND THE SISTER IS IN A NURSING HOME SO WE ARE GLAD THAT WE TOOK THAT OPPORTUNITY TWO YEARS AGO .
NANCY DO YOU HAVE ANY CHILDREN .
YES I HAVE A TWELVE YEAR OLD AND I VE BEEN VERY LUCKY I HAVE NT NEEDED CHILD CARE EXCEPT FOR MY MOM SO .
OH .
I VE BEEN REAL LUCKY I M A NURSE I GO TO SCHOOL I MEAN I GO TO WORK EARLY SO MY MOM COMES OVER IN THE MORNING AND GETS HER READY FOR HER SCHOOL OR JUST HANGS BY WHILE SHE GETS READY .
WELL THAT S NICE .
DRIVES HER TO SCHOOL THEN I M HOME TO PICK HER UP SO I M VERY VERY LUCKY .
THAT IS LUCKY WELL HOW OLD UM DOES A CHILD HAVE TO BE BEFORE YOU HAVE TO YOU GET TO STOP MAKING ARRANGEMENTS FOR HIM I WONDER .
WELL I COULD DO IT NOW .
UHHUH .
BUT SHE GETS LONELY .
UHHUH .
IN THE MORNING AND I FEEL BETTER UM SHE HAS A CRAZY FATHER OUT THERE SOMEWHERE THAT I JUST DO NT LET HER OUT OF MY SIGHT SO UM .
WELL AND UM IT S NICE FOR THEM .
YOU NEVER KNOW .
NOT TO BE ALONE .
YEAH YEAH SHE FEELS THAT WAY YOU KNOW AND WE HAVE A NEIGHBOR ON THE NEXT BLOCK THAT SHE COULD ALWAYS WALK OVER THERE .
UHHUH .
AND GO TO SCHOOL WITH BUT WE JUST FEEL BETTER DOING IT THIS WAY SO .
NOT AFTER WOR .
I DO NT KNOW WHAT DAY WE LL STOP WE WE WERE ABOUT TO STOP ONE DAY THIS YEAR AND THEN HER FATHER CALLED THE SCHOOL AND MADE ALL KINDS OF THREATS AND SO .
OH NO .
WE DID NT STOP AND SO SO UM YOU KNOW YOU REALIZE THAT IT ONLY TAKES ONE SECOND FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN SO .
YEAH .
EVEN THOUGH SHE S TWELVE SHE S STILL A KID SO .
SHE IS .
YOU GOT TO BE CAREFUL .
WELL I M GLAD YOU HAVE THAT UM OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE YOUR MOM .
YEAH I M I M GLAD TOO .
WELL I I HAVE TWO KIDS .
UHHUH .
AND UH FIVE AND SIX A GIRL AND A BOY AND UM SO FAR I HAVE NT HAD TO MAKE A LOT OF CHILD CARE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THEM BECAUSE UM I M AT HOME NOW .
UHHUH .
FULL TIME BUT UM WHEN I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL I WOULD GO TO SCHOOL A TIME THAT MY HUSBAND WAS NT YOU KNOW WHEN HE WAS AT HOME .
YEAH .
SO THAT WE WOULD JUST SWITCH BACK AND FORTH LIKE THAT BUT UM IT S REALLY SCARY AND I WOULD REALLY HATE TO BE IN A POSITION TO HAVE TO FIND CHILD CARE .
WELL I WOULD TOO BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH A PLACE CAN LOOK PRETTY GOOD ON THE OUTSIDE WE RE FINDING OUT NOW THAT IT S NOT ALWAYS ON THE INSIDE .
UHHUH .
AND I I JUST DO NT KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO IF .
NO .
I HAD TO DO THAT I KNOW THE HOSPITAL THAT I WORK IN IS A BIG HOSPITAL AND THEY PROVIDE CHILD CARE AND OF COURSE THEY CHARGE FOR IT .
UHHUH .
BUT AT LEAST ALL THE NURSES CAN LEAVE THEIR CHILDREN AND THEY RE ALWAYS WATCHING THEM THEY CAN EAT LUNCH WITH THEM IF THEY FEEL SICK THEY CAN CALL THEM AT WORK AND THEY RUN OVER AND CHECK ON THEM AND .
OH .
THEY FEEL A LITTLE BETTER THAN IF THEY DROPPED THEM OFF SOMEWHERE ON THE WAY SO .
WELL THAT S NICE .
YEAH IT IS NICE .
AND I KNOW THAT I HAVE UM DONE SOME BABYSITTING MYSELF AND UH WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL AND NEEDED EXTRA MONEY AND I KNOW HOW I FEEL HOW I FELT AS A PROVIDER OF CHILD CARE THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU RE YOU RE TAKING CARE OF SOMEONE ELSE S CHILD AND YOU RE FORCING YOURSELF TO YOU KNOW TREAT THEM EQUALLY AND YOU KNOW BETTER USUALLY BETTER THAN YOUR OWN .
RIGHT RIGHT .
UM IT S NOT THE SAME AND IT MADE ME REALIZE THAT UM NO ONE WILL LOVE YOUR CHILD AS MUCH AS .
WELL THAT S RIGHT .
YOU AND YOUR MOTHER YOUR .
YEAH RIGHT .
AND UM THE FAMILY AND NO ONE WILL LOOK OUT AFTER THEM AND I JUST THINK UM SO FAR I THINK MY PREFERENCE WOULD BE RATHER THAN TO HAVE LIKE A OH A BIG DAY CARE THAT UM WHAT IS THAT LIKE CHILD KINDER CARE AND .
RIGHT .
THINGS LIKE THAT RATHER THAN HAVING ONE WHERE THEY WOULD DELIVER THE CHILDREN TO SCHOOL IN A VAN OR SOMETHING I WOULD PREFER TO HAVE IN HOME CARE EITHER MY OWN HOME OR A .
YEAH .
NEIGHBOR OR SOMETHING .
YEAH JUST NEVER KNOW I BABYSAT FOR THE LITTLE GIRL NEXT DOOR FOR A YEAR OR SO WHEN HER PARENTS FIRST GOT DIVORCED AND .
UHHUH .
IT WAS HARD TO TREAT HER EQUALLY WITH MY CHILD THEY WERE THE SAME AGE AND THEY PLAYED TOGETHER AND THEY WERE GOOD FRIENDS BUT LIKE YOU SAID YOU TEND TO GO MORE FOR THE OTHER ONE S SIDE .
RIGHT .

DO YOU HAVE YOU EVER HAD TO PUT YOUR CHILDREN IN CHILD CARE MARY DELL .
OH YES .
I M AN OLD EXPERIENCED HAND .
I STARTED BACK WHEN IT WAS NT .
STYLISH TO DO THAT AT ALL .
MY DAUGHTER .
THAT S SEVENTEEN NOW .
UHHUH .
I WORKED EVEN WHEN SHE WAS A BABY .
OH .
AND I HAD PRIVATE CARE FOR BOTH MY DAUGHTERS UNTIL THEY WERE TWO AND THEN I WAS REALLY LUCKY TO HAVE PUT THEM IN A .
METHODIST DAY SCHOOL AT PRESTON HOLLOW METHODIST RIGHT OFF .
UHHUH .
OF WALNUT HILL AND PRESTON .
UHHUH .
AND IT WAS A WONDERFUL ENVIRONMENT .
I I JUST WISH ALL KIDS IF THEY HAVE TO BE PUT IN DAY SCHOOL COULD HAVE THAT KIND OF PLACE .
UHHUH .
I SEE .
SO IT WORKED WELL .
OH .
HOW ABOUT YOU .
WELL I HAVE UH A NINE YEAR OLD AND A SIX YEAR OLD AND NEITHER ONE OF THEM HAS EVER BEEN IN .
UHHUH .
IN UH DAY CARE FOR THE REASON OF OF ME WORKING .
UHHUH .
BUT UH THEY .
BOTH WENT THROUGH PRESCHOOL .
YEAH .
AND UH WE VE JUST BEEN REAL LUCKY .
UHHUH .
I THINK ANYWAY .
TO NOT .
IT S NOT HARD TO FIND ANYTHING .
THAT S PARTTIME .
SO MANY OF THE CHURCHES HAVE REALLY STRONG .
RIGHT LIKE HALF DAY PROGRAMS .
UHHUH .
PRESCHOOL AND CHILDREN S DAY OUT .
UHHUH .
BUT IT WAS A NIGHTMARE BACK WHEN CHERYL WAS LITTLE AND THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW CHURCHES .
THAT DID IT .
THERE WERE A COUPLE DOWNTOWN DALLAS BUT THEY WERE SO SEEMED .
COLD AND IMPERSONAL I JUST COULD NT HACK IT .
UHHUH .
AND WHAT .
I LIKED ABOUT PRESTON HOLLOW IS THAT THE PEOPLE .
THAT WERE THERE WHEN CHERYL WAS TWO WHICH WAS FIFTEEN YEARS AGO MANY OF THEM ARE STILL THERE TODAY .
SO THERE .
OH .
WAS REAL CONTINUITY .
SHE WENT BACK AS A TEENAGER AND THESE PEOPLE .
THAT HAD CHANGED HER DIAPERS WHEN SHE WAS THREE WERE STILL THERE .
OH MY GOSH .
SO IT IT WAS REALLY NEAT .
BUT IT WAS BECAUSE THEY HAD A DIRECTOR .
THAT HAD ALWAYS DONE IT AS A LABOR OF LOVE AND .
UHHUH .
SHE JUST KEPT GOOD PEOPLE AND .
OH MY GOODNESS .
REAL CHEERFUL PLACE LOTS OF ARTS AND CRAFTS AND I M REALLY GLAD MY KIDS HAD IT BECAUSE PLANO SCHOOLS DO SO LITTLE OF THAT .
RIGHT .
RIGHT .
YEAH .
THAT IF THEY HAD NT HAD IT BEFORE THEY HIT FIRST GRADE .
THEY WERE NEVER GOING TO HAVE ANY ART OR MUSIC OR ANY OF THE INTERPRETIVE STUFF .
UHHUH .
YEAH THAT IS UH A BIG DRAWBACK .
I THINK IN THAT IN THE UH PUBLIC SCHOOLS OUT HERE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW TO YOUR LUCKY TO HAVE AN ART TEACHER AND IF YOU DO YOU GET THEM ONCE A WEEK OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW .
OR PAY FOR IT AFTER SCHOOL .
OUR EMILY S IN THE THIRD GRADE OVER AT HUFFMAN AND THEY STARTED A PILOT PROGRAM WHERE WE CAN PAY PRIVATE TUITION SO THAT THEY CAN TAKE FRENCH AND MUSIC AND ART AND .
OH IS THAT RIGHT .
I HAD NO IDEA .
YOU KNOW I WILLINGLY DID IT BUT I THOUGHT .
THIS MAKES ME ANGRY .
THIS IS SOMETHING .
THAT OUGHT TO BE IN THE SCHOOLS .
OH MY GOODNESS .
RATHER THAN SOME OF THE OTHER STUFF .
THEY DO .
AND WITH OUR BUDGET CUTS I M SURE .
YEAH .
THAT S NOT GOING TO NOT GOING TO CHANGE ANYTIME SOON .
WELL THAT S THE ONLY WAY .
THEY RE .
YEAH WELL THAT S THE ONLY WAY .
THEY RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IT .
AND PARENTS .
WHO REALLY WANT THEIR KIDS TO HAVE ANY HUMANITIES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DO THAT .
OH MY GOODNESS .
SO IN SOME WAYS I THINK THE THE DAY SCHOOLS DO SERVE THOSE PURPOSES .
YEAH .
THAT S TRUE .
WELL EVEN THE PRESCHOOLS YOU KNOW THEY GET SO MUCH OF THAT IN PRESCHOOL AND THEN WHEN THEY HIT KINDERGARTEN YOU KNOW IT S LIKE WHAM .
YEAH .
YEAH .
CULTURE SHOCK .
IT S JUST .
PUT THE COLORS AWAY .
YEAH YEAH .
GET THE COMPUTERS OUT .
WHICH IS TOO BAD .
AND YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
THAT S HARD .
UHHUH .
IT S SO DIFFICULT FOR THEM .
UM DID YOU HAVE YOUR CHILDREN DID YOU SAY IN HOME IN IN PRIVATE CARE WAS THAT IN YOUR HOME OR IN SOMEONE ELSE S HOME .
UNTIL THEY WERE TWO .
YEAH .
YEAH BOTH .
TIMES THEY WERE AT OUR HOUSE .
UHHUH .
SO YOU WERE ABLE TO HAVE SOMEBODY COME THERE .
AND THAT WAS HARD TOO .
I I LUCKED OUT WITH REALLY GOOD PEOPLE .
BOTH .
TIMES BUT I KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE .
THAT ARE NEVER ABLE TO FIND THAT AND I D PRACTICALLY GIVE MY PAYCHECK AWAY TO DO IT SO .
YEAH .
YEAH .
DID YOU HAVE A NANNY OR DID YOU HAVE SOMEONE .
YEAH .
THAT LIVED IN WITH YOU .
WELL NO SHE DID NT LIVE WITH US .
UH THE FIRST ONE WAS AN .
ELDERLY LADY .
WHO WAS PUTTING A A DAUGHTER THROUGH NURSING SCHOOL .
OH .
JUST PURELY ON BABYSITTING MONEY .
OH MY GOODNESS .
AND SHE KEPT CHERYL DURING THE DAY AND THEN DID MORE BABYSITTING AT NIGHT .
UHHUH .
AND SHE WAS NEAT BECAUSE SHE WAS LIKE THE GRANDMOTHER THAT MY KIDS NEVER HAD .
YEAH .
BECAUSE BOTH OUR PARENTS ARE DEAD .
OH .
SO THAT THAT WAS A PLUS FROM .
OH GOSH .
THAT RESPECT AS WELL .
AND THEN WITH EMILY IT WAS A NEIGHBORHOOD FRIEND .
UHHUH .
THAT KEPT HER .
UHHUH .
SO .
I HAVE UH .
I JUST CAN NOT FATHOM PUTTING A LITTLE BITTY BABY IN A COMMERCIAL CARE CENTER .
UHHUH .
I WAS JUST LISTENING TO A PROGRAM .
THIS MORNING OH WELL I GUESS IT WAS ON THE HOME SHOW BUT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT UH A NEW UH OH I CA NT EVEN THINK OF THE NAME OF IT .
I WAS HALFWAY LISTENING WHILE I WAS PAINTING .
UHHUH .
UM IT S SOME KIND OF ADVISORY BOARD .
THEY VE PUT TOGETHER FOR PARENTS AND CHILDREN .
UHHUH .
AND THEY VE NOW MOVED IT TO WASHINGTON D C AND THE THE DOCTOR .
THAT WAS ON THERE THE PEDIATRICIAN SAID YOU KNOW I CA NT IMAGINE LEAVING A THREE WEEK OLD AND TAKING THEM TO A NURSERY DAYCARE .
YEAH .
AND LEAVING THEM THERE .
OH THAT WOULD BE HARD .
YOU KNOW SO UM .
WELL THEY GIVE A LOT MORE LEAVE .
I WORK AT N C N B NOW AND OUR BENEFITS FOR MATERNAL AND AND PARENTAL CARE AND EVEN FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
ARE ARE REALLY EXPANDING .
WE HAVE MORE OPTIONS NOW THEN WE DID WHEN I MY KIDS WERE BORN WITH BEING ABLE TO TAKE OFF FULLTIME LONGER .
UHHUH .
OF YOU CAN PHASE YOUR SCHEDULE IN SO THAT IT S NOT FULLTIME FOR .
OH BOY THAT S GREAT .
UP TO SIX MONTHS .
IT S REALLY NEAT .
I VE I VE HAD A COUPLE OF ASSISTANTS .
THAT CAME BACK JUST THREE DAYS .
A WEEK OR THEY VE YOU KNOW WHATEVER SCHEDULE .
THEY WANT FROM A PAY STANDPOINT .
UHHUH .
UHHUH .
WE TRY TO WORK IT WITH THEIR HOURS .
AND THAT HELPS BECAUSE YOU DO NT HAVE TO JUST WEAN YOURSELF .
COLD TURKEY AND SAY .
YEAH .
OKAY I NEVER GET TO SEE MY BABY FOR EIGHT HOURS .
A DAY AGAIN .
RIGHT .
RIGHT .
AND THE BANK HAS A LOT OF PROGRAMS NOW FOR CHILD CARE REFERRALS .
I VE OF COURSE .
IT S TOO LATE FOR ME SO .
YEAH .
I VE I VE NOT TRIED THEM TO SEE HOW EFFECTIVE THEY ARE BUT .
UHHUH .
UHHUH .
I THINK WE RE FINALLY BEGINNING TO MAKE PROGRESS BUT JUST NOT VERY FAST .
GOD IT S AMAZING .
AND FOR OUR AGE GROUP .
IT S TOO LATE TOO LITTLE TOO LATE .
RIGHT .
RIGHT .
BUT I I DO THINK IT S AN AREA .
THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT AND IMPROVED BECAUSE MORE OF US ARE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK .
UHHUH .
UHHUH .
TWO INCOME FAMILIES I THINK ARE HERE TO STAY .
WELL AND I WOULD THINK YOU KNOW SINCE BIG BUSINESS IS SUPPOSEDLY WHY THE GOVERNMENT MAKES THE DECISIONS THEY DO .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THE THE PEOPLE .
THAT WORK IN BIG BUSINESS HAVE FAMILIES .
RIGHT .
THEY HAVE CHILDREN .
YEAH .
SO IT S ONLY TO THEIR ADVANTAGE THAT THEY GET THESE PROGRAMS GOING AND .
OH SURE .
WORKING AND UH .
YOU RETAIN EMPLOYEES AND KEEP THEM LONGER .
THAT S THAT WAS THE RATIONALE .
THEY GAVE WHEN THEY WERE GIVING US .
INFORMATION ABOUT OUR .
UHHUH .
EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS THAT .
UHHUH .
THEY WANT US TO BE HAPPY AND WANT US TO BE ABLE TO COPE WITH TRYING TO .
RIGHT .
SPLIT OURSELVES IN FIFTEEN MILLION PIECES .
RIGHT .
RIGHT .
SO I I HOPE IT HELPS .
IT SEEMS TO HELP THE NEW MOTHERS .
OH THAT S GOOD .
NOT HAVE TO COME BACK FULLTIME .
BECAUSE THAT S HARD .
THAT S GOOD TO KNOW .
I HAVE A COUPLE OF FRIENDS .
THAT .
HAVE HAVE FOUND THE UH YOU KNOW A PRI A PRIVATE HOME TO TAKE THEIR CHILDREN TO WHEN THEY RE YOUNG .
UHHUH .
UNTIL THEY HIT THE PRESCHOOL AGE .
UHHUH .
AND THEY USUALLY YOU KNOW YOU LL FIND A A WOMAN .
THAT S KEEPING LIKE SIX CHILDREN OR .
UHHUH .
FOUR TO SIX CHILDREN IN THE HOME AND MY FUTURE FUTURE SISTERINLAW S MOTHER DOES THAT TOO FULLTIME .
WELL IN PLANO THOUGH THE PROBLEM IS YOU FIND AND THIS IS WHAT .
I FOUND WITH EMILY .
I FROM THE TIME .
SHE STARTED FIRST GRADE I WANTED HER OUT IN PLANO AREA .
UHHUH .
AND I KEPT FINDING NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS AND THEY D MOVE .
OH .
SHE ENDED UP BEING IN A DIFFERENT HOME .
EVERY YEAR .
TOO TRANSIT .
UHHUH .
AND I FINALLY DECIDED I DID NT LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT WAS TRAUMATIC TO HER TO GET SO ATTACHED TO A FAMILY AND THEN HAVE THEM MOVE .
AND HER SURROUNDINGS .
SO THIS YEAR .
I I TRIED KINDERCARE AND .
THEN SHE S OLD ENOUGH TO .
WELL UH IF YOU HAD TO PICK A A TYPE OF MUSIC THAT YOU LIKE WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO .
WELL I COULD PICK COUNTRY MUSIC .
COUNTRY MUSIC I .
AS I VE GOTTEN OLDER I VE STARTED LISTENING MORE TO THE WORDS OF MUSIC .
UH .
AND TO THE SOFTER MELODIES .
UH ARE YOU FROM TEXAS .
NOT ORIGINALLY .
NOT ORIGINALLY WHERE YOU FROM .
GEORGIA .
GEORGIA OKAY WELL SEE I M I M FROM CHICAGO SO UH I M KIND OF IN A DIFFERENT CATEGORY HERE UH .
IF YOU HAD TO PICK ONE WHAT WOULD YOU CHOOSE .
UH I WOULD PROBABLY GO WITH IT S TOUGH UH I THINK I WOULD JUST STICK WITH THE CLASSICS ONLY BECAUSE UH I LIKE MUSIC JUST FOR MUSIC S SAKE AND UH YOU KNOW I M FROM THE ERA WHERE YOU KNOW WE HAD ALL THE ROCK AND ROLL I M FORTY SO I M YOU KNOW PART OF THAT WHOLE DEAL AND UH THAT WAS A REAL INTERESTING TIME AND YOU KNOW THE MUSIC SORT OF MADE THE WHOLE TIME VERY RICH WITH SOUND UH BUT I THINK I D STICK BACK WITH MY BEETHOVEN AND MY BACH AND MY MOZART I MEAN BECAUSE IT S JUST IT WILL ALWAYS BE THERE IT S CLASSIC AND I DO NT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT S CURRENT AND WHAT S NOT BECAUSE I HAVE NT BEEN CURRENT WITH MUSIC FOR A LONG TIME BUT YOU KNOW SAME UH AND AS FAR AS COUNTRY MUSIC IS I VE NEVER REALLY UH LISTENED TO IT I MEAN BECAUSE THAT S JUST IT WAS IT WAS NT PART OF WHAT I KNEW SO THERE YOU GO .
WELL I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU RE SAYING I THINK IF YOU WOULD LISTEN TO IT A LITTLE YOU WOULD DISCOVER THAT IT HAS A LOT OF ROOTS FROM THE BOTH FROM THE CLASSICS AND FROM SOME OF THE ROCK AND ROLL OF THE ERA THAT THAT WE BOTH LIVED THROUGH .
RIGHT YEAH .
UH .
I IT S IT S A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON EVERYTHING TOO I I KNOW WELL WHENEVER THEY TALK ABOUT UH COUNTRY MUSIC IT S ABOUT IT SEEMS SAD TO ME IT S ALWAYS ABOUT SOME GUY LOSING SOME GIRL AND THEN YOU KNOW PLAYING THE GUITAR AND SINGING ABOUT IT .
WELL THERE S SOME JOY IN IT ALSO .
BUT MOSTLY IT IT JUST TELLS A STORY ABOUT LIFE .
YEAH WELL I MUST SAY THOUGH UH I LISTEN TO AMY GRANT DO YOU CONSIDER HER COUNTRY .
I DO NT KNOW I M NOT ALL THAT FAMILIAR WITH HER WORK .
UH UH LET S SEE WELL NAME SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE COUNTRY THAT I SHOULD LISTEN TO THAT WOULD BE GOOD .
WELL I KIND OF LIKE UH I LIKE GROUPS LIKE THE STATLER BROTHERS .
OKAY .
AND THE JUDDS CERTAINLY .
OH OKAY I I MUST ADMIT THAT S YEAH THEY RE FANTASTIC SO UH UH .
REBA MCINTIRE IS A LITTLE TOO COUNTRY FOR ME .
SHE S SOMETHING THOUGH SHE S GOT SO MUCH ENERGY .
THAT S TRUE .
WELL I GUESS I I HAVE LISTENED IN ON SOME OF THE STUFF AND NOT REALLY REALIZED IT THAT I DO LIKE SOME OF THAT UH DOLLY PARTON SHE S KIND OF IS SHE KIND OF COUNTRY .
OH YES .
KIND OF .
THAT S CERTAINLY WHERE HER ROOTS ARE .
RIGHT DOWN THERE .
UH UH HOW ABOUT THE OAK RIDGE BOYS .
VERY MUCH SO .
VERY MUCH OKAY WELL I LIKE THEM TOO SO I GUESS I VE HAD A SMATTERING AND I JUST UH YOU KNOW PICKED I VE PICKED UP A LITTLE BIT ALONG THE WAY THAT I PROBABLY WOULD NT HAVE IF I D STAYED UP NORTH YOU KNOW .
THAT S TRUE .
YOU KNOW SO WELL I THINK THERE S MUSIC ALL AROUND ANYWAY I MEAN I THINK LIFE IS JUST MUSIC SO YOU KNOW YOU CAN HEAR IT WHEREVER YOU WANT AND UH AND I VE I VE KIND OF SHIED AWAY FROM SOME OF THE NEW STUFF BECAUSE I JUST DO NT UNDERSTAND IT BUT MAYBE TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW THEY LL LOOK AT IT AS CLASSIC ROCK AND ROLL WHICH I REALLY LIKE SO .
WELL IT S JUST DIFFICULT FOR ME TO BELIEVE THAT ANYBODY S EVER GOING TO MAKE A A RECORD OF THE RAP SONGS OF THE EIGHTIES .
YEAH THE GREATEST HITS RIGHT .
YEAH .
YEAH YEAH SO I MEAN IT IT IT LL IF IT STANDS THE TEST OF TIME WE LL SEE .
THAT S TRUE .
AND UH THEN IT LL IF IT SURVIVES THEN IT LL JUST PROBABLY BE ONE OR TWO SONGS THAT SORT OF HEY LISTEN WHAT WE LISTENED TO .
YEAH .
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS SORT OF THING BUT UH YOU KNOW I I THINK OF I GET REAL TICKLED WHEN I LISTEN TO SOME OF THESE OLD BEATLE UH MUSIC YOU KNOW THE ORCHESTRATION OF IT AND THAT IT S SO POPULAR STILL AND AND UH YOU KNOW ALL THESE ROCKS ROCK STATIONS CALL IT CLASSIC SOFT ROCK YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
BUT WE USED TO LISTEN TO IT FULL BLAST .
OF COURSE .
YEAH SO IT S KIND OF FUNNY THE WAY WE LISTENED TO THE STUFF BUT I DO NT KNOW WELL YOU GOT ANY MORE .
WELL THE BIG KEY IS THAT I THINK YOU VE ALREADY STATED THAT ALL MUSIC IS ROOTED IN THE CLASSICS AND IT HAS GROWN FROM THERE .
WELL THAT S .
WELL LISTEN I HAVE TO RUN I HATE TO CUT .
OKEYDOKE WELL IT WAS GREAT .
THIS SHORT .
YEAH AND WE LL UH LISTEN TO SOME MORE MUSIC AND UH I LL LOOK AT SOME COUNTRY .
YOU BET .
OKAY BYEBYE .
BYEBYE .
SO WHAT ARE YOUR FEELINGS ON THE TOPIC TODAY AS FAR AS CRIME IN AMERICA TODAY .
WELL I THINK SOME OF THE BLAME CAN BE PLACED ON PLEA BARGAINING AND PEOPLE GETTING LESS TIME AND NOT SERVING ANY OF THE OR A LOT LESS OF THE .
TIME THAN THEY RE .
YEAH .
GIVEN BY THE COURT SYSTEM BUT I DO NT KNOW WITH THE ECONOMY THE WAY IT IS I THINK CRIME CA NT DO MUCH BUT GO UP .
NO I HAVE TO I HAVE TO AGREE WITH YOU I HAD OCCASION A COUPLE YEARS AGO TO HEAR THE R S CHIEF OF POLICE OF RICHARDSON TEXAS SPEAK AND YOU KNOW IT S A SHAME A A CRIMINAL TODAY NOT A MURDERER BUT A GUY THAT BREAKS IN HOUSES AND STEALS THINGS AND YOU KNOW HE DOES THIS AND HE DOES THIS FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS HIDES ALL THE STASH AND WORKS OFF OF IT AND THEN WHEN HE GETS CAUGHT HE LL BE SENTENCED TO SOMETHING LIKE FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS BUT HE GETS FIVE DAYS CREDIT FOR EVERY DAY HE SERVES I MEAN IT S LIKE A BONUS TO GO TO JAIL .
RIGHT .
SO .
SUBSEQUENTLY A FIVE YEAR SENTENCE MEANS HE S GOING TO BE OUT IN UH A YEAR ON PROBATION I MEAN WHAT HE DOES THE CHIEF SAID IS HE JUST MERELY GOES BACK TO HIS HIS STASH WHERE HE HAS IT HIDDEN AND CONTINUES TO OPERATE AND UH WHEN HE S USES UP ALL THAT AND SPENDS ALL THAT MONEY THEN HE UH STARTS ROBBING HOUSES AGAIN OR WHATEVER AND GETS CAUGHT AGAIN AND GOES THROUGH THE SAME THING .
WELL THERE WAS AN ARTICLE IN OUR PAPER SUNDAY THAT THE AVERAGE PERSON SENTENCED TO SEVEN TO TEN YEARS IN NORTH CAROLINA THE AVERAGE SERVES SIX WEEKS .
NOW SEE THAT S A YOU TALK ABOUT THAT S A CRIME RIGHT THERE .
WELL SEE WE DO NT HAVE ANY ROOM IN OUR PRISONS SO .
WELL WE DO NT EITHER IN TEXAS .
THEY SHU THEY SHUTTLE THEM IN AND SHUTTLE THEM OUT AND THEY GET THEM GET THEM EARLY PAROLE IN ORDER TO MAKE ROOMS FOR THE NEW CRIMINALS WHO STAY THERE FOR THEIR SIX WEEKS AND THEN THEY RE THEY RE PAROLED UH TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE NEWEST CRIMINALS AND IT JUST IT IT S JUST REALLY ABSURD .
WELL IT IT CERTAINLY IS AND UH THAT WOULD BE A HUGE CONCERN YOU KNOW I DO NT THINK THE GENERAL PUBLIC REALLY REALIZES THIS AS FAR AS WHAT GOES ON WITH OUR CRIMINAL SYSTEM OUR JUDICIARY SYSTEM AND EVERYTHING ELSE IT S JUST UH IT S TERRIBLE THE WAY IT IS RIGHT NOW .
I THINK THE GENERAL PUBLIC IS SO OVERWHELMED BY THINGS RIGHT NOW SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS COMING IN SO MANY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS THAT THEY VE JUST DECIDED TO BECOME APATHETIC TOWARDS IT ALL BECAUSE THEY REALIZE THERE S ABS OR THEY THINK THAT THERE S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THEY CAN DO ABOUT IT .
YEAH AS FAR AS STEPS TO REDUCE CRIME IF IT S UH CRIMES LIKE WE RE JUST BEEN DISCUSSING OBVIOUSLY WE WE NEED MORE PRISONS AND MORE CORRECTIVE FACILITIES TO PUT THESE PEOPLE IN .
YEAH .
TO UH TAKE THEM OFF THE STREETS BUT I DO NT THINK THAT S GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE JUST LIKE YOU SAID AND OUR STATE S A GOOD EXAMPLE YOUR STATE S A GOOD EXAMPLE AND IT S JUST NOT GOING TO HAPPEN AS FAR AS THE MURDERERS AND PEOPLE THAT COMMIT RAPE AND THINGS LIKE THAT I M NOT SURE WHAT S RIGHT BUT I KNOW IT IT S NOT RIGHT TO PUT THEM IN THERE AND LET THEM LIVE FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND LEERS W YEARS BEFORE YOU DO EXECUTE THEM OR WHATEVER BECAUSE IT S HAS TO BE VERY COSTLY TO FEED A PRISONER AND TO .
YEAH .
CLOTHE HIM AND YOU KNOW TO I M SURE HE GETS TO WATCH A LOT OF T V AND I M SURE THEY HAVE UH EXERCISE FACILITIES AND MOVIES AND AND EVERYTHING ELSE YOU KNOW THEY CAN HAVE A GOOD TIME IN .
WELL I DO NT KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS BUT I KNOW THAT ASKING THE QUESTION OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS NT WORKING SO .
NO IT REALLY IS NT A BIG IT S A BIG PROBLEM AND HOPEFULLY SOMETHING WILL COME OUT OF IT SO I DO NT KNOW .
UH .
I M UH .
I HOPE SO .
I M PRETTY MUCH OF A HARD PERSON UH I BELIEVE IN CAPITAL PUNISHMENT I MEAN YOU KNOW A PERSON RAPES A KID OR SHOOTS SOMEONE OR KILLS SOMEONE I MEAN YOU KNOW IF IT S JUST DOWNRIGHT OUTRIGHT .
OH I DEFINITELY BELIEVE IN CAPITAL .
OH .
PUNISHMENT .
YOU BET I MEAN THAT S THE ONLY WAY TO .
IT S WHEN THEY IT S WHEN THEY RE IN ON DEATH ROW FOR NINETEEN YEARS THAT I DO NT I M KIND OF C CURIOUS ABOUT .
OH YEAH AND YOU SPEND THOUSANDS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO UH TAKE CARE OF THEM AND ALL YOU KNOW IT S JUST UNBELIEVABLE .
YEAH YOU CAN APPEAL NOW IN NORTH CAROLINA FOR ALMOST A PERIOD OF TWENTY YEARS .
CAN YOU REALLY .
YEAH YOU CAN JUST KEEP GOING AROUND AND AROUND AND AROUND THE MERRY GO ROUND UNTIL YOU I THINK THE I THINK IT S UH THE AVERAGE IS EIGHT TO TEN YEARS TO GET IN TO THE NORTH CAROLINA SUPREME COURT .
GOD .
AND THEN UH AFTER THAT IT GOES TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES AND THAT USUALLY TAKES ANOTHER FOUR TO SIX YEARS .
OH I KNOW .
SO IT S .
MEANWHILE YOU RE LIVING IN A COUNTRY CLUB SITUATION PERHAPS YOU KNOW .
THEY RE HOPING I GUESS THEY RE WHAT THEY RE H THEY RE TRYING TO PROLONG THEIR LIVES AND HOPING PEOPLE WILL FORGET WHAT THEY DID .
YES .
BUT IT S JUST A WE HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM WE HAVE SO MANY PROBLEMS IN THIS STATE NOW AND AND THE THE THING IS THE THE THING .
THE DRUG PROBLEM THAT S ANOTHER ONE .
THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IS THE IS .
WELL HI I GUESS UH I LL JUST START BY SAYING THAT WE ENTERTAIN WITH UH A GOURMET CLUB HERE UM WHICH MEANS THAT WE HAVE LIKE EIGHT EIGHT PEOPLE FOUR COUPLES .
UHHUH .
AND MOST OF THE HUSBANDS THIS IS REALLY PECULIAR MOST OF THE HUSBANDS COOK .
GREAT .
I MEAN THE WIVES DURING THE DAY YOU KNOW GET I GUESS SO BURNED OUT ON COOKING WHATEVER THEY HAVE TO COOK EVERY DAY .
UM YOU KNOW THEY DO NT REALLY CARE ABOUT GOURMET STUFF BUT IT WAS THE GUYS THAT GOT TOGETHER AND DID ALL THIS .
OH THAT S NICE .
AND UM LIKE MY HUSBAND JUST HE REALLY REALLY LIKES TO COOK IN TERMS OF UM OH BARBECUE AND I MEAN ALL GUYS I THINK LIKE TO BARBECUE I THINK IT S CAVEMAN .
RIGHT RIGHT .
I M TELLING YOU BUT UM HE REALLY DOES COOK AND IT S A GOOD THING BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU CA NT YOU CA NT KNOCK THAT .
NO .
BUT ALL THESE OTHER GUYS DO TOO AND SO WE VE GOTTEN TOGETHER AND WE JUST DO THESE REALLY ELABORATE GOURMET MEALS .
AND IT S REALLY REALLY KIND OF A NEAT THING TO DO YOU .
HOW OFTEN DO YOU MEET .
WELL WE TRY I MEAN BECAUSE YOU KNOW EVERYBODY IS SO ACTIVE WITH THEIR KIDS AND ALL THAT IT S LIKE YOU KNOW IF WE CAN DO IT ONCE EVERY SIX MONTHS WE RE DOING WELL .
OH YES YES .
YEAH SO I MEAN WE ORIGINALLY STARTED OUT YOU KNOW WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER .
UHHUH .
AND DID NT HAVE SO MUCH STUFF GOING ON WITH THE KIDS UM THEN WE WOULD WE TRIED TO DO IT EVERY OTHER MONTH .
YEAH .
BUT LATELY IT S JUST BEEN ONCE EVERY SIX MONTHS .
OH WELL THAT S MUCH MORE REASONABLE I WAS INVOLVED IN A A CLUB LIKE THAT FOR UM THAT YOU KNOW WHERE WE TRIED TO REALLY DO GOURMET UH MEALS .
YEAH .
AND UH WE WE WERE A LITTLE BIT TOO FREQUENT I THINK .
OH .
I DO NT REMEMBER IF WE WERE ONCE A MONTH OR ANYWAY IT WAS IT WAS DIFFICULT BY THE TIME WE WENT AROUND IT WAS UH FOUR COUPLES SO UH BY THE TIME WE GOT AROUND UH TO EACH OF US AND IT WAS TIME AGAIN WE WERE ALMOST TIRED YOU KNOW .
REALLY REALLY .
UM PARTLY BECAUSE UM WH GOURMET COOKING IS NOT PARTICULARLY CONDUCIVE FOR REGULAR DINING IT S TOO RICH .
OH IT IS ABSOLUTELY .
AND SO I WE FOUND THAT WHILE WE ENJOYED THE EVENING WE REGRETTED IT THE NEXT DAY .
YEAH .
UM SO UH WE WE KIND OF AND THEN ONE OF THE COUPLES UH MOVED AND SO WE SORT OF DID NT DID NT CONTINUE IT BUT UM AND I MUST ADMIT THAT AS YOU SAY WHEN YOUR CHILDREN START TAKING UP YOUR TIME THEN YOU YOU DO NT HAVE AS MUCH TIME FOR UH REGULAR ENTERTAINING BUT UM UH UH WHEN WHEN WE ENTERTAIN I USUALLY TRY TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WILL BE UM KIND OF H GOOD FOR EVERYBODY AND THAT S .
RIGHT .
THAT SOMETIMES MEANS YOU CA NT DO GOURMET .
OH YEAH .
BECAUSE DEPENDING ON WHO YOUR GUESTS ARE .
WELL YEAH THAT S TRUE AND WE HAVE A GOURMET FRIEND THAT CA NT STAND FISH SO I MEAN HE CAN GET WITHIN .
OH YEAH WELL ONE OF MY FRIENDS DOES NT EAT ANY CHEESE AT ALL .
OH MY .
UH SO THAT S A REAL PROBLEM BECAUSE SO MANY DISHES REQUIRE CHEESE .
OH YEAH .
UH WELL I TAKE THAT BACK UH SHE CA NT EAT SOME CREAM CHEESE BUT THAT THAT REALLY LIMITS .
IT SURE D .
UM .
IT MAKES YOU UH KEEP LOOKING FOR RECIPES EVERY TIME YOU HAVE AN EYE OUT .
OH YEAH .
FOR SOMETHING LIKE .
RIGHT .
RIGHT SO WE WE TRY TO KEEP ALL THAT IN MIND BUT OTHERWISE UM I GUESS YOU KNOW ENTERTAINING UM I I GUESS I HAVE RECIPES I UM BUT THAT S THAT S BASICALLY WHAT WE DO IS THE GOURMET .
UHHUH .
SO YOU KNOW THEY WOULD BE PRETTY ELABORATE .
YEAH .
UM BUT IT S FUN I MEAN IT TOOK US FOUR DAYS TO COOK A STOCK AND THREE DAYS TO MAKE THIS STUFF .
OH WOW .
AND .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW YOU GET ALL PREPARED BUT YOU RE RIGHT IT S VERY VERY RICH AND I M GLAD WE DO NT HAVE IT EVERY .

I ALWAYS THOUGHT OF DALLAS AS BEING A FAIRLY SAFE PLACE .
WELL IT IS BUT OUR CRIMES UP HERE UH AS I THINK IT MUST BE IN MOST CITIES NOW BUT UH I WAS LISTENING TO THE NEWS .
THE OTHER DAY AND THEY SAID THEY THOUGHT A LOT OF IT THE REASON .
IT WAS UP SO WAS BECAUSE OF THE UH SO MANY PEOPLE ARE WITHOUT WORK NOWADAYS ECONOMY S SO BAD .
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT .
I MEAN IT IT S BEEN UP EVERY YEAR FOR MANY YEARS AND THE ECONOMY HAS NT BEEN .
THIS BAD FOR SO LONG HAS IT .
THAT S A GOOD POINT .

UHHUH .
AND BACK UP TO A REAL UH HIGHLY TRAVELED MAIN STREET .

BUT UH WE WERE SO UH .
SO SO YOU SAW THIS HAPPENING IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND YOU FIGURED IT WOULD NT HAPPEN TO YOU .
SORT OF YEAH .
AND I NEVER DID GET A SECURITY SYSTEM BUT SINCE THAT HAPPENED I CERTAINLY HAVE .
YEAH WHAT KIND OF SYSTEM DO YOU HAVE .
IT .

PRETTY STANDARD .
IS THIS IS THIS .
ONE WITH SOME COMPANY THAT THAT SERVICES .
YOU AND .
YES YES .
TAKES YOUR CALLS AND ALL THAT STUFF .
IT S MONITORED AND ALL THAT .
YEAH .
AND .
WELL IS THAT A NECESSARY FEATURE TO HAVE SOMEBODY YOU KNOW AT THE OTHER END OF THE LINE OR IS IT ENOUGH JUST TO HAVE A THING .
THAT MAKES LOUD NOISE .
I THINK UH THE THING .
THAT MAKES A LOT OF NOISE WOULD WOULD SUFFICE .
YEAH .
I REALLY DO .
BUT UH THIS DEAL .
THAT WAS PART OF IT FOR YOU KNOW THREE YEARS OR SO .
YEAH .
TO PAY THE UNIT OFF OR WHATEVER .

S S SO YOU GOT A SIGN UP THERE .
THAT SAYS YOU GOT THIS ALARM SYSTEM .
UHHUH .
AND WHAT IF A BURGLAR COMES ALONG AND CUTS YOUR PHONE LINE .
WELL IT S GOT A BACK UP SYSTEM .
THAT DOES NT WORK SUPPOSEDLY .
THA UH THAT IF IT S CUT SUPPOSEDLY IT NOTIFIES THEM ANYWAY .
SUPPOSEDLY .
HOW DOES IT DO THAT .
WHO KNOWS YOU KNOW .
BUT THAT S A SELLING POINT .
AND I THINK THEY RE PROBABLY I THINK IT PROBABLY DOES THESE THINGS OR SUR SUPPOSEDLY PRETTY GOOD .
UHHUH .
BOY THEY SURE ADVERTISE THEM YOU KNOW SO MANY OF THEM NOWADAYS .
SURE .
BUT UH WELL DO NT DO NT YOU .

WELL YEAH UH .
I M NOT SAYING IT S ANY HIGHER THAN ANYBODY ELSE S .

I WOULD GATHER PROBABLY FROM DRUGS .

IT S SO HIGH EVERYWHERE .
YEAH .
BUT I DO NT THINK THERE S ANYPLACE USED TO YEARS AGO YOU THOUGHT WELL THESE LITTLE SMALL CITIES AND ALL WOULD NT HAVE THAT PROBLEM BUT THEY DO .
YEAH .
WE VE HAD RELATIVES THAT THEIR CHILDREN WERE JUST AS INVOLVED IN IT UH AS ANYONE YOU KNOW .

UHHUH .
AND YOU LET IT RISE AND YOU CAN LET IT RISE IN THE REFRIGERATOR AND THEN PUNCH IT DOWN AND THEN UH MAKE YOUR ROLLS THEY REALLY ARE GOOD .

THAT IS SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME THAT WE HAVE A DINNER PARTY OR THAT WE ARE GOING SOME PLACE WHERE EVERYBODY IS SUPPOSE TO BRING SOMETHING AND THEY HAVE HAD MY ROLLS BEFORE .
UHHUH THEY REQUEST IT .
THEY ALWAYS ASK ME TO BRING THOSE ROLLS .
I HAVE NOT GOTTEN ANY REQUESTS YET LAST YEAR I HAD A CHRISTMAS PARTY AT UH MY OFFICE AND I UH MADE THE TUNA FISH SANDWICHES AND EVERYONE UH I MEAN I THINK EVERYONE KNOWS HOW TO MAKE TUNA FISH SO I THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE EASY FOR ME TO MAKE AND I CAN NOT GO WRONG WITH THAT AND SO I MADE IT AND UH I USED CELERY SEED IN MY DO YOU USE CELERY SEED IN YOUR TUNA FISH .
NO I HAVE NT .
AND I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS SO STRANGE BECAUSE I NEVER I THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS WHAT CELERY SEED WAS FOR WAS FOR TUNA FISH .
OH HOW FUNNY .
AND SO BUT EVERYONE REALLY REALLY LOVED THE TUNA FISH AND THEY JUST COULD NT GET OVER THE FACT THAT I USED CELERY IN IT AND IT JUST SURPRISED ME CELERY AND ONION AND .
WELL SEE I I HAVE ALWAYS USED CELERY I MEAN I HAVE USED CELERY BEFORE .
UHHUH .
BUT I NEVER USED THE CELERY SEED IN IT .
OH YEAH .
WELL WHAT ELSE DO YOU PUT IN IT BESIDES THE CELERY SEED .
JUST LIKE UH REALLY FINE ONIONS AND GREEN PEPPER AND THE CELERY SEED AND I USE LIKE UH MIRACLE WHIP SALAD DRESSING INSTEAD OF THE ACTUAL MAYONNAISE .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE I REALLY DO NT LIKE THE HELMAN S MAYONNAISE BUT IF YOU USE SALAD DRESSING WITH KIND OF UH YOU KNOW KIND OF I GUESS A TART TASTE .
UHHUH .
THEN IT COMES OUT REAL GOOD BUT I UH IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE I HAVE EVER FOUND OUT THAT THE THE NOBODY ELSE USED CELERY SEED I FEEL SO SILLY BUT .

THE MIRACLE WHIP .
IT DEPENDS ON WHAT I HAVE .
YEAH .
AND SOMETIMES IF I AM USING LIKE REGULAR MAYONNAISE TO SPICE IT UP A LITTLE BIT .
UHHUH .
UH I WILL USE A LITTLE BIT OF MUSTARD WITH IT .
YEAH I DO THAT ALSO .
UHHUH .
JUST TO TO PUT A LITTLE ZING IN IT .
YEAH BUT NOT A BUNCH .
UHHUH .
BUT ENOUGH TO MAKE IT HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE FLAVOR .
MUMBLEX I LOVE BARBECUE ANYTHING BARBECUED I WILL EAT .
I LIKE UH TO BARBECUE BABY BACK RIBS .
UH .
AND UH AND AND THEY ARE SO EASY TO DO IF YOU UH HAVE A GOOD BARBECUE SAUCE .
UHHUH .
AND YOU UH JUST COOK THEM VERY VERY SLOWLY IN THE OVEN .
UHHUH .
AND IT IS NOT HARD TO COOK LIKE SOME MEALS ARE .
YEAH .
AND IT IS NOT OF COURSE IT IS MESSY TO EAT THAT IS THE DISADVANTAGE .
YEAH .
AND UH I MAKE LASAGNA FROM SCRATCH AND PEOPLE REALLY LIKE MY LASAGNA .
YEAH I LIKE TO MAKE THAT TOO I MAKE THAT ONCE IN A WHILE .
AND SO UH SOMETIMES I AM REQUESTED TO MAKE THAT AND THAT IS NOT TOO HARD TO DO BECAUSE YOU CAN DO IT IN ADVANCED AND JUST BAKE IT .
IT IS NOT REALLY ONCE YOU HAVE ALL THE INGREDIENTS .
UHHUH .
IT IS JUST THE LAYERING REALLY .
YEAH .
AND NOT BREAKING THE UH THE UH PASTA .
UHHUH .
THAT IS THE HARDEST PART PROBABLY .
BUT UH .
THEN I HAVE A WONDERFUL RECIPE FOR STRAWBERRY PIE IT JUST TAKES FOREVER .
UH .
BUT IT IS UH WHEN THE STRAWBERRIES ARE NICE AND BIG AND FRESH AND YUMMY .
DO YOU MAKE CHEESECAKE .
UH UHHUH I DO BUT THIS ONE IS BASICALLY IT IS LIKE A NORMAL PIE CRUST .
UHHUH .
BUT THEN YOU USE THIS SORT OF UH IT IS A CREAM CHEESE UH UH LAYERING BUT YOU USE UH THIN IT OUT A LITTLE BIT .
UH .
UH OR MAKE IT A LITTLE FLUFFIER AND YOU PUT UH LINE THE WHOLE PIE CRUST WITH THAT .
UHHUH .
AND SO IT IS SORT OF LIKE IN A WAY UH USING CHEESE .
UH .
CAKE BUT AND IT IS NOT A REAL CHEESE CAKE AND THEN YOU .
AND JUST PUT THE STRAWBERRIES .
OUR TOPIC TODAY .
UH YEAH SOMETHING ABOUT THE SCHOOL SYSTEM HERE .
RIGHT AND NOW I M SORT OF DO NT KNOW IF THIS AN ADVANTAGE OR DISADVANTAGE MY WIFE S A SCHOOL TEACHER SO .
WELL THEN I LL UH I LL WALK SOFTLY .
NO YOU GO RIGHT AHEAD BECAUSE I .
HAVE A LOT OF STRONG OPINIONS ON IT TOO MY WIFE TEACHES SEVENTH GRADE AND YOU KNOW THERE IS A LOT OF SERIOUS THINGS WRONG WITH THE SCHOOL SYSTEM TODAY AND THE TEACHING SYSTEM I THINK THE I DO NT THINK THE TEACHERS GET ENOUGH SUPPORT QUITE HONESTLY .
YEAH .
BUT UH FOR EXAMPLE MY WIFE SHE HAS KIDS THAT ARE ON DRUGS AND OF COURSE LIKE EVERYONE SHE HAS KIDS THAT GET PREGNANT EVEN EVEN IN THE SEVENTH GRADE .
WHAT SCHOOL SYSTEM DOES SHE TEACH IN .
PLANO SCHOOL SYSTEM .
OH WOW .
BUT TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE UH YOU KNOW ONE OF HER KIDS WILL COME IN AND HE S YOU COULD TELL HE WAS JUST BOMBED OUT ON DRUGS AND UH SHE SENDS HIM TO THE PRINCIPAL S OFFICE AND THE PRINCIPAL SENDS HIM RIGHT BACK OR HER RIGHT BACK AND SAYS HEY YOUR PROBLEM YOU TAKE CARE OF IT YOU RE NOT ALLOWED TO SEND THEM HOME YOU KNOW IF YOU DO THAT THEN YOUR ALLOCATION S CUT FROM THE STATE OR THE FEDS OR WHATEVER YOUR YOUR YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF KIDS IN YOUR CLASS EVERY DAY AND IT S IT S IT S A NUMBERS GAME I DO NT THINK THAT S RIGHT IF THEY RE ESPECIALLY IF THEY RE INTERRUPTING THE CLASS AND PREVENTING OTHER KIDS FROM LEARNING .
WELL I THINK IT S MORE OF A THERE S A BIGGER PROBLEM HERE THAN UH THAN DISCIPLINE IN THE SCHOOLS I THINK IT GETS BACK TO THE UH PARENTAL PARTICIPATION INTO THE PROGRAM .
YES .
UM TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE BOTH OF MY CHILDREN ARE IN THE ACADEMY SYSTEM IN THE GARLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT AND IT S A PUBLIC SYSTEM HOWEVER YOU D THINK THAT IT WAS A PRIVATE SCHOOL BECAUSE I TAKE IT THE BEST TEACHERS AND THE BEST STUDENTS THEY RE TAKING TOP THREE PERCENT THAT HAVE TESTED OUT YOU KNOW IN THE DISTRICT AND UH PUT THEM IN THIS ACADEMY SYSTEM AND TO GET INTO THE SYSTEM S VERY DIFFICULT BUT ONCE YOU RE IN UH THEY HAVE THEY HAVE SELFPACED PROGRAMS AND SO YOU HAVE STUDENTS THAT WANT TO LEARN AND UH YOU HAVE TEACHERS THAT WANT TO TEACH AND YOU HAVE PARENTS THAT ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN THE CHILDREN AND BASICALLY UH THERE S PROBABLY SOME DISCRIMINATION IF YOU WANT TO SAY THAT .
SURE .
UH BECAUSE MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE ACADEMY SYSTEM UH ARE CAUCASIAN AND BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO TEST INTO THE SYSTEM .
SURE .
AND MOST OF THAT S NOT ALL TRUE BUT I M SAYING A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THEM ARE AND ALSO THE OTHER LARGE PERCENTAGE IS IS THAT ALL THE PARENTS JUST ABOUT OF THESE KIDS UH HAVE COLLEGE DEGREES AT LEAST ONE PARENT DOES AND SO THERE S I THINK THAT UH THAT S MY JUSTIFICATION FOR SAYING THAT THE PARENTS THAT ARE THAT ARE PUSHING THEIR CHILDREN AT HOME EVEN IF THEY DO NT KNOW WHAT THEIR CHILDREN ARE LEARNING THEY RE THEY RE SAYING DO YOUR HOMEWORK LET ME SEE IT DO NT GET IN TROUBLE AT SCHOOL OR WE RE GOING TO BE ALL OVER YOU .
OH YEAH MY SON HAD SUCH A TOUGH TIME IN UH THE SCHOOL HE WENT TO BUT THERE WAS THROUGH IT WAS NT ALL THE SCHOOL S FAULT IT WAS HIS FAULT ALSO BUT WE PUT HIM IN A PRIVATE SCHOOL IN RICHARDSON AND THAT THAT COST MORE THAT WAS FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A SEMESTER FOR THREE SEMESTERS THAT WAS MORE THAN HIS COLLEGE TUITION WAS .
YEAH .
BUT UH IT HAD TO BE DONE AT LEAST IT TOOK CARE OF HIM AND UH THREW HIM IN A GOOD LEARNING SITUATION WHERE HE DID PARTICIPATE AND UH WANT TO LEARN SOMETHING BUT I LL TELL YOU WHAT THERE S A THERE THERE ARE A FEW FAULTS TO SAY THE LEAST IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS TODAY .
YEAH I THINK WHAT WE VE DONE IS UM UM ESPECIALLY LOOKING AT UM THE SOUTH DALLAS AREA IS THAT WE RE TRYING TO BRING THE EDUCATION LEVEL DOWN TO THE LOWEST LEVEL SO THAT THE LOWEST LEVEL CAN SUCCEED .
YEAH I THINK WE HAVE THAT PROBLEM DEALING IN MOST AREAS WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE .
AND UM THAT ALSO PROBABLY CROSSES OVER INTO BUSINESS BECAUSE NOW BUSINESSES ALSO SAY THAT IF YOU RE NOT DO NT HAVE THE PROPER EDUCATION UH INCLUDING UH EXPOSURE TO HIGH TECH FIELDS .
YOU BET .
SUCH AS COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY IF YOU CA NT USE A COMPUTER TODAY AND DO WORD PROCESSING AND DO UH DATA BASE MANAGEMENT AND DO I FORGET ALL THE OTHER STUFF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND ALL THIS OTHER KIND OF STUFF IN YOUR REGULAR JOB UH YOU CA NT FUNCTION .
YOU BET .
YOU KNOW .
MUMBLEX .
SO I THINK THAT THE SCHOOL SYSTEM PROLIFERATES OVER TO THE BUSINESS WORLD AND THE BUSINESS WORLD THEN SAYS WE RE NOT GOING TO PAY YOU UNLESS YOU HAVE THE EDUCATION AND THEN EDUC AND THEN THEN WE WHAT WE VE DONE IS CAUSED A BIG PROBLEM THAT PROLIFERATES ITSELF .
SURE WELL TEACHERS YOU KNOW THEY HAVE A A TOUGH ROW TO HOE SO TO SPEAK THEY JUST ALWAYS FIGHTING THE SYSTEM I DO NT KNOW IF IT S BETTER THAN ANY YOU KNOW WE CAME DOWN TO TEXAS FROM THE UH NEW YORK AREA WE WERE THERE FOR A SHORT TIME BUT MY WIFE IS FROM NEW YORK AND SHE WAS BORN AND RAISED THERE AND EDUCATED THERE COLLEGE AND EVERYTHING AND I THINK YOU KNOW THE SCHOOLS IN THE EAST ARE REALLY A WHOLE LOT BETTER THAN THE SCHOOLS IN THE SOUTH I DO NT CARE WHERE YOU RE FROM AND THEY THEY I DO NT KNOW IF THEY LEARN MORE BUT THEY CERTAINLY UH THEY HAVE A TENDENCY TO LEARN MORE AND IN THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY THERE IS ALL NATIONALITIES .
ALL RIGHT .
I VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE SO I GUESS THAT S ALL .
I HAVE TO DO RIGHT .
I GUESS SO .
I VE BEEN CALLED SEVERAL TIMES AND I PUSH IN PUSHED IN MY NUMBER THEY KEPT SAYING YOU HAVE THE INVALID CODE .
OH REALLY .
AND THEN I FOUND OUT THAT MY NEW PHONE WAS NT WORKING RIGHT .
OH .
OH SO THIS IS THE FIRST TIME .
I VE EVEN DONE IT .
YEAH .
I WONDER HOW LONG .
IT S GOING TO BE ON FOR .
I THINK FIVE MINUTES IS THE MAX .
OH NO I MEAN THIS WHOLE THING LIKE FOR TWO MONTHS OR SOMETHING DO YOU KNOW .
OH I DO NT KNOW .
YEAH OKAY WELL BACK TO CRIME I GUESS WE RE SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT THAT .
THEY SAY WHAT ASPECT ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT WELL I THINK AT THIS POINT I FOR ONE AM WORRIED ABOUT EVERY ASPECT .
RIGHT ESPECIALLY UH YOU SINCE YOU RE IN THE SAME METROPLEX YOU KNOW THERE S SO MUCH GOING ON HERE .
I THINK THE DRIVE BY SHOOTINGS ARE GETTING TO BE SO COMMON THAT S REALLY A SOMETHING .
YOU GOT TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM .
WELL THAT AND IN THE SCHOOLS TOO .
UHHUH GOLLY I KNOW .
STARTING TO PUT METAL DETECTORS IN AND .
HAVE THEY DONE THAT IN GARLAND .
NO I NOT THAT I M AWARE OF .
NOW UM .
I JUST HEARD YOU KNOW LAST WEEK AT THAT ONE SCHOOL THEY STARTED PUTTING THEM IN BECAUSE THERE WAS THAT ONE SHOOTING .
RIGHT .
SO UM .
WELL WE HAD A VICE PRINCIPAL SHOT AT HERE .
IS THAT RIGHT .
LAST YEAR ON THE YOU KNOW ON THE SCHOOL GROUNDS AFTER SCHOOL .
AND THE ONE BOY KILLED HIMSELF .
A FEW YEARS AGO IN THE IN A GRADE SCHOOL SO .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THESE KIDS DO NT HAVE ANY TROUBLE GETTING A HOLD OF GUNS IN ANY .
NOT AT ALL .
IN ANY NEIGHBORHOOD DOES NT SEEM LIKE .
YEAH YEAH .
SO .
YEAH IT S KIND OF SCARY TO THINK YOU SEND YOUR CHILD TO SCHOOL AND YOU WONDER IF HE S GOING TO GET SHOT .
I MEAN WE DID NT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT BEFORE .
I KNOW .
WHAT .
NEXT .
I KNOW IT S IT S IT S GETTING IT S BEEN OUT OF HAND I THINK FOR A WHILE AND IT JUST CONTINUES TO GET WORSE .
RIGHT AND YOU KNOW WE CA NT REALLY DEPEND ON THE POLICE TO SOLVE ALL THIS THEY JUST CA NT DO IT .
YEAH .
I THINK IT GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE BREAK UP OF THE FAMILY .
RIGHT .
TO A CERTAIN EXTENT AND UH AND HOW WE GOING TO BRING THAT BACK TOGETHER .
YEAH THAT S I THI I AGREE I THINK THAT S WHERE IT STEMS FROM IS THAT AND UM YOU KNOW YOU VE GOT A LOT OF A LOT MORE WOMEN .
THAT ARE WORKING NOWADAYS .
UHHUH .
THAT ARE NT HOME WITH THE CHILDREN .
RIGHT AND .
AND THAT MAY IMPACT IT AS WELL .
I THINK SO AND AND THEN THERE S A DROP IN UH THE TRAINING OF MORALS REALLY YOU KNOW .
RIGHT RIGHT .
THESE SOME OF THESE YOUNG KIDS YOU READ ABOUT JUST DOES NT BOTHER THEM TO KILL SOMEONE AT ALL .
YEAH .
I THINK .
THEY DO NT THINK TWICE ABOUT IT .
I THINK YEARS PAST MAYBE OUR CRIMINALS HAD A LITTLE MORE MORALS YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
WOULD NT KILL SOMEBODY IN COLD BLOOD .
EITHER THAT OR I DO NT KNOW IF IT HAPPENED AND IT WAS NT AS HIGHLY PUBLICIZED AS IT IS NOW OR WHAT .
THE WHAT .
THE .
I THINK IT WAS JUST RARE I REALLY DO .
UHHUH .
MY MOTHER WELL SHE S LIKE SEVENTYFOUR NOW .
SHE WHEN SHE WAS A YOUNG GIRL SHE HAD A BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL COUSIN .
THAT LIVED IN CALIFORNIA AND SHE WAS DATING THIS MILLIONAIRE S SON AND HE WANTED TO MARRY HER AND SHE WOULD NT MARRY HIM AND SO HE DROVE OUT IN THE COUNTRY ONE DAY AND SHOT THEM .
BOTH AND UH .
YOU RE KIDDING .
NO I M THE ONE .
HIMSELF AND HER .
YEAH THAT MUST HAVE BEEN AT LEAST FIFTY YEARS AGO OR MORE BUT .
OH WOW .
THE POINT OF THE STORY IS THAT THAT WAS SO UNBELIEVABLE A THING IN THOSE DAYS THAT IT WAS IN ALL THE PAPERS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY FOR WEEKS .
I BET .
BUT NOW YOU KNOW YOU WOULD NT PROBABLY READ ABOUT IT HERE IN TEXAS .
OH I KNOW .
IT S JUST YOU KNOW ANOTHER KILLING .

I REMEMBER SEEING THAT .
YEAH UH UH IS NT THAT WEIRD .
YEAH THERE S JUST TOO MANY CRAZY PEOPLE OUT THERE .
THESE DAYS .
I KNOW AND UH THE POLICE ARE NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING UNTIL THEY THEY VE COMMITTED SOME SORT OF A CRIME .
YOU KNOW HE WAS JUST BEGGING HER ON THE PHONE THAT S NOT DOING ANYTHING .
YEAH .
AND THERE ARE TIMES I THINK GEE I MUMBLEX SHOULD GIVE MY KIDS GU .
WE RE SET .
OKAY .
WHAT CHANGES DO YOU FEEL HAVE HAPPENED .
OH I GUESS THE FIRST THING HAS BEEN THE UH FOR THE RIGHT FOR WOMEN TO VOTE .
I THINK THAT HAS BEEN A MAJOR CHANGE AND ALSO THE FACT THAT UH THERE ARE SO MU MANY MORE WOMEN IN THE WORK FORCE NOWADAYS THAN THERE WERE AND THAT S PROBABLY GOING TO INCREASE .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW .
INCREASES .
EACH YEAR DOES NT IT .
I M SORRY .
IT INCREASES EACH YEAR .
I THINK .
IT SURE DOES .
YEAH THERE IS A LOT MORE WOMEN IN THE WORK PLACE NOWADAYS .
WELL AND I THINK WOMEN HAVE KIND OF HAD UH IN THE PAST .
THE REAL SUBSERVIENT .
ROLE .
ROLE .
RIGHT .
AND UH .
THAT S CHANGING .
WELL WE DO TO SOME DEGREE .
RIGHT .
BUT UH UH I THINK IT S NOT AS MUCH AS IT WAS .
RIGHT YEAH I I AGREE .
IT DEFINITELY .
I .
HAS CHANGED .
AND ESPECIALLY I THINK WITH WOMEN INCREASINGLY WORKING THEY RE GOING TO HAVE TO DEMAND MORE FROM MEN .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE THERE IS JUST I IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP UP ON EVERYTHING ELSE .
YEAH YEAH .
HAVE MORE OF AN ACTIVE ROLE IN TAKING CARE OF CHILDREN MORE OF AN ACTIVE ROLE IN TAKING CARE OF THE HOME .
WELL YOU KNOW THEY VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND I DO NT KNOW UH WHAT .
THE STATUS IS ON IT BUT YOU KNOW WOMEN GET MATERNITY LEAVE AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND I KNOW THAT THEY VE THERE HAS BEEN DISCUSSION ABOUT MEN ALSO GETTING MATERNITY LEAVE .
RIGHT .
TO HELP OUT BUT YOU KNOW I HAVE NT REALLY HEARD MUCH ABOUT THAT RECENTLY .
WELL YOU KNOW THERE IS A LOT OF COMPANIES .
THAT WO NT GIVE MAT WOMEN MATERNITY LEAVE FOR THAT VERY REASON .
UHHUH .
UH IN FACT I KNOW THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS DOWN HERE YOU THEY DO NT HAVE MATERNITY LEAVE .
UH .
OH IS THAT RIGHT .
YOU SIMPLY HAVE TO TAKE ACCUMULATE YOUR SICK LEAVE .
OH .
AND TAKE YOUR SICK LEAVE .
UHHUH .
AND I DO NT KNOW UH IF BIGGER COMPANY COMPANIES DO BUT WHEN I WAS EMPLOYED WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT I DID NT HAVE MATERNITY LEAVE EITHER AND THAT WAS THE REASON BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT WAS SHOWING PREJISIM TO WOMEN AND NOT TO MEN BUT .
HUH THAT S INTERESTING .
SO UH .
THAT S A BUMMER THOUGH .
YEAH IT IS .
I MEAN .
YOU HAVE TO SAVE ALL OF YOUR UH VACATION TIME .
YOU GOT TO TAKE THE TIME OFF .
YOU DO .
YOU HAVE TO SAVE ALL YOUR VACATION TIME AND .
YEAH .
THAT S USUALLY HOW IT S UH HAPPENED BUT UH .
UHHUH .
WHAT DO YOU SEE UH CHANGING IN THE FUTURE .
I THINK THAT WE RE PROBABLY GOING TO SEE A LOT MORE COMPANIES UH RUN BY FEMALES .
RIGHT AND AND .
AND WE LL PROB .
TOP LEVEL .
I M SORRY .
MAYBE TOP LEVEL .
RIGHT RIGHT UPPER MANAGEMENT MORE WOMEN IN UPPER MANAGEMENT AND PROBABLY UH WE LL SEE MORE FEMALES IN POLITICAL ROLES .
MORE GOVERNORS AND I THINK YOU KNOW ROLES LIKE THAT .
THAT WOULD BE KIND OF NICE .
WELL WE VE GOT IN TEXAS WE HAVE A FEMALE GOVERNOR .
THAT S RIGHT THAT S RIGHT .
AND WE HAD A FEMALE MAYOR HERE IN DALLAS AND SHE JUST HER TERM JUST ENDED AND UH SO I THINK WE RE PROBABLY GOING TO SEE MORE OF THAT .
YEAH .
IN THE FUTURE .
I THINK THAT S PROBABLY GOOD .
A LITTLE MORE INTEGRATION .
UHHUH .
AND UH MAYBE NOT SO MUCH THAT WE .
SIT ON THE BACK BURNERS AND .
RIGHT YOU KNOW I MEAN AND THAT S FINE WITH ME .
I THINK .
BUT SOMETIMES I MEAN I M NOT A WOMEN S LIBBER BY ANY MEANS BUT .
RIGHT .
I DO THERE ARE ISSUES .
THAT YOU KNOW AS FAR AS LIKE EQUAL PAY FOR MEN AND WOMEN AND THAT KIND OF STUFF I TOTALLY AM FOR .
RIGHT .
BUT I DO NT GET INTO THE UH THE REAL .
NO I DO NT EITHER .
WOMEN LIBBER MOVEMENT YOU KNOW .
I DO NT THINK THEY RE EVER GOING TO PROVE THAT MEN AND WOMEN ARE EQUAL .
YEAH .
WE JUST FUNCTION DIFFERENTLY .
RIGHT RIGHT .
AND UH I M NOT CAPABLE OF LIFTING WHAT UH A MAN CAN LIFT AND .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW THAT TYPE OF THAT TYPE OF THING BUT UH .
RIGHT .
ONE OF THE BIG CHANGES UH THEY RE DOING IN SALT LAKE IS UH AND THEY RE PROBABLY I M SURE IN DALLAS SINCE YOU RE BIG PLACES A LOT MORE WOMEN ARE UH WORKING RIGHT OUT OF THEIR HOME WITH THEIR P C S OR WITH THEIR LAP COMPUTERS OR WHATEVER .
YEAH I I VE HEARD OF THAT .
UH I HAVE NT REALLY TALKED TO ANYBODY .
THAT S YOU KNOW TOO INVOLVED WITH THAT .
BUT I MEAN I THINK THAT IS A .
I THINK THAT .
LIKE THE COTTAGE INDUSTRY .
IS IS THAT WHAT .
YOU RE TALKING ABOUT WOMEN WORKING OUT OF THEIR HOMES .
RIGHT .
YEAH UH I THINK IT S WONDERFUL .
RIGHT .
YOU ONLY HAVE TO CHECK IN WITH THE OFFICE ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK AND .
YEAH .
COURSE THEY RE TALKING ABOUT UH THAT WE RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO OUR GROCERY SHOPPING AND .
OH I KN .
BANKING AND .
BY THE PHONE AND ALL THAT .
EVERYTHING LIKE THAT SO UH IT WOULD BE KIND OF EXCITING IN SOME WAYS TO TO SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THAT AND SOME WAYS IT MIGHT BE KIND OF SCARY .
RIGHT .
THINK ANYBODY COULD DO IT BUT .
RIGHT .
ANYWAY .
YEAH I WOULD NT MIND JUST CALLING UP THE GROCERY STORE AND GIVING THEM MY ORDER AND .
RIGHT .
GOING AN HOUR LATER AND PICKING IT UP .
RIGHT BUT THEN YOU KNOW THERE IS THE PROCESS OF SELECTION .
WOULD YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM .
RIGHT .
THE BRAND AND UH .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SHOP YOU USUALLY COMPARE THE PRICES AND WOULD BE NICE THOUGH .
ALRIGHT ALLEN UH THE QUESTIONS IS CONCERNING THE CHANGES IN THE ROLES OF AMERICAN WOMEN IN THE PAST SEVERAL GENERATIONS AND YOU KNOW IN THEIR THE SOCIETY WE LIVE IN WHAT DO YOU THINK HAS OCCURRED THERE .
WELL I THINK ONE OF THE MAJOR CHANGES IS THE WHOLE ATTITUDE TOWARDS WOMEN IN THE WORK PLACE AND THE ROLE OF WOMEN IN DOING JOBS OUTSIDE OF THE HOME THAT S PROBABLY ONE OF THE MAJOR CHANGES I SEE OVER THE LAST PERIOD OF TIME .
UHHUH BUT ARE ARE THEY BEING GIVEN THE FULL HONOR FOR THE WORK THEY ARE DOING AND FOR THE UH OH MY GOSH I CA NT THINK OF THE WORD BUT FOR THE WHAT THEY HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT S THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR UH RESPONSIBILITIES IS WHAT I AM TRYING TO SAY .
OH I DO NT THINK SO I THINK IT HAS COME A LONG WAYS IN TERMS OF GIVING THEM EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES .
UHHUH .
BUT I STILL THINK IN LOTS OF JOB MARKETS THEY ARE NOT TREATED AS EQUALS IN OTHER WORDS IN SOME RESPECTS THE OTHER DIRECTION IN SOME JOB MARKETS THEY DO NT REALLY WANT TO BE TREATED AS EQUALS .
BY THE SAME TOKEN MOST IN MOST CASES WOMEN HAVE THE JOBS WITH THE SAME RESPONSIBILITY OF MEN WHO HAVE BEEN THERE BEFORE BUT AT LOWER SALARIES .
YES I THINK THAT S .
IS THAT RIGHT AND WRONG .
GENERALLY SPEAKING PRETTY TRUE AND I THINK THAT S WHAT WE REALLY OUGHT TO LOOK AT THAT GOING IS IF THEY ARE GOING TO DO EQUAL WORK THEY OUGHT TO GET EQUAL PAY .
YES .
AND THAT UH THEY OUGHT TO HAVE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES TO ADVANCE TO THOSE POSITIONS .
UHHUH .
AND I DO NT THINK THAT WE HAVE GOTTEN THERE YET .
YEAH WELL WHAT CHANGES DO YOU THINK ARE MOST SIGNIFICANT OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS ANY INDIVIDUAL THING .
OH BOY .
OR IS IT JUST A GENERAL SWITCH OVER .
I THINK IT S GENERALLY THAT SWITCH OVER AND AND I THINK THAT SWITCH OVER HAS BEEN MORE IN THE WORK FORCE I DO NT THINK THAT WOMEN ARE TREATED AS EQUALS IN THE HOME AS MUCH AS THEY ARE IN THE WORK FORCE I THINK THOSE WOMEN WHO ARE OUT WORKING ARE PROBABLY STILL EXPECTED TO CARRY MORE RESPONSIBILITY AT HOME .
UHHUH .
THAT THE HUSBAND IS HAVING THEM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT COIN PICKED UP AS MUCH RESPONSIBILITY AT HOME SO THEY HAVE ONE AND THREE QUARTERS JOBS NOW WHEREAS THE HUSBANDS HAVE ONE AND A QUARTER .
I HAVE A FEELING THAT BUSINESS WITH THE WOMAN WORKING OUT AT THE SAME LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY AS THEIR HUSBAND SORT OF TEARS INTO THEIR SOCIAL OR THEIR LOVING RELATIONSHIP .
YEAH .
IN THAT UH THE THE LADY NEEDS TO STAND UP FOR WHAT SHE HAS MADE AND HER OWN RIGHTS AND HAS A RIGHT TO DO SO AND THIS UPSETS THE MAN BECAUSE WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN BUILT TO THINK THAT WE WERE SORT OF HEAD OF THE HOUSEHOLD SO DO YOU THINK THAT IS GOING TO BE UH DIFFICULT SAYING AS FAR AS MARRIAGES AND PEOPLE ENJOYING EACH OTHER .
YES .
IN THE FUTURE YEARS .
YEAH I THINK ALSO IN TERMS OF PARENTING I THINK THERE IS GOING TO BE SOME INCREASING PROBLEM BECAUSE I THINK WOMEN ARE EXPECTING HUSBANDS TO DO MORE PARENTING AND I AM NOT SURE THEY ARE BECOMING MORE SKILLED AT IT .
UHHUH .
SO I THINK IT REALLY HAS PUT SOME ADDITIONAL STRESSES ON THE FAMILY UNITS .
WELL DO YOU HAVE ANY OPINION OF POTENTIAL CHANGES THAT MAY OCCUR IN THE NEXT GENERATION .
SPECIFICALLY .
WELL I I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ALWAYS HAPPENS IS I THINK IS WHEN THE ONE END WH YOU KNOW WERE MOVING OUT TO THE END WHERE A LOT OF WOMEN WILL BE AT WORK .
UHHUH .
AND THEN I THINK WE ARE STARTING TO SEE NOW SOME TENDENCY OF WOMEN AT MID THIRTIES AND SO THE OPINION OF THIS CAREER THING IS NT ALL THAT IT IS CRACKED UP TO BE AND I WANT TO GO BACK AND DO SOMETHING ELSE I THINK WE WILL PROBABLY SEE THE SW PENDULUM IN TERMS OF THE WORK FORCE SWING BACK A LITTLE BIT .
UHHUH .
ALSO MUCH OF IT IS DRIVEN BY ECONOMICS RIGHT NOW .
YES .
PEOPLE HAVE GOTTEN OUT AND GOTTEN USE TO INCOMES COMING IN .
WELL I ACTUALLY MO A LOT OF WOMEN ARE BEING HIRED NOW INSTEAD OF MEN BECAUSE THEY CAN GET BROUGHT IN AT LOWER SALARIES BECAUSE THAT S WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE ASSUMES THEY ARE GOING TO GET .
YEAH .
AND THE PEOPLE WELL HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT WOMEN IN UH ARMED SERVICES .
WELL I THINK THEY OUGHT TO HAVE THE RIGHT I HAVE SOME PROBLEMS WITH MY OWN FAMILY THINKING ABOUT MY WIFE GOING TO COM OR MY WIFE AND MY DAUGHTER GOING INTO COMBAT .
YEAH .
BUT I HAVE PROBLEMS WITH MEN DOING THAT AND I GUESS IF THEY WANT TO THEY OUGHT TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO IT .
UM .
IT S NOTHING I WOULD BE GREATLY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT PUSHING FOR IT .
YEAH I SOMEHOW CA NT DO THAT I .
WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE AGES WHERE THE LADIES WERE KEPT HOME SAFE SECURE AND MADE HAPPY AND THE MEN WENT OUT AND TOOK RESPONSIBILITY OF EARNING THE MONEY BRINGING IN WHATEVER THEY NEEDED AND PROTECTED THE HOUSEHOLD AND IT IT REALLY STILL BOTHERS ME I SPENT PLENTY OF YEARS IN THE SERVICE BUT IT STILL BOTHERS ME TO SEE LADIES OUT IN COMBAT OR ACTUALLY OUT IN PLACES WHERE THERE IS TWO OR THREE OF THEM THERE AND FIVE HUNDRED MEN AROUND I MEAN HOW ARE THEY GOING TO PROTECT THEMSELVES SO TO SPEAK .
I AGREE .
IT PUTS THEM IN A VERY BAD SITUATION I I REALLY DO NT GO FOR THAT .
I THINK ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT CONCERN HAS CONCERNED ME A LITTLE BIT AND I THINK I SEE SOME CHANGE IN ATTITUDES THERE MY WIFE HAPPENS TO BE A WIFE WHO HAS CHOSEN TO STAY AT HOME .
UHHUH .
AND THERE S UH HAS BEEN A TENDENCY OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS TO TREAT HER AS THOUGH SHE WAS SOMEBODY WHO DID NT HAVE MUCH INTELLIGENCE .
YEP .
BECAUSE IF SHE DID SHE WOULD BE OUT IN THE WORK FORCE UH FULFILLING HERSELF .
WELL THAT S NOT FAIR BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU ONE THING STAY HOME SOMETIME AND START DOING SOME OF THOSE JOBS THAT SHE S BEEN HANDLING AND YOU RE GOING TO LEARN THERE IS A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY JUST KEEPING THE HOME GOING .
AND I HOPE WE REACH THE POINT WHERE WHATEVER WOMEN CHOSE TO DO THAT S ACCEPTABLE .
YEAH .
IF THEY CHOSE TO GO INTO THE WORK FORCE THAT S OKAY .
YEAH .
IF THEY CHOSE NOT TO THAT S ACCEPTABLE .
AND IF THEY GO INTO THE WORK FORCE THEY SHOULD BE TREATED AS NICELY .
AS EQUALS .
AS AS WELL AS A MAN OR ANY OTHER PERSON AND UH NOT .
YEAH ARE YOU THERE .
YES .
OKAY .
DO YOU KNOW THE QUESTION FOR TODAY .
UH YES .
IT S ABOUT WHY THERE ARE NT MORE PEOPLE .
THAT ARE VOTING AND PARTICIPATING IN .
AND WHAT IS YOUR FEELING .
DO YOU THINK THIS IS VITAL IMPORTANT .
OH ABSOLUTELY .
OKAY .
DO YOU .
UM I THINK THAT UH IT S KIND OF DISCOURAGING TO UH I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN SOME POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS AND THAT KIND OF THING AND IT S REALLY DISCOURAGING TO BE IN A PHONE BANK AND CALL PEOPLE AND NOT A LOT OF THEM ARE SO ILL INFORMED THEY HAVE NO IDEA YOU KNOW EVEN THAT THERE S AN ELECTION OR .
I .
AND THESE ARE PEOPLE .
THAT ARE REGISTERED .
IT I HAVE WORKED IN SOME CAMPAIGNS AND IT S THE MOST DISCOURAGING THING IN THE WORLD .
I M ORIGINALLY FROM OKLAHOMA AND UP THERE IF THEY MISS THREE ELECTIONS THEN THEY HAVE TO REREGISTER .
AND I HAVE OFTEN WONDERED IF IF MAYBE THAT WOULD HELP THE SITUATION .
I DO NT KNOW .
WELL THAT S A THOUGHT .
WELL CAN YOU COME UP WITH ANYTHING ELSE THAT MAYBE WE COULD DO TO THESE PEOPLE .
HUH .
I DO NT KNOW I I LIKE THAT IDEA .
UM OH I HAD A THOUGHT JUST A SECOND AGO BUT IT SLIPPED MY MIND .
OH THAT S ALL RIGHT .
UM ONE THING .
THAT I THAT I THINK PROBABLY ONE OF THE REASONS THAT PEOPLE DO NT VOTE MORE IS BECAUSE THEY DO NT KNOW THE CANDIDATES .
AND I THINK SOMETIMES YOU KNOW THAT S ONE THING THAT I HAVE LEARNED IN W WORKING IN ELECTIONS AND THINGS IS YOU KNOW SOMETIMES EVEN WHEN YOU WORK FOR SOMEONE .
YOU DO NT REALLY KNOW WHAT .
THEY RE LIKE .
I KNOW THERE S BEEN A COUPLE OF PEOPLE THAT WE VOTED FOR AND WORKED FOR AND WHEN THEY GOT IN OFFICE .
IT WAS JUST A DISASTER .
WELL .
UH AND AND I M NOT SURE HOW YOU GO ABOUT REALLY FINDING OUT WHAT PEOPLE ARE REALLY LIKE BEFORE YOU VOTE FOR THEM .
I M I M NOT SUR THE ONLY THING IS IF THEY DO NT VOTE THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO COMPLAIN .
ABSOLUTELY .
IT IS UM I DO NT KNOW WHY WE ARE SO COMPLACENT BUT I M GOING TO VOTE EACH TIME .
RIGHT OR WRONG I M GOING TO CAST A BALLOT AND THEN IF I M UNHAPPY WITH IT I HAVE THE RIGHT TO EXPRESS MY OPINION .
THAT S RIGHT .
SO UH THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE I WAS GOING TO AND I M LIKE YOU .
I VE JUST LOST A TRAIN OF THOUGHT THAT I HAD .
BUT THEY HAVE BEEN MORE LITTLE MORE S EFFECTIVE IN OKLAHOMA WITH HAVING THIS PROGRAM THAT YOU VOTE OR YOU LOSE IT .
NOW IF YOU JUST LOSE IF YOU JUST SKIP ONE ELECTION .
NO THREE .
THREE .
YOU HAVE TO LO YOU HAVE TO SKIP THREE .
UHHUH .
AND UH OF COURSE THOSE CAN BE THEY CAN BE OH A LONG TIME APART BUT UM .
I THINK THAT S AN EXCELLENT IDEA BECAUSE THEN PEOPLE REALLY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT .
OF COURSE WHAT DO YOU THINK AND THIS IS NOT ONE OF OUR QUESTIONS BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS NO EXCUSE ABSENTEE BALLOTING .
NO EXCUSE .
UH I M NOT SURE IF I M FAMILIAR WITH THAT .
OKAY .
OR NOT .
I M SURE ALL OVER THE STATE OF TEXAS NOW YOU HAVE THREE WEEKS TO GO FOR ABSENTEE BALLOTING .
UHHUH .
AND YOU DO NT HAVE TO H BE SICK OUT OF TOWN OR ANYTHING .
THEY THERE IS NO EXCUSE .
ANYONE CAN GO AND VOTE .
OH I THINK THAT S GREAT .
UM .
DO YOU .
ACTUALLY YOU KNOW MY HUSBAND HAS RUN FOR OFFICE BEFORE AND SOMETIMES IT S NICE TO BE ABLE TO GO AHEAD OF TIME AND VOTE BECAUSE YOU KNOW IF YOU RE GOING TO BE TIED UP THAT DAY UH CAMPAIGNING OR WHATEVER .
IT MIGHT BE .
UM THAT KIND OF JUST KIND OF TAKES .
THAT LOAD OFF YOU KNOW YOU CAN JUST GO AHEAD AND GET THAT TAKEN CARE OF AND .
BUT THAT IS AN EXCUSE AND THAT WOULD I COULD LIVE WITH .
UHHUH .
BUT THIS IDEA OF ANYONE .
WEL I JU I AM SO BITTERLY OPPOSED TO THIS .
IF YOU RE BUSY THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A LEGITIMATE EXCUSE .
UHHUH .
IF YOU ARE INCAPACITATED ILL HEALTH BUT TO HAVE THE EXPENSE OF LET S SEE .
THEY HAVE FIVE SIX PEOPLE AT MY POLLING PLACE .
THEY CAN COME FROM ALL OVER THE CITY AND I DO NT KNOW WHY WE COULD NT HAVE DUPLICATE VOTING ON SOME OF THIS .
WELL HOPEFULLY ONCE THEY HAVE UH YOU KNOW ONCE THEY VE CHECKED THEM OFF THE LIST .
THEY THEY DO HAVE TO CHECK THEM OFF A LIST .
YES I KNOW .
WHEN THEY VOTE SO HOPEFULLY THEY COULD NT .
BUT IS THERE IS EVERY LIST CHECKED AS THOROUGHLY AS A YOU KNOW .
WE BACK IN WHEN I LIVED .
OKAY UH LET ME SEE I VE GOT TWO CHILDREN ONE IS UH BOTH PRESCHOOLERS ONE IS TWO AND ONE IS UH FOUR .
UHHUH .
SO AND UH THIS IS MY FIRST YEAR OFF AND I VE ALWAYS WORKED UH FROM THE TIME THAT THEY WERE LITTLE AND SO I DECIDED TO HOLD OFF ON MY JOB FOR A WHILE AND STAY HOME WITH THEM AND SPEND SOME MORE TIME WITH THEM WHICH I HAD NT BEEN DOING .
WELL I THINK THAT S WONDERFUL .
SO .
MY CHILDREN ARE IN COLLEGE .
OH .
BUT I TEACH SCHOOL AND I TEACH UH MIDDLE SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN .
OH .
AND SO I SEE A LOT OF UH VARIATION IN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN KIDS ARE AT HOME .
YEAH .
UH I HAVE TAUGHT SCHOOL EVER SINCE MY CHILDREN WERE LITTLE .
UHHUH .
BUT THE ADVANTAGE OF TEACHING SCHOOL IS YOUR HOURS ARE CLOSER TO YOUR CHILDREN S AND YOUR HOLIDAYS ARE TOO .
YEAH .
SO TEACHING I THINK IS A A GOOD CAREER TO HAVE AND STILL BE ABLE TO SPEND A LOT OF QUALITY TIME WITH KIDS .
WELL THAT S WHAT I WAS DOING BEFORE I WAS TEACHING FOR RICHARDSON SCHOOL DISTRICT .
UHHUH .
AND UH IT JUST SEEMED LIKE IT TOOK A LOT OF MY TIME WITH THEM BEING SO LITTLE .
RIGHT .
AND IT S REALLY HARD .
WELL WITH THEM BEING AS YOUNG IT WAS MUCH MUCH HARDER WHEN MINE WERE YOUNG .
YEAH .
AND UH I REALLY DID NT HAVE THAT MUCH OF A CHOICE BECAUSE MY HUSBAND WAS TRYING TO FINISH HIS UH COLLEGE WORK .
YEAH .
AND HIS MASTER S DEGREE .
YEAH .
AND SO FORTH AND SO IT WAS A MATTER OF SOMEBODY HAD TO HAVE A MUMBLEX JOB .
THAT S RIGHT THAT S RIGHT AND THAT S WHAT WAS KIND OF WHAT WHERE WE WERE YOU KNOW WE I REALLY DID NT HAVE TO WORK BUT I FELT LIKE I REALLY WANTED TO WORK .
UHHUH .
AND I FELT I ALSO FELT LIKE BOY I WAS SURE MISSING A LOT AND THEY WERE GROWING SO FAST AND YOU KNOW IT S LIKE DO I REALLY NEED TO WORK YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
AND I AND IT THAT CHOICE WAS THERE I REALLY DID NT HAVE TO AND YOU KNOW SO I DID HAVE THAT ADVANTAGE THERE BUT IT S DIFFERENT STAYING HOME TOO YOU KNOW .
YES IT CERTAINLY IS WE .
IT S AN ADJUSTMENT TO MAKE ALSO .
WELL I THINK THAT UH WE NEED TO SPEND MORE FAMILY TIME TOGETHER WITH WITH CHILDREN TODAY UH WE MADE A POINT TO SPEND A LOT OF QUALITY TIME AND THE ACTIVITIES THAT WE WERE INVOLVED IN WERE THE ACTIVITIES THE KIDS WERE .
UHHUH .
INVOLVED IN YOU KNOW LIKE UH THROUGH SCOUTING OR .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW ANYTHING LIKE THAT WE PARTICIPATED AND UH WE ALWAYS MADE A POINT TO HAVE BREAKFAST TOGETHER AND SUPPER TOGETHER NOW .
WOW THAT S GREAT .
WHEN YEAH WHEN UH THE KIDS WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL IT WAS HARDER TO ALWAYS HAVE SUPPER TOGETHER BUT WE DID ALWAYS HAVE BREAKFAST TOGETHER .
UHHUH .
SO WE WE HAD SUPPER TOGETHER AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BUT WHEN IT WAS NT FEASIBLE YOU KNOW WE KIND OF KEPT A MASTER CALENDAR .
UHHUH .
AND WHEN IT WAS NT FEASIBLE WELL THAT WAS UNDERSTANDABLE BUT .
YEAH .
UH WE VE ALWAYS TRIED TO SPEND TIME TO TALK AND UH HAVE SOME TIME TOGETHER TIME AND WE SAT AROUND THE TABLE WE DID NT SIT IN FRONT OF A T V OR .
WOW THAT S GREAT .
THAT KIND OF THING SO I THINK THAT S BEEN IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A CLOSE FAMILY .
UHHUH .
AND EVEN THOUGH THE KIDS ARE BASICALLY UH GROWN UH THEY STILL LIKE TO SIT DOWN AT THE TABLE AND US ALL EAT TOGETHER WHEN THEY RE HERE AND .
UHHUH .
UH HAVE SPOKEN BEFORE OF THEY WANT THAT KIND OF YOU KNOW SITUATION FOR THEM WHEN YOU KNOW AND THEIR CHILDREN WHEN THEY MARRY AND HAVE CHILDREN .
YEAH KIND OF GOES ON .
UHHUH .
THEY DO WHAT THEY SEE YOU KNOW .
THAT S RIGHT THEY MODEL AND WITH THE DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILIES TODAY I M SURE WITH A AS A SCHOOLTEACHER ALSO YOU SEE .
UHHUH .
WHAT HAPPENS TO THESE KIDS .
YEAH .
WHEN THESE FAMILIES NEVER COMMUNICATE OR THEY RE DYSFUNCTIONAL AS FAR AS THE BETWEEN UH OH SECOND FAMILIES UH ONE PARENT FAMILIES OR .
UHHUH YEAH .
ALL THOSE KINDS OF PROBLEMS THAT THEY HAVE AND THEN YOU SEE THEM MAGNIFIED IN THE CHILDREN .
YEAH PLUS YOU TEACH MIDDLE SCHOOL SO I M SURE THAT .
OH BOY YES .
YOU ARE REALLY YOU REALLY BOY OH BOY I TAUGHT EARLY CHILDHOOD .
UHHUH .
SO I HAD THE LITTLE ONES .
YES .
AND UH YOU KNOW I SAW IT THERE TOO AND YOU YOU KNOW YOU JUST OH IT S IT S KIND OF AN EYEOPENER .
IT IS .
SO .
IT IS AND M I THINK MOST TEACHERS REALIZE THE VALUE OF QUALITY TIME WITH CHILDREN .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK WE MAKE A POINT TO DO THAT .
YEAH I THINK YOU RE RIGHT .
BECAUSE WE SEE WE SEE ALL THE TIME THE OUTCOME OF NOT DOING THAT .
YEAH .
AND I THINK IF WE WERE NT SO INTERESTED I IN CHILDREN IN CHILD CARE THEN WE WOULD NT BE TEACHING ANYWAY .
RIGHT .
SO .
RIGHT .
UH I WISH WE COULD REACH MORE OF THE REST OF THE WORLD .
YEAH YEAH .
I THINK UH THE MAJOR PROBLEMS IN EDUCATION ARE NOT WHAT S HAPPENING IN THE SCHOOLS IT S WHAT S HAPPENING IN THE FAMILIES .
I AGREE YEAH .
AND UH THEY EXPECT US TO YOU KNOW HAVE CREATE MIRACLES AT SCHOOL AND FIX ALL THE PROBLEMS AND TAKE OVER THE ROLES OF THE PARENTS AS WELL AS THAT OF THE TEACHERS .
YEAH .
AND YOU GET TO A POINT WHERE IT S COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE .
YEAH I AGREE I I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU RE SAYING .
AND YOU JUST GET MORE AND MORE FRUSTRATED AND YET YOU FEEL FOR THE THE KIDS YOU DO THE BEST YOU CAN BUT .
WELL DO YOU HAVE ANY PETS .
YES I DO .
I HAVE A DOG NAMED GRISLY WHO S A TEN YEAR OLD UH MIXED BREED BETWEEN GOLDEN RETRIEVER AFGHAN HOUND AND CHOW .

WELL I I THINK WE HAVE A NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH .

YEAH .
PLAYING IN THE YARD .

AND I GUESS MOST OF THE CRIME THAT I M CONCERNED ABOUT GENERALLY IS AGAINST MY KIDS IT S SCARY TO SEND THEM OFF DOWN THE STREET A FEW HOUSES .
OH I M SURE IT IS .
TO LET THEM GO PLAY WITH SOMEONE AND .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU HEAR ABOUT PEOPLE GETTING PICKED UP AND .

UHHUH .
AND WE HAVE NEIGHBORHOOD KIDS THAT LIKE TO GET INTO MISCHIEF SO .
OH NO .
WE THOUGHT WITH THAT LIGHT YOU KNOW IT WOULD MAYBE KEEP THEM FROM DOING SOMETHING TO THE BOAT .
THAT S A GOOD THOUGHT .
YEAH SO .
WELL WE VE BEEN REAL LUCKY THAT I DO NT BELIEVE THERE S BEEN YOU KNOW MUCH TROUBLE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD BUT IT .
UHHUH .
BUT IT DOES SEEM THERE THAT THERE IS A LOT MORE HERE IN PLANO OF UH JUST BORED TEENAGERS .

UHHUH .
YOU KNOW KIDS THAT ARE BORED LIKE YOU SAY .
YEAH AND THEY DO NT UH I KNOW MY SISTERINLAW WHO LIVES IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD .
UHHUH .
THEY VE HAD THEIR THEY PARKED THEIR CAR OUT ON THE STREET BEFORE AND IT S BEEN SPRAY PAINTED AND .
OH NO .
A FEW THINGS LIKE THAT AND COURSE YOU KNOW I DO NT KNOW I M GETTING SCARED FOR KIDS TO GET OLDER BECAUSE YOU DO NT KNOW IF IT S SOMEONE THEIR TEENAGERS KNOW .
UHHUH .
WHO AND OR IS IT JUST RANDOM .
UHHUH .
CRIME BUT UH WE VE BEEN REAL LUCKY THAT NO ONE IN MY FAMILY WITH THE ANYWHERE THAT THEY LIVE HAS HAD BEEN A VICTIM OF YOU KNOW A SERIOUS CRIME .
YEAH YEAH .
BUT UH IT S REALLY SCARY TO KNOW THAT YOU CAN LIVE A NORMAL LIFE AND TRY TO BE A GOOD CITIZEN .
UHHUH .
BUT IT DOES NT MEAN YOU LL BE SAFE AND .
UHHUH I KNOW IT .
BUT I GUESS I TAKE A LOT OF UH LITTLE BIT OF UH SAFETY IN KNOWING THAT A LOT OF THE CRIMES THAT THEY REPORT ARE LIKE DRUG RELATED OR .
UHHUH .
UH THINGS THAT PLACES USUALLY THAT I WOULD NT BE GOING .
UHHUH UHHUH .

I I THOUGHT WHEN I GOT MY V C R I D PROBABLY DROP IT YOU KNOW BUT THAT WAS YEARS .
WELL WHAT .
I BELIEVE IS ONE OF THE MAJOR PRO UH THINGS .
THAT IS WRONG WITH OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM IS THAT UM WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH DISCIPLINE .
UHHUH .
AND THE PARENTS DO NOT LET THE TEACHERS DISCIPLINE THE CHILDREN .
THE WAY THAT THEY NEED TO BE .
UHHUH .
DISCIPLINED RIGHT NOW .
UHHUH .
I AGREE WITH THAT .
UH WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL I KNOW I WAS SCARED TO DEATH .
YOU WERE .
ABOUT BEING DISCIPLINED AND THE DISCIPLINE THAT MY DAUGHTER RECEIVES NOW .
UHHUH .
IN GOING TO SCHOOL IS JUST TOTALLY DIFFERENT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW YOU JUST YOU DID NOT SEE I DID NOT SEE ANYBODY IN MY CLASSROOMS WHEN I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL ACT UP THE WAY THAT KIDS DO .

THESE DAYS IN THE CLASSROOM .

I UNDERSTAND THEY ACT UP PRETTY BAD .

WELL THEY THEY JUST DO NT DO THAT ANY MORE .
I KNOW .
BUT THE SCHOOL SYSTEM S AFRAID OF GETTING SUED .
UHHUH .
AND UM ALL SORTS OF LAWSUITS I M SURE BECAUSE OF THINGS LIKE THAT .
YEAH YEAH .
AND I ALSO BELIEVE WE DO NT EVEN THOUGH I FEEL LIKE I PAY A GOOD SHARE TOWARDS THE SCHOOL SYSTEM THAT THE TEACHERS ARE STILL UNDERPAID AND WE STILL DO NT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TOWARDS .
UHHUH UHHUH .
PUT IN TOWARD PUBLIC SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
AND UM I THINK THAT IF WE HAD ENOUGH MONEY AND PAID THE TEACHERS .
A LITTLE BIT MORE THAT MAYBE THAT COULD SOLVE SOME OF OUR PROBLEMS .
YEAH .
WAS NT THAT WHAT PART OF THE LOTTERY IS GOING TO GO FOR IF WE .
YES .
APPROVE IT .
SUPPOSEDLY THAT S .
WHAT .
IT .
S SUPPOSE TO GO FOR AND .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW WE LL JUST HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE WHETHER THAT S APPROVED OR NOT .
YOU KNOW I DO NT KNOW YOUR FEELINGS TOWARD THAT .
I GUESS WE SHOULD NT GET INTO THAT BUT .
UM AND WHAT ELSE UM I THINK IN SOME WAYS THAT THEY NEED TO BE MORE CAREFUL OF THE TEACHERS THAT THEY HIRE .
UHHUH .
I HAVE HEARD STORIES UH FROM OTHER PARENTS THAT I KNOW OF THEIR CHILDREN ARE IN HIGH SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
THAT TEACHERS ARE OUT THERE GIVING DRUGS AND SELLING DRUGS .

UHHUH .
AND YOU KNOW TO BE BE MORE CAREFUL OF THE TEACHERS THAT WE PLACE IN OUR SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
UM .
UM THAT S BASICALLY ABOUT ALL THAT I KNOW THAT MAY BE WRONG WITH THE SCHOOL SYSTEM .
I THINK WITH WHAT .
THEY HAVE TO WORK WITH I THINK THEY RE DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB RIGHT NOW .

UHHUH SO .
BUT THEN WHAT DO I KNOW .
YOU DO NT HAVE ANY CHILDREN IN SCHOOL .

EXTENDED CARE THAT TYPE OF THING SO YES I M VERY FAMILIAR WITH IT AND IT S NOT SOMETHING THAT IS UH YOU KNOW I NEVER THOUGHT I D HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS KIND OF EXPERIENCE BUT I GUESS WE ALL DO .
I THINK SOONER OR LATER UH BOTH MY MOTHER AND MY HUSBAND S MOTHER WE HAD TO END UP PUTTING IN NURSING HOMES AND THEY WERE TO THE POINT THAT THEY ONLY LIVED BOTH OF THEM ABOUT SIX WEEKS ONCE THEY GOT IN .

IN MY LIFE I THAT IT JUST YOU KNOW IT S ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING .

WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND IN DEALING WITH THE NURSING HOMES .
WELL THEY RE NOT EVERY ALL THE HORROR STORIES YOU HEAR ABOUT THEM I THINK ARE TRUE .

UH WE VE YOU KNOW WE VE LOOKED AROUND AND MY WIFE HAS LOOKED AT EXTENSIVELY AT ALL THE ONES IN THE AREA AND THE ONE SHE IS IN NOW UH THERE S A LOT OF DRAWBACKS A LOT OF THINGS WE DO NT LIKE BUT AGAIN IT S NO DIFFERENT THAN EVERY ONE AND YOU KNOW THE COST OF IT THE THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH .
UM UHHUH .
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT FOR WHAT YOU RE PAYING A HOSPITAL FOR .
YES .
ALMOST THE SAME WELL EVEN NOT AS MUCH CARE .
YES .
IT S NOT THAT EXPENSIVE REALLY .

UHHUH .
AND UH THEIRS BOTH RAN OH I THINK MY MOTHERINLAW S WAS LIKE FIFTEEN HUNDRED AND MY MOTHER S WAS TWO THOUSAND THEN THIS HAS BEEN FIVE YEARS AGO AND UH .
UHHUH .
UH ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW I HAD DISCOVERED IS THAT IF THEY KNEW THAT I CAME IN THERE AT ALL DIFFERENT HOURS THEY GOT MUCH BETTER CARE THAN IF WHEN I STARTED OUT WITH MY MOTHERINLAW BECAUSE SHE WAS IN THERE FIRST I .
UHHUH .
WOULD GO CERTAIN HOURS AND THEY KNEW AND IF I D POP IN UNEXPECTEDLY I DISCOVERED YOU KNOW THEY DID A LITTLE BIT THEY DID BETTER .
OH REALLY .
YOU KNOW UHHUH AND YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF TIMES WITH MY MOTHERINLAW I WOULD CATCH SOMETHING NOT BEING TAKEN CARE OF .
UHHUH .
AND YOU KNOW WOULD HAVE TO RATE SO I GOT TO WHERE I KNEW THEN WHEN MY MOTHER WAS IN THAT YOU KNOW NOT TO GO THE SAME TIME ALL THE TIME .
YEAH .
BECAUSE THEY WOULD AND WHEN I WAS LOOKING FOR THE NURSING HOMES ANOTHER THING THAT I LEARNED UH WE HAD MY MOTHER ALL SET TO GO INTO ONE AND FOR SOME REASON I JUST WENT BACK AND ON MY OWN WENT AROUND THE DIFFERENT FLOORS .
UHHUH .
AND I SAW AREAS THAT THEY HAD NOT SHOWN ME AND THEY DID NOT COME ACROSS AS WELL .
WELL I LL BE DARNED .
AS YOU KNOW WHAT THEY HAD ORIGINALLY SHOWN ME SO UH WE DID NOT PUT HER IN THAT ONE WE PUT HER IN ANOTHER ONE THAT I I WENT A COUPLE OF TIMES .

YES YOU DO .
I KNOW MY MOTHER S IN NOW IN A UNIT THAT S MAINLY ALZHEIMER S .
UHHUH .

UHHUH .
UH THE FACT THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE THEY RE UP AND AROUND BUT THEY RE THEY RE IT S REMINDS ME TOO MUCH OF AN ASYLUM TYPE S .
UHHUH .
SITUATION .
UHHUH .

UHHUH .
AND UH WE DO NT KNOW I I MEAN SHE DOES NOT KNOW US ANYMORE .

I THINK THE ENTIRE BASEBALL YEAH THEY RE THE ONES .

I THINK THEY SHOULD UH UH PAY HIM .
WHAT .
HIS SALARY IS GOING TO BE UH AND LET HIM BECAUSE HE S GOT ONE MORE YEAR BEFORE HE TURNS INTO A FREE AGENT .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND THEN UH WHO KNOWS IF HE PRODUCES NEXT YEAR THEY MAY HAVE TO END UP PAYING HIM ANYWAY BUT IF HE DOES NT THEN HIS MARKET VALUE WILL GO DOWN AND THEY CAN PICK HIM UP FOR FOR A LOT LESS THAN .
MUMBLEX .
THAN THEY WOULD UH IF THEY PAID HIM .
THE SI YOU KNOW THE SIX MILLION DOLLARS .

I SAW ON THE NEWS TODAY THAT BU BUECHELE WAS BACK JUST TO VISIT .

WELL I M JUST GULLIBLE ENOUGH THAT I THINK BOBBY VALENTINE IS UM UH DOING ALL RIGHT AND I M SURE .
YOU DO HUH .
WELL .
THAT S CONTRARY TO UH POPULAR BELIEF YOU KNOW .
OH I KNOW I KNOW SO BUT I WOULD LIKE SO MUCH FOR THESE RANGERS TO GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER AND GIVE UM OH UH NOLAN RYAN .
THE SUPPORT .
HE NEEDS .
OH I KNOW .
YOU KNOW IT S TOO BAD THAT UH IT HAS TO BE A FORTYTWO YEAR OLD GUY TO TO LEAD THE UH THE RANGERS YOU KNOW .
I UNDERSTAND .
THEY NEED TO HAVE SOME SOME YOUNG GUYS .
THAT CAN TAKE THE LEAD AND AND UH .
WELL I JUST OH I HAVE SO MANY MIXED EMOTIONS ABOUT ALL THIS .

BUT I THINK WITH THEIR NEW STADIUM THEY SHOULD GO AND LET .
SO HOW MANY UM CREDIT CARDS DO YOU HAVE .

UHHUH .
I TRY NOT TO USE THEM TOO OFTEN .
BUT LIVING IN THIS AREA UH LIKE I LIVE FIFTEEN MILES WEST OF WASHINGTON D C .

YEAH .
SO SOMETIMES YOU HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE IF YOU NEED TO BUY SOMETHING .
YEAH .
WELL I I KNOW I WAS UP IN THERE AND A LOT OF CREDIT CARDS AND I WAS JUST STARTING TO GET TO WHERE IT WAS GETTING ME IN TROUBLE .

SO THAT I USE BECAUSE I TRAVEL SOME .
SO I USE THAT AND I DO NT REALLY HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I ONLY USE IT FOR BUSINESS SO I AUTOMATICALLY HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY IT OFF .
YEAH .
BUT .
UM .
UH I WOULD NT MIND UH YOU KNOW GETTING BACK INTO ONE IF THEY WOULD YOU KNOW YOU START OUT AT A LOW LIMIT AND THEN THEY JUST KEEP WANTING YOU TO INCREASE YOUR LIMIT .
UHHUH .
AND AND IF I CAN GET ONE .
THAT LL KEEP MY LIMIT AT FIVE HUNDRED .
UHHUH .
AND I CAN NEVER GO OVER THAT OR SOMETHING .
UHHUH .

UHHUH .
FIFTY THOUSAND .
YEAH .
FORGET IT I DO NT WANT THAT .
UM THE TEMPTATION S TOO GREAT .
YEAH .
UM .
SO I DO NT KNOW JUST UH WRITING CHECKS IS JUST AS EASY I GUESS .

SO I GUESS UH WE VE KIND OF EXHAUSTED THIS UH TOPIC .
YEAH WELL REALLY WHAT WHAT CAN YOU .
YEAH YOU CA NT SAY TOO MUCH ABOUT IT REALLY .
OTHER THAN YOU USE THEM OR YOU DO NT USE THEM .
YOU LIKE THEM OR YOU DO NT LIKE THEM .
SO .
UHHUH .
I GUESS UH THEY DO NT CARE IF WE END IT EARLY .
SO UH HOPEFULLY UH YOU HAVE A GOOD THANKSGIVING .
THAT S COMING UP AND .
OKAY YOU TOO .
AND THEN UH MAYBE WE LL TALK AGAIN .
YEAH MAY BE YOU RE THE FURTHEST PERSON ACTUALLY THAT I VE TALKED .
I VE TALKED TO A LOT OF PEOPLE IN TEXAS .
YEAH .
YEAH .
TEXAS IS THE BIG ONE .
YEAH SO .
OKAY THEN .
WELL BYE NOW .
O OKAY BYEBYE .
WELL STEVE DID YOU GO TO COLLEGE .
YEAH .
IN FACT I M STILL GOING .
OH THAT S GOOD .
SO YOU PROBABLY COULD GIVE SOME GREAT ADVICE .
UH WELL I DO NT KNOW ABOUT THAT BUT I IN FACT I M IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO CHOOSE A P H D SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
WELL WHAT S YOUR CA WHAT S YOUR INTEREST YOUR UH .
UH WELL COMPUTER SCIENCE AND COGNITIVE SCIENCE .
UHHUH .
SO .
THAT THAT S SIMILAR TO WHAT I M IN A P H D PROGRAM RIGHT NOW .
OH I SEE .
AND UH MY AREA OF EXPERTISE IT .
S INFORMATION SYSTEMS WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT LESS TECHNICAL I THINK THAN UH THAN COMPUTER SCIENCE .
BUT MY AREA OF EXPERTISE IS UH UH HUMAN COMPUTER INTERACTION .
OH YEAH .
AND I THINK THAT S ONE REASON WHY I M PART OF THIS STUDY UH BECAUSE IT S OF I M WORKING WITH VOICE SYSTEMS .
YEAH .
YEAH .
SO SO GOOD LUCK .
I GUESS WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT GIVING ADVICE THOUGH .
WH WHAT WHAT TYPE OF ADVICE DO YOU THINK YOU D GIVE TO A A PARENT .
TO A PARENT .
YEAH .
WELL YOU KNOW THE THING IS WHEN YOU RE A KID .
UHHUH .
AND THE KID AT THAT AGE ESPECIALLY IF THEY RE GOING INTO UNDERGRADUATE IT SEEMS LIKE THEY THINK THEY KNOW WHAT .
THEY WANT .
YEAH .
AN AND I MEAN CHOOSING FROM MY EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW I THOUGHT YOU KNOW MY I KNOW WHAT .
I WANT A LOT MORE THAN MY PARENTS KNOW WHAT .
I WANT .
UHHUH .
BUT UH I DO NT KNOW AT THE SAME TIME YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT THE SCHOOL YOU KNOW THE SIZE OF IT OR .
YEAH .
I THINK THAT S MORE IMPORTANT PROBABLY THAN EVEN THE CAREER VOCATION BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE CHANGE .
YEAH .
I KN I KNOW VERY FEW PEOPLE .
THAT UH STARTED IN ONE FIELD AND STAYED WITH IT .
YOU KNOW THEY I THINK THAT S WHAT .
YOU JUST SAID YOU KNOW HAVING TO DO MORE WITH THE SIZE OF THE SCHOOL THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE SCHOOL UH I THINK THAT S MUCH MORE IMPORTANT .
I I THINK I D I D ADVISE A PARENT TO SEND A KID TO A SCHOOL THOUGH THAT HAS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROGRAMS YOU KNOW THAT UH SOME OF THE SMALLER SCHOOLS MIGHT BE VERY LIMITED IN WHAT .
THEY CAN OFFER BUT SOME OF THE UH THE SMALL SOME OF THE LARGER SMALL SCHOOLS YOU KNOW I GUESS AROUND THREE OR FOUR THOUSAND STUDENTS .
YEAH .
HAVE A CAN OFFER A BROADER RANGE OF CURRICULUMS AND THINGS SO IF THE KID DOES CHANGE THEY DO NT HAVE TO TRANSFER OR THEY DO NT HAVE TO UH UH I DO NT KNOW THEY DO NT HAVE TO GIVE UP YEARS OF YOU KNOW OF CREDIT TRANSFER AND THINGS .
YEAH .
THAT S DISRUPTIVE .
YEAH .
I NORMALLY AND AND PARENTS HATE TO HEAR THIS YOU KNOW BECAUSE I I ACTUALLY TEACH COLLEGE I HATE TO UH I HATE TO TALK TO THE PARENTS BECAUSE UM ONE OF THE REASONS IS BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE KID DOES NT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT .
THEY WANT AND I ALWAYS SAY MAKE SURE YOU MAJOR .
IN SOMETHING THAT YOU LIKE EVEN IF IT S NOT GOING TO BE YOUR CAREER VOCATION .
BECAUSE YOU LL GET BETTER GRADES .
I I THINK MOST EMPLOYERS WOULD PROBABLY RATHER HIRE YOU KNOW A A THREE SIX IN UM IN HISTORY UH TO BE A SALESMAN THAN SOMEONE WITH A TWO .
OH IN BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION .
OH YEAH .
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE .
YEAH .
WELL YEAH I SEE WHAT .
YOU RE SAYING .
YEAH .
I ALWAYS YOU KNOW TELL THEM THAT YOU SHOULD MAJOR IN SOMETHING .
YOU YOU RE GOING TO GET GOOD GRADES IN .
YEAH .
BECAUSE THAT THAT S ALWAYS I THINK MORE IMPORTANT YOU KNOW OVERALL .
I DO NT KNOW .
UH GIVE ME .
FIVE MINUTES .
YEAH .
OH YOU YOU RE AT THE OFFICE NOW .
YEAH .
AT WORK .
YEAH .
YEAH .
I M JUST GETTING READY TO GO TO LUNCH .
UH YEAH THAT S LIKE WHAT .
WE WERE SAYING THOUGH WOULD YOU UH ADVISE A PRIVATE SCHOOL OR A PUBLIC SCHOOL .
I WOULD I WOULD .
YOU KNOW WHAT S THE TRADE OFF THERE WHAT .
IT WOULD I I TELL YOU I LIVE IN MARYLAND AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS HERE ARE .
PRETTY GOOD .
I TEACH AT A PUBLIC SCHOOL ACTUALLY AND I KNOW THAT THE S .
A T SCORES FOR OUR ADMITTING FRESHMEN ARE HIGHER THAN A LOT OF THE PUBLIC SCH A LOT OF THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS .
AND UM I ACTUALLY I WOULD FULL TIME AT A AT A PUBLIC SCHOOL AND THEN RIGHT NOW I M TEACHING PART TIME AT A PRIVATE SCHOOL AT A CATHOLIC INSTITUTION .
OH I SEE .
AND UM AND I REALLY THINK I THINK I M GETTING A BETTER CALIBER OF STUDENT AT THE PRIVATE SCHOOL BECAUSE I THINK THEIR PARENTS PAY MORE AND I THINK THE KIDS ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE CHALLENGED BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS ARE PROBABLY COLLEGE EDUCATED WHERE AT THE PUBLIC SCHOOL I DO NT THINK AS MANY PARENTS ARE PUBLIC ARE ARE COLLEGE EDUCATED AND I DO NT I THINK BECAUSE IT COSTS LESS THE KID DOES NT TAKE IT QUITE AS SERIOUS YOU KNOW THEY RE NOT TH IT IT S THE MINIMAL COST .
BUT I THINK YOU CAN GET A GOOD EDUCATION AT PUBLIC OR PRIVATE BUT I THINK YOU CAN ALSO GET A BAD EDUCATION AT PUBLIC OR PRIVATE YOU KNOW I .
YEAH .
YOU HAVE TO REALLY YOU HAVE TO LOOK AROUND AT THE SCHOOL .
I I THINK THE BAD PART IS THAT MOST PARENTS OR KIDS DO NT KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR .
YEAH YEAH .
I THINK UH I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT .
IN FACT THE THING THAT I M GOING THROUGH THE SAME THING WHERE IN GRADUATE SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
I WAS TRYING TO CHOOSE .
YOU KNOW A PARTICULAR INSTITUTION MIGHT BE BETTER .
RIGHT .
FOR MY AREA .
UHHUH .
YET LIKE SAY YOU KNOW THE UNIVERSITY OF SMALL TOWN IN ARKANSAS OR SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
MIGHT HAVE SOME TOP SPECIALISTS IN MY AREA .
RIGHT .
YET IF I GO TO U OF I OR C M U OR YOU KNOW SOME YOU KNOW ANY BIG NAME SCHOOL MY QUALITY OF EDUCATION MIGHT NOT BE THAT MUCH BETTER BUT IT S THE SAME THING THERE S YOU KNOW WHAT WILL THE NAME RECOGNITION .
RIGHT .
GET ME .
YEAH .
KIND OF THING .
DOES IT HAVE A BIG TEN FOOTBALL TEAM OR .
YEAH YEAH .
THAT S THAT S USUALLY THE BASIC CRITERIA .
YEAH .
I MEAN UH YEAH IS IT .
A PAC TEN SCHOOL YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
BUT I THINK YEAH SEE I M I M AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND SO IN THIS THIS REGION UM THOUGH I GO TO A SMALLER BRANCH OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND MY DIPLOMA WILL STILL SAY UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND .
OH .
UM YOU KNOW IT DOES NT DOES NT DIFFERENTIATE ON MY DIPLOMA THOUGH I WOULD PUT IT ON MY RESUME WHAT PROGRAM .
I WENT TO .
BUT I I THINK YOU KNOW I M ACTUALLY AT A SMALLER PROGRAM I M NOT AT THE COL THE BIG COLLEGE PARK CAMPUS YOU KNOW THAT S THE BIG ONE WITH THE FOOTBALL TEAM .
YEAH .
SO I I THINK UM I THINK YOU RE RIGHT THAT THERE S A LOT OF THERE .
S DIFFICULT DECISIONS THERE BASED ON NAME RECOGNITION .
UM YOU KNOW WHEN I FIRST WAS APPLYING FOR GRADUATE SCHOOLS I APPLIED TO SOME BIG PROGRAMS YOU KNOW IN THIS AREA LIKE STEVENS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS RECOGNIZED IN THE NORTHEAST AS AS YOU KNOW ONE STEP BELOW M I T IN A SENSE .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW SO IT S GOT BIG NAME RECOGNITION IN THIS AREA A BIG SCIENCE SCHOOL NO FOOTBALL TEAM BUT A BIG SCIENCE SCHOOL .
YEAH .
AND TECHNICAL PEOPLE KNOW THAT .
BUT I DON YEAH I THINK YOU RE RIGHT YOU REALLY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT FOR THE JOB .
I WENT TO A VERY SMALL STATE COLLEGE WHEN I GOT MY BACHELOR S AND WHEN I NOW I WAS IN EDUCATION AT FIRST WHEN I WAS LOOKING FOR JOBS I WAS GOING TO BE A TEACHER I WAS JUST A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER SO MOST PEOPLE RECOGNIZED THAT INSTITUTION BECAUSE IT WAS A TEACHING SCHOOL SORT OF .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW BUT THEN WHEN I WENT UM FOR GRADUATE WORK YOU KNOW OR FOR A NEW JOB PEOPLE SAID TO ME YOU KNOW SHIPPENSBURG STATE WHERE IS THAT YOU KNOW .
YEAH YEAH .
AND YOU KNOW WHEN I WENT INTO HIGHER EDUCATION EVEN AT OTHER UNIVERSITIES THEY WERE NT AWARE OF IT YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
SO I THINK YEAH THAT S IMPORTANT UM .
I THINK IT DEPENDS ON IF YOU WANT TO BE A IF YOU WANT A REGIONAL JOB OR A NATIONAL JOB YOU NEED THAT FIRST .
YEAH .
JOB OR SO OUT OF SCHOOL TOO .
YEAH .
I I GUESS ANOTHER THING .
THAT CONCERNS ME IS UH SO MANY PEOPLE IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY .
TODAY IS STILL IN THAT MUMBLEX JOB MARKET AND UH UM WHERE WAS I AT .
OH GO IN GOING TO SCHOOL YOU GET TAUGHT THE THINGS YOU LEARN IN SCHOOL BUT THERE IS ALSO A WHOLE OTHER DIMENSION I MEAN THE GROWING UP WHILE YOU RE GOING TO SCHOOL PART .
UHHUH YEAH .
AND UH ACTUALLY IN THE MIDWEST ESPECIALLY A LOT OF THE SCHOOLS HAVE LIKE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI WILL HAVE A MAIN CAMPUS LIKE COLUMBIA WHICH IS BIG MULTI DISCIPLINARY .
RIGHT .
AND THEY LL HAVE A SATELLITE CAMPUS IN A USUALLY IN A SMALLER TOWN .
THAT SPECIALIZES IN THE TECHNICAL FIELD .
SO YOU VE REALLY UH I GUESS SACRIFICED .
UHHUH .
SOME SOCIAL .
RIGHT .
EXPOSURE TO DIFFERENT GROUPS AND EVERYTHING .
YEAH DEPENDING ON YOUR TECHNICAL AREAS .
YEAH .
YEAH .
I COULD SEE THAT .
BUT YOU KNOW AT SOME OF THE LARGE SCHOOLS I KNOW THAT AT AT AT UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND WHERE I AM YOU KNOW IN A P H D PROGRAM I I HAVE NT EVEN MET UH SOMEONE OUTSIDE OF MY AREA OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS EXCEPT FOR .

IT MAY BE IMPROVED BY NOW BUT .
THAT S WHAT .
I VE HEARD .
YEAH IT S UH WORDSTAR WAS NEVER VERY INTUITIVE TO ME .
I MEAN YOU KNOW YOU SOME OF THE COMMANDS JUST HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU KNOW WHAT .
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING WHAT .
THEY WHAT .
THEY DID ON THE COM COMPUTER BUT UH .
UHHUH .
I MEAN LIKE GOING UM FORWARD AND BACKWARD A WORD OR UP AND DOWN A LINE .
THAT SORT OF THING JUST YOU KNOW DID NT MATCH WITH THE KINDS OF KEYS .
YEAH YOU HAD TO .
YOU WERE USING .
MEMORIZE IT .
YEAH .
AND .
AND BUT WORDPERFECT IS JUST A LOT MORE INTUITIVE IN A LOT OF WAYS .
AND YOU AND IT DOES A LOT OF THINGS TOO THAT IF YOU IF YOU DO ANY KIND OF UH RESEARCH OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT WHERE YOU HAVE TO UH USE FOOTNOTES IT IS JUST WONDERFUL .
OH .
BECAUSE IT KEEPS TRACK OF ALL YOUR FOOTNOTES .
OH THAT S NEAT .
YEAH AND IF YOU ADD IT IF YOU PUT A FOOTNOTE IN IN THE MIDDLE YOU KNOW IF YOU COME UP WITH SOME NEW PIECE OF DOCUMENTATION AND YOU PUT THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR PAPER AND HAVE TO FOOTNOTE IT YOU JUST CHANGE UM IT JUST AUTOMATICALLY CHANGES ALL YOUR FOOTNOTING NUMBERS FOR YOU .
OH HOW WONDERFUL .
SO YOU KNOW IT S JUST .
THAT I HAD HEARD THAT THAT WAS BETTER .
YEAH .
THAT WAS A BETTER ONE .
YEAH .
AND I THINK ABOUT HOW IT USED TO BE IF YOU WERE DOING A PAPER AND YOU HAD TO GO BACK AND RETYPE .
EVERYTHING AND OH IT WAS JUST AWFUL .

ALTHOUGH I THINK WE VE PROBABLY BEEN TALKING AT LEAST TEN MINUTES SO UM IF YOU UM UNLESS YOU HAVE SOME OTHER THINGS YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT AS HAVING TO DO WITH P C S .

RIGHT .
SO WE LL SLOWLY LEARN JUST TO TYPE HERE AND THEN .
THAT S GREAT .
THEN PUT THE STORY IN .
WELL THAT S A THAT S A SKILL THAT SHE CAN USE FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE SO .
YES YES .

AND HAD ENDED UP HE HAD SOME ACCOMPLICES THAT WERE KIND OF SUSPECT AND THEY UH THEY BROKE IN ONE ONE NIGHT AND FOUND A BUNCH OF MEMOS THAT WERE UH SUPPOSEDLY FROM FROM HUGHES TO UH TO HIS MAIN UH MAIN A ASSISTANT BACK UH IN THE FIFTIES AND SI WELL I GUESS IN THE SIXTIES .
WELL THAT IS INTERESTING .
UP UNTIL HIS DEATH .
RIGHT .
SO IT S PRETTY INTERESTING WORK SO .
THAT IS AN INTRIGUING TYPE OF BOOK TO BE READING AND TRYING TO KEEP UP ON THINGS LIKE THAT .
YEAH IT S A IT S A LITTLE IT S A LITTLE HARD MUMBLEX YOU HAVE TO PLOD THROUGH IT AND YOU KNOW IT DOES NOT HAVE A REAL STORY OR ANY PLOT .
UHHUH .
YOU JUST KIND OF HAVE TO READ AND UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON .
AND THEY HAVE NOT MADE A MOVIE OF THE WEEK OF IT YET .
NO I HAVE NOT SEEN IT .
BUT IT S BUT IT IS IT IS REAL INTERESTING .
YEAH .
UH I ALSO READING UH THE UH THI IT S A AN OLD ANOTHER OLD BOOK THAT I HAPPEN TO HAVE I AM SORT OF REREADING IT IT S UH A BOOK ABOUT UH THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE BUT IT S UH IT S ABOUT IT S A REAL GOOD BOOK THAT A GUY UH WROTE WHO WAS UH A RESEARCH LIBRARIAN HE WROTE UH SORT OF DEBUNKING MANY OF THE UH UH MUMBLEX THE STORIES ABOUT THE UH BERMUDA TRIANGLE YOU KNOW HE HE WAS THINKING MANY .
UH .
MANY OF THE THE MYTHS MANY OF THE MYTHS OF THE TRIANGLE WERE UH ACTUALLY COULD BE EXPLAINED .
EXPLAINED MUMBLEX .
AND YOU KNOW UH AND THE REA REASON I WAS MUMBLEX PICKED IT BACK UP WAS IN LIGHT OF ALL THE UH MUMBLEX WELL WHEN THEY FOUND THE UH THE AIRPLANES ON THE IN THE ATLANTIC THINKING THEY WERE FLIGHT NINETEEN AND I DO NT KNOW IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THAT AT ALL BUT IT S UH FLIGHT NINETEEN WAS ONE OF THE UH WAS A A COLLECTION OF A FLIGHT OF FIVE NAVY ADVENTURES AT THE END OF WORLD WAR TWO RIGHT AFTER WORLD WAR TWO AND THEY WERE THEY WERE LOST AND UH .
SUPPOSEDLY SCOOPED UP BY THE TRIANGLE .
YEAH THEY WERE .
YEAH .
AND SO AND IN THE BOOK YOU KNOW EVEN HE WROTE THIS BOOK BACK IN THE SEVENTIES AND EVEN AND EVEN THEN HE HE HAD A VERY GOOD CASE FOR THE FACT THEY PROBABLY JUST GOT LOST AND THEY DITCHED IN THE WATER AND UH BECAUSE HE HE MENTIONS HE HE GOES THROUGH AND BRINGS OUT POINTS FROM THE NAVY S FINDINGS AND SO FORTH AND UH IT S PROBABLY YOU KNOW REAL CLOSE TO WHAT YOU KNOW EVERYONE IS THINKING NOW THAT THEY JUST GOT TURNED AROUND AND COULD NOT FIND THEIR WAY BACK .
YEAH ON THAT SAME TOPIC HAVE YOU EVER READ ANYTHING ABOUT YOU KNOW THE AMELIA EARHART STORY WHATEVER HAPPENED WITH HER .
UH NO I HAVE NOT .
I I THINK THAT WOULD BE I AM SURE THERE IS SOMETHING OUT THERE UH MUMBLEX .
YEAH I WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO TOO BECAUSE IT S A LOT OF THINGS COMING UP HERE LATELY ABOUT HER YOU KNOW POSSIBILITIES OF HE OF WHERE SHE MUMBLEX .
I THOUGHT SHE WAS A PRISONER OF WAR OR SOMETHING FOR LIKE TEN YEARS .
UH .
WELL WHATEVER THIS IS ONE ASPECT OF IT .
YEAH .
OF COURSE YOU KNOW IT IS SO WEIRD CAUSE NO ONE WILL EVER REALLY KNOW IT S IT THA SO BUT IT S ENTERTAINING AND IT MAKES YOU THINK ABOUT THINGS .
RIGHT .
THAT IS FOR SURE .
YEAH SO THAT IS PRETTY MUCH FOR RIGHT NOW THAT IS .
YEAH .
WHAT I HAVE BEEN READING I KIND OF LIKE TO READ DIFFERENT STUFF AND UH I LIKE TO READ A NOVEL EVERY NOW AND THEN BUT UH I AM TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM JUST READING NOVELS ALL THE TIME .
RIGHT WELL I I GUESS I JUST HAVE NOT READ ANYTH I MEAN USUALLY I JUST IF I FIND A GOOD BOOK I WILL SIT YOU KNOW FOR TWO DAYS UNTIL IT IS FINISHED IF IT S THAT GOOD .

UH .
FROM HERE AND UH I READ IT AND REALLY LIKED IT AND THEN ABOUT THAT IS WHEN IT REALLY GOT BIG AND UH SO I .
THAT WAS GOOD I THINK .

BONFIRE OF THE VANITY .
BON YEAH .
I HAVE NOT READ THAT ALTHOUGH .
UH .
I HAVE HEARD IT IS PRETTY GOOD .
YEAH I THAT WAS REALLY REALLY GOOD THE MOVIE WAS NOTHING COMPARED TO THE BOOK .
YEAH THAT IS WHAT I HAVE HEARD .
AND YEAH .
I SAW THE MOVIE AND UH .
OH THE MOVIE WAS A JOKE COMPARED TO I MEAN BECAUSE TOM WOLFE IS SO PERCEPTIVE .
YEAH .
WHEN IT COMES TO YOU KNOW PINPOINTING UH SO SO SOCIETY S ILLS AND .
RIGHT .
THINGS LIKE THAT AND JUST NAILING PEOPLE TO THE WALL AND EXPOSING THINGS AND .
RIGHT .
AND SO IT WAS IT WAS A MUCH MORE INTENSE BOOK THAN THE SORT OF FLIMFLAM THAT THEY CAST OFF IN THE MOVIE .
I KNOW .
AND ANYWAY WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT BUT UH GEE I JUST I LIKE TO READ GARDENING BOOKS AND THINGS LIKE THAT JUST TO TELL ME WHAT TO DO WITH MY GARDEN AND UH .
YEAH .
AND UH .
I HAVE A LOT OF UH UH COMPUTER BOOKS THAT I AM I DO COMPUTER WORK AND SO I HAVE A LOT OF THOSE SO I SPEND A LOT OF TIME LOOKING THROUGH THOSE NOT NECESSARILY READING THEM BUT .
YEAH .
LOOKING THROUGH THEM BUT I I M INTERESTED IN A LOT OF THAT BUT UH I HAVE GOT A LOT OF BOOKS THAT I I INTEND TO READ BUT I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO YET YOU KNOW FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER .
LIKE WHAT IS A BOOK ON YOUR LIST YOU KNOW I HAVE A LIST TOO AND I HAVE NEVER GOTTEN TO IT .
OH GOSH I DO NOT I DO NOT REALLY HAVE A LIST CAUSE I JUST KIND OF UH I JUST HAVE ALL THE BOOKS OUT YOU KNOW I HAVE BOOK SHELVES AND I HAVE THEM ALL OUT AND USUALLY WHEN I AM THROUGH WITH ONE I WILL GO IN AND UH UH UH LOOK LOOK THROUGH UH I HAVE ONE NOW AND I I CAN NOT REMEMBER THE NAME OF IT THAT I THAT I GOT IS THE SISTERINLAW IN CHICAGO USUALLY SENDS ME FOR MY BIRTHDAY OR OR CHRISTMAS OR SOMETHING WILL SEND ME ANOTHER ANOTHER GOOD BOOK AND UH .
OH .
UH SH I HAVE ONE AND I CAN NOT REMEMBER THE NAME OF IT UH IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE A MYSTERY .
WELL .
DO YOU HAVE UH SOME STRONG FEELINGS ONE WAY OR THE OTHER ABOUT ABOUT THE CARE OF THE ELDERLY .
WELL YES I DO UH THIS IS A A QUESTION THAT HIT PRETTY CLOSE TO HOME I HAD TO GO THROUGH THIS WITH MY DAD ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO HE WAS HIS HEALTH WAS FAILING .
UHHUH .
AND UH HE WAS ADAMANT ABOUT TWO THINGS ONE WAS THAT I TAKE CARE OF MY MOTHER AND TWO THAT HE NOT BE PUT INTO A HOME .
UHHUH .
AND WE TALKED UH ABOUT SOME LENGTH AND I RESPECTED HIS WISHES HE UH STAYED AT HOME AS LONG AS HE COULD AND THEN UH HE DIED IN A HOSPITAL BUT UM I THINK THAT MY POSITION WA IS THAT UH YOU NEED TO FIND ONE THAT YOU CAN REALLY HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THEY ARE TAKING CARE OF THE OF THE UH OF THEIR CLIENTS .
YES .
AND UM BECAUSE I VE HEARD ABOUT THE MANY ABUSES AND BECAUSE HE HAD HEARD OF SO MANY ABUSES HE JUST DID NT WANT THAT .
YEAH YEAH .
HOW ABOUT YOU .
WELL MY GRADUATE WORK IS IN SPEECH PATHOLOGY AND UH SO SO UH I VE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS MORE THAN ONCE UH YOU KNOW DEALING WITH UH YOU KNOW I M CONCERNED WE RE GOING TO HAVE A GERIATRIC UH POPULATION IN IN TWENTY YEARS IT S GOING TO BE YOU KNOW PHENOMENAL .
YEAH ALMOST THIRTY ALL OVER THIRTY PERCENT IS NT IT .
YEAH YEAH UH AND UM BUT I HAVE BEEN AMAZED AND AND IN TALKING WITH UH SOME OF MY FELLOW STUDENTS IT LOOKS AS THOUGH UM NURSING HOMES ARE NOT GOING TO BE THE ONLY OPTION ANY MORE AND UH IN TWENTY YEARS UH WHERE A LOT OF STUDENTS ARE HOPING UH TO WORK AS AN IN THE HOME TYPE UH UH APPROACH WHERE WHERE THE UH WHERE THERE S YOU KNOW THE SPEECH THERAPIST OR WHETHER IT S A NURSING SPECIALIST OR SOMEONE PLANS TO UH WORK OUT OF A FAMILY S HOME AND TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY AWAY FROM THE FAMILY BUT YET ALLOW THE THE LOVED ONE TO STAY YOU KNOW AT HOME .
UHHUH .
WITH THE FAMILY MEMBERS UH IT S IT S DIFFICULT FOR MANY FAMILIES ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF UH OF ALZHEIMER S AND AND UH SOME OF THE MORE DEGENERATIVE DISEASES TO UH SAY UH UH LEAVE THEM TO HAVE THEM AT HOME BECAUSE THEN THE FAMILY BECOMES COMPLETELY UH .
THEY RE CAPTIVE .
EXACTLY YEAH AND AND DID DID YOU EXPERIENCE THAT WITH YOUR WITH YOUR FATHER OR NOT .
UH WE HAD A AT ONE STAGE WE HAD CARE SOMEWHAT LIKE LIKE WHAT YOU RE TALKING ABOUT WE HAD THE VISITING NURSES PROGRAM .
UHHUH .
AND THEY SENT SOMEBODY IN AND IT IT WAS A A NOMINAL CHARGE THAT THIS UH IT STARTED OUT THAT THE LADY WOULD COME IN I THINK THREE TIMES A WEEK AND EVENTUALLY GOT UP TO THE POINT WHERE THEY WERE COMING BY EVERY DAY .
YEAH .
THEY WOULD TRY TO GET HIM TO EXERCISE THEY WOULD TRY TO UH YOU KNOW THEY WOULD CHECK HIM OVER TO TO YOU KNOW THE BASIC CHECKS TRY TO GET HIM TO TALK AND BE MOTIVATED .
UHHUH .
AND UH THAT S WHAT WE WENT THROUGH UH UP TO A POINT THINGS SEEMED TO BE WORKING AND THEN UH I THINK HE HE BECAME DISCOURAGED .
RIGHT .
AND THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW TO TAKE CARE OF THAT AND THEN UM AT THAT POINT I THINK IT S MOSTLY A PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEM .
OH .
AND UH BUT YES I AGREE THERE S A LOT OF OPTIONS THERE COULD BE A LOT OF OPTIONS .
UHHUH .
I THINK IT S TIME THAT UH WE DECIDE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT .
YEAH .
UM .
DEFINITELY YOU KNOW ONE OF THE OTHER SUBJECTS ON THE SWITCHBOARD AND THIS IS ONE THAT I VE BEEN THINKING APPLIES HERE UH WHERE WHERE UH YOUNG YOUNG KIDS UH GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL WHETHER THEY SHOULD DO A COMMUNITY SERVICE TYPE WORK THIS WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF SOME WHERE UH SOME PLACE WHERE UM THE COMMUNITY COULD BE MORE INVOLVED YOU KNOW MORE THAN JUST LEAVING IT ONLY TO PROFESSIONALS THERE IS A LOT THE COMMUNITY THE COMMUNITY CAN DO TO UH ENHANCE THE OR OR ASSIST THE LIVES OF THOSE WHO ARE KEEPING A LOVED ONE AT HOME .
I SUPPOSE AT ONE TIME THE CHURCH WOULD FULFILL THIS NEED .
POSSIBLY BEFORE I DO NT KNOW NOW .
YEAH THE CHURCH OR SYNAGOGUE WHATEVER .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE TYPICALLY THESE WERE CLOSE KNIT GROUPS AT ONE TIME BUT IN TODAY S LARGE METROPOLITAN AREAS OR EVEN IN MOST EVEN EVEN THE RURAL AREAS NOW PEOPLE ARE NOT QUITE AS CLOSE AS THEY ONCE WERE .
HUHUH .
UH THE MOBILITY FACTOR THE FACTOR THAT UH OH WE RE LIVING LONGER AND PEOPLE ARE LESS TRUSTING ALL THESE THINGS TEND TO DESTROY THIS TYPE OF SYSTEM BUT I AGREE WITH YOU THERE MIGHT BE SOME POSSIBILITIES THERE .
UHHUH .
ALTHOUGH DEALING WITH GERIATRICS IS SOMETHING A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE JUST ARE NT EMOTIONALLY PREPARED TO DO .
I AGREE THAT S A THAT S A GOOD POINT .
I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE SOME TRAINING .
OKAY JERRY .
OK .
I GUESS UH TONIGHT S TOPIC IS ABOUT UH PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND LEVEL OF INTEREST AND UH AND YOUR YOUR EXPERTISE .
OOPS .
OH WELL .
OH WELL .
WELL OKAY WELL LET S LET S FIRE AWAY UH WELL BRIAN .

THAT KIND OF RUNS I GUESS YOU WOULD SAY THE NEIGHBORHOOD ROAD IT RUNS BETWEEN THE HIGH SCHOOL AND THE THE COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS AND UH I M OVER THE NORTHEAST PART OF DALLAS .
IT S A IN A NICE NEIGHBORHOOD .
THE HOUSES HERE UH BEFORE THE RECESSION WERE RUNNING TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OR SO AND COURSE EVERYTHING S DOWN TEN TO TWENTY PERCENT NOW .
YEAH SEE THAT S THE SAME THING HERE .
BUT WE HAVE UH ONE ONE THING .
THAT EFFECTS US IS WE HAVE APARTMENTS .
THAT ARE PROBABLY ABOUT A HALF MILE AWAY AND NOW THE ECONOMY IS BAD THEY HAVE TROUBLE KEEPING THOSE FULL SO THEY VE DROPPED THE UH THEY RE NOT NEARLY AS SELECTIVE AS THEY USED TO BE .
YEAH .
AND COURSE THAT S KIND OF LIKE A CANCER IN AN APARTMENT COMPLEX .
YOU START LETTING THAT HAPPEN AND THEY GO DOWN AND THEN BEFORE YOU KNOW IT .
YOU HAVE DRUGS AND A LOT OF OTHER THINGS SO UH I M SURE THAT AGGRAVATES IT ALSO .
YEAH .
BUT UNEMPLOYMENT NOW IN DALLAS OR IN TEXAS IS UP AROUND SIX POINT .
WELL I DO NT KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE FEDERAL BUDGET .
UM THERE CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN IDEAS SURFACED UH RECENTLY UH MATTER OF FACT REPEATEDLY BY MANY PEOPLE AND I SORT OF WONDERED WHAT .
YOUR WHAT THOUGHTS YOU HAD ON THAT AREA .
THE THE FIRST ONE IS WE NEED PEOPLE IN THERE .
THAT THAT UNDERSTAND UH NUMBERS .
THE NUMBERS .
THAT ARE BEING THROWN AROUND WHEN WHEN WE RE TALKING IN TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS .
UHHUH .
UH WHICH IS AN ASTRONOMICAL SUM AND AND THE PEOPLE .
THAT ARE TALKING THIS NUMBERS HAVE NO CONCEPT OF WHAT .
THAT NUMBER MEANS .
NOW ARE YOU ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE ELECTED PEOPLE OR ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT OTHERS .
THE ELECTED PEOPLE .
YES .
UHHUH .
UHHUH .
OUR OUR OUR SENATE AND CONGRESS AND AND PEOPLE .
THAT THAT DEAL EVERYDAY AND AND WHAT S GOING TO BE DONE WITH THOSE MONIES .
YES .
UM AND DO NT REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT .
THAT IS OR HOW A BUDGET EVEN WORKS .
UHHUH .
UH WE NEED TO ELECT PEOPLE .
THAT ARE MORE UH OR .
I M NOT SURE HOW YOU WOULD ACH HOW WOULD YOU ACHIEVE THAT .
I MEAN IF .
WELL LET S LET S MAKE THEM HAVE A DEGREE IN ECONOMY UH OR ECONOMICS .
SO YOU WOULD TRUST THE DECISION MAKING DEC ECONOMISTS .
WELL .
SOMETIMES CALLED THE DISMAL SCIENCE .
YEAH .
BUT BUT PEOPLE .
THAT THAT KNOW THE VALUE OF A DOLLAR .
THAT UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF A DOLLAR .
UHHUH .
YES .
UM AND WH IN IN IN THE THE UH LOBBYISTS .
UHHUH .
NEEDS THEM TO BE ELIMINATED UH .
UHHUH .
FROM CONGRESS .
UM .
YES .
THEY DO NT MAKE PRAGMATIC DECISIONS .
THEY MAKE A DECISION BASED ON CONSTI CONSTITUENCY .
YES .
INSTEAD OF A DECISION BASED ON WHAT .
THEY REALLY BELIEVE .
UHHUH .
UM YOU KNOW TH OR THEY TACK ON THIS UH PORK BELLIES AND AND DO THINGS .
THAT THAT ARE GOOD FOR THEIR AREA TO PASS SOMETHING .
THAT IS THAT IS NOT GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY .
RIGHT .
SO SO YOU WOULD FAVOR A LAW .
WHICH SAID THERE COULD NOT BE LOBBYISTS .
I MEAN RIGHT NOW LOBBYISTS REQUIRE TO REGISTER YOU D JUST SAY .
OH I I DEFINITELY WOULD .
YEAH .
GET RID OF THEM .
MA MAKE THEM .
ALL .
TOTALLY .
UH .
NO CAUSES THAT YOU THINK THE LOBBYISTS WOULD BE GOOD FOR .
I I THINK THAT ANY COMPANY OR ANYTHING .
THAT WANTS TO CONTRIBUTE TO A FUND .
UHHUH .
SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND BE REGISTERED WITH WHAT .
THEY EVER CONTRIBUTE .
BUT THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE A ONEONONE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PEOPLE MAKING THE DECISIONS .
THAT AFFECT THEM .
UHHUH .
THAT THAT S A CONFLICT OF INTEREST AS FAR AS I M CONCERNED .
YEAH .
WHEN YOU ARE TALKING AGAIN UH BILLIONS AND TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS .
UHHUH .
UH YOU RE YOU RE JEOPARDIZING THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY UH FOR TODAY .
THAT .
SO UH YOU TALK ABOUT JEOPARDIZING THE FUTURE .
WOULD YOU BE AGAINST ANY DEFICIT SPENDING .
I I THINK TO BRING IT IN LINE .
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A GENERATION .
THAT S GOING TO REALLY BITE THE BULLET TO BRING IT IN LINE .
YOU CA NT EASE INTO IT .
IT TOOK YEARS AND YEARS TO BUILD UP THE MOMENTUM .
THAT S THERE NOW .
UHHUH .
UH I I FORGET THE FIGURES ON THE INTEREST RATE BUT IT S SOMETHING LIKE UH HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS .
A SECOND .
UHHUH .
IN INTEREST .
YEAH .
PART OF THE PROBLEM IS WE DO NT LOAN FROM OURSELVES .
WE WE BUY FROM INTIMATE INTERNATIONAL BANKING .
THAT S WHY WE HAVE INTEREST .
UHHUH .
AND AND I I I REALLY FEEL THAT THAT THAT IS PART OF THE PROBLEM THAT WE WE VE LET THINGS GET SO OUT OF CONTROL THAT THAT WE DO NT WANT TO PUT THE BRAKES ON THEM .
BUT WHA WHAT .
PRACTICAL STEPS COULD ON COULD ONE TAKE .
UM .
BY BY HAVING A A A BUDGET .
THAT IS IS FEASIBLE THAT IS REASONABLE .
WELL BUT EVERYBODY WILL SAY THAT HE IS FOR THAT .
UH AND .
OH OF COURSE .
SURE .
AND HOW WILL YOU .
AND THEN ADD ON TO IT .
MAKE THAT ACTUALLY HAPPEN .
YOU TAKE THE GROSS NATIONAL INCOME .
UHHUH .
AND YOU SAY OUR BUDGET IS X NUMBER OF PERCENT OF THIS GROSS NATIONAL INCOME .
ONE THING .
WE COULD DO IS GIVE A TEN PERCENT INCOME TAX .
UHHUH .
ACROSSTHEBOARD EVERYONE NO MATTER .
WHAT .
YEP .
PAYS A TEN PERCENT INCOME TAX .
SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA .
UH .
NOTHING ESCAPES RIGHT .
NO NO .
THAT S RIGHT .
DEDUCTIONS NOTHING .
RIGHT .
NO DEDUCTIONS .
JUST TEN PERCENT .
YOU PAY A TEN PERCENT INCOME TAX .
YEP .
THAT S WHAT .
YOU PAY IF YOU MAKE FORTY MILLION DOLLARS UH THEN YOU RE GOING TO PAY FOUR MILLION .
RIGHT .
I IF YOU MAKE FORTY DOLLARS YOU RE GOING TO PAY FOUR DOLLARS .
AND AND THAT S IT .
YEP .
SO THAT THAT S IT .
THAT S I MEAN I I AGREE WITH THAT THAT S A GOOD IDEA AND IS IT YOUR EXPECTATION THAT THAT WOULD RAISE THE TOTAL REVENUES COLLECTED OR OR LOWER THEM OR WHAT .
I DO NT KNOW THAT IT WOULD OR WOULD NT .
UH WELL LET S SEE .
HOW MANY YOU SAID YOURS ARE ALL I MEAN THAT SOUNDS LIKE AN ARMY .
FIVE .
OH LORD .
THAT IS AN ARMY I CAME FROM A FAMILY OF SIX .
AND I HAVE ONLY GOT TWO AND THEY ARE ONE .
WELL MUMBLEX ANY NUMBER IS NICE LET ME TELL YOU .
WELL I KIND OF DECIDED THAT SINGLE SINGLE CHILDREN THAT THAT THAT S NOT PARENTING THAT S A HOBBY .

BUT .
IT S NOT AS FAIR TO THE CHILDREN EITHER I DO NOT THINK .

THEY ARE INTO QUALITY TIME .

YEAH BUT SOMETIMES YOU CAN HURT THEM BY HAVING TOO MUCH QUALITY TIME TOO .
WELL I I I CAN SPOT A KID WHO REALLY YOU KNOW WHOSE PARENTS SPEND EVERY .

QUALITY TIME WITH THEM YOU KNOW OUTSIDE OF THE WORK DAY .
UHHUH .
AND WHEN I TAKE CARE OF SOME PEOPLE S KIDS .

UHHUH .
AND THAT KIND OF STUFF I WILL TAKE MY FRIENDS KIDS .
UHHUH .

UHHUH .
AND YOU CAN SPOT THEM .

BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO HANG OUT AND MESS AROUND .
HOW TO JUST ENTERTAIN THEMSELVES .
YEAH .
YEAH YEAH .
REALLY .
IT S A PROBLEM FOR ANY CHILD AND YOU TAKE ONE THAT S USED TO BEING UH BUSY BEING HAVING SOMETHING TO DO ALL THE TIME IT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE .
IT S NOT A PROBLEM FOR MY TWO THEY ARE ONLY EIGHTEEN MONTHS APART .
UH KEEPS YOU BUSY .
THEY CAN FIND THINGS TO DO AND MESS AROUND .
YEAH .
AND PLOT AND SCHEME AND EVERYTHING ELSE .
WELL THAT S GREAT .
YOU DID ALL FIVE OF YOURS COMPLETE COLLEGE .
NO OUR LAST DAUGHTER SHE DID NOT WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL SHE S UH BUT SHE S MARRIED NOW THEY BUILT A HOME JUST A COUPLE MILES FROM US AND .
WELL HOW DID YOU GO ABOUT SELECTING A COLLEGE THEN .
WELL WE DID NOT DO IT RIGHT ALL THE TIME WITH OUR FIRST BOY WE PERSUADED HIM TO START HERE AND I DO NOT ALWAYS THINK YOU SHOULD TRY TO MAKE THEM STAY CLOSER TO HOME I THINK THE MAIN THING IS TO UH RIGHT NOW I THINK THE MAIN THING IS TO LOOK AT WHAT THEY ARE INTERESTED IN UH AND TAKE WHAT THEY ARE INTERESTED IN AND THEN THEN START LOOKING FOR SCHOOLS .
DO YOU THINK THAT WHAT THEY SAY THAT THEY ARE INTERESTED IN IS AT EIGHTEEN IS GOING TO BE WHAT THEY ARE ULTIMATELY .
NO NOT NECESSARILY .
ULTIMATELY GRADUATING AT .
BUT MIKE OUR OLDEST BOY I THINK HE WOULD HAVE HE WANTED TO GO TO EMBREY REY RIDDLE AND WE TALKED HIM INTO GOING LOCAL HERE FIRST .
UHHUH .
AND HE ONLY WENT A FEW MONTHS AND THEN TRANSFERRED TO PITTSBURGH HE WENT TO AERONAUTICAL UH OH JUST LEARNING TO WORK ON ENGINES AND THAT .
UHHUH .
UH IT HAS TO DO WITH AIRPLANES AND EVERYTHING WHICH IS WHAT HIS WHOLE LIFE IS AND I REALLY WISH WE WOULD HAVE LET HIM GO WHERE HE WANTED TO GO ORIGINALLY .
AND HE WOULD PROBABLY BE FLYING IS WHAT HE WOULD BE DOING UH BUT BUT RIGHT NOW OF COURSE HE S HE S WORKING FOR PRATT AND WHITNEY IN CONNECTICUT AND THEY BUILD AND REBUILD NON JET ENGINES .
HOW ABOUT THE OTHER FOUR OTHER THREE WHO WENT .
UH THE OTHER ONES UH THE SECOND ONE SHE CHOSE WE LET HER GO WHERE SHE WANTED TO UH WE DID NOT WANT HER TO GO BUT SHE WENT TO ERIE TO GANNAN UNIVERSITY UH OR GANNAN COLLEGE I AM NOT SURE WHICH IT IS COLLEGE I GUESS UH SHE WENT THERE TWO YEARS AND IT WAS MORE EXPENSIVE AND SHE SOON REALIZED YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH SHE DID NOT LIKE CLARION SHE CAME BACK AND FINISHED AT CLARION BECAUSE IT UH SAVED HER QUITE A BIT OF MONEY AND SHE GOT REALLY THE SAME BASIC EDUCATION THAT SHE WANTED .
UHHUH .
AND OUR OTHER TWO BOYS THEY WENT TO CLARION ALSO AND UH DID VERY WELL THERE AND THEY HAVE ALL REALLY GOT UH THEY HAVE ALL REALLY GOT REALLY GOOD JOBS AND UH .
WHEN THEY WERE LIKE IN JUNIOR HIGH AND HIGH SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
I MEAN HAD THEY DID THEY HAVE AN IDEA THAT THEY WERE DEFINITELY GOING TO GO TO COLLEGE AND .
UH YEAH THEY KIND OF HAD THAT THEY JUST EXPECTED TO GO DAPHNE NEVER WENT SHE ALWAYS SAID SHE WOULD NEVER GO TO COLLEGE SHE SAID I I ALWAYS THOUGHT SHE WOULD CHANGE HER MIND .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW BUT SHE DID NOT AND THERE S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT YOU KNOW IF COLLEGE IS NOT FOR EVERYBODY .
UH .
BUT UH IT IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR PA WAGE INCOME I THINK IT S WHAT THEY WANT OUT OF LIFE BECAUSE IF THEY GET AN EDUCATION AND ARE WILLING TO GO WHERE THE JOBS ARE THEY CAN MAKE A YOU KNOW A MUCH BETTER INCOME .
UHHUH .
LIKE MY KIDS THEY ARE ALL MAKING MORE THAN MY HUSBAND WAS MAKING WHEN HE RETIRED FROM THE STATE .
YOU KNOW THAT BOGGLES .
YEAH I WAS .
MY MIND .
I WAS MAKING MORE THAN I WAS MAKING THREE TIMES WHAT MY FATHER WAS MAKING .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AS AN EXECUTIVE IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY WHEN HE RETIRED .
OKAY DID YOU GO TO COLLEGE .
YEAH .
YOU DID SEE IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE .
I WENT UH FOUR YEARS TO UNDERGRAD AT UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA AT LINCOLN .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE LINCOLN IS WHERE WHERE MY PARENTS LIVE .
UHHUH .
AND THERE REALLY THERE REALLY WAS NOT A CHOICE .
UHHUH .
I MEAN THE FINANCES UH DICTATED THAT YOU HAD TO GO THERE .
UH UHHUH .
I KIND OF I AM NOT GOING TO SAY I RESENT IT .
UHHUH .
BUT I WAS WELL YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
ONE OF THE NATIONAL MERIT SCHOLARSHIP QUALIFYING AND .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW ONE OF THE RHODES SCHOLARS KIDS .
UHHUH .
AND THE WHOLE BIT UH MY PARENTS DID NOT EVEN DISCUSS WITH ME GOING TO COLLEGE OUT OF STATE .
SOME PLACE ELSE .
OR ANYPLACE ELSE AND I JUST KNEW THAT THE FINANCES YOU KNOW WOULD NOT SUPPORT IT .
UHHUH .
IF I HAD KNOWN HOW NOT I AM NOT GOING TO SAY EASY BUT HOW MUCH LESS DIFFICULT THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE TO GET A UH SCHOLARSHIP .
UHHUH .
TO GO ANYPLACE ELSE I THINK THAT I WOULD DEFINITELY YOU KNOW HAVE GONE NOW WHEN I FINISHED THERE THEN I GOT A SCHOLARSHIP TO GO THE HARVARD UNIVERSITY IN BOSTON .
UHHUH .
AND THAT WAS UH I THINK THAT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT HAD EVER HAPPENED I MEAN I WAS .
THAT S GREAT .
TAKEN OUT OF MY ELEMENT YOU KNOW THE HOMOGENY MIDWEST .
UHHUH .
WHICH IS A LOVELY PLACE TO GROW UP .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND PUT INTO SOMEPLACE ELSE WHERE .
PEOPLE THOUGHT DIFFERENTLY .
UHHUH .
LOOKED DIFFERENTLY SOUNDED DIFFERENTLY YOU KNOW .
DIFFERENT LIFE STYLES YES YES .
DIFFERENT LIFE STYLE AND I THINK IT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME .
UHHUH .
NOW MY KIDS I KEEP SAYING THAT UH YOU KNOW I WOULD LIKE THEM TO GO TO THE BEST SCHOOL THAT THEY POSSIBLY COULD .
UHHUH .
AND I DO NOT KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT THE REALITIES YOU KNOW IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE YOU KNOW WE ARE PUTTING MONEY AWAY ALREADY .
UHHUH .
UH BUT I REALLY THINK IT S IMPORTANT TO PUT THESE CHILDREN SOMEPLACE WHERE IN ADDITION TO YOU KNOW THEM GETTING AN EDUCATION THEY REALLY NEED A YOU KNOW A SOCIALIZATION AWAY FROM WHAT THEY ARE RAISED IN .
UHHUH .
ESPECIALLY IF YOU LIVED A PRETTY INSULAR COMMUNITY AND .
RIGHT .
AN UPPER CLASS SUBURB OF DALLAS LET ME TELL YOU .
IT S QUITE A BIT DIFFERENT .
IT S VERY DIFFERENT .
SEE THAT S THE WAY WE ARE WE ARE MORE OF A RURAL TYPE OF AN AREA AND IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE I THEY SAY YOU SHOULD NOT LOOK AT THE EXPENSE OF THE COLLEGE WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING .
YOU SHOULD NOT .
YEAH NOT REALLY BECAUSE THEY SAY THAT A LOT OF TIMES YOU GET MORE HELP .
UHHUH .
WITH A MORE EXPENSIVE COLLEGE .
OH YEAH .
AND SO IN THE LONG RUN IF IT S REALLY WHAT THEY WANT YOU KNOW THEY ARE BETTER OFF NOW OUR CHILDREN ALL PRETTY MUCH BORROWED FOR THEIR SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
UH WE WE DID ALL WE COULD BUT THEY PRETTY MUCH HAD TO BORROW A LOT OF THEIR MONEY TO GO .
OKAY WELL WHAT DO YOU DO ON YOUR YARD .
WELL UH TYPICAL LAWN STUFF .
SAINT AUGUSTINE UH .
UHHUH .
WITH A LITTLE BERMUDA MIXED IN IN SOME OF THE SUNNY AREAS .

SO WE HAD TO GO OUT AND RESOD THE WHOLE THING WITH SQUARES AND WET IT AND PUT IT DOWN AND ROPE IT OFF AND EVERYTHING .
IT TOOK A LOT OF MONEY AND A LOT OF TIME SO THE MOST CAREFUL THING .
WE DO ON OUR YARD .
EVERY AUGUST IS PUT DOWN THAT DIAZINON .

OH YEAH THAT S REAL CLOSE .
YEAH IN FACT I WE WERE THERE FROM UH SEVENTY THREE TO SEVENTY SEVEN AND .
UHHUH .
I WAS I WORKED FOR THE LITTLE THE WEEKLY NEWSPAPER THERE THE .
OH HOW NEAT .
THE PLYMOUTH OH WHAT WAS IT CALLED CRIER AND UH MY HUSBAND IS FROM THE UPPER PENINSULA SO HE WAS BORN AND .
OH OKAY .
RAISED UP THERE .
UHHUH .
THAT IS WHERE MY MOTHERINLAW STILL LIVES SO UH ARE YOU ORIGINALLY FROM MICHIGAN OR .

UHHUH .
BORN IN DETROIT .
I WILL BE DARN .
OKAY UH WELL DO YOU UH KEEP A FAMILY BUDGET OR DO YOU HAVE SOME .
NO I DO NT USE A FAMILY BUDGET MY FATHER WHO IS VERY OLD HAS KEPT ONE HIS ENTIRE LIFE .
UHHUH .
AND I PROBABLY RE REBELLED AGAINST IT .
I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE KEPT ONE HE KEEPS EVERY PENNY THAT COMES IN AND GOES OUT .
OH INTERESTING .
ON A VERY STRICT PERCENTAGE .
YES WELL UH WE SORT OF STARTED DOING IT YEARS AND YEARS AGO AND MY HUSBAND STARTED GRADUATE SCHOOL WHEN WE WERE FIRST MARRIED AND I SORT OF JUST GOT IN THE HABIT I GUESS AND YOU KNOW NEVER HAVE GOTTEN OUT OF IT I CAN NOT REALLY SAY THAT IT S A FORMAL BUDGET IT S MORE JUST A A PRETTY UH A FAIRLY UH ACCURATE UH RECORDING OF WHAT I SPEND .
RIGHT .
AND WHAT I THINK I AM GOING TO HAVE TO SPEND AND UH .
I THINK IT MAKES MUCH MORE SENSE .
YEAH .
AND I HAVE RECENTLY UH GOTTEN OUT OF DEBT AND EVERYTHING AND I WILL PROBABLY KE START KEEPING A LITTLE BETTER .
YEAH .
TRACK OF IT .
YEAH .
I JUST UH SPENT WHATEVER CAME IN AND AND UH DIDN NEVER KNEW WHAT CAME IN AND WHAT WENT OUT .
RIGHT .
BUT UH JUST YOU KNOW LIKE ABOUT LIKE THE GOVERNMENT RUNS .
YEAH .
HUH .
THAT SOUNDS REAL SIMILAR .
SO I THINK IT IS PROBABLY BETTER TO HAVE SOME SORT OF A A AT LEAST A RECORD BUT MY DAD WAS SO PRECISE .
UM .
THAT I MEAN IF IT SAID TO SPEND ELEVEN PERCENT ON SOMETHING THAT S WHAT IT WAS SPENT AND .
OH MY YEAH .
THAT WAS PUT OVER THERE AND I MEAN OF COURSE HE IS FROM THE DEPRESSION AND UH .
YEAH .
SO UH YOU KNOW IT S HIS LIFE .
SURE .
BUT UH I WOULD I THINK IT WOULD BE SMART IF SOMEBODY WOULD KEEP UH SOME SORT OF A PLAN THAT WORKS FOR THEM .
YEAH I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT UM UH WELL I IT MUST HAVE BEEN SORT OF INTERESTING TO US IS TO UH IT S BECAUSE SINCE I HAVE PRETTY MUCH KEPT MY RECORD BOOKS FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS I GUESS I CAN GO BACK AND LOOK AND IT S REAL FUN TO JUST SEE HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED OVER THE YEARS UH .
YEAH IT IS .
FOR INSTANCE .
I M A HISTORIAN AND MY FATHER HAD KEPT THEM I THINK SINCE NINETEEN TWENTYSEVEN AND UH .
MY GOODNESS .
BUT HE BURNED THE ONES FROM TWENTYSEVEN TO FI I COULD NOT BELIEVE HE DID THAT BUT THEN .
OH DEAR .
SO I TOOK THE ONES FROM FIFTYTWO ON TO THE PRESENT .
YES .
BUT TO LOOK TO HAVE LOOKED BACK INTO THE TWENTIES THIRTIES AND FORTIES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FANTASTIC .
OH YES .
TO SEE THAT BUT UH .
WELL AS A MATTER OF FACT UH MY MOTHER WAS GOING THROUGH SOME THINGS NOT LON NOT LONG AGO I GUESS IT HAS BEEN A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO IN AN OLD TRUNK THAT SHE HAD AND SHE CAME UPON A A BUDGET BOOK THAT SHE HAD BACK IN THE THIRTIES UH .
UHHUH .
WHEN THEY IT WAS THE LATE WELL I GUESS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN I WILL TAKE THAT BACK IT MUST HAVE BEEN IN THE FORTIES BECAUSE THEY HAD BEEN MARRIED UH PROBABLY FIFTEEN YEARS AT THE TIME AND IT WAS JUST UH FASCINATING TO SEE HOW LITTLE THINGS COST I MEAN IT WAS .
OH .
IT WAS JUST ALMOST LAUGHABLE IN SOME INSTANCES THAT YOU KNOW OF COURSE IT S ALL RELATIVE OF COURSE .
I KNOW RIGHT .
BUT UH NEVER THE LESS IT WAS FUN TO SEE THOSE FIGURES NEXT TO YOU KNOW FOR A PR PAIR OF SHOES WAS LIKE FIVE DOLLARS AND .
I KNOW WELL EVEN IN NINETEEN SIXTYTHREE I FOUND A RECORD THAT I HAD UH I TRAVEL IN EUROPE A LOT AND I WHAT I HAD PAID FOR HOTELS .
UM .
AND A SIMILAR HOTEL IN PARIS IS TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A NIGHT NOW .
OH .
AND I PAID UH OH BETWEEN FOUR AND FIVE DOLLARS .
OH IS NT THAT .
IN NINETEEN SIXTY .
SOMETHING .
AND THAT S REALLY CRAZY CAUSE THAT S ABOUT THIRTY YEARS AGO .
REALLY OH THAT IS THAT IS REALLY REALLY SOMETHING .
OH BUT OF COURSE IT S JUST WHAT THE MARKET WILL BEAR .
THAT S TRUE .
IF PEOPLE WILL PAY TWO HUNDRED THEN WHY CHARGE TEN .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW MUMBLEX .
THAT S THAT S RIGHT THAT S EXA THAT S JUST GOOD OLD ECONOMICS WORKING .
RIGHT RIGHT .
WELL UH WE HAVE TRIED TO UH INSTILL SOME SOME SENSE OF UH OF BUDGETING IN OUR KIDS BUT OUR TWO CHILDREN ARE JUST UH AS UM UNLIKE AS NIGHT AND DAY AND .
UHHUH .
OUR SON COULD CARE LESS ABOUT A BUDGET AND OUR DAUGHTER WATCHES HER PENNIES SO CLOSELY .
THAT SHE ALMOST SHE ALMOST JUST SOUNDS LIKE YOUR FATHER I MEAN SHE HAS EVERYTHING PLANNED SO CLOSELY .
UHHUH .
THAT IF .
UHHUH .
SOMETHING GOES WRONG IT JUST THROWS HER FOR A LOOP .
YEAH WELL THEN YOU NEVER KNOW HOW THEY WILL ONE THEY MAY FLIP FLOP WHEN THEY .
YES .
GET TO BE UH OL .
RIGHT YES .
WE OLDER THE OTHER ONE MAY BE VERY CAREFUL .
YES .
AND SHE MAY MARRY SOMEBODY AND OF COURSE IT WOULD BE GOOD BECAUSE IT YOU MARRY SOMEBODY A LITTLE LOOSE THEN SHE WILL HAVE THAT STABILITY OF WATCHING UH .
YEAH .
YOU SHOULD HAVE ONE IN THE IN THE .
I THINK THAT IS TRUE I UH AND .
IN THE HOUSE AND I THINK .
I THINK THAT IS PROBABLY WHAT HAPPENED IN OUR HOUSE BECAUSE I THINK MY HUSBAND WAS NOT QUITE AS UH GOOD AT SAVING AND SO ON BEFORE WE GOT MARRIED AND I WAS I WAS REALLY DILIGENT ABOUT THAT I WAS PUTTING MONEY ASIDE AND WHEN BEFORE I WAS MARRIED YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS WORKING OUT OF COLLEGE AND .
YEAH .
UH THAT REALLY PAID OFF BECAUSE WHEN TIME CAME FOR HIM TO GO BACK TO GRADUATE SCHOOL WE WERE IN IN FAIRLY GOOD SHAPE FINANCIALLY AS FAR AS NOT HAVING ANY MAJOR DEBTS AND .
YEAH THAT S ABOUT THE WAY IT IS HERE .
YEAH .
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR MY WIFE I WOULD HAVE PROBABLY BEEN IN DEBTOR S PRISON .
IF WE HAD ONE .
MUMBLEX .

UHHUH .
IT S VERY TEDIOUS IF YOU DO NT HAVE A WHOLE GROUP YOU RE NOT FINISHING A QUILT IN A LONG TIME .

NOW DID YOU SAY YOU COULD KNIT .
NO .
OH .
UHHUH HAVE NT TRIED THAT EITHER .
WELL I WAS GOING TO SAY BECAUSE .
I WANT TO LEARN TO CROCHET I .
BECAUSE IF YOU COULD KNIT YOU COULD CROCHET .
REALLY .
IT S JUST LIKE DOING ONE HANDED AS LONG AS YOU LEARN HOW TO TO WEAVE THE THE YARN IN BETWEEN YOUR FINGERS ON YOUR LEFT HAND .
UHHUH .
AND THEN YOU JUST USE YOUR RIGHT HAND WITH THE HOOK .
UHHUH .
AND THAT S NOT IT S REALLY NOT TOO DIFFICULT YOU COULD LEARN THAT I M SURE .
YEAH .
AND PICK THAT UP .

IF YOU I THINK IF YOU CAN DO ANY HANDICRAFT YOU CAN LEARN TO CROCHET .
UHHUH .
IT S NOT TOO DIFFICULT .
IT S FUNNY WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT SEWING I LOVE TO DO ANYTHING BY HAND WITH A NEEDLE .
YEAH .
BUT I M TOTALLY INTIMIDATED IF I SIT DOWN AT A SEWING MACHINE I NEVER LEARNED AND I GET REAL NERVOUS WHEREAS USUALLY THE OTHER NEEDLEWORK STUFF IS RELAXING TO ME .
IS NT THAT INTERESTING .
BUT I JUST HAVE A PHOBIA ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO ACTUALLY SEW .
I THINK THAT S REALLY INTERESTING .
UHHUH .
HUH AND YET YOU KNOW I THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW YOU SAID YOU DO A LOT OF NEEDLEWORK AND AND THERE ARE SOME BEAUTIFUL JUST GORGEOUS PATTERNS .
UHHUH .
THAT PEOPLE DO AND I I JUST THINK THAT UH THAT S ONE OF ONE OF THE ARTS THAT I THINK ARE REALLY PRETTY AND A LOT OF PEOPLE DO NT DO THAT EITHER .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND SO .
WELL IT S HARD TO FIND THE TIME I I WOULD NT IF I DID NT HAVE THIS CAR TIME ABILITY PROBABLY .
YEAH .
BECAUSE AT NIGHT IF I SIT DOWN I M DOING SOMETHING WITH THE KIDS OR .
YEAH .
JUST NOT SITTING DOWN AT ALL .
THAT S TRUE YOU KNOW AND AND I ALWAYS THINK WELL I CAN DO THIS AND WATCH T V OR SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND UH IT SEEMS LIKE I ALWAYS GET MY MIND CARRIED AWAY TO SOMETHING ELSE AND THEN IT DOES NT .
WELL IT .
QUITE WORK OR .
I M AT THE AGE WHERE BIFOCALS OR TRIFOCALS WOULD BE NECESSARY IT S SO I FIND MYSELF PUTTING GLASSES ON TO TO WATCH T V AND THEN TAKING THEM OFF TO DO NEEDLEWORK AND I GET FRUSTRATED DOING THAT SO JUST GIVE IT UP .
AND YOU KNOW I LIKE TO SKETCH I CAN I CAN SKETCH SOMETHING LIKE IF I SEE A PICTURE LIKE OUT OF A BOOK I CAN SKETCH THAT .

KIND OF THING I WISH I COULD AND AND YET I CA NT DO YOU KNOW LIKE LIKE UH CRAFT UH ON WOOD .
UHHUH .
I CA NT DO THAT PAINTING THING .
YEAH .
AND YET .
I M THE SAME WAY IF I SEE SOMETHING I CAN COPY IT BUT I CERTAINLY CA NT CREATE I ADMIRE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THAT IN THEIR MINDS ALREADY .
YEAH ME TOO ME TOO I KNOW A WOMAN WHO S JUST WONDERFUL AT THAT .
UHHUH .
AND I LOOK AT IT AND YOU KNOW YOU LOOK AT THOSE THINGS AND YOU WISH SO BADLY THAT YOU COULD DO THEM I GUESS IF YOU WANTED TO YOU COULD TAKE CLASSES AND LEARN I GUESS THAT S THE ONLY WAY I COULD DO IT .
WELL SOMETIMES EVEN WITH THAT I I THINK YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME .
OKAY LOWELL SO I D LIKE TO KNOW UM WHAT WHAT DO YOU DO IN LAWN AND GARDEN WHAT UH WHAT S WHAT S OF INTEREST TO YOU AND HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT IT .
WELL I HAVE A TOWN HOME SO I DO NT DO A LOT OF REGULAR MAINTENANCE BUT I DO HAVE A LARGE GARDEN OUT IN BACK SO WE DO A LOT OF THINGS WITH PERENNIALS AND UH ALSO A FEW ANNUAL PLANTS UH AND THEN EVERY YEAR I GROW A GARDEN .
OH YOU DO YOU DO ACTUALLY UH GROW A GARDEN TO PRODUCE FOOD .
YES .
UHHUH SO HOW MUCH ROOM DO YOU HAVE .
UM WE HAVE VIRTUALLY NO ROOM OUT IN FRONT AND THEN IN THE BACK I D SAY WE HAVE ABOUT AN EIGHTH OF AN ACRE .
UHHUH .
AND WE PRETTY MUCH FILL IT UP WITH UH LIKE I SAID PERENNIALS THINGS THAT ARE NT DO NT HAVE TO FOOL WITH EVERY YEAR BUT THEN I VE GOT UH A TWENTYFIVE BY TWENTY AREA THAT I DO GARDENING AS FAR AS YOU KNOW TOMATOES AND CUCUMBERS AND BEANS AND .
OH THAT S WHAT I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT I WAS WONDERING WHETHER YOU HAD ACTUALLY SOME OF THE FLOWERS THAT YOU HAD PLANTED WERE BULB TYPE THAT YOU WOULD DIG UP AND AND THEN PUT DOWN YOUR GARDEN AND THEN PUT THEM BACK IN LATER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO YOU .
NO WE HAVE A SEPARATE AREA FOR THE GARDEN .
UHHUH YOU DO HAVE A SEPARATE AREA .
YEAH AND LAST YEAR WAS THE FIRST YEAR WE TRIED TWO NEW THINGS WE TRIED CORN AND .
OH .
WE TRIED A WATERMELON .
UHHUH WELL TELL ME THIS UH LOWELL DO YOU EN DO YOU ENJOY DOING THAT KIND OF WORK AND .
UH .
DO YOU HAVE THE TIME TO RELAX SO THAT YOU CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT .
I ENJOY DOING IT ON A LIMITED BASIS I DO NT THINK THAT IF I THE REASON I BOUGHT A TOWNHOUSE IS SO THAT I WOULD NT I GET I M ALLERGIC TO GRASS SO I DO NT MOW GRASS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT SO I THINK IF I HAD A BIG HOME AND A BIG LAWN I D I DO NT BELIEVE I WOULD ENJOY IT BUT JUST ON THE LIMITED BASIS THAT I DO IT I DO ENJOY IT VERY MUCH .
UHHUH WELL I M A LITTLE MORE FORTUNATE I THINK FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW I M NOT ALLERGIC TO THINGS AND I MOVED HERE IN STATE COLLEGE QUITE A WHILE AGO AND WAS FORTUNATE TO GET SOME LAND SO ACTUALLY I HAVE NINE ACRES .
OH WOW .
AND UH FOR MANY YEARS I GREW SWEET CORN UH AND AND MY KIDS WERE THERE AND SO WE SET UP A SHOP THERE AND UH I WOULD UH COLLECT THE CORN VERY CAREFULLY EAR BY EAR AND IT WAS NEVER MORE THAN ONE TO TWO HOURS OLD AND PEOPLE CAME FROM MILES AND MILES AROUND TO GET THAT CORN BECAUSE THEY KNEW IT WAS INDIVIDUALLY PICKED AND VERY VERY FRESH .
HOW ABOUT THAT .
SO WE HAD A NICE THING GOING THERE AND IT WAS DELICIOUS HUH I REALLY ENJOYED THAT AND THEN I ALSO HAVE A A GARDEN OH IT S PROBABLY UH TWENTYFIVE BY THIRTY OR FORTY SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT I PUT IN MY NORMAL FOOD GARDEN THINGS EACH YEAR AND UH I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING OR A WHOLE LOT OF EVERYTHING IN THE ACTUALLY I LOVE UH BROCCOLI BRUSSELS SPROUTS AND I HAVE ALL KINDS OF TOMATOES KALE AND ALL THOSE GOOD THINGS AND I RENT OUT MY FIELD THAT I USED TO PLANT IN SWEET CORN TO A LOCAL FARMER AND THEN HE PLANTS ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN ACRE OF SWEET CORN FOR ME TO USE SO I GET OUT OF THAT AMOUNT OF WORK AT ANY RATE .
WELL THAT S NICE .
IT IS IT IS VERY VERY NICE I I REALLY ENJOY IT MY PROBLEM IS NOT HAVING ENOUGH TIME TO DO THE JOB AS COMPLETELY AND AS THOROUGHLY AS I WOULD LIKE I ENJOY IT VERY MUCH .
THAT MUCH LAND REQUIRES AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME .
YES IT DOES UH AND ACTUALLY I HAD A PONY THERE FOR TWENTYFIVE YEARS AND HE HAD TWO ACRES THAT HE HAD FOR HIS OWN GRAZING .
HOW ABOUT THAT .
SO HE HAD HIS OWN BACKYARD GARDEN TOO BUT THAT THAT WORKED OUT VERY NICELY TOO I BUILT HIM A BARN BACK THERE WHERE IN THE PART OF MY CORN FIELD AND HE LIVED IN THAT BUT UH AS FAR AS GARDENING IS CONCERNED WE DO ENJOY IT MY WIFE IS IN CHARGE OF THE FLOWERS SHE DOES ALL OF THE FLOWER GARDENING THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE PROPERTY AND WE HAVE YOU KNOW AN ACRE AN ACRE AND A HALF THAT THE HOUSE IS SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF AND SHE HAS FLOWER GARDENS AND BULBS PERENNIALS AND THINGS WE HAVE BLUEBERRIES BLACKBERRIES I HAVE TWO OR THREE UH APPLE TREES THE GOLDEN DELICIOUS WERE FANTASTIC THIS YEAR MY NEIGHBOR HAS PEAR TREES AND UM OH BLUEBERRIES ALL KINDS OF FOOD AROUND THERE IF WE JUST HAD TIME TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT MY WIFE HAS SPENT PROBABLY I DO NT KNOW HOW MANY HOURS IN THE LAST TWO OR THREE WEEKS CANNING PEARS BECAUSE THERE WERE SO MANY OF THEM AND I HAVE BEEN TOTALLY ENGULFED WITH GOLDEN DELICIOUS APPLES I JUST COULD NT HANDLE THE THE AMOUNT OF THEM WE GOT THIS YEAR IT S REALLY BEEN A REMARKABLE YEAR .
WELL I BET YOU COULD ANSWER A QUESTION FOR ME WHAT S A GOOD APPLE TO BAKE PIES WITH .
I USE MY GOLDEN DELICIOUS AND THEY MAKE DELICIOUS PIES .
ARE THERE M N THERE S AN AFFLU .
SO HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT .
WELL IT S I AM PRETTY MUCH AGAINST IT .
REALLY .
YEAH .
HOW ABOUT YOU .
OH I M PRETTY MUCH FOR IT .
OH GOOD WE CAN HAVE A DEBATE .
WE LL HAVE SOME INTERESTING DISCUSSION I GUESS .
WELL LIKE UM I DO NT KNOW I C THINK THAT I ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I M AGAINST IT IS THAT UH UM I M AFRAID OF SOMEONE LOSING THEIR LIFE FOR S UM WRONGLY .
WRONGFULLY .
YEAH .
RIGHT .
YEAH .
AND UH ANOTHER REASON ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT REALLY I REALLY ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN KIND OF AMBIVALENT ABOUT IT BUT ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT REALLY .
UH MADE ME FEEL KIND OF STRONGLY AGAINST IT IS THAT UH YOU KNOW SOMEONE SAID TO ME ONCE WELL IMAGINE IF THE PERSON .
YOU LOVE MOST IN THE WORLD LIKE YOUR MOTHER OR SOMETHING IF SOMEONE KILLED HER WOULD NT YOU WANT TO SEE THEM KILLED FOR THE PUNISHMENT .
BUT THEN I THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND I THOUGHT WELL THE LOSS THAT I WOULD FEEL AT LOSING MY MOTHER .
YEAH IT WOULD NEVER BE EQUAL .
SOMEONE ELSE WOULD FEEL THAT ABOUT THAT PERSON .
RIGHT .
NO MATTER HOW ROTTEN THEY WERE SOMEBODY LOVES THEM .
RIGHT .
YEAH .
HOW ABOUT YOU .
WELL I GUESS YOU KNOW I I GUESS I CAN SEE IT FROM SEVERAL DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES BUT YOU KNOW WHEN I HEAR ABOUT THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT .
THEY VE WHAT .
THEY VE BEEN REPORTING ABOUT IN MILWAUKEE YOU KNOW I I TO ME .
I DO NT SEE ANY WAY OF REHABILITATING THE GUY .
YOU KNOW MAYBE THERE IS I DO NT KNOW .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
BUT YOU KNOW AND YOU KNOW HE S NEVER GOING TO BE TO ME A FUNCTIONING PART OF SOCIETY .
HE S ALREADY BEEN EITHER PAROLED OR WHATEVER FOR CHILD MOLESTATION .
UHHUM .
I MEAN I DO NT KNOW I JUST I REALLY HAVE A HARD TIME WITH THAT BECAUSE HE REALLY SOUNDS LIKE A REAL SICKO .
AND YOU KNOW FOR THE THINGS .
HE S DONE I DO NT KNOW I GUESS IT S EITHER YOU KNOW PUT HIM IN JAIL FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE YOU KNOW OR OR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT .
I GUESS .
YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
WELL YOU KNOW .
AN AND .
THAT S TRUE BECAUSE UM M B .
A LOT OF UM .
THESE CONVERSATIONS I VE HAD ON THIS PROGRAM .
THIS .
UHHUH .
THESE TELEPHONE CONVERSATIONS HAVE REVOLVED AROUND UM CRIMINAL .
OH REALLY .
YOU KNOW JUSTICE .
UHHUH .
UHHUH .
OR WHATEVER AND MOST OF THE TIME .
I HEAR MYSELF SAYING .
WELL YOU KNOW WE DO NT HAVE ENOUGH ROOM LEFT IN THE JAILS AND PEOPLE CRIME IS STILL CLIMBING .
AND WE NEED TO HAVE DIFFERENT PUNISHMENTS YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
BUT I JUST AM SCARED OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT .
YEAH .
I GUESS .
WELL I CAN UNDERST I .
I MEAN YOU KNOW THERE .
THERE IS ALWAYS THAT CHANCE BUT YOU KNOW I GUESS TO SOME PEOPLE .
IT D ALMOST BE BETTER TO DIE TO THEM THAN TO SPEND LIFE IN PRISON OR WHATEVER .
I DO NT I MEAN I DO NT KNOW BUT UH YOU KNOW BUT THAT WOULD BE A SITUATION WHERE IF SOMEBODY .
YOU KNOW WAS GON NA BE YOU KNOW YOU .
YOU .
YOU REALLY THROW A LOT ON THE COURTS HOPEFULLY THAT THEY WO NT DO THAT YOU KNOW FOR ANY FOR ANY SITUATION REALLY .
BUT UH YOU KNOW WHEN I YOU FIND SOMEBODY JUST LIKE THAT SITUATION I MEAN IT WAS DISGUSTING WHEN I READ ABOUT IT .
TODAY .
AND AND WHEN YOU FIND SOMEONE LIKE THAT THAT YOU KNOW IS GUILTY HE CONFESSED ALREADY TO KILLING ELEVEN .
UHHUH .
I I D YOU KNOW I GUESS I HAVE A HARD TIME FEELING MERCIFUL TOWARD HIM AND .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW .
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT S SO FAR REMOVED .
IF IT S NO ONE THAT I KNOW .
RIGHT .
THEN YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE TAXPAYERS PAYING .
RIGHT .
THE SHELTER AND FEED AND CLOTHE .
RIGHT .
THEM FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIFE .
AND TRYING TO REHABILITATE HIM TOO AND YOU KNOW .
LETTING HIM OUT AGAIN .
RIGHT EXACTLY .
AND UH YOU KNOW NOBODY WANTS THAT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW EVERYBODY WOULD BE JUST AS SCARED TO DEATH YOU KNOW .
WE WE VE HAD A REAL PROBLEM HERE IN TEXAS WITH UH PRISON OVERCROWDING AND THEY VE BEEN RELEASING PEOPLE LEFT AND RIGHT AND YOU KNOW THEY VE COMMITTED MURDERS AND RAPES AND EVERYTHING ELSE AND YOU KNOW YOU JUST THINK YOU KNOW WHERE S THE JUSTICE HERE .
UHHUH .
I MEAN YOU KNOW THEY RE NOT EVEN HAVING TO SERVE OUT WHAT .
THEY SHOULD BE SERVING .
THAT S TRUE .
YOU KNOW I JUST RECENTLY MOVED TO MASSACHUSETTS .
I M NOT SURE WHAT .
THEIR POLICY IS ON CAPITAL PUNISHMENT AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS BUT UH I DO KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOTORIOUS FOR PAROLING PEOPLE .
OH REALLY .
YEAH WHEN THEY RE WHEN AND THEN HAVING THEM RECONVICTED FOR .
UHHUH .
VIOLENT CRIMES .
YEAH .
AND I GUESS THEY SAID YOU KNOW SH DO YOU THINK IT SHOULD BE RESTRICTED .
I GUESS IF IT WERE IF IF BECAUSE A LOT OF STATES DO STILL PRACTICE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT .
UHHUH .
I GUESS VIOLENT CRIMES WOULD BE THE CRIMES WHERE I CAN SEE IT MAKING THE MOST SENSE .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW VIOLENT CRIMES WITH NO UH WITH JUST MALICIOUS INTENT .
RIGHT EXACTLY .
YEAH .
WELL YOU KNOW THAT S EXACTLY I MEAN I M I M NOT SAYING I I THINK CAPITAL MURDER OR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS THE PERFECT SOLUTION IN EVERY CASE YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME CASES WHEN YOU JUST DO NT KNOW AND I I THINK THERE S A A SHADOW OF A DOUBT YOU KNOW LIKE WITH THIS THIS GUY IN IN MILWAUKEE .
I MEAN IT HE PRETTY MUCH CONFESSED TO IT .
I MEAN THEY YOU KNOW JUST EVERYTHING I MEAN CANNIBALISM AND EVERYTHING ELSE UH .
YEAH .
I REALLY WOULD HAVE A HARD TIME ESPECIALLY IF I WAS ON A JURY NOT WANTING HIM TO YOU KNOW BE EXECUTED .
HANG .
YEAH .
BECAUSE I MEAN THAT S JUST AWFUL .
AND WHAT IS HE GOING TO DO PRISON TO THE OTHER PEOPLE .
RIGHT .
WELL I HAVE A HUN I HAVE A HUNCH THAT YOU KNOW THE OTHER PRISONERS ARE NT GOING TO BE TOO HAPPY WITH HIM ANYWAY .
EITHER I MEAN YOU KNOW THEY I DO NT KNOW FROM FROM WHAT .
I HEAR ABOUT JAIL LIFE IS NOT ANY WAY TO LIVE .
RIGHT .
BUT UH I DO NT KNOW .
IT S JUST .
WELL I WAS I SAW ON A HUMAN INTEREST STORY OR WHATEVER TODAY THERE WAS A WOMAN .
WHO WAS JUST BEING PAROLED AND TRYING TO MAKE IT BACK SHE .
UHHUH .
WAS OFF DRUGS AND EVERYTHING BUT SHE SAID UH YOU KNOW IN PRISON .
YOU CAN GET ANYTHING .
YOU CAN ANY DRUGS YOU WANT .
THERE S IT IT S JUST LIKE BEING OUTSIDE .
YOU KNOW PEOPLE .
REALLY .
FIND WAYS AROUND .
AND THERE S A POWER STRUCTURE THAT YOU HAVE BOW TO AND AND IT REALLY IS NT FOR SOME PEOPLE THA WHO HAVE BEEN THERE FOR OVER AND OVER AND OVER IT REALLY IS NT UH AS BAD .
I MEAN THERE S IT S NOT THAT BAD OF A LIFE AS IT SHOULD BE .
YEAH .
B FOR THE PUNISHMENT ASPECT .
YEAH .
BUT THE SOCIETY IS TURNED AGAINST PUNISHMENT AND MORE TOWARDS REHABILITATION AND .
YEAH .
THAT .
MAYBE THAT S WHY ONE OF THE REASONS WHY CRIME HAS GONE UP BECAUSE IT S NOT SO SCARY ANYMORE .
YEAH .
WELL YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY LIKE REPEAT OFFENDERS .
IT IT JUST APPALLS ME THAT THEY CAN BE OUT YOU KNOW THEY EVEN GET A TEN YEAR SENTENCE AND BE OUT IN IN TWO OR THREE OR FOUR YEARS .
YOU KNOW THAT S THAT S SCARY BECAUSE YOU KNOW I M NOT SURE I THINK WE RE PAROLING THEM WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING IF THEY RE YOU KNOW GOING TO BE COMMITTING ANY .
MORE VIOLENT ACTS OR NOT .
RIGHT .
AND WHAT .
THEY RE GOING TO BE DOING WHEN THEY .
RIGHT .
GET OUT .
AND IT IT S IT S REALLY SCARY .
I ME YOU KNOW I I DO NT KNOW WHAT .
THE PERFECT SOLUTION TO THAT IS BUT I KNOW THAT ESPECIALLY WITH VIOLENT CRIMES WHERE YOU KNOW YOU RE NEARLY A HUNDRED PERCENT CONVINCED THAT THEY RE GUILTY AND WITHOUT MUCH REPENTANCE OR ANYTHING ELSE YOU KNOW THEN I DO NT KNOW I I GUESS I I JUST REALLY DO NT SEE MUCH USE FOR THIS GUY IN MILWAUKEE YOU KNOW .
FOR INSTANCE I MEAN THAT S JUST I COULD SEE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IN A CASE LIKE THAT .
AND YOU KNOW FOR FOR OTHER PEOPLE TOO THAT DO THINGS LIKE THAT .
BUT UH WHEN UH MY WIFE AND I ARE BOTH PARTICIPATING IN THIS SURVEY AND SHE PICKED UP THE PHONE AND WHEN SHE HEARD THE TOPIC SHE SAID CAPITAL PUNISHMENT SO SHE WAS UH .
HANDED IT TO YOU .
YEAH WELL LUCKILY IT WAS FOR ME .
BECAUSE THEY WANT TH THEY COORDINATE THE TIMES SO IT CAN .
ONLY BE ONE OR THE OTHER .
OH OH I SEE .
SO SHE TRIED TO ENTER HER NUMBER AND IT WOULD NT WORK SO SHE SAID WHEW IT S FOR YOU .
SO BUT UH YOU KNOW I DO NT KNOW I I STRUGGLE WITH IT BUT I I REALLY THINK THAT IN IN TERMS OF LIKE THIS I D I THINK THAT IT IT MIGHT NOT BE SUCH A BAD THING .
BECAUSE I DO NT KNOW THAT ANYBODY W IN I DO NT KNOW THAT ANYBODY WOULD FEEL GOOD YOU KNOW LIKE IF YOU LET SOMEONE LIKE THAT LOOSE IN YOUR COMMUNITY .
YOU KNOW I I I M SU YOU D HAVE TO BE SCARED TO DEATH .
WELL MAYBE IF THEY COULD UH IF THEY HAD MORE MONEY OR MORE MORE RESOURCES TO WORK MORE ON REHABILITATION I MEAN DEEP DOWN I THINK EVERY EVERY HUMAN .
OKAY LET S TALK ABOUT SCHOOLING .
YEAH UH WHAT WHAT CONTACTS DO YOU HAVE WITH THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SY .
OKAY WELL I HAVE A BOY AND HE JUST WENT INTO MIDDLE SCHOOL AND I HAVE A GIRL AND SHE S IN UH GRADE SCHOOL AND THEN I HAVE A LITTLE BOY WHO GOES TO UH THEY HAVE SOMETHING JUST BEFORE KINDERGARTEN AND IT S CALLED EARLY CHILDHOOD AND I HAVE A YOUNG .
OH OKAY .
A YOUNG BOY IN THAT .
UHHUH .
SO I I HAVE A LOT OF CHILDREN IN IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM DOWN HERE .
UHHUH .
AND UM I THINK WE HAVE EXCELLENT TEACHERS HERE I AM REALLY UH LIKE THE STU LIKE THE WAY THE TEACHERS WORK WITH THE STUDENTS UH I VE NOT BEEN SO UM HAPPY WITH THE SCHOOLS THEMSELVES I GUESS LIKE MY LAST YEAR MY SON AND DAUGHTER WERE IN THE SAME GRADE SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
BEFORE HE MOVED UP TO MIDDLE SCHOOL AND IT WAS JUST PACKED I MEAN IT WAS A A FIRE HAZARD IF WE HAD ANY KIND OF ASSEMBLY THERE WITH PARENTS .
YEAH .
AND IT WAS JUST A REAL PROBLEM UH SO WE HAD TO DO A BOND ISSUE AND AND UM VOTE TO TAKE MONEY AND EITHER HAVE STUDENTS BUSSED TO DIFFERENT SCHOOLS IF THAT S WHAT THE PREFER TO DO OR TO UH WORK ON THE WORK FOR ANOTHER SCHOOL TO BE BUILT WHICH IS A GOOD IDEA BUT IN THE MEANTIME THE SCHOOL STILL HAS LOTS AND LOTS OF KIDS IN IT .
YEAH YEAH .
SO UM I THINK ONE THING IS THAT WOULD MAYBE WE DO NT HAVE ENOUGH SCHOOLS AND SECONDLY WHEN WE HAVE ENOUGH SCHOOLS SOMETIMES WE CA NT GET THE THE SUPPORT FOR THE TEACHERS THAT WE NEED TO PAY THEM TO KEEP GOOD TEACHERS .
WELL I THINK THAT S I THINK THAT S UH TRUE I I VE GOT A LITTLE DIFFERENT UH CONTACT BUT I VE I VE GOT A ONE SON THAT GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL LAST YEAR .
OH .
AND ANOTHER SON THAT S A A SOPHOMORE THIS YEAR .
UHHUH .
AND UH MY WIFE TEACHES KINDERGARTEN HERE IN RICHARDSON .
OH GREAT .
UH BUT IN GENERAL I I THINK THE THE YOU KNOW ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE WE UH THE CHOSE TO LIVE IN RICHARDSON WHEN WE WHEN WE CAME HERE WAS THE WAS THE SCHOOLS AND I THINK THAT PLANO AND RICHARDSON IN TERMS OF THE UH THINGS SERIOUSLY WRONG WITH THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE NOT NEARLY TO THE EXTENT TH THAT .
WE SEE THROUGH THE OUT THE COUNTRY .
UH RIGHT RIGHT AND I THINK I THINK PART OF THAT IS THAT IS THE THE UH A BIG PART OF THAT IS JUST THE DEMOGRAPHICS THE POPULATION IN THOSE SCHOOLS ARE ARE TYPICALLY UH PEOPLE THAT VERY MUCH VALUE THE EDUCATION AND SUPPORT .
UHHUH .
THE THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS .
I THINK THAT S RIGHT .
AND AND UH ALTHOUGH THERE S STILL SOME STILL SOME PROBLEMS BUT UH I YOU KNOW I WHEN I WAS WHEN I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL I GREW UP IN IOWA AND AND IN MY FAMILY SCHOOL WAS CERTAINLY VALUED BUT IF THERE WAS EVER ANY SORT OF A UH IF EV IF I WAS EVER IN TROUBLE IN SCHOOL I WAS ALSO IN TROUBLE AT HOME .
YEAH .
EVEN MORE SO AND I THINK THAT PART OF IT IS IS NOT EXACTLY WITH THE SCHOOLS BUT WITH THE WITH THE UH .
THE HOME YEAH .
THE CULTURE THAT DOES NT DOES NT VALUE THE EDUCATION AND DOES NT VALUE THE SCHOOLS AND DOES NT SUPPORT UH .
I THINK THAT S RIGHT .
WHAT THE SCHOOLS ARE ARE TRYING TO DO .
IT IS SO HARD WITH A FAMILY SYSTEM UM EITHER DIVORCED OR OR JUST ONE PARENT .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
OR JUST LI AND THEN IF BOTH OF THEM HAVE TO WORK EVEN THAT IS A A HARD SITUATION .
UHHUH .
FOR THE CHILDREN UH TO TO HAVE A SUPPORTIVE SYSTEM AROUND THEM TO MAKE SCHOOL WORK FOR THEM .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK IT S REAL IMPORTANT THAT THE PARENTS WORK WITH THE SCHOOL UM .
YEAH .
I THINK WHAT YOU SAID IS IS REALLY A PINPOINT THOUGH THAT THE STUDENT AND THE FAMILY LIFE REALLY ADDS OR DETRACTS .
YEAH .
WHAT S HAPPENING IN THE SCHOOL .
YEAH .
SO UM WHAT ABOUT YOUR WIFE IS SHE SHE HAPPY AT SCHOOL OR MUMBLEX .
WELL UH SHE SHE WORKS VERY HARD AS A KINDERGARTEN TEACHER .
I BET SHE DOES .
SHE HAS SHE HAS TWO HALF DAY CLASSES SO SHE .
UHHUH .
HAS UH YOU KNOW ON THE ORDER OF TWICE AS MANY STUDENTS AS .
YEAH .
AS THE TEACHERS IN THE HIGHER GRADES .
RIGHT RIGHT .
AND UH UH BUT HER HER BACKGROUND IS IN IS IN UH CHILD DEVELOPMENT AND .
UHHUH .
AND UH SO FORTH AND SO KINDERGARTEN IS AS HIGH AS SHE AS SHE WANTS TO TEACH AND SHE S .
YEAH .
SHE S TEACHING RATHER THAN SOMETHING ELSE BECAUSE THAT THAT THAT S THE JOBS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND THAT THE SCHEDULE MATCHES UH YOU KNOW WITH OUR KIDS AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
RIGHT .
SO YEAH UH AND BUT UH THE .
OKAY UH WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER AN INVASION OF PRIVACY .
UH I WAS JUST NOW TOLD THAT S WHAT THE TOPIC WAS AND UH I GUESS INVASION OF PRIVACY UH TO ME FOR EXAMPLE WOULD BE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF CREDIT CARDS .
UHHUH .
FOR EXAMPLE AND UH I GUESS RECENTLY ONE OF THE T V STATIONS HERE UH RAN A SERIES OF UH NEWS CASTS ON UNAUTHORIZED CREDIT CARD USAGE AND HOW EASY IT WAS TO GET A PERSON S CREDIT CARD NUMBERS .
IT S VERY EASY .
AND USE IT AND I WAS QUITE SURPRISED AT THAT I GUESS I CAN CONSIDER MYSELF FORTUNATE THAT UH IT NEVER HAPPENED TO ME .
NOW I VE NEVER .
I DO NT KNOW WHAT I D REALLY DO IF IT DID .
I VE NEVER HAD THAT HAPPEN TO ME EITHER WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT PLACES LIKE I WAS IN MICHAEL S THE OTHER NIGHT AND CHARGED SOMETHING AND THEY ASKED FOR MY HOME PHONE EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW THE CHARGE HAD BEEN APPROVED WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT .
UH .
DOES IT BOTHER YOU TO GIVE IT .
NO NOT REALLY BECAUSE I M LISTED IN THE PHONE BOOK IF I WAS THE TYPE OF INDIVIDUAL THAT UH HAD AN UNLISTED NUMBER I I THINK I WOULD BE HESITANT TO GIVE IT .
YOU KNOW THAT THEY THEY NOW HAVE A UH I BELIEVE IT S A FEDERAL LAW THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO GIVE YOUR PHONE NUMBER ON CHARGE TICKETS .
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT UPSET ME WHEN I LIVED IN CALIFORNIA WAS UH THEY DID A LOT OF THINGS WITH S YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER .
SECURITY NUMBER UHHUH .
AS A MATTER OF FACT THEY EVEN WENT TO THE POINT OF PRINTING OUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER ON YOUR DRIVER S LICENSE .
OH .
AND THEY WOULD NOT CASH CHECKS UNLESS THEY HAD YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER SO WE HAD OUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS IMPRINTED ON OUR CHECKS .
UH UHHUH .
AND I WAS REALLY YOU KNOW UNHAPPY ABOUT THAT SITUATION I THINK THAT WAS AN INVASION OF PRIVACY .
PRIVACY YES YES I CAN SEE YOU KNOW WHERE THAT WAS I I DO NT MIND MY PHONE NUMBER AND ADDRESS OR WORK PHONE BEING GIVEN YOU KNOW WHEN I HAVE TO CASH A CHECK I DO NT SEE ANY NEED FOR IT WHEN I M CHARGING SOMETHING BUT I NEITHER AM I A PERSON THAT HAS THE GUTS TO SAY NO I M NOT GOING TO GIVE IT TO YOU EITHER .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW AND UH .
ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS I THINK THAT S GOING ON IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW IS THE SELLING OF UH MAIL LISTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
YES YES .
YOU KNOW UH RECENTLY WE UH I PURCHASED SOME MAGAZINES U S NEWS .
UHHUH .
AND FORBES MAGAZINE .
UHHUH .
AND EVERY SINCE THAT DAY I HAVE BEEN INUNDATED WITH YOU KNOW UH SUBSCRIPTIONS TO THIS SUBSCRIPTIONS TO THAT UH THIS NEWS LETTER THIS INVESTMENT LETTER UH EVEN TO THE POINT OF PEOPLE CALLING ME AT HOME AND PRIOR TO ME ORDERING THESE MAGAZINES I NEVER GOT THOSE KIND OF CALLS .
RIGHT RIGHT .
AND .
I DISCOVERED WITH UH CHARGE CARDS UH I FEEL LIKE THAT I DO NT KNOW WHETHER IT S THE STORES THEMSELVES THAT SELL THE LIST OR WHETHER THE UH UH CREDIT REPORT BUREAU SELLS IT BUT I GET CATALOGS FROM PEOPLE I VE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF .
UHHUH .
AND I KNOW THEY HAVE TO BE COMING FROM MY CHARGE CARDS YOU KNOW .
FROM SOME SOME LIST YEAH .
FROM SOME LIST YOU KNOW THAT KNOWS THAT I HAVE A SAY A CHARGE ACCOUNT AT AT NEIMAN S OR SOMETHING BECAUSE THEN I LL GET CATALOGS THAT YOU KNOW ARE WITHIN THAT RANGE .
UHHUH .
THAT I WOULD NEVER ORDER FROM .
RIGHT .
ORDINARILY AND UH YOU KNOW AND I GET I GET TIRED OF THAT I BECAUSE I LOOK AT ALL THAT JUNK MAIL AND I THINK OF HOW INEPT OUR POST OFFICE IS AND HOW THAT S TAKING UP .
ALL THEIR TIME .
YOU KNOW ALL THEIR TIME TO SORT AND THEY RE NOT EVEN PAYING FULL POSTAGE .
SURE .
YOU KNOW AND IF YOU DID AWAY WITH SOME OF THAT OUR POSTAL SERVICE MIGHT GIVE BETTER SERVICE .
I THINK THE GENERAL PUBLIC WOULD BE YOU KNOW UH TREMENDOUSLY UPSET IF THEY KNEW HOW EASY IT IS FOR UH LET S SAY THE CRIMINAL INDIVIDUALS TO TO GET ACCESS TO PEOPLE S RECORDS UH THEIR CREDIT CARDS .
RIGHT .
DRIVER S LICENSES CHECKS THINGS LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
UH I DO NT THINK ANYBODY REALLY KNOWS WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT .
NO NO .
COMPUTERS CAUSED A LOT OF THIS I M SURE .
WELL YOU KNOW LET S FACE IT COMPUTERS CAN BE GOTTEN INTO VERY EASILY IF YOU IF YOU REALLY HAVE THE THE KNOW WITH ALL IF YOU RE YOU KNOW SO INCLINED TO UH OH WHAT DO I WANT TO SAY HAVE THE SMARTS TO BE ABLE TO TINKER WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
SURE .
YOU KNOW AND HAVE A BASIC KNOWLEDGE THEY RE VERY EASY TO GET INTO TO TAP INTO A SYSTEM .
SEEMS AS THOUGH THEY ARE YEAH .
UHHUH YOU KNOW AND UH WHICH IS SCARY I MEAN YOU KNOW OUR LIVES ARE ON COMPUTERS .
UNFORTUNATELY .
AND UH AND I DO NT KNOW I KIND OF I RESENT THE CALLS OF AN EVENING TRYING TO SELL ME SOMETHING UH .
FORTUNATELY I HAVE NT UH HAVE NT UH BEEN INUNDATED WITH THAT SITUATION YET .
WE ARE CONSTANTLY IT SEEMS LIKE I DO NT KNOW WHY YOU KNOW EITHER WANTING TO CLEAN OUR CARPET SELL US STORM WINDOWS .

UHHUH .
UM SO IF THAT S OKAY WITH YOU THEN I LL JUST PRESS ONE .
THAT WILL BE FINE .
OKAY WELL HI .
HI .
GOOD MORNING UM I THINK I MEAN IF IF I START THIS I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT UM ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DO NT THINK WE REALLY UNDERSTOOD ABOUT THE THE MIDDLE EASTERN SITUATION IS THAT THEY RE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT TYPE OF PEOPLE THAN WE ARE AND I MEAN THEY THINK DIFFERENTLY AND THEIR IDEA OF WHAT IS JUSTICE IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM OURS AND AND RIGHT NOW I I THINK THAT THAT S BEEN PROVEN IN THE FACT THAT UM THEY HAVE JUST WELL ANYWAY I JUST THINK THAT YOU KNOW THE UNITED STATES POLICY OVER THERE I THINK WE SHOULD JUST LEAVE THEM ALONE I REALLY DO IN IN A MAJOR WAY BECAUSE THEY JUST UM THAT WHOLE REGION OVER THERE I THINK NEEDS TO SETTLE IT S OWN DIFFERENCES WITHIN ITSELF .
YEAH .
AND THAT S THE WAY THE COURSE THAT THEY SHOULD GO I MEAN YOU KNOW WE CAN MAYBE HELP THEM A LITTLE BIT PROMPT THEM BUT I DO NT THINK THIS INTERVENTION AT SUCH HIGH LEVELS SHOULD BE GOING ON THE THE THING WITH ISRAEL AND PALESTINE I BELIEVE THAT SHOULD BE SETTLED BETWEEN THEM AND ALSO UM YOU KNOW THE OTHER THING IS THEIR IDEA OR OUR IDE IDEA OF DEMOCRACY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM I MEAN THA I MEAN I M TALKING ABOUT THE WHOLE MIDDLE EA AND AND MAYBE THIS IS TOO GENERAL BUT I JUST BELIEVE THAT UM THEY DO NOT LOOK AT DEMOCRACY THE SAME WAY WE DO THEY DO NT UNDERSTAND IT AS WE DO NT UNDERSTAND THE WAY THEY LIVE .
YEAH .
AND SO YOU KNOW TRYING TO PUT LIKE A SQUARE PEG IN A ROUND HOLE IS JUST YOU KNOW I I DO NT THINK THAT THAT S THE WAY TO GO IN THIS AND UM YOU KNOW IT IT OH WELL THAT S THAT S A COUPLE THOUGHTS ON IT .
YEAH .
I I GUESS YOU KNOW I D LIKE YOU TO MAYBE EXPRESS SOMETHING HERE .
WELL I I I THINK OVERALL THAT S RIGHT I THINK IT S KIND OF SAD THOUGH THAT FOR GENERATIONS THEY VE BEEN TAUGHT TO HATE EACH OTHER .
YEAH .
AND THAT S I YOU KNOW IF SOMEWHERE IN THERE SOMEONE S GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN A DIFFERENT WAY .
THAT S YEAH .
YOU KNOW AN AN I I THINK THAT UM TRUE WE DO HAVE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAYS OF LOOKING AT THINGS AT A LOT OF THINGS BUT UH AT THE SAME TIME I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF THERE IS A LOT OF GOOD THAT THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES CAN DO AS FAR AS EXAMPLE AND AND UH I THINK SOME DIFFERENT THINGS COULD COME FROM WHAT S HAPPENED THAN WHAT WE EXPECT .
WELL YE WELL YEAH UM I I GUESS WE COULD BE A CATALYST FOR THEIR CHANGE I UM THE WAR HAS CERTAINLY SORT OF SET THINGS ON END OVER THERE AND I DO NT THINK WE D BE TALKING ABOUT THIS YOU KNOW THE ISRAELI SITUATION PALESTINIAN SITUATION UM SORT OF CAME TO A HEAD UM UNLESS THERE HAD BEEN A WAR I MEAN THAT WAS ONE THING .
YEAH .
THAT CAME OUT OF IT GOOD OR BAD I I DO NT JUDGE ANY WAR AS GOOD OR BAD IT S JUST A WAR .
YEAH .
AND I DO NT SEE ANY WINNERS OR LOSERS I JUST SEE DEAD BODIES I M SORRY YOU KNOW BUT UM I I I JUST THINK YOU KNOW YOU RE RIGHT AND I THINK MAYBE IT S AT A WHOLE DIFFERENT LEVEL OF THEM TRYING TO COOPERATE AND GET ALONG IT S NOT GOING TO BE THAT WE RE GOING TO UH YOU KNOW SORT OF TELL THEM TO GO TO THEIR ROOM AND THAT S GOING TO SOLVE THE WHOLE PROBLEM .
YEAH .
IT S GOING TO BE THEM .
BUT THAT S THE TYPE OF THING THEY UNDERSTAND .
YEAH .
THEY DO NT UNDERSTAND ANY OTHER WAY .
AND YOU KNOW .
AND SO AT THAT AT THAT YOU HAVE TO WORK AT THEIR LEVEL .
IT S .
TO AN EXTENT TOO .
YEAH THAT THAT S TRUE TOO I UM .
THEY WOULD NT HAVE UNDERSTOOD ANYTHING ELSE THAN WHAT WE DID IN THE WAR .
OH WELL YEAH THEY THEY UNDERSTAND VIOLENCE .
THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE YEAH .
THEY LOVE VIOLENT LEADERS TO YOU KNOW I MEAN LOOK AT YOU KNOW THE LEADER THEY HAD THEY THEY JUST ADORED HIM .
YEAH .
BECAUSE HE WAS SO STRICT AND CRUEL AND YOU KNOW FOR A WHILE THERE HE HAD THEM BE .
I CA NT FIGURE OUT WHY THEY ADORED HIM .
WELL IT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THEIR RELIGION I GOT TO SAY .
YES YEAH .
THAT OVER THERE UM AND I KNOW THIS ONLY BECAUSE FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT I M SPEAKING OF THIS BECAUSE I I VE YOU KNOW TRAVELED AROUND TOWN WITH DIFFERENT CAB DRIVERS IN A SITUATION WHERE I VE DONE THAT AND ONE ONE OF THE KINDEST PEOPLE I VE EVER MET IN MY WHOLE LIFE UM IS FROM THAT AREA OF THE COUNTRY AND I MEAN HE IS JUST OVERLY HE HE IS ABOUNDING IN KINDNESS LET S SAY .
YEAH .
AND HIS WIFE IS SO GODLY I MEAN EVERY THOUGHT THEY HAVE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT LIFE THAN WE HAVE .
HUH .
YOU KNOW AND WHEN YOU ADD THE UM COMMERCIALIZATION OF THE WESTERN WORLD IT SORT OF SCREWS EVERYTHING UP FOR THEM .
YEAH .
AND THEY HAVE VERY BASIC LIFE UM WELL IT S JUST A VERY BASIC LIFE AND THEY JUST REALLY BELIEVE IN ALLAH OR GOD OR WHATEVER .
UHHUH .
AND IT S YOU KNOW EVERYTHING IS TO THE GLORY OF ALLAH AND AND YOU KNOW AND IT IT S ALMOST LIKE .
WHAT S SAD IS THAT THE LEADERS THAT HAVE CONTROL .
YEAH WELL THAT S .
ARE POWER .
SEE USING THAT YEAH .
YES AND THEY ABUSE THAT .
AND IT S ALWAYS BEEN MILITARY AND IT S ALWAYS BEEN AND THAT S THAT S ALWAYS BEEN THE WAY OF THE WORLD DO NT YOU THINK .
WHICH I THINK THAT THAT S NOT THE THE WAY THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE OVER THERE REALLY ARE .
YEAH SO IT S REALLY HARD WHEN YOU SEE THE LEADERS COMPARED TO THE PEOPLE .
BUT I THINK IN A IN A WAY THE WAR UH I THINK IN A WAY ALL THE INVOLVEMENT OVER THERE TOO THOUGH HAS SHOWN A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT DO NT FOLLOW WHAT THOSE FEW ARE DOING AND THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE GOOD PEOPLE .
YEAH YEAH .
YOU KNOW THERE S AND I I THINK WE MAY NOT HAVE EVER HAVE SEEN THAT WITHOUT SOME OF THESE UH NEWSPEOPLE BEING IN THERE IN THE BROADCASTS AND THE THE UH SOLDIERS LEAVING UM YOU KNOW SURRENDERING AND .
RIGHT AND SURRENDERING THAT WAS .
TRYING TO GET OUT OF THAT SITUATION .
YEAH .
AND AND THE YOU KNOW .
IT JUST REALLY COMES DOWN TO PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME COMPASSION SOME HUMANNESS .
THAT S RIGHT .
DOES NT MATTER WHERE THE BOUNDARIES ARE UM YOU KNOW THERE ARE POLITICAL BOUNDARIES AND THOSE ARE MAN MADE BOUNDARIES BUT YOU KNOW FOR HEAVEN SAKES THAT S SOMETHING THAT S BEEN GOING ON FOR AGES .
AND I I THINK SO MUCH OF IT IS WHAT YOU RE TAUGHT .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
YOU KNOW THEY TEACH THEIR CHILDREN UH IN SUCH A WAY THAT .
OKAY .
WELL WHY DO NT YOU START CAUSE IT SAID I WAS SUPPOSE TO ASK YOU .
WHAT DO YOU .
DO YOU HAVE ANY ELDERLY RELATIVES CURRENTLY IN AN UH NURSING HOME NOW .
YES I DO .
DO YOU .
I HAVE A GRANDMOTHER .
SHE S A HUNDRED AND TWO .
OH MY GOSH .
SHE LL BE A HUNDRED AND THREE IN AUGUST .
UHHUH .
AND WE DECIDE NOT TO PUT HER IN A NURSING HOME .
SHE LIVES WITH MY MOTHER AND MY FATHER .
WHO ALSO LIVE HERE IN TOWN AND THEN MY SISTER TAKES CARE OF HER .
UHHUH .
SHE EVEN THOUGH SHE IS A HUNDRED AND TWO SHE STILL HAS ALL OF HER FACULTIES .
RIGHT .
SHE STILL HAS HER SNAP .
SHE TAKES CARE OF HER OWN BUSINESS .
THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR THAT SHE HAS GOTTEN WEAK AND ACTUALLY HAS TO HAVE A LITTLE WALKER BUT WITH SOMEBODY .
THAT NEEDS AROUND THE CLOCK CARE I HAVE SEEN MY FAMILY AGE .
RIGHT .
I HAVE SEEN THEM IN THE SHE S BEEN THERE TEN YEARS NOW .
AND I HAVE SEEN THEM .
AGE TWENTY .
YEAH .
IN THE TIME AND AND WITH THE EXPENSE AND EVERYTHING I TH I STILL THINK IT IS WORTH IT IF YOU IF YOU HAD A GOOD NURSING HOME AND THEY NEEDED SOME QUALITY CARE I WOULD .
RIGHT .
PUT SOMEONE IN A NURSING HOME .
MY MOTHERINLAW FINALLY .
THEY HAD TO MAKE A FAMILY DECISION .
THERE S SEVEN CHILDREN IN MY HUSBAND S FAMILY AND FORTUNATELY FOUR OF THEM LIVE IN THE SAME HOME TOWN AND SHE HAS ALZHEIMER S .
IT WAS GETTING WHERE SHE WAS GETTING TH DANGEROUS .
I MEAN .
UHHUH .
LETTING STRANGERS IN AND THINGS LIKE THIS BUT THEY WERE VERY FORTUNATE .
IT S A SMALL TOWN AND SHE HAPPENS TO ROOM WITH ONE OF THE DOCTOR S MOTHER S AND .
OH WELL THAT S GOOD .
THEN SHE .
S GOT A LOT OF FAMILY THERE AND THAT GO AND SEE HER .
ALL OF THE TIME BUT SHE REALLY DOES NT .
NOBODY THOUGHT SHE WOULD ADJUST BUT SHE HAS ADJUSTED BEAUTIFULLY .
OH THAT IS GREAT .
BUT THEN I AM ALSO FACING MY FATHER .
WHO IS VERY SICK AND MY MOTHER AND FATHER RESIDE IN COLORADO .
SHE S BEEN TAKING CARE OF HIM .
I DO NT KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER THIS CAN LAST AND AT THAT POINT BECAUSE HE REQUIRES ROUND THE CLOCK .
HE CA NT DO ANYTHING WITHOUT HER .
HE DOES NT KNOW WHEN TO TAKE HIS MEDICINE AND IT S REALLY SAD AND I HAVE THOUGHT IF SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN TO MY MOTHER FOR UH MY BROTHER S ARE NOT INTERESTED IN HELPING ME SO I WOULD HAVE TO MOVE HIM DOWN HERE .
THAT WAY I WANT TO SEE THE NURSING HOME .
IF I HAVE TO PUT HIM INTO ONE .
YOU KNOW WHERE I CAN GO SEE IT .
I I D BE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH HIM BEING IN COLORADO .
AND .
OH WHY YEAH .
I AM SURE YOU HAVE GOT SOME REALLY GOOD NURSING HOMES AROUND DALLAS .
YES .
AND SOME OF THEM ARE LIMITED CARE TOO WHERE PEOPLE CAN DO UH LIKE THEY HAVE APARTMENT STYLES BUT THAT WOULD NT WORK FOR HIM .
I THINK HE IS BEYOND THAT .
WHERE IF YOU NEED HELP YOU CAN GET IT BUT BASICALLY PEOPLE KIND OF HAVE A SMALL APARTMENT AND DOCTOR S ARE AVAILABLE IF THEY NEED THEM .
UHHUH .
I I .
AND ALLOWS .
KNOW A LADY .
THAT LIVES IN A PLACE SIMILAR .
YEAH .
TO THAT IN AUSTIN .
YEAH .
WELL THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THESE ARE THAT THEY ARE VERY EXPENSIVE .
OF COURSE I GUESS ALL NURSING HOMES .
THERE IS BUT .
AND THE BAD THING ABOUT IT BEFORE YOU CAN GET ANY KIND OF GOVERNMENT HELP YOU JUST PRACTICALLY HAVE WELL YOU HAVE TO BE A PAUPER .
RIGHT .
IT IT TAKES EVERY PENNY .
THEY WANT YOU TO SPEND EVERY DIME .
YOU HAVE .
YEAH .
BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT WILL PAY FOR YOUR YOUR CARE .
RIGHT .
AND THAT S THE SAD PART ABOUT IT .
YEAH .
I UH YEAH AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE .
WHO DO IT NOW .
IN COLORADO .
IT S INTERESTING .
I TALKED TO MY MOTHER .
THEY ALLOW YOU .
SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND YOUR CAR AND YOUR HOME .
AND MY MOTHER COULD MAKE IT ON THAT .
WHAT .
SHE PROBABLY WOULD DO IS DISBURSE THE MONEY TO ME AND THEN I WOULD SEND IT BACK TO HER SO THAT S WHAT WOULD HAPPEN .
UHHUH .
I THINK THAT S WHAT .
MOST PEOPLE DO .
YOU JUST HAVE TO GIVE IT EVERYTHING AWAY .
YEAH .
IT S UNFORTUNATE .
I I WORK AT A BROKERAGE FIRM AND I HAVE SEEN SO MANY PEOPLE .
THAT JUST HAVE TO GIFT YOU KNOW THEIR BELONGINGS .
RIGHT .
AS MUCH AS THEY CAN EACH YEAR IN ANTICIPATION OF HAVING TO MOVE TO A NURSING HOME .
YEAH .
IT S FRIGHTENING .
AND I GUESS UH I DO NT KNOW HOW OLD YOU ARE .
I M FORTYSIX .
YOU KNOW WE RE THE GENERATION MOVING INTO THIS AND I DO NT KNOW HOW OUR KIDS ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF US .
I CA NT IMAGINE .
YOU KNOW .
I M TWENTYNINE .
YEAH .
AND EVERYBODY IN MY FAMILY HAS ALWAYS HAD WE DO NT HAVE ANY CHILDREN .
EVERYBODY .
THAT HAS HAS THEM LATER IN LIFE .
YEAH .
SO MY MY MOTHER AND MY FATHER ARE IN THEIR LATE SIXTIES .
SO I MEAN THEY RE NOT .
RIGHT .
THAT FAR AWAY .
I ALSO SEE ON MY GENERATION .
A SQUEEZE BETWEEN LOOKING TO HAVING TO HELP MY PARENTS AND STILL HAVING TO HELP MY SON BECAUSE THINGS ARE SO ROUGH OUT THERE JOB WISE AND HE S STILL LIVING AT HOME AND I DO NT KNOW HOW HE IS EVER GOING TO GET ON HIS OWN THE WAY THINGS ARE .
OH I KNOW .
AND SO IT S KIND OF YOU FEEL SQUEEZED IN THE MIDDLE OF HAVING BOTH .
GENERATIONS BUT IT SOMETHING WILL HAVE TO CHANGE AS MORE AND MORE OF US GET OLDER .
UH LUCKILY IF WE COULD BE LIKE YOUR GRANDMOTHER I UH YOU KNOW I WOULD LOVE TO LIVE TO A HUNDRED AND TWO IF I WERE OKAY .
BUT .
IT BUT YEAH .
YOU SEE THESE PEOPLE IN THEIR SEVENTIES .
MOST PEOPLE ARE NT .
YEAH MOST ARE NT .
THAT S THE PROBLEM .
AND THAT S THE BAD THING .
I WOULD HATE TO HAVE LIVED SO LONG .
SHE LIVED BY HERSELF .
MY GRANDFATHER PASSED AWAY BEFORE I WAS BORN SO SHE LIVED BY HERSELF UP UNTIL SHE WAS NINETY NINETYONE .
THAT S INCREDIBLE .
AND JUST DID EVERYTHING .
DO YOU SEE AS UH THE CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN THE LAST MUMBLEX BEVERLY .
I THINK ONE OF THE THING THAT I NOTICE A LOT I KNOW IT S TOUCHING SOCIAL CHANGES BUT UH TO ME WHAT BECOMES SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE AND I I DO NT KNOW IF IT S A FACTOR OF ME GROWING OLDER AND SEEING THINGS THROUGH DIFFERENT EYES OR IF IT S A FACTOR OF OUR SOCIETY ACTUALLY MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION BUT I NOTICE THINGS ON T V BEING MORE UM OPEN MORE I BELIEVE UH THEY PORTRAY THINGS ON T V OBVIOUSLY THAT THEY NEVER WOULD HAVE YEARS AGO AND YOU KNOW AND SPECIFICALLY NUDITY THINGS LIKE THAT UH I DO NT KNOW I I VE SAID SEVERAL TIMES TO MY HUSBAND THAT I FEEL LIKE GEE IN TEN YEARS THEY LL HAVE JUST FULL NUDITY ON T V AND NOBODY WILL THINK ANYTHING OF IT AND TO ME THAT S SURPRISING TO ME THAT S THAT S A BIG CHANGE TO ACCEPT IT AND IT COMES ACROSS I THINK SUBTLY YOU KNOW A LITTLE AT A TIME TO WHERE YOU GET SO USED TO SEEING A LITTLE CHANGE THAT YOU KNOW WHEN THEY GO ONE STEP FURTHER YOU DO NT NOTICE IT THAT MUCH THAT S ONE OF THE BIGGEST ONES I VE SEEN .
HUH YEAH THAT S A BIG ONE .
WHAT ABOUT YOU .
WELL I THINK THAT SOCIETY HAS COME TO A POINT WHERE THEY RE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OF THEIR ACTIONS SOMEBODY ELSE UH MADE THEM DO IT UH THAT S WHAT I SEEM TO SEE A LOT OF THAT UH NO ONE IS WILLING TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR LIFE AND THEIR CHOICES IT S RATHER SUE THESE GUYS BECAUSE THEY MADE A FOO UH A SEAT BELT THAT DID NT WORK RIGHT OR .
UHHUH .
UH THAT S WHAT I THINK IS A BIG ONE .
I TEND TO AGREE WITH YOU AND I THINK THERE S A LOT OF THAT UM YEAH WE HAVE BECOME LAWSUIT HAPPY ANY LITTLE THING IT S LIKE LET S SEE WHAT I CAN GET DO NT YOU THINK THAT MAYBE A LOT OF THAT CAME FROM UM OH YOU KNOW THE THE THE ERA WE WENT THROUGH THAT WAS LIKE YOU KNOW HEY IF IT MAKES YOU HAPPY DO IT YOU KNOW KIND OF LIKE DISREGARD TO OTHERS DO WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY AND AND YES WE SHOULD TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES YOU KNOW AND WE SHOULD SEE TO OUR OWN LIVES BUT NOT TO A TOTAL DISREGARD OF OTHERS UM I DO NT KNOW I THINK IT S COME TO THAT A LOT I SEE IT A LOT IN MY DAUGHTER I HAVE A FOUR YEAR OLD .
UHHUH .
AND HERS IS NT A SOCIAL THING AS MUCH AS IT S A STAGE THEY GO THROUGH BUT WHENEVER SOMETHING HAPPENS IT S YOU MADE ME HIT THAT YOU MADE ME DO THIS AND SO I TRY TO TELL HER MUMBLEX EVERYTHING IS NT ALWAYS SOMEBODY ELSE S FAULT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO WATCH WHERE YOU RE GOING AND .
SURE .
AND SO IT S WHAT YOU JUST SAID KIND OF HITS HOME TO ME JUST THROUGH HER SO .
YEAH AND ANOTHER THING I THINK HAS CHANGED QUITE A BIT IS UH THE ROLES THAT MEN AND WOMEN PLAY THAT S REALLY IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS HAS CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY .
I THINK YOU RE RIGHT UM IN YOUR OPINION GOOD OR BAD OR BOTH .
WELL BOTH YOU KNOW THERE S SOME GREAT THINGS THAT UH HAVE COME ABOUT WITH MORE EQUALITY BUT I THINK THAT ALSO I DO NT KNOW WHAT S CAUSING SOCIETY TO HAVE SO MANY BROKEN FAMILIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT S BAD FOR US .
I DO TOO I THINK PART OF THAT I DO NT KNOW I THINK THE ROLE OF WOMEN CHANGING HAS BEEN GOOD IN THAT WOMEN ARE FEELING LIKE IN TERMS OF THEIR SELF CONFID CONFIDENCE THEIR SELF WORTH YOU KNOW I CAN DO SOMETHING I CAN BE SOMEBODY YOU KNOW IF I PUT MY MIND TO IT I CAN ACCOMPLISH THINGS TOO AND I THINK THAT S GOOD BUT UM I THINK WHEN YOU PUSH YOU KNOW MAYBE I THINK WHEN THAT WAS FIRST TRYING COME ABOUT WITH YOU KNOW WHAT WE KNOW AS THE WOMEN S LIB MOVEMENT .
UHHUH .
I THINK IT WAS TOO EXTREME UM I THINK YOU CAN BE FEMININE AND STILL BE ALL THOSE OTHER THINGS TOO YOU KNOW AND I THINK THERE S DEFINITE ROLES AND I THINK YOU KNOW PART OF THE BREAK UP OF THE FAMILY MAYBE IT S BECAUSE OF THE THE THE SOCIAL CHANGES I DO NT KNOW THE FACT THAT UH DURING THEIR EARLY CHANGES WHERE YOU KNOW WOMEN DID COME MORE SPEAK MAYBE SPEAK OUT I WAS GOING TO SAY COME MORE OUT OF THEMSELVES BUT SPEAK OUT I THINK A LOT OF MEN WERE THREATENED BY THAT I THINK NOW LESS MEN ARE YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY RE USED TO IT IT S AROUND THEM UM BUT I I DO NT KNOW I I I DO NT KNOW WHY THE FAMILIES ARE BREAKING UP I THINK THAT MAY GO BACK TO WHAT YOU SAID A MINUTE AGO ABOUT PEOPLE NOT BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THEMSELVES OR THEIR ACTIONS BECAUSE IT S LIKE THEY DO NT GO INTO THE MARRIAGE WITH A COMMITMENT THAT THIS IS GOING TO WORK THEY GO IN AND SAY WELL HEY YOU KNOW I LL STICK WITH IT WHILE IT S GOOD AND THEN I LL GET OUT AND I I I THINK THAT DIRECTLY AFFECTS THE EFFORT THAT YOU PUT INTO THAT MARRIAGE OR THAT COMMITMENT .
YEAH I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU UH .
IN IN THE LIGHT OF WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING LATELY WITH THE DOCTORS THAT I KNOW AND LAWYERS AND WHATNOT I THINK NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE IS A WAY TO THROW A LOT OF MONEY AT A VERY SMALL PROBLEM .
DO YOU WHY .
WHY WELL IF YOU TOOK HALF THE MONEY THAT THEY WOULD SPEND IN THE STATE OF TEXAS FOR HEALTH INSURANCE AND GAVE IT TO QUALIFIED STUDENTS TO SO THEY COULD BECOME DOCTORS THE PROBLEM WOULD GO AWAY .
YOU THINK THE PROBLEM IS NOT ENOUGH DOCTORS .
I THINK THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE DOCTOR V DOCTORS HAVE CONSPIRED TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF DOCTORS AND THAT THE LAWYERS HAVE CONSPIRED TO MAKE SURE THAT IF YOU ARE A DOCTOR YOU ARE GOING TO PAY HIGH PREMIUMS ON YOUR H UH UNEMP I MEAN ON YOUR LIABILITY .
GOSH I REALLY HAVE A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW ON THIS .
OH .
WELL BECAUSE I M A NURSE .
UHHUH .
FOR ONE THING .
AND YOU THINK THERE ARE PLENTY OF DOCTORS .
OH YEAH I DO NT THINK THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF DOCTORS AND I DO KNOW THAT O B WHICH IS MY FIELD .
UHHUH .
THE DOCTORS HEALTH IN THE DOCTORS MALPRACTICE INSURANCE IS OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR .
IT S ASTRONOMICAL .
THAT DELIVER BABIES NOW THEY CA NT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT THAT I DO NT THINK THEY RE IN A CONSPIRACY I THINK IT S OUR FAULT BECAUSE WE AS PEOPLE JUST SUE THEM .
NO PEOPLE DO NT SUE .
PEOPLE ARE VERY SUE SUE CONSCIOUS .
LAWYERS SUE IF YOU PUT A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR CAP ON THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT A LAWYER COULD MAKE FROM A LAW SUIT AGAINST A DOCTOR .
YEAH .
THEY WOULD NT SUE A ONE OF THEM .
WELL THAT S PROBABLY TRUE TOO .
YOU KNOW .
BUT PEOPLE ARE VERY CONSCIOUS OF HOW MUCH MONEY THEY CAN GET REAL FAST THESE DAYS .
WELL SURE .
AND SO .
BUT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT REASONABLENESS NOW I BELIEVE THAT A LAW SUIT SHOULD HAVE SOME FOUNDATION IN THE TORT THEORY YOU KNOW WHAT TORT THEORY IS .
NO .
WELL A TORT IS WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING WRONG .
RIGHT .
WELL IT UH AN O B G Y N DOCTOR CAN NOT CONTROL THE FETUS IN THE WOMB A HUNDRED PERCENT .
THAT S RIGHT .
IF THE BABY IS BORN DEAD WELL THAT HAPPENS .
WELL .
IF IF THEY HAVE COMPLICATIONS AND .
IT DEPENDS .
WELL I KNOW I MEAN THERE ARE GUYS THAT ARE REAL SLOBS BUT YOU KNOW THERE ARE ALSO PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT ARE REALLY DOING THEIR JOB AND THE PEOPLE THAT ARE REALLY DOING THEIR JOB ARE PAYING FOR EVERYBODY ELSE .
WELL THAT S TRUE THEY ARE .
YOU KNOW .
BECAUSE DOCTORS ARE PERFORMING MANY MORE TESTS .
MANY OF THEM ARE UNNECESSARY THEY ARE DOING SO MANY C SECTIONS .
JUST TO PREVENT A .
JUST TO .
A LAW SUIT .
PREVENT BECAUSE THEY HAVE ALL THESE MONITORS NOW AND IF ANYTHING LOOKS EVEN A LITTLE BIT FUNNY .
YEAH .
THEIR ONLY SAFETY PRECAUTION IS TO GO IN AND GET THAT BABY AND .
YEAH .
SO IT S COSTING MORE ALL AROUND IN HEALTH INSURANCE .
UHHUH .
FOR TESTS FOR SURGERY FOR LONGER HOSPITAL STAY .
SEE I BELIEVE .
SO IT S TERRIBLE .
THAT THERE THERE IS A SYSTEM ALREADY IN PLACE FOR HEALTH CARE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THEY HAVE INDIGENT HEALTH CARE YOU SHOW UP AT PARKLAND BLEEDING .
YOU LL GET IT .
AND THEY LL FIX YOU .
THAT S TRUE .
YOU KNOW .
IN FACT YOU LL GET IT AT PRESBYTERIAN IF YOU SHOW UP THERE TOO .
YEAH .
AND WE HAVE THAT HAPPEN WE HAVE PATIENTS THAT GO THROUGH PARKLAND .
UHHUH .
THROUGH THE CLINIC AND AT THE LAST MINUTE THEY COME TO US WELL .
UHHUH .
UH WE CA NT TURN THEM AWAY SO .
YEAH I THINK THAT IF YOU JUST WROTE THE LAWYERS OUT OF THE EQUATION .
YEAH .
THE PROBLEM WOULD PRETTY MUCH EVAPORATE .
I M FOR THAT I VE BEEN THROUGH A TWO YEAR DIVORCE WHERE THE ONLY ONE THAT CAME OUT AHEAD WAS MY LAWYER SO .
YEAH .
I D LIKE TO WIPE THEM ALL OUT .
WELL I I HAPPEN TO KNOW A FEW AND I EVEN CLAIM ONE AS A FRIEND .
HE S A DIVORCE ATTORNEY .
BUT .
HE BETTER NOT BE MINE .
I THINK HE LL GO NAMELESS FOR THE FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS CONVERSATION BUT I ALSO KNOW AN UH O B G Y N WHO HAS STOPPED PRACTICING .
YEAH SOME THEY DO .
UH HE JUST SAID .
THEY STOP THEIR O B AT LEAST .
YEAH I MEAN HE S NOT GOING TO DELIVER ANY MORE BABIES .
RIGHT .
EVER .
RIGHT .
HIS MALPRACTICE WAS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR .
THAT S INCREDIBLE .
AND YOU KNOW HE SAID I HAD TO HE HAD TO EAR GROSS TWO MILLION TO TAKE HOME AS MUCH AS HIS MALPRACTICE .
YEAH AND MOST OF THEM ARE VERY SINCERE MOST OF THEM DO THE .
YEAH .
BEST THEY CAN THEY ARE HUMAN .
THIS .
OCCASIONALLY .
THIS GUY IS CATHOLIC .
SOMETHING WILL GO WRONG .
YEAH I MEAN YOU KNOW .
WELL YOU CAN BE HUMAN AND CATHOLIC .
YEAH I KNOW YOU CAN BE HUMAN AND CATHOLIC .
BUT YOU RE NOT LIKELY TO FIND SOMEBODY WHO IS GOING TO YOU KNOW HAVE A LESS CONSCIENTIOUS EFFORT .
YEAH NO .
I MEAN .
MOST OF THEM DO I REALLY BELIEVE THAT FROM DEALING WITH DOCTORS DEALING WITH LAWYERS THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND WHO IS MORE CONSCIENTIOUS .
WELL YOU KNOW WHO IS GETTING RICH INSURANCE COMPANIES .
YEAH THEY ARE .
YOU KNOW IF YOU WERE ABLE TO WRITE A MALPRACTICE INSURANCE THAT WOULD NEGATE ANY FINANCIAL OBLIGATION ON THE PART OF THE DOCTOR OVER AND ABOVE THE INSURANCE SAY SAY YOU HAVE MALPRACTICE INSURANCE AND A KID DIES OR IS MALFORMED OR .

OH I SEE OH I I DID NT REALLY KNOW THAT I KNOW A LOT OF THEIR OH THEIR COUNTRIES THAT THEY HAD OVERTAKEN OR WANTED TO BE INDEPENDENT OR SEVERAL OF THEM RIGHT .
YEAH .
AND UH WHAT ABOUT ASTONIA ARE THEY .
THEY RE COMPLETELY OUT NOW .
RIGHT I THOUGHT THEY WERE .
YES THE THREE THE THREE BALTIC UH REPUBLICS GOT OUT AS QUICKLY AS THEY COULD .
BUT BUT THE THE UKRAINE IS ESPECIALLY SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT OF THE AGRICULTURE .
RIGHT IT S IT S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE ECONOMICS OF THE WHOLE OF THE SOVIET UNION .
UH SO THERE WERE PROBABLY REALLY FIGHT TO KEEP IT IN IF THEY COULD .
RIGHT UH EXCEPT THEY CA NT FIGHT .
NO THEY DO NT .
IT S DONE DEMOCRATICALLY UH .
AND BUSH HAS ALREADY GIVEN HIS OPINION ON IT RIGHT .

MY MY DRESS FOR WORK UH MOST OF THE TIME IS UH RATHER COMFORTABLE AND CASUAL .
UHHUH .
UH USUALLY UH SLACKS AND A SOFT COLORED SHIRT .
THE UM THING .
THAT THAT DISTINGUISHES ME .
A LOT OF THE TIME WHEN I HAVE TO DRESS REAL PROFESSIONALLY FOR A MEETING OR SOMETHING IS I WEAR A CLERICAL COLLAR .

TODAY TODAY .
WE WE WEAR COATS AND .
DID YOU .
AS THE DAY UH WARMS UP WE MAY GO TO LIGHT JACKETS BUT I DO NT THINK THERE S AN ESCAPE FROM LIGHT JACKETS .
I UNDERSTAND .
THE WIND WILL TAKE AWAY A LOT OF BODY HEAT .
WELL SO ARE THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU UM DRESSING SIMILAR TO YOU .
VERY SIMILAR .
UHHUH SO YOU DO NT HAVE TO YOU DO NT HAVE TO BUY THE LOT OF THE WARDROBE THAT SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN BANKING AND THAT KIND OF THING DO .

WELL THAT S GOOD .
KIND OF A UH SITUATION .
THAT S GOOD .
AS I SAY UNLESS IT HAPPENS TO BE NOW YESTERDAY I HAD TO DRESS UP AND .
UHHUH .
AND UH BE MORE FORMAL BECAUSE I HAD A A FORMAL MEETING AT NOON TIME BUT THEN I CAN GO HOME LATER IN THE DAY AND AND BE A LITTLE .
MORE CASUAL .
WELL THAT S WONDERFUL .
AND THEN IF I HAVE A A MEETING OF PEOPLE THAT I KNOW I CAN BE VERY CASUAL IN THE EVENING .
WELL MY HUSBAND HAS TO TAKE THE BUS INTO DALLAS AND DOES NT RETURN ALL DAY SO HE HAS TO DRESS AND HE JUST REALLY HATES IT THEY HAVE THE LONG SLEEVE SHIRTS AND THE WHOLE TIE AND THE WHOLE SUIT AND EVEN WHEN HIS JOB IS NOT GOING TO BE WITH PEOPLE ALL DAY LONG HE SAID IT S JUST PART OF THE UNIFORM AND THE EXPECTED IMAGE THAT THEY HAVE TO DRESS .
YEAH THAT S AROUND HERE IN A LOT OF PLACES .
THAT S THE WAY .
IT IS .
UHHUH .
I MEAN THERE THERE ARE EX EXPECTED UH DRESS CODES .
UHHUH .
AND THE PEOPLE NEED TO FOLLOW THAT .
I THINK UH YEARS AGO I USED TO BE FAR MORE UH COMMITTED TO THE IDEA OF OF A DRESS CODE .
UHHUH .
BUT I VE RELAXED A LOT MORE AS I VE GOTTEN OLDER AND BECOME MORE COMFORTABLE WITH MYSELF .
WELL I THINK THAT S I THINK THAT S GREAT .
I THINK THAT S GOOD .
IT S TAKEN A LONG TIME TO BREAK AWAY .
FROM FROM THAT .
I UNDERSTAND .
BUT NOW THAT I VE BROKEN AWAY FROM IT I M I M GLAD I HAVE .
WELL ANOTHER INTERESTING THING ON THE OUR OUR END HERE IS HOW EVEN IN MY FORTIES HOW MUCH YOUNGER I DRESS THAN MY MOTHER WOULD HAVE IN HER FORTIES AND I WILL RUN AROUND TO THE STORE IN THINGS IN SLACKS AND TENNIS SHOES AND SHE .
YOU MEAN YOU DO NT NEED TO WEAR LITTLE OLD HOUSE DRESSES ANY MORE .
RIGHT AND PEARLS AND SHE WOULD NOT HAVE EVEN PROBABLY OWNED A PAIR OF TENNIS SHOES AFTER SHE GOT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL .
SO UH SHE TELLS ME .
I DRESS YOUNG BUT THAT S OKAY MUMBLEX .
THAT S A GOOD IDEA THAT S A GOOD IDEA .
WELL THERE S NOT A LOT MORE I CAN THINK OF TO DISCUSS ON CLOTHING .
NO THERE YOU KNOW .
MUMBLEX I GUESS THIS IS WHAT .
YOU CALL A NATURAL END .
YEAH WHAT KIND WHAT KIND OF SHOES DO THEY WEAR DOWN THERE .
WELL WE WEAR OF COURSE LIKE I SAID IF MY HUSBAND S GOING DOWNTOWN HE S GOT THE WHOLE UH YOU KNOW THE DRESS MEN S DRESS SHOES .
UHHUH .
BUT FOR AS OUT HERE JUST ANYTHING THAT THE MOMS WE .
ALL KIND OF HAVE OUR OWN LITTLE DRESS CODE OF JUST EITHER TENNIS SHOES OR LITTLE LOAFERS AND AND UH TIGHTS AND THINGS .
THAT FEEL COMFORTABLE TO US AROUND OUR KIDS .
WE WE CAN WEAR PRETTY MUCH THAT ALTHOUGH UM TENNIS SHOES ARE KIND OF OUT .
YEAH I M SURE THEY ARE THERE .
IN IN ALMOST EVERY EVERY SITUATION .
YEAH I M SURE THEY ARE .
UNLESS YOU WANT TO LOOK LIKE A GOOK .
THAT S RIGHT I M SURE THAT TRUE .
IT S A LOT DIFFERENT THAN WORKING IN A KIDS PRESCHOOL .
A LOT DIFFERENT .
THAT S RIGHT .
WELL YOU .
ALL HAVE A NICE DAY THERE .
YOU TOO AND THANK YOU FOR CALLING .
THANK YOU VERY MUCH .
UHHUH .
BYEBYE .
BYE .
OKAY WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM .
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WELL LIKE IN THIS PART OF TOWN SEEMS TO BE THE ATTITUDE AND THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE SCHOOLS .
UHHUH .
THAT UH YOU KNOW YOU CAN THROW MONEY AT IT BUT IT S I DO NT KNOW TO ME .
IT SEEMS LIKE THE SCHOOLS ARE REFLECTING SOCIETY IN A BIGGER WAY .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW BECAUSE I MEAN THE GENERAL VALUES THAT WE RE TEACHING .
YEAH .
KIND OF CONFLICT WITH WHAT .
WE EXPECT OUT OF PEOPLE IN SCHOOL I MEAN .
IS IT .
THE DO YOU THINK IT S THE VALUES THAT THEY RE TEACHING IN SCHOOL OR THE VALUES THEY GET FROM HOME .
UH WELL THE VALUES MORE OR LESS AT HOME AND THE T V JUST A GENERAL I MEAN LEARNING IS NOT A REVERED ENDEAVOR REALLY I MEAN IT S A LOT MORE IT S SOCIALLY WELL I WO NT SAY SOCIALLY UNACCEPTABLE BUT WHEREAS LIKE IN UH A PERSON THAT UH STUD THEY PUT A LOT MORE EMPHASIS ON ATHLETICS AND THINGS LIKE THAT ARE A LOT MORE GLORIFIED GENERALLY IN SOCIETY AND I THINK THAT CARRIES OVER TO SCHOOL .
RIGHT .
A LOT .
SO .
YEAH I I I I THINK THAT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS UH WITH THE UH WITH THE HOME ENVIRONMENT BEING PART OF IT .
YOU KNOW IF I THINK TOO MANY PARENTS EXPECT UH THE SCHOOL TO TEACH UH THE MORAL ASPECTS OF OF THINGS TO THE ST TO THE KIDS AND YOU KNOW WHILE WE RE NOT GOING TO WORRY ABOUT UH TEACHING YOU MANNERS OR TEACHING YOU RESPECT FOR ANYONE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW AND THEN EXPECT THEM TO PICK IT UP AT SCHOOL YOU RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT YOU KNOW YOU RE GOING TO CARRY CARRY WITH CARRY TO SCHOOL UH OUT INTO THE WORLD YOU KNOW WHAT .
YOU LEARNED AT HOME AND UH .
YEAH .
UH I THINK THAT THAT PART OF THAT SHOWING UP NOW YOU KNOW WITH WITH THINGS BECAUSE KIDS I THINK HAVE PROBABLY LESS RESPECT THAN FOR FOR PEOPLE THAN IN IN OTHER THINGS THAN WE MAY HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST UH AND PART OF IT S THE THE FAMILY I THINK AND PART OF IT S UH THE LIVING CONDITIONS OF CERTAIN PEOPLE ARE SUBJECTED TOO DRUGS IS A BIG PROBLEM NOW AND I THINK THAT S THAT S THAT S ANOTHER ROOT PROBLEM .
YEAH YEAH YOU KNOW I WONDER IF THAT S A ROOT PROBLEM OR NOT BECAUSE I THINK ABOUT THAT A LOT AND IT S JUST LIKE EVERYBODY LIKES TO BLAME EVERYTHING ON DRUGS NOW BUT I WONDER YOU KNOW DO YOU GET THE OH THAT S KIND OF SIDE TRACKED BUT UH I JUST REMEMBER SEEING ON THE NEWS .
THE OTHER NIGHT THEY HAD THE THING ABOUT HOW CATHOLIC SCHOOLS ARE DOING SO MUCH BETTER .
UHHUH .
I THOUGHT WELL YOU KNOW OF COURSE .
THEY RE DOING BETTER AND NOT SO MUCH WHEN I WAS GROWING UP CATHOLIC SCHOOLS ARE GENERALLY CONSIDERED A LITTLE BIT EASIER THAN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS BUT UH THEY STILL HAD A A BETTER SUCCESS RATE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY STARTED WITH A LOT BETTER RAW MATERIAL .
I MEAN EVERYBODY .
THAT WENT TO A CATHOLIC SCHOOL HAD UH AT LEAST THE PARENTS DID AT LEAST HAD EDUCATION AS A PRIORITY .
RIGHT .
LIKE YOU SAID .
RIGHT .
AND KIND OF HAD A WHOLE CONDUCIVE ATMOSPHERE TO IT .
AND I WONDER IF NOT SO MUCH THAT UH .
WELL I THINK IT S LIKE YOU SAY IT S IT S THE SOCIOECONOMIC MIX THERE YOU KNOW THE THEY RE YOU LOOK AT THE SCHOOLS LIKE THAT WHERE YOU VE GOT A LOT OF KIDS .
WHO ARE BASICALLY UH THAT MIGHT BE MORE WELL TO WELL OFF YOU KNOW GOING TO A PRIVATE CATHOLIC SCHOOL OR WHATEVER UH AND AND THEY RE NOT ALL THAT WAY BUT YOU KNOW SOME .
THAT ARE .
YEAH .
UM THAT THEY RE THEY RE NOT QUITE THE SAME AS THE KIDS .
THAT ARE GOING TO THE INNER CITY UH YOU KNOW PUBLIC SCHOOLS .
YEAH THIS IS INTERESTING BECAUSE IN MY MIND .
I DO NT HAVE THE STEREOTYPE OF A CATHOLIC SCHOOL BEING A SUBURBAN KIND OF ENVIRONMENT BUT UH THIS THIS WAS ACTUALLY INNER CITY .
YEAH .
PEOPLE WERE SENDING I MEAN JUST BECAUSE THEIR KIDS HAD THE ABILITY AND THE AND THE DRIVE TO DO TRY AND GET AN EDUCATION THEY DID NT SEND HIM TO A PUBLIC SCHOOL YOU KNOW LIKE YOU SAID YOU HAVE THE DRUG PROBLEM AND JUST THE GENERAL ATMOSPHERE WHERE YOU RE PRESSURED NOT TO LEARN IN INSTANCE .
YEAH WELL YOU KNOW IN A LOT OF CASES LIKE THAT WHERE YOU KNOW IF KIDS ARE GOING TO A PUBLIC PAROCHIAL SCHOOL LIKE THAT IT S IT S BECAUSE THE PARENTS ARE MORE INTERESTED IN THEM RECEIVING AN EDUCATION .
IT SHOWS I THINK IT SHOWS THAT THE PARENTS HAVE SOME UH DESIRE FOR FOR THE KID TO DO DO WELL YOU KNOW AND THAT MAY BE PASSED ON DOWN TO THE KID AS WELL AND UH MAYBE THEY PICK UP ON THAT .
YEAH .
AND THEN FROM THE OTHER ASPECT UM MAYBE THE UH SCHOOL .
ITSELF HAS HAS HAS MORE EMPHASIS ON UH TRYING TO DO A GOOD JOB BECAUSE THE CLASSES MAY BE SMALLER UH THEY MAY BE ABLE TO TO GIVE THE RESOURCES .
THAT S NEEDED TO UH TO DO A GOOD JOB .
YEAH I MEAN AND WHAT DO YOU WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO FIX THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS .
UH THAT S A TOUGH QUESTION .
YEAH .
HOW TO FIX THE SCHOOL SYSTEM .
UH WITH UH I WOULD TRY TO I GUESS TO SEE ABOUT GETTING PARENTS MORE INVOLVED WITH TRY TO TO COME UP WITH MORE WAYS TO DO THAT .
UH UH UH STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION TO BOTH .
BOTH .
THE PARENTS AND THE STUDENTS AND UH MORE MORE CLASSES THAT I THINK THAT ARE AND I THINK THIS IS HAPPENING SOME AROUND THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF UM MORALS TRYING TO TEACH THE KINDS OF THINGS .
THAT THAT ARE NT GETTING TAUGHT AT HOME AND UH AND AND RESPECT FOR OTHER PEOPLE .
UH I THINK THAT S A BIG PART OF IT .
YOU KNOW PEOPLE YOU KNOW IF YOU DO NT CARE ABOUT PROPERTY AND PEOPLE YOU KNOW YOU RE NOT GOING TO CARE ABOUT UH ABOUT LEARNING I THINK .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW YOU RE NOT GOING TO REALLY CARE ABOUT YOURSELF .
YEAH .
THAT S WHAT .
I WAS GOING TO SAY .
IT S THE CHICKEN AND THE EGG THING .
I WONDER A LOT OF TIMES YOU KNOW PEOPLE I MEAN A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE LITERALLY TEAR APART THEIR OWN SCHOOLS .
RIGHT .
VANDALISM WISE AND YOU GET I MEAN IT S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I BEEN IN HIGH SCHOOL .
THEY RE EVEN IN GRADE SCHOOL WHEN THEY DO THAT .
BUT I CA NT REMEMBER EXACTLY WHAT GOES THROUGH THEIR HEAD WHEN THEY RE DOING THAT .
BUT YOU GOT TO THINK IN A WAY .
IT S KIND OF A OUTWARD SHOWING OF THAT THEY DO NT THINK THEY HAVE A CHANCE OF DOING ANYTHING AND TAKE IT OUT ON THE SCHOOL .
WELL YOU KNOW AND I THAT S NOT AN EA BUT THAT S NOT AN EASY TASK YOU KNOW THAT S WHY I SAY IT S IT S A TOUGH QUESTION .
WHAT WOULD YOU DO BECAUSE YOU KNOW EVEN TRYING TO INSTILL THOSE VALUES IS KIND OF HARD WHEN UH WHEN WHEN YOU RE GROWING UP IN YOU KNOW IN A HOME .
WHICH MAY BE UH JUST THE PITS AND UH YOU DO NT HAVE ANY ANY KIND OF A GOOD ENVIRONMENT TO LIVE IN YOU KNOW IT S KIND OF HARD TO SAY WELL YOU NEED TO TAKE CARE OF OTHER PEOPLE S STUFF AS WELL WHEN YOU RE WHEN YOU BARELY HAVE ANYTHING .
YOURSELF .
SO .
YEAH .
I COULD SEE WHERE THAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM AND I THINK THAT S I THINK IT S .
UM .
SO YOU HAVE A SON .
I HAVE AN OLDER SON YEAH HE DOES NT HAVE ANY CHILDREN YET THOUGH .
UHHUH .
UH HE S THIRTYSEVEN AND I DO NT KNOW IF HE S EVER GOING TO HAVE ANY OR NOT BUT I DO HAVE SOME NEIGHBOR KIDS LOTS OF LITTLE NEIGHBOR KIDS .
UHHUH .
THAT I GO OUT AND UH I PLAY BALL WITH THEM YOU KNOW IT S BECAUSE LIKE THIS ONE THAT LIVES RIGHT NEXT DOOR HER MOTHER DOES SOME WORK AT HOME .
UHHUH .
ON COMPUTERS .
UHHUH .
AND IT JUST SEEMS LIKE SHE DOES NT HAVE ANY TIME FOR HER WHICH IS KIND OF SAD YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
SO THE KIDS ARE KIND OF HUNGRY FOR SOMEONE TO PLAY WITH THEM SO I WILL GO OUT AND PLAY CATCH WITH THEM OR YOU KNOW WE HA LET THE DOGS OUTSIDE AND THEY WILL ROLL AROUND ON THE GROUND AND PLAY WITH THE DOGS BUT UH ACTUALLY I DO THINK THAT THE PARENTS SHOULD HAVE YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO SPEND WITH THEIR KIDS .
I WOULD THINK SO WHEN YOU WHEN WHEN YOUR SON WAS AT HOME DID YOU UH WORKING DID YOU WORK OR WERE YOU ABLE TO STAY AT HOME WITH HIM .
NO WHEN MY SON WAS AT HOME I I DID WORK AND THEN HE WENT TO A BABY SITTER THAT THIS LADY HAD ABOUT FIVE OTHER KIDS THAT SHE BABY SAT YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
BUT WE ALWAYS HAD OUR DAYS OFF TOGETHER AND WE WENT CAMPING ON VACATIONS SO WE HAD A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER THAT WAY YOU KNOW .
YEAH WELL WHEN MY MOM UH WHEN I WAS GROWING UP MY MOM WORKED TOO BUT SHE WORKED NIGHTS .
UHHUH .
AND UH AS A NURSE AND SO SHE WAS ALWAYS HOME FOR US .
UHHUH .
AND I ALWAYS I REALLY APPRECIATED THAT HAVING HER THERE WHEN I WAS YOU KNOW WHEN I CAME HOME FROM SCHOOL AND WHEN I WORKED BUT NOW WHEN I LOOK BACK AT IT IT MUST HAVE BEEN A REALLY DIFFICULT THING THAT SHE DID .
YEAH .
FOR US .
OH YEAH WELL I AM SURE IT WAS YOU KNOW BUT UH I DO NT KNOW WHAT THE FAMILIES ARE GOING TO COME TO NOW DAYS BECAUSE THEY THERE JUST DOES NT SEEM LIKE THEY DO HAVE TIME FOR THEIR KIDS BECAUSE MOST MOST OF THEM THE FATHER AND MOTHER BOTH WORK YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
SO IT S REALLY ROUGH UH I HAVE ONE NEIGHBOR THAT S UH THE FATHER IS A FIREMAN AND HE WORKS LIKE FOUR DAYS ON AND IT SEEMS LIKE HE IS SUPPOSE TO COME HOME FOR LIKE THREE OR FOUR DAYS BUT HE CA NT MAKE ENOUGH AS A FIREMAN TO SUPPORT HIS FAMILY YOU KNOW SO HE S GOT A SECOND JOB .
UM .
SO HE S YOU KNOW HE S NOT HOME VERY OFTEN .
YEAH .
AND THAT S YOU KNOW THE KIDS I KNOW MISS THAT .
THEY REALLY DO .
YOU KNOW .
UH A FAMILY WITHOUT A FATHER IT S IT S UH A REALLY HARD THING .
YEAH YOU KNOW AND I DO NT KNOW I I SUPPOSE THEY ARE TRYING TO GET THROUGH TO THEM THAT WELL DADDY IS NOT HOME BECAUSE YOU KNOW HE IS OUT WORKING TRYING TO MAKE SOME MONEY FOR YOU KNOW WE CAN BUY YOU THIS BIKE AND THAT TOY AND SO FORTH YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
BUT UH .
KIDS I THINK WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE DAD THERE THAN THE TOY ANYWAY .
OH I AM SURE THEY WOULD YOU KNOW SO ARE YOU PLANNING ON TO HAVING ANY CHILDREN OR .
OH YEAH OH YEAH .
UHHUH .
UHHUH BUT WE ARE WE JUST GOT MARRIED LIKE LIKE DECEMBER SO WE ARE GOING TO WAIT A YEAR .
UM YEAH .
AND .
WELL THAT S GOOD .
THEN WE WILL TRY .
THAT S WHAT MY UH DAUGHTERINLAW TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE KIDS PROBABLY AFTER TWO YEARS OF MARRIAGE .
UHHUH .
AND THEY WILL BE MARRIED NINE YEARS .
THIS YEAR SO I DO NT KNOW SHE S A NURSE YOU KNOW AND UH SHE HAS BROTHERS AND SISTERS THAT HAS GOT LOTS OF LITTLE KIDS SO MAYBE THEY JUST DECIDED THAT UH IF THEY WANTED TO HAVE KIDS AROUND THE HOUSE THEY WOULD JUST YOU KNOW CALL ONE OF THEIR SISTERS OR BROTHERS UP AND TELL THEM TO SEND THE KIDS OVER FOR THE NIGHT .
YEAH THAT S A POSSIBILITY .
YOU KNOW BUT UH .
WELL WE REALLY WANT TO HAVE A FAMILY WE FEEL LIKE THAT THAT COUPLE YOU KNOW YOU ARE NOT GIVING ENOUGH OF YOURSELF AND .
UHHUH .
YOU SHOULD YOU SHOULD BE SHARING YOUR FAMILY .
UHHUH SO .
AND GIVING YOUR VALUES YOU KNOW MAKING SOMETHING BETTER OF THE WORLD BY RAISING UP GOOD KIDS .
RIGHT .
AND LETTING THEM KNOW THEY RE LOVED AND STUFF .
RIGHT RIGHT .
GIVE THEM GIVE THEM AN EDGE BUT WE FEEL LIKE LIKE THE FIRST YEAR NEEDS TO BE DEVOTED TO UH MAKING THE FAMILY THE COUPLE STRONG .
UHHUH .
AND SECURE IN THEIR LOVE FOR EACH OTHER .
RIGHT RIGHT .
BUT THEN A FAMILY IS IS DEFINITELY A HIGH PRIORITY .
YEAH UH DO YOU PLAN ON STAYING HOME AFTER YOU HAVE YOUR CHILDREN OR DO YOU DO YOU WORK OR WHAT .
WELL WELL I UH I AM IN I AM IN A DIFFERENT SITUATION I AM A MISSIONARY .
UHHUH .
AND I AM HOME ON FURLOUGH IT CALLED LIKE I HAVE WORKED FOR FOUR YEARS IN AFRICA AND I COME HOME FOR A YEAR .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND THEN WE GO BACK FOR FOUR YEARS BUT MY HUSBAND AND I WILL DO THE SAME JOB AND WE WILL BE LIVING IN IN AFRICA AND WE WILL BE WORKING TOGETHER .
UHHUH .
SO UH WE WILL WE WILL SHARE THE JOB OF RAISING THE FAMILY I MEAN AS A MOTHER I WILL HAVE CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITIES THAT HE MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY HAVE BUT STILL WE WILL SHARE THAT JOB .
UHHUH UHHUH .
BUT WE HAVE THEN WE HAVE DECISIONS THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE THAT ARE HARD ABOUT SCHOOLING LIKE DO YOU WANT TO HOME SCHOOL YOUR KIDS ON A COMPUTER PROGRAM .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THAT KIND OF THING .
UHHUH .
OR DO YOU SEND THEM AWAY TO BOARDING SCHOOL AND IF YOU DO THAT WHEN DO YOU DO IT AND THAT S A .
THE QUESTION WAS ON LAWN AND GARDEN WORK .

I UNDERSTAND I UNDERSTAND .
BUT HOPEFULLY HOPEFULLY NEXT WEEK I LL GET BACK TO MY NORMAL ROUTINE .
OKAY UH YOU ARE INVOLVED WITH T I S UH SPEECH UM RECOGNITION .
WELL NOT REALLY I UM .
HOW DID YOU FIND OUT ABOUT IT .
I WORK AT MUMBLEX LABORATORY .

WELL THERE S INJURIES IN A LOT OF SPORT .
I UNDERSTAND THAT .
I D I .
BUT I THINK THE THEY HAPPEN MORE IN FOOTBALL I THINK THE ODDS ARE CUT DOWN .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW I I KNOW THEY CAN GET HURT IN BASEBALL TOO THE BAT IS A VERY HEAVY OBJECT CAN DO A LOT OF DAMAGE BUT UH I THINK THAT THEY HAVE A A LOWER RACIAL OF INJURIES .
UH .
RATIO OF INJURIES IN BASEBALL .
BASEBALL IT S TRUE I I WOULD SAY THAT BASEBALL TENDS TO BE ONE OF THE LESS .
BECAUSE THE .
TROUBLESOME SPORTS .
YEAH .
BUT UH FOR SOME PEOPLE IT S JUST UH UH .
A LOVE FOR THEM .
WELL THAT NOT SO MUCH THAT BUT UH EVEN IN BASEBALL YOU CAN LIKE WHEN I PLAYED BASEBALL WHEN I WAS GROWING UP I HAD TROUBLE UH UH JUST THROWING THE BALL BECAUSE I WA VERY I WAS ALWAYS VERY STRONG AND I COULD TH WHEN I WAS YOUNG I COULD THROW HARDER .

UHHUH .
HAVING TROUBLE I AND I WAS A CATCHER SO I WAS CONSTANTLY THROWING BACK TO THE PITCHER AND THEN DOWN TO SECOND BASE AND ALL AND K THAT KIND OF STUFF SO I THAT WAS ALWAYS A PROBLEM FOR ME WAS JUST JUST THE CONSTANT THROWING SO .

APPLIANCES .
APPLIANCES AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND THEY RE REAL GOOD WITH THEIR APPLIANCE AND STUFF LIKE THAT SO .
YEAH .
BUT UH WE TRY TO AVOID THEM WITH A PASSION BECAUSE OF THE PERCENT OF INTEREST RATE IF YOU VE GOT THE CASH TO PAY FOR SOMETHING IT S BETTER TO DO IT THAT WAY THAN VERSUS CREDIT CARDS UNLESS IT S A SMALL ENOUGH SUM THAT YOU CAN DO IT WITHIN A TWO THREE MONTH PERIOD BUT .
YEAH .
IF IT S UH ANY LARGE PURCHASES UH YOU VE GOT TO KIND OF THINK ABOUT UH HOW MUCH YOU RE GOING TO PUT DOWN AS FAR AS UH PAYMENTS ON IT SO THAT YOU RE NOT GETTING EIGHTEEN PERCENT OR .
RIGHT .
TWENTY PERCENT INTEREST TAKEN OFF SO .
MY MY HUSBAND AND I DO BASICALLY THE SAME THING BUT WE WE END UP SNEAKING A FEW IN THERE THAT SURPRISE US .

GOOD TALKING TO YOU .
BYE NOW .
YOU THINK ABOUT AIDS RESEARCH .
WELL AIDS IS A NASTY TERRIBLE DISEASE AND YOU DIE FROM IT SO I THINK THAT UH THEY NEED TO LOOK INTO IT AND IT S KIND OF LIKE CANCER I DO NT YOU KNOW HOW MANY YEARS HAVE WE TRIED TO FIND A CURE FOR CANCER .
UHHUH .
I THINK IT LL PROBABLY BE AS DIFFICULT UH HOW ABOUT YOURSELF .
UM WELL I M CERTAINLY IN FAVOR OF AIDS RESEARCH AND I THINK PROBABLY THE GOVERNMENT COULD SPEND A BIT MORE MONEY ON IT THAN IT DOES I THINK THAT BECAUSE BESIDES THE FACT THAT IT S A DEADLY DISEASE THAT IT S A CONTAGIOUS DISEASE SO THAT IT S UM ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT KILLING THAT MANY PEOPLE NOW IT STILL HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET OUT OF CONTROL AND BECOME A HUGE PROBLEM .
YEAH THEY SAY A MILLION PEOPLE ARE INFECTED .
UHHUH .
WITH THE H I V VIRUS AND UH YEAH I THINK .
THAT S IN THE WORLD OR IN AMERICA YOU .
UH IN THE COUNTRY AMERICA .
OH REALLY .
YEAH .
UM THAT S .
AND THEY HAVE MILLIONS .
WHOSE FIGURE IS THAT .
I DO NT KNOW I VE JUST HEARD IT ON THE RADIO .
OKAY .
SOMETIMES YOU HEAR THINGS THAT ON THE RADIO THAT YOU KNOW COULD BE TRUE OR COULD NT BE .
UHHUH .
UH DO YOU FEEL LIKE THIS IS I I GUESS THEY RE SPENDING A BILLION OR SO A YEAR ON THIS AIDS RESEARCH .
UHHUH .
DO YOU THINK THEY SHOULD SPEND MORE .
UH I I THINK THEY SHOULD ACTUALLY ALTHOUGH PROB PERHAPS NOT A AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT MORE THAN WHAT THEY RE DOING AND I DO NT NECESSARILY THINK THAT THEY SHOULD UH FUND AIDS RESEARCH AND IN THE PROCESS NEGLECT CANCER RESEARCH OR WHATEVER I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO INCREASE FUNDING FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH IN GENERAL .
WHAT DO YOU THINK DOUG OF MISTER JOHNSON .
UM .
MAGIC .
WELL I WELL I AM SORRY THAT HE HAS THE VIRUS I UM I DO NT KNOW I DO NT I THINK IT S VERY STRANGE THAT THE MEDIA HAS NT UM QUESTIONED HIM MORE STRONGLY TO ABOUT GAY SEX OR INTRAVENOUS DRUGS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT AS THEY PROBABLY WOULD FOR A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE .
DO YOU THINK HE S THE HERO THAT HE S BEING CALLED BY A BUNCH OF OTHER A BUNCH OF THE MEDIA .
UM WELL NOT NOT REALLY THOUGH I MEAN I THINK HE S PROBABLY DOING THE RIGHT THING FOR A MAN IN HIS POSITION BUT I DO NT THINK IT S ANYTHING EXCEPTIONAL THAT HE S DOING IT S WHAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE DONE ALREADY WHO WERE JUST LESS FAMOUS .
YOU KNOW I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN YOU KNOW HE CAME OUT I TALKED TO MY KIDS ABOUT IT YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
IT S SOMETHING THAT I HAD NT HAD NT DONE BEFORE .
UHHUH .
UH .
WELL THAT S GOOD .
I M GLAD THAT MISTER JOHNSON S CHANGED HIS TUNE ON UH SAFE SEX TO ABSTINENCE OR .
UHHUH .
I WAS GLAD HE DID THAT FOR YOUNG KIDS BECAUSE A LOT OF KIDS WOULD HAVE ENDED UP DYING BECAUSE OF WHAT HE WAS PROMOTING .
UHHUH .
UH LET S SEE WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER QUESTIONS UH YOU DO NT UH LET S SEE I DO NT HAVE ANY FRIENDS THAT HAVE THE DISEASE I GUESS YOU MIGHT MIGHT NOT .
UM YEAH I DO MY COUSIN DOES FOR INSTANCE .
IS IT PRETTY .
AND UM .
NASTY .
YEAH YEAH IT IS HE S ACTUALLY UM HE HAD AIDS RELATED COMPLEX FOR A WHILE AND HE IS NOW IN FULLBLOWN AIDS REALLY NOT DOING VERY WELL AND HAS A BRAIN TUMOR OR SOME THAT SORT OF THING .
YEAH IT SOUNDS AWFUL .
YEAH IT S IT S A VERY NASTY THING .
IS IT JUST THAT THE IMMUNE SYSTEM CEASES TO FUNCTION PROPERLY AND .
UM YEAH THAT S THAT S BASICALLY IT THAT UM THE IMMUNE SYSTEM CAN AT FIRST SLOW DOWN AND THE WHITE BLOOD CELL COUNT GOES DOWN WHICH IS THAT S AIDS RELATED COMPLEX BUT THEN WHEN THINGS GET COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTROL AND IT BASICALLY HITS BOTTOM THAT S AIDS .
AND .
AND IN THAT CASE YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE PRONE TO GETTING ANY KIND OF YOU KNOW WEIRD CANCER THAT ONLY ANIMALS GOT BEFORE .
OH REALLY .
AND YEAH THAT SORT OF THING .
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT .
WELL I I FEEL IN LIGHT OF SOME OF THE ACCIDENTS AND SO FORTH THAT HAVE HAPPENED LATELY THAT I THINK THERE ARE SOME OCCUPATIONS THAT THEY SHOULD SUCH AS THE HEALTH FIELD THE TRANSPORTATION FIELD UH THEY RE ALREADY DOING IT IN THE ARMED FORCES WHERE THEY HANDLE WEAPONS AND SO FORTH UH THEY DO IT TO PRISONERS .
YEAH .
SO I I UH I I I FEEL LIKE IT SHOULD BE MANDATORY IN SOME PROFESSIONS AND I THINK IF IF UH AN EMPLOYER FEELS THAT HE WANTS TO TO DRUG TEST EMPLOYEES AND THEY DO NT LIKE IT THEN THEY SHOULD NOT BE EMPLOYED THERE .
THAT WAS YOU KNOW I WOULD NOT MIND IT .
YEAH I I ESPECIALLY AGREE THAT IF IT S AN AREA WHERE THEY COULD CAUSE SOMEBODY ELSE YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
HARM OR INJURY ABSOLUTELY .
AND I DO NT HAVE A PROBLEM AT ALL WITH EMPLOYERS UH TESTING IN THE HIRING PROCESS BUT I I I DO NT I DO NT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEM TOO MUCH TESTING EVEN AFTER THE FACT BUT I DO A LITTLE BIT WHERE IT WHERE IT WOULD NT HURT ANYBODY .
I DO NT KNOW SOMETIMES I THINK THEY CARRY IT .
A LITTLE BIT TOO FAR .
UHHUH .
BUT .
UNLESS AN EMPLOYER HAS A REASON TO .
YEAH .
BELIEVE THAT HIS UH THE WORK COMPETENCY OF OF THE EMPLOY EMPLOYEE IS IS HURTING THE BUSINESS .
RIGHT .
I MEAN MAYBE IT S UH .
AND THEN IT S NOT A PROBLEM .
NUMBER ONE BECAUSE GENERALLY IF IF THEY ARE INVOLVED IN THAT TYPE OF THING .
THEY ARE INTO THEFT .
YEAH .
AND AS AN EMPLOYER I WOULD THINK THAT WOULD BE AND THE FIRST IT S NOT GOING TO BE WHOLESALE BECAUSE OF THE COST .
OH ABSOLUTELY .
THERE S NO WAY .
BUT BUT MY CONCERN IS UH SCHOOL BUS DRIVERS .
OH YEAH .
TR THE TRAIN DRIVERS .
UM I M NOT EVEN I M IN EDUCATION I M NOT EVEN OPPOSED TO IT FOR THAT .
UH I M CONCERNED IN THE MEDICAL FIELD .
YEAH .
I I I THINK THEY SHOULD SCREEN FOR ALCOHOL IN THESE AREAS TOO .
I WISH THEY WOULD .
BECAUSE I CONSIDER THAT A DRUG .
I WISH THEY WOULD AND THAT I THINK IS EVEN PROBABLY MORE WIDELY ABUSED .
RIGHT .
BY YOU KNOW THE MASSES .
RIGHT .
THAN THAN DRUGS SO TO SPEAK .
RIGHT .
SO .
BUT WHEN YOU CONSIDER THEY COULD BE DRIVING AN AIRPLANE .
OH I KNOW .
OR DRIVING A BUS OR A TRAIN UM .
AND .
AND IT DOES NT TAKE THAT LONG .
THEY DO NT HAVE TO BE TOTALLY ROARING DRUNK .
NO .
JUST A LITTLE .
JUST UH .
OFF ON THEIR TIMING .
YEAH AND .
COULD COULD MEAN LIFE .
NOW T I HAS THE RANDOM TESTING POLICY .
OH OKAY .
AND AND YOU KNOW OUR NAMES OR OUR EMPLOYEE NUMBERS OR WHATEVER ARE IN A IN A POOL .
UHHUH .
SO I VE ALREADY BEEN TESTED ONCE WHEN I WAS HIRED AND AND ONCE SINCE THEY INITIATED THIS RANDOM TESTING PROGRAM .
UHHUH UHHUH .
BUT I WORK WITH ONE GIRL .
WHO WAS TESTED HER NAME GOT GOT RANDOMLY SELECTED THREE TIMES IN SIX MONTHS .
OH MY WORD .
AND I THINK THAT S THE ONLY REASON .
I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT WHEN THERE S NO YOU KNOW THERE S NO REASON .
CONTROL .
TO SUSPECT SOMEONE YOU KNOW .
THAT THAT S GETTING A LITTLE BIT THAT S ENOUGH TO MAKE ANYBODY PARANOID .
RIGHT .
WELL AS LONG AS YOU ACCEPT THAT IT IS A RANDOM A RANDOM TESTING .
YEAH .
UH YOU KNOW TO TO ALLEVIATE THAT WAY .
YOU CA NT FEEL LIKE SOMEBODY S OUT TO GET ME .
RIGHT .
IF IT S ALMOST LIKE BEING SELECTED FOR JURY DUTY .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW SO YOUR NAME CAME OUT OF POT WHEN THEY SPUN THE WHEEL THAT S THAT S JUST THE WAY .
IT IS .
EITHER JUST THE LUCKY OR THE UNLUCKY ONE DEPENDING ON HOW YOU LOOK AT IT .
I WOULD I WOULD RATHER HAVE IT .
THAT WAY TO KNOW THAT I WAS CHOSEN AT RANDOM BY A COMPUTER THAN TO THINK THAT SOMEBODY TURNED ME IN .
OH ABSOLUTELY .
BECAUSE I I THINK THERE S WHEN YOU LET OTHER EMPLOYEES TURN IN PEOPLE .
THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WITH WITH THEIR PETTY AXES TO GRIND .
RIGHT .
IT COULD REALLY GET .
RIGHT .
OUT OF HAND .
SO I I I WOULD REALLY RATHER KNOW HOWEVER THERE S GOT TO BE SOME BACKUP TO SAY THAT IF IF SOMEBODY DOES OBSERVE YOU AT SAY AT A PARTY UH USING DRUGS .
YEAH .
I WOULD THINK THAT IT WOULD BE THEIR OBLIGATION TO REPORT THAT .
TO REPORT IT AND I GUESS YOU D REPORT THAT TO A SUPERVISOR MAYBE .
PERSONNEL OR SOMETHING .
ANONYMOUSLY OR SOMETHING .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE I I WOULD FEEL VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WORKING WITH SOMEONE .
I KNEW WAS USING EITHER ILLEGAL DRUGS OR ABUSING ALCOHOL I D JUST .
RIGHT .
I D FEEL REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE .
RIGHT .
I DO NT KNOW WHAT KIND OF WORK .
YOU DO BUT THERE THERE WOULD BE EVEN BE A SITUATION WHERE YOU WERE AT A MACHINE AND WORKING WITH SOMEBODY .
THAT WAS THAT WAY .
YEAH WE HAVE WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE .
WHO WORK ON THE LINE .
I M IN ACCOUNTING SO IT WOULD NT YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
THEY COULD NT HURT ME WITH THEIR TEN KEY OR SOMETHING BUT OUT ON THE LINE THEY VE GOT PEOPLE WORKING SOME .
RIGHT .
SERIOUS EQUIPMENT .
RIGHT .
SO .
IT S IT S I I JUST THINK EMPLOYERS HAVE TO HAVE ESPECIALLY GIVEN TODAY THE DRUG ABUSE .
THAT GOES ON I JUST THINK EMPLOYERS HAVE TO HAVE SOME KIND OF WAY TO SEE THAT THEY RE NOT BEING PUT AT .
PUT AT RISK .
RISK .
I AGREE .
BECAUSE .
TOTALLY .
THEY RE THE ONES .
WHO ARE GOING TO HAVE THE LAWSUITS THE INSURANCE CLAIMS ET CETERA AND AND I M NOT SURE BUT WHAT SOME OF THE INSURANCE CLAIMS ARE NT DUE TO UH ILLNESSES BROUGHT ON BY DRUG ABUSE OR ALCOHOL ABUSE .
AND IN THE LONG RUN WE RE ALL PAYING FOR THAT .
RIGHT .
SO IT I MEAN IT PROTECTS US IN THE LONG RUN HOPEFULLY .
RIGHT .
WHEN THEY DO THAT .
I I WAS TRYING TO REMEMBER THERE WAS A COURT CASE UH HERE WHERE I LIVE JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO .
THE CITY WORKERS THEY WANTED TO UM THE CITY GOVERNMENT WANTED TO INSTITUTE THE RANDOM DRUG TESTING .
UH .
AND THE CITY WORKERS UH TOOK THEM TO COURT TO PROTEST SAYING THAT IT INVADED THEIR I GUESS FIRST A THE THE SEARCH AND SEIZURE AMENDMENT .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND IT S STILL TIED UP IN THE LEGAL CHANNELS .
THEY HAVE NT RULED ON WHETHER THEY CAN TEST THEM OR NOT .
HUH .
SO I M CURIOUS ESPECIALLY SINCE T I S .
TO SEE HOW THAT S .
A LOCAL YOU KNOW EMPLOYER IS ALSO ALREADY DOING IT SEEING WHAT .
THEY LL SAY ABOUT IT ESPECIALLY SINCE .
IS IT IS IT UH JUST A SMALL GROUP OF THE EMPLOYEES .
THAT ARE CONCERNED .
WELL IT S THE WHOLE IT S THE WHOLE CITY SEEMS LIKE THE WHOLE GROUP OF CITY EMPLOYEES .
THAT S RAISING A STINK OVER IT .
THEY THEY JUST DO NT WANT TO BE DRUG TESTED .
YEAH .
SO .
YOU KNOW WE VE NEVER MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN A SITUATION WHERE SOMEBODY SAID YOU HAVE TO BE DRUG TESTED .
YEAH .
UH MY HUSBAND S RETIRED FROM I R S AGENTS .
UHHUH .
HOWEVER THIS IS NT A PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE .
RIGHT .
EITHER ALCOHOL OR DRUG AND SO WE WE IN OUR MINDS WE RE THINKING WHAT S THE BIG DEAL .
YEAH THAT S THE WAY .
I LOOKED AT IT .
IF I HAD SOMETHING TO HIDE IT S ONE THING BUT I M YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU DO NT SO IT S NOT AS BIG A DEAL AND YOU SOMETIMES WONDER WHEN THESE PEOPLE PROTEST SO MUCH WHETHER THEY RE REALLY CONCERNED .
RIGHT .
ABOUT THEIR RIGHTS OR WHETHER THEY RE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE .
AND AND THEN THEY SAY WELL IF YOU GIVE THEM .
THE RIGHT TO DO THIS THEN THEY RE GOING TO TAKE SOME OTHER RIGHT AWAY FROM YOU BUT I I FIRM .
I DO NT BELIEVE THAT .
I THINK THAT AN EMPLOYER HAS THE RIGHT TO ASK YOU TO DO ANYTHING AND OF COURSE THE BIG DEAL ONE OF THE BIG DEALS NOW TOO IS TO THAT WHEN YOU COME INTO A COMPANY AS YOU SIGN A PAPER SAYING THAT I WILL GO TAKE A .
WELL I USUALLY KEEP UP WITH NEWS BY WATCHING A B C NEWS ON TELEVISION AND READING THE PAPERS HERE THE LOCAL DALLAS MORNING NEWS AND THEN I ALSO TAKE THE WALL STREET JOURNAL .
DO YOU GET A CHANCE TO DO IT AT HOME OR DO YOU MOSTLY LIKE CATCH UP WHILE YOU RE AT WORK DO YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO LOOK THROUGH THE WALL STREET JOURNAL I M NOT SURE WHAT YOU DO .
YEAH WELL I WELL I D AT THE OFFICE I GENERALLY CATCH THE WALL STREET JOURNAL AT LUNCHTIME .
UM .
I USE PART OF MY LUNCH PERIOD TO UH READ THE WALL STREET JOURNAL .
WELL THE .
THEN UH I READ THE THE NEWSPAPER AT HOME GENERALLY IN THE EVENING I D RATHER SLEEP THE EXTRA THIRTY MINUTES IN THE MORNING .
I UNDERSTAND THAT WELL AND YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT BETTER NEWSPAPER THE DALLAS MORNING NEWS IS A GOOD PAPER LUBBOCK IS KIND OF SMALL AND THE A J S UH KIND OF DOMINANT THERE S NO COMPETITION SO WHAT YOU GET IS WHAT YOU GET WE USED TO TAKE THE PAPER EVERY DAY AND I FINALLY QUIT TAKING IT BECAUSE IT STACKED UP I NEVER GOT AROUND TO READING IT AND SO I TRY TO TAKE YOU KNOW WEEKEND PAPERS .
YEAH .
AND THEN DURING THE WEEK I CATCH UP YOU KNOW ON THE RADIO ON THE WAY TO WORK OR IF I M TRAVELING AROUND AT LUNCH OR ON THE WAY HOME AND HOPEFULLY I M SITTING DOWN BY THE TEN OCLOCK NEWS TO WHERE I CAN KIND OF GET A RECAP ON T V UH .
YEAH THAT S UH WHAT WE DO TO IT WE RE NEVER IN HOME IN TIME TO REALLY WATCH THE SIX OCLOCK NEWS ON TELEVISION .
NO .
SO WE CATCH THE TEN OCLOCK NEWS .
YEAH .
BUT I CATCH THE NEWS ON THE RADIO COMING TO AND FROM WORK BUT RADIO NEWS IS IS RATHER SHORT UH .
IT IS .
MOST OF THE NEWS STATIONS MOST OF THE STATIONS HERE THAT ARE NOT ALL NEWS STATIONS YOU GET ABOUT FIVE MINUTES ON THE HOUR .
UHHUH .
AND IF YOU CATCH THE NEWS STATIONS UH YOU DO NT CATCH THAT MUCH IN THE CAR .
OH I SEE .
YEAH BUT UH .
WE UH IT S FRUSTRATING TO ME BECAUSE I REALLY WISH THAT I DID HAVE MORE I DO NT KNOW UH WHAT DO I WANT TO SAY I WISH THAT I WAS AROUND MORE NEWS IT S FRUSTRATING WHEN I DO NT KNOW WHAT S GOING ON I FEEL LIKE IT S HIT AND MISS AND I HAVE NT FOUND ANYTHING YET THAT KEEPS ME THERE ON A CONSTANT BASIS SOMEBODY WILL SAY OH DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS THAT HAPPENED LAST WEEK AND IT MIGHT BE LOCAL AND IT MIGHT BE NATIONAL AND I M LIKE NO I MISSED THAT ONE .
YEAH I HAVE THE SAME SITUATION I TRIED THE NEWS MAGAZINES LIKE TIME NEWSWEEK U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT .
YEAH .
AND THEY D JUST STACK UP I WOULD NT FIND TIME TO READ THEM YOU HAVE TO HAVE TIME TO SIT DOWN AND CONCENTRATE ON ON THE STORIES OR E .
UHHUH .
ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU LOOK AND THERE S THREE UH THREE WEEKS WORTH LAYING ON THE COFFEE TABLE AND YOU WIND UP THROWING THEM OUT WITHOUT READING THEM .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
BECAUSE IT S TOO MUCH TROUBLE TO TRY AND CATCH UP SO .
THAT S TRUE .
HAVE TO DEPEND I GUESS WE RE BECOMING MORE OF A TELEVISION ORIENTED NATION IN THAT I DO NT THINK THAT UH MY CHILDREN EVEN READ NEWSPAPERS OTHER THAN THE T V GUIDE SECTION .
UH OH NO .
THERE S IS ALL UH STRICTLY TELEVISION NEWS .
A LITTLE BIT THAT WORRIES ME BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THE NEWS IS SO BIASED .
OH YEAH .
AND YES THEY REPORT FACTS AND YES YOU CAN GET AN IDEA OF WHAT S GOING ON BUT YOU KNOW IT S AN AND I WISH THEY WOULD JUST REPORT THE INCIDENT AND THEN LEAVE THE COMMENTARIES OUT BUT SO MANY TIMES YOU GET WELL UH THIS IS MY OPINION OF WHAT HE MEANT BY THAT .
YEAH .
AND I M LIKE WHO ARE YOU TO JUDGE YOU KNOW .
RIGHT IT S THE SAME .
JUST REPORT THE FACTS .
THING WITH THE NEWS MAGAZINES LIKE TIME AND AND THE OTHER MAGAZINES .
UHHUH .
IT S HARD TO CELEBR UH TO CELEBRATE TO SEPARATE THE NEWS FROM THE COMMENT BECAUSE .
YES .
IN THE WAY IT S PRESENTED THEIR OPINIONS IS PRINT OR PRESENTED AS BEING THE NEWS .
UHHUH .
AND SO THEN YOU HAVE TO TRY AND SORT OUT WHAT REALLY IS THE NEWS .
AND I FEEL LIKE THEY SENSATIONALIZE THINGS THAT SHOULD NT BE SENSATIONALIZED I FEEL LIKE THEY FOCUS TOO MUCH ON THINGS THAT I DO NT KNOW YOU KNOW SO MUCH DURING THE GULF WAR THEY WOULD ASK QUESTIONS THAT UH YOU WOULD NT WANT BROADCAST IT S LIKE IF YOU TELL US THE ANSWER TO THAT YOU RE TELLING OUR ENEMY WHAT YOUR STRATEGY IS .
THAT S RIGHT .
BUT THEY KEEP ASKING THESE QUESTIONS AND I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY WELL I DO NT KNOW ASININE ACTUALLY .
RIGHT .
STUPID .
WELL SO MANY OF THEM ALSO COME THROUGH AND THEY HAVE DISCOVERED THAT THIS IS THE MOST POPULAR ISSUE OF THE TIME WHETHER IT BE THE HOMELESS OR UH CANCER OR WHATEVER AND THEN THEY DEVOTE UH AN INORDINATE AMOUNT OF TIME ON THE NEWS CAST TO THEIR PERSONAL AX TO GRIND .
UHHUH YES .
AND UH UH .
I AGREE .
PARTICULARLY THE LOCAL TELEVISION UH I KNOW THE THE WEDNESDAY S CHILD BIT AND THEY LL TAKE UP TEN MINUTES OF A NEWSCAST AND LEAVE OUT SOMETHING I M NOT SAYING THAT S NOT IMPORTANT .
YEAH .
BUT THEY LEAVE OUT A REAL NEWS ISSUE TO DEVOTE TO ONE OF THEIR LOCAL PET PROJECTS .
YEAH THAT S TRUE THAT S TRUE AND IT S FRUSTRATING .
YEAH S .
SO I GUESS I GUESS WHEN I GET TO LISTEN TO THE NEWS IT S IT S PROBABLY TELEVISION OR RADIO I SEE VERY LITTLE PAPER BUT I I DO NT GET TO SEE THAT AS MUCH AS I WANT AND WHEN I DO I M WONDERING WHY I WANTED TO SEE IT SO BAD .
THAT S YEAH THAT MAKES SENSE WE UH AGAIN LIKE I SAY BY THE TIME I READ THE NEWSPAPER IT S THE THE IT S THAT MORNING S NEWS FROM THE DAY BEFORE AND I M READING IT IN THE EVENING SO .
YEAH .
I M A I M ABOUT A DAY BEHIND MOST OF THE TIME ANYWAY .
EXACTLY EXACTLY .
YEAH .
WELL I M GLAD THA IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I M NOT ALONE THOUGH IN THE WORLD I I USED TO THINK THAT I WAS PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE THAT JUST I DO NT KNOW WAS RUNNING AROUND SO MUCH I LOOK AT OTHER UH WOMEN WORKERS OR MEN AT WORK .
YEAH .
THAT HAVE KIDS AND FAMILIES AND I M LIKE HOW DO THEY SEEM SO TOGETHER ALL THE TIME I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE I M RUNNING A RAT RACE .
YEAH WE WE .
SO I GUESS NEWS IS JUST PART OF THAT RAT RACE FOR ME .
YEAH YEAH MY WIFE AND I FEEL THAT WE NEVER HAVE A MOMENT THAT WE CAN CALL OUR OWN .
YEAH .
IT S ALWAYS THERE S SOMETHING GOING ON ALL THE TIME UH YOU DO NT REALLY HAVE TIME TO SIT DOWN AND AND THOROUGHLY READ A NEWSPAPER .
EXACTLY .
AS A MATTER OF FACT I READ THE SUNDAY PAPER THIS EVENING .
WELL .
WE HAD SUCH A BUSY DAY YESTERDAY DID NT FIND TIME TO EVEN READ IT .
YEAH THAT S INCREDIBLE TOO .
YEAH WELL THAT S ABOUT ALL THEN .
WELL I APPRECIATE TALKING TO YOU .

OH GRACIOUS .
WELL I I THEY VE CAUGHT THEM AND THEY THEY RE IN THERE .
UHHUH WAS NT IT YOUR STATE THAT HAD THE UH GUY THAT COMMITTED ALL THOSE MURDERS THERE WAS THAT UH .
WELL YEAH WISCONSIN UH AND MILWAUKEE AREA YOU KNOW .
YEAH YEAH THAT WAS REALLY ON THE NATIONAL NEWS A LOT WE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THAT IN TEXAS .
YEAH SO THAT S WELL I I LIVE RIGHT ON THE BORDER OF MINNESOTA AND WISCONSIN SO I KIND OF GET BOTH BOTH NEWS AND I KNOW IN MINNESOTA UH THEY HAD UH THE ONE THAT JUST UH GOT OUT AND WENT AFTER A UH COLLEGE STUDENT AND RAPED .
OH .
AND KILLED HER AND THEY ARE NOT TOO HAPPY ABOUT THAT NOW I GUESS SO .
WELL I CAN IMAGINE .
THERE .
IT SEEMS LIKE THE VIOLENT CRIMES ARE INCREASING A LOT TO ME I I DO NT KNOW I DO NT KNOW IF STATISTICALLY THEY ARE BUT IT SEEMS LIKE YOU SURE HEAR A MAYBE YOU JUST HEAR A LOT MORE ABOUT THEM ON THE NEWS I DO NT KNOW .
YEAH UH THAT S HARD TO SAY FOR SURE I UH SOMETIMES I WONDER IF THESE PEOPLE ARE NT DO NT IT JUST FOR THE PUBLICITY AND .
YOU WONDER ABOUT THAT SOMETIMES .
THEY THEY GET THEIR NAMES IN THE IN THE PAPER AND THEY BECOME BIG CELEBRITIES BUT .
UHHUH THAT S KIND OF SCARY I I WISH THERE WAS SOME WAY THAT WE COULD CHANGE THE NEWS MEDIA SO THEY DID NT FEATURE THESE WAY OUT STORIES MAYBE IT WOULD NT GIVE OTHER PEOPLE IDEAS .
WELL UH I KNOW ONE THIN I I THINK TEXAS HAS THE DEATH PENALTY RIGHT .
YES WE DO .
YEAH .
DO YOU HAVE IT UP THERE .
NO NO .
I SEE .
SEE I I NO I .
DO YOU THINK THAT S A DETERRENT .
YEAH WELL IT S IT S IT S NOT GOING TO PREVENT ANY PEOPLE FROM DOING IT BUT .
THE PERSON THAT S CAUGHT HE LL NEVER DO IT AGAIN IF HE GETS THE DEATH PENALTY .
YEAH .
AND THAT S AND THERE ARE A LOT OF REPEATERS UH .
UHHUH I GUESS THAT S ANOTHER THING THAT TO ME IS A A REAL PROBLEM AND I KNOW WE HAVE GOT SO MANY PEOPLE IN OUR PRISON SYSTEM NOW AT LEAST HERE IN TEXAS .
YEAH .
I MEAN THEY ARE REALLY IN A CRISIS THERE HAS BEEN TIMES THEY HAVE HAD TO JUST CLOSE OFF THE PRISONS AND LEAVE THEM IN COUNTY JAILS OR WHATEVER BECAUSE THERE JUST WAS NT ENOUGH ROOM FOR ALL OF THEM .
YEAH .
AND A LOT OF THEM THEY PUT OUT ON PAROLE AND THEN SOME OF THE ONES THAT THEY PUT OUT EARLY YOU KNOW DO REPEAT OFFENSES AND .
HUH .
THE CRIME RATE IS THE WORST THAN EVER BEFORE .
YEAH WELL SOME I M JUST WONDERING A LOT OF TIMES THEY WILL PUT UH PEOPLE LESSER CRIMES IN UH WITH UH PEOPLE THAT DID MORE SEVERE CRIMES THAN THEY MAYBE THEY JUST TEND TO LEARN FROM THESE PEOPLE AND THEY AND WHEN THEY GET BACK OUT THEY JUST GO INTO WORSE CRIMES .
I THINK THAT COULD BE TRUE TOO .
MAYBE THEY SHOULD TRY AND SEPARATE THEM A LITTLE BIT MORE UH .
I THINK THE WHOLE PAROLE THING YOU KNOW IF SOMEBODY IS CONVICTED OF SECONDDEGREE MURDER OR SOMETHING GETS FIFTEEN YEARS WELL THEY ARE OUT IN SIX OR SEVEN YOU KNOW OUTBOUND ON THE STREETS AGAIN .
YEAH .
AND TO ME THAT S REALLY SCARY SOME OF THESE CRIMES THAT THEY COMMIT YOU KNOW SEEMS LIKE THE PUNISHMENT IS NOT REALLY EQUAL TO THE CRIME .
UHHUH WELL UH I DO NT KNOW WITH WITH MY LIMITED UH PSYCHOLOGY BACKGROUND I DO HAVE I DO NT I DO NT EVEN FEEL THAT PRISONS AND STUFF ARE ARE THE ANSWER IF YOU WANT TO STOP THE CRIME I THINK YOU VE GOT TO GET UH THE PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE KIDS .
OH YEAH .
A LOT OF THIS PROBABLY JUST STARTS WITH FROM THE FROM THE HOMES ALSO FROM THE THE THE MEDIA THE T V S THE UH .
UHHUH .
ALL THESE UH GORY MOVIES ON THERE BECOMES UH JUST A NATURAL FACT OF LIFE .
UHHUH THEY THINK IT S OKAY THING TO DO .
YEAH .
YEAH I THINK THAT S A VERY GOOD POINT YOU KNOW I THERE S A LOT MORE WORKING MOTHERS A LOT MORE KIDS IN DAY CARE CENTERS ALL THAT KIND OF THING MORALITY IS BEING TAUGHT MORE BY THE SCHOOLS A LOT OF TIMES THAN IN THE HOME ANYMORE AND .
UHHUH WELL A LOT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES UH THEY TEND TO SENSOR WELL THEY PROBABLY WO NT SENSOR SO MUCH THE SEXUAL STUFF AS MUCH AS THE VIOLENT .
UHHUH .
AND THEY HAVE A LOT LESS CRIME .
HUH .
SOME OF SOME OF THOSE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE ARE YOU CAN LEAVE YOUR YOUR UH DOORS OPEN AND AND AND BE SAFE UH EVEN UH I THINK NEW ZEALAND IS ONE OF ONE OF THE PLACES UH THAT .
UM I DO NT I AM ONLY TWENTYEIGHT AND I HAVE NT HAD MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH NURSING HOMES .

UM ACTUALLY I HAVE UM I VE I VE BEEN IN THEM BUT UM JUST VISITING AND UH WE USED TO G WHEN WE WERE LIKE IN IN OUR TEEN AGES WE D GO ON SUNDAYS AND VISIT YOU KNOW THE OLDER PEOPLE .
BUT UM I HAVE AN ELDERLY GRANDMA .

AND SHE S LIVED WITH US FOR LIKE FIVE YEARS .
SO I .
KIND OF KNOW HOW IT IS TO HOW TO DECIDE IF YOU WANT TO PUT SOMEBODY IN A REST HOME OR UM LIKE WE I MEAN WE VE HAD THOSE DISCUSSIONS YOU KNOW ABOUT SHOULD WE PUT HER IN OR BECAUSE SHE S PRETTY SENILE AND .
AND IT IT TAKES A LOT OF CARE LIKE TWENTYFOUR HOURS A DAY .

S REA .
WELL THERE S SOMEONE IN MY MY FIANCEE S FAMILY .
HIS GRANDMOTHER TOO AND THEY RE THAT HI HER SON HIS UNCLE WHATEVER YOU KNOW ANYWAY .
HE HE HAS HE S RECENTLY RETIRED AND SO HE S THE ONE .

UM WELL SEE IT S MORE MY GRANDMA .
THAT FEELS THAT WAY .
UHHUH .
SHE SAYS THAT WHEN HER HUSBAND DIED THAT HE SAID OH THAT MY UNCLE HAD SAID THAT HE WOULD NEVER HA PUT HER IN A REST HOME .

THEY RE GOING TO DO .
IT S REALLY NOT MY FAMILY .
IT .

I M NOT REALLY FAMILIAR WITH HOW OTHER COUNTRIES .
IT S REALLY MORE OF A UM LIKE A RESPECT ISSUE TH THAT THE OLDER OLDER PEOPLE IN OTHER COUNTRIES THAT I VE BEEN TO SEEM TO REALLY HAVE A LOT MORE RESPECT FOR THE ELDERLY PEOPLE AND AND THEY REALLY SEEM AS WISE AND AND IN THIS COUNTRY .
NOBODY REALLY .
THEY RE SEEN AS SENILE .
YEAH NOBODY REALLY PAYS ATTENTION AND THEY OH THE OLDTIMER MADE WITH THE OLD WAY AND NOBODY RESPECTS THE TRADITIONS .
AND YOU KNOW IT S I I M NOT SAYING THAT I DO EITHER BUT .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW IT S JUST FUNNY AND AND WE REALLY DO NT HAVE ANY .
THAT DO NT HAVE THE SOCIAL SECURITY AND EVERYTHING REALLY IS NT THAT MUCH .
UHHUH .
FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE TO LIVE ON .
YOU KNOW EVEN IF THEY RE IN GOOD HEALTH .
IT S INCREDIBLE .
RIGHT .
THEY DO NT HAVE ANY THEY DO NT GET SPECIAL TREATMENT AND MAYBE THEY SHOULD YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE WE RE ALL GOING TO GET OLD SOMEDAY .

I WANTED A LITTLE MORE DETAIL LIKE YOU KNOW THEY WOULD TELL MORE ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT WERE KILLED WHERE THEY WERE FROM AND HOW OLD THEY WERE AND I GUESS YOU JUST YOU KNOW YOU .
YES YES .
YOU JUST WANT TO KNOW AND WITH INTEREST YOU KNOW I FOUND SOME PEOPLE THAT WERE MEMBERS OF OUR CHURCH WHICH WAS DIFFERENT AND THAT MADE YOU EVEN FEEL A LITTLE MORE KIN TO TO WHAT WAS GOING ON .
YOU FOUND SOME MEMBERS OF YOUR CHURCH THAT HAD BEEN MURDERED .
WELL YOU KNOW OF THE SAME SAME TYPE OF CHURCH THAT WE BELONG TO .
OH THE SAME TYPE OF CHURCH .
UHHUH .
UHHUH UHHUH .

UHHUH .
WITH US SO .
I USED TO UH OR I DID NT USED TO BUT UH .
NO .
WHEN MY GRANDCHILDREN HAD UH HAVE STAYED OVER BEFORE AND EVEN MAYBE WHEN OUR KIDS WERE YOUNGER ONE OF THE CHANNELS USED TO GIVE BRIEF INSERTS OF NEWS AT A CHILD S LEVEL .
UHHUH .
AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS VERY INTERESTING AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT FOR KIDS LIKE THEY BROUGHT DOWN SOMETHING THAT HAD HAPPENED LIKE IF THERE WAS SOMETHING GOING ON UH IN THE WAR THEY WOULD BRING IT DOWN TO A CHILD S LEVEL IN WORDS .
HUH .
YOU KNOW THAT THEY COULD UNDERSTAND .
UHHUH .
WHAT WAS GOING ON AND UH I NOTICED THAT MY GRANDCHILDREN SEEMED TO KIND OF ENJOY THAT THE OLDEST ONE HE S .
RIGHT .
NINE AND UH HE WOULD PARTICULARLY ENJOY THIS BEEN A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO .
YEAH .
AND UH I THOUGHT I THINK THAT S REALLY INTERESTING ACTUALLY I EVEN UNDERSTOOD IT BETTER .
YEAH THAT S NICE SOMETIMES WHEN THEY .
YEAH .
THEY PULL IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT LIKE THAT .
YEAH YOU KNOW AND UH BUT AS I SAID UH I TEN YOU KNOW I I HAVE KIND OF A BLAS3E ATTITUDE ABOUT UH NEWS AND NEWS REPORTING WHICH IS IS NOT GOOD YO YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
NOBODY SHOULD GET THAT WAY ABOUT THE NEWS .
RIGHT .
AND WHAT S GOING ON IN THE WORLD .
OH DO YOU HAVE A CERTAIN STATION YOU LIKE TO WATCH WHEN YOU WATCH IT OR .
YES WE LIKE CHANNEL EIGHT .
DO YOU .
WE LIKE IT IT S THE BEST .
UM CHANNEL FIVE FOR SOME REASON HAS ALWAYS BEEN .
IS THAT BEEN .
THE ONE I WATCH .
YOUR FAVORITE UHHUH .
I I DO NT KNOW IT S PROBABLY THE ANCHORS THEY JUST KIND OF CATCH YOU I DO NT I DO NT KNOW .
YEAH I VERY SEL AND I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY INTERESTING UH CHANNEL NINE WATCHING IT WHEN THE MURDERS WERE IN KILLEEN .
UHHUH .
AND AND GOING ON THEY WERE HAVING NEWS COVERAGE AND .
THE C N N IS THAT WHAT THAT IS .
NO IT WAS CHANNEL NINE .
HUH .
AND YOU KNOW THEY HAVE THAT HOUR THAT NINE TO TEN .
OH .
OF AN EVENING AND SO WE HAD THE T V ON AND WE WERE TRYING TO CATCH ALL OF IT AND THEY WERE SHOWING SOME AND I WAS WATCHING MY HUSBAND AND I WERE WATCHING IT AND THEN WE SWITCHED OVER TO CHANNEL EIGHT AND THE DIFFERENCE IN COVERAGE WAS UNBELIEVABLE .
YEAH .
I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY CHANNEL ELEVEN IS UH YOU KNOW WHY THEY RE KIND OF BEHIND .
YEAH .
DID I SAY CHANNEL NINE TO BEGIN WITH .
YEAH THAT S .
NO .
WHY I WONDERED .
OKAY NO CHAN .
I DO NT GET THAT CHANNEL .
CHANNEL ELEVEN I MEANT .
YEAH .
I WAS THINKING NINE TO TEN .
YEAH YEAH .
BUT CHANNEL ELEVEN .
THAT IS IF YOU IF YOU WANT TO GO TO BED EARLY IT S NICE TO TO TO WATCH THAT EARLY NEWS .
UHHUH .
SOMETIMES SO .
IT UH BUT THE COVERAGE WAS NT NEAR AS GOOD AS WHEN WE YOU KNOW SWITCHED OVER TO CHANNEL EIGHT AND THEY DID NT E .
WELL HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT SPOT TEST SPOT TESTING FOR DRUGS .
WELL BASICALLY I THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA MYSELF I UH I THINK IF SOMEBODY S NOT ON DRUGS THEY HAVE NO REASON YOU KNOW TO BE AFRAID OF IT .
UHHUH .
UH I DO THINK THAT THERE HAS TO BE SOME CONTROLS UH LIKE I DO NT THINK ONE TEST POSITIVE SHOULD UH BE UH THE END OF IT YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
I I THINK THEY SHOULD TEST MORE THAN ONCE .
YEAH IT S IT S .
IT .
IT S REFRESHING TO HEAR SOMEBODY .
THAT HAS A SIMILAR OPINION AS MINE I MEAN ALL THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE AGAINST IT THAT MAY THE YOU KNOW THEY MAY NOT EVEN BE ON DRUGS THEY THEY CALL IT AN INVASION OF PRIVACY .
UHHUH .
AND I DO NT SEE THAT TO ME THAT JUST DOES NT SOUND LIKE A VALID ARGUMENT BECAUSE THIS COMPANY IS PAYING YOU GOOD MONEY THAT YOU RE WORKING FOR .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND THEY I BELIEVE THAT .
THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW IF YOU RE USING A A DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
BUT .
THERE S SO MANY JOBS THAT UH .
REALLY HAVE OTHER PEOPLE S LIVES IN THEIR HANDS OR EVEN THEIR OWN LIFE AND YOU KNOW AND IT S UH .
UHHUH .
UH HOW CAN YOU DO ANYTHING ABOUT A PROBLEM BESIDES IF YOU DO NT KNOW ABOUT IT .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW AND I JUST UM I I THINK .
RIGHT .
THERE DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BE SOME CONTROL TO IT I GUESS IT IS POSSIBLE TO HAVE A FALSE POSITIVE REPORT .
YES NO I I I AGREE THAT YOU KNOW YOU THERE NEEDS TO BE A A WELL THOUGHT OUT SANE APPROACH TO .
HOW TO ADMINISTER THAT PROGRAM .
UHHUH .
JUST BECAUSE YOU YOU SOMETHING CAN GET MIXED IN THE MAIL OR .
UHHUH .
UH THE CHEMICALS COULD REACT INCORRECTLY THAN THAN WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT THEM TO AND YEAH YOU YOU KNOW .
OR SOMEBODY S TEST GETS MIXED UP WITH SOMEBODY ELSE S .
RIGHT .
I MEAN THOSE THINGS DO HAPPEN .
YEAH .
UH I CERTAINLY WOULD NT WANT PEOPLE S LIVES RUINED .
RIGHT AND YOU KNOW I VE .
UH WRONGLY .
THE THE THE COMPANY THAT I WORK FOR UH HAS JUST RECENTLY WELL YOU KNOW WITHIN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS INSTITUTED FOR ALL NEW HIRED EMPLOYEES THEY SUBMIT TO A URINE TEST .
UHHUH .
AND THEY THEY SAY THAT THERE S BEEN YOU KNOW THEY THEY THEY VE ALSO IMPLEMENTED RANDOM TESTING .
UHHUH .
AND MUMBLEX IT HAS NT HAPPENED TO ME IN THE COUPLE OF YEARS THAT YOU KNOW IT S BEEN IN PROGRESS .
UHHUH .
BUT UH I I FULLY AGREE WITH IT AND THERE S YOU KNOW THERE S ALL THESE MEMOS GOING AROUND ABOUT FOLKS THAT ARE DISGRUNTLED AND FEEL IT S AN INVASION OF PRIVACY AND .
UHHUH .
I I AGREE WITH YOU IF IF IF YOU FEEL IT S AN INVASION OF PRIVACY YOU VE YOU VE PROBABLY GOT SOMETHING YOU RE TRYING TO HIDE .
YEAH AND YOU MAYBE NEED TO LOOK FOR SOME OTHER TYPE OF JOB TO DO .
YEAH .
THAT UH DOES NT REQUIRE THE TESTING .
RIGHT .
UH TO ME IT S TO ME IT S NOT AN INVASION OR PRIVACY I THINK IT S PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW IF IF UH THEIR THEIR LIFE MAYBE S IN JEOPARDY OR UH .
OR THE QUALITY OF THEIR PRODUCT .
YEAH THEIR WORK THE WORK THEY RE DOING FOR THEIR COMPANY UH THOSE THINGS ARE ALL AFFECTED IF NOT IMMEDIATELY IT CERTAINLY DOES EVENTUALLY .
YEAH .
I THINK THAT S WHERE A LOT OF THE PROBLEM IS AT FIRST IT DOES NT SEEM TO UH BOTHER THE QUALITY OF WORK .
UHHUH .
BUT EVENTUALLY IT DOES .
RIGHT BECAUSE IT USUALLY REQUIRES MORE AND MORE OF THAT SUBSTANCE THAT YOU RE MISUSING .
UHHUH UHHUH .
TO GET THE SAME EFFECT .
UHHUH .
UM .
COURSE I FEEL THE SAME WAY ON THE AIDS PROBLEM I I DO NT THINK THAT S AN INVASION OF PRIVACY THAT S THE ONLY COMMUNICABLE DISEASE THAT THEY RE NOT ALLOWED TO TEST FOR .
YOU KNOW AND IT S DESTROYING A LOT OF .
AND THEN .
PEOPLE S LIVES .
AND ONE OF THE FEW THAT THEY DO NT HAVE A CURE FOR .
YEAH AND IT S YOU KNOW IT S IT S DESTROYING PEOPLE S LIVES AND I I THINK THAT PERSON PLUS ANYBODY IN DANGER SHOULD SHOULD B KNOW ABOUT IT AND BE AWARE OF IT .
YEAH MUMBLEX .
I DO NT KNOW IT S IT S KIND OF HARD TO I GUESS THE GAY MOVEMENT HAS HAD A LOT TO DO WITH CONSIDERING THAT THAT UH AN INVASION OF PRIVACY OF COURSE THAT S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE WHAT WE RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY I GUESS SO .
YEAH .

OKAY NO THEY DO NT CHARGE US THAT EXTRA NICKEL .
THAT S SORT OF NICE THOUGH .

WE OUGHT TO DO IS START SENDING UNSMASHED UH PEPSI CANS AND WHATEVER .
YEAH .
UP THERE .
EXACTLY YEAH SEND IT TO THIS ADDRESS NO .
BUT UH LET S SEE THEY SAID THAT HOW WAYS CAN ENCOURAGE RECYCLING UH .
I I I TELL YOU .
WHAT WHAT REALLY WORKS UH AT LEAST DOWN HERE IS IF THERE IS IF THERE IS SOME E EVEN SOME MONEY BASICALLY TO TAKE CARE OF THE GAS TO RECYCLE IT YOU KNOW WHAT .
I MEAN THEN PEOPLE TEND TO DO IT .
UH .
YEAH THAT S .
IN OTHER WORDS TAKING CARE OF THE ENVIRONMENT IS IS ALL WELL AND GOOD .
UHHUH .
BUT IF IT S GOING TO COST YOU TO TAKE CARE OF THE ENVIRONMENT THEY RE NOT QUITE AS UH .
AS LIKELY TO DO IT .
LIKELY TO DO IT .
YEAH .
AS IF UH IF YOU GET SOMETHING BACK FOR IT .
YOU KNOW .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
AND UH SO YOU KNOW IF THERE ARE SOME ENERGY SAVINGS OR IF THERE IS SOME SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS ANYTHING THAT THEY CAN PASS ON TO THE CONSUMER YOU KNOW IT .
KIND OF REMINDS ME OF USING AN .
A T M CARD YOU KNOW TO GET MONEY .
UHHUH .
OR DOING YOUR BANKING .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW IF IT S FREE PEOPLE WILL USE IT IF IT COSTS THEM .
SOMETHING THEN THEY RE NOT AS LIKELY TO USE IT .
YEAH EXACTLY .
YOU KNOW .
BUT UH I KNOW WE HAD A PROBLEM DOWN HERE WITH UH OIL PEOPLE TAKING OIL OUT OF THEIR CARS .
UHHUH .
AND JUST PUTTING IT DOWN THE D YOU KNOW THE S THE DRAIN SEWER .
YEAH .
AND UH ALL THAT BECAUSE THERE WAS APPARENTLY A LOT OF PEOPLE YOU KNOW EVERY TIME .
THEY CHANGE THE OIL THEY JUST DUMP ALL THE RES THEIR OLD OIL DOWN THERE .
UHHUH .
NOW THEY RE STARTING TO RECYCLE THAT STUFF .
OH THAT S GOOD .
UH ANOTHER THING .
I THOUGHT OF I GUESS TO RECYCLE WOULD BE LIKE CLOTHES BECAUSE I MEAN EVERYBODY GETS RID OF THEIR CLOTHES SOMETIME OR OTHER .
AND ONE WAY THAT WE DO IT SORT OF IN IN IOWA IS THAT WE CAN TAKE SOME OF OUR CLOTHES TO THE CONSIGNMENT SHOPS .
YEAH .
AND THAT WAY YOU KNOW YOU DO NT GET NEAR ENOUGH AS AS MUCH AS YOU BOUGHT IT FOR BUT YOU YOU GOT THE USE OUT OF IT AND WHAT .
YOU RE GOING TO BASICALLY DONATE TO A GOODWILL OR WHATEVER ANYWAYS YOU CAN GET A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY FOR .
YEAH .
AND SO .
YEAH .
THAT S SOMETHING THAT I VE NEVER I WE RE WE RE NEW TO IOWA SO THAT S SOMETHING THAT I HAD NT YOU KNOW LOOKED INTO BEFORE .
BUT THAT S ONE WAY TO SORT OF GET MONEY AND STILL RECYCLE I GUESS .
YEAH I KNOW A LOT OF PLACES THEY UH UH .
I GUESS WE RE READY TO TALK .
HOW YOU DOING HOWARD THIS IS A A SUBJECT THAT I M NOT REAL WELL VERSED ON BUT .
WELL LET S TALK ABOUT AIR POLLUTION .
OKAY .
WHAT DO YOU THINK CAUSES AIR POLLUTION IN DALLAS OR WHERE ARE YOU FROM .
NO .
MAYBE YOU RE NOT IN DALLAS .
OKAY I M FROM THE UH I M FROM DALLAS I M IN RICHARDSON .
OKAY UH .
WHAT DO YOU THINK AS FAR AS AIR POLLUTION IN THE DALLAS AREA .
WELL I HAVE SOME SMALL EXPERIENCE IN THIS AREA THE BROWN HAZE THAT YOU SEE IF YOU LOOK DOWN CENTRAL TOWARDS DOWNTOWN .
RIGHT .
A LOT OF THAT IS UH TIED UP WITH THE OXIDES OR NITROGEN ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE KIND OF BLUISH GRAY STUFF WE SEE SOMETIMES IS TIED UP WITH PARTICULATES BUT UH THE ONE OF THE MAJOR PROBLEMS THAT DALLAS HAS IS OXIDES AND NITROGEN THAT S BECAUSE OF ALL THE EQUIPMENT THAT S BEING OPERATED BUT AT THE SAME TIME UH BECAUSE WE DO NT HAVE WE DO NT BURN A LOT OF COAL AND SOLID MATERIALS WE .
DO NT GET A LOT OF PARTICULATES NOW PARTICULATES WOULD COME FROM TRASH BURNING OR INCINERATION OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT HERE IN DALLAS .
RIGHT .
UH POWER PLANTS SINCE .
MANY OF OUR LOCAL POWER PLANTS UH ARE NATURAL GAS MOST OF THE TIME UH THE THINGS THAT COME OFF OF THOSE PLANTS ARE CARBON DIOXIDE AND N O X THERE S NO PARTICULATES IN NATURAL GAS OF COURSE AND WE PICK UP A LITTLE BIT OF SULPHUR OFF SOME OF THESE PRODUCTS WE RE BURNING FUEL OIL AND A FEW OTHER THINGS BUT GASOLINE OF COURSE NOW THE LEAD S OUT AT LEAST THEORETICALLY UH I GUESS YOU COULD SAY WE RE PICKING UP SOME SULPHUR BECAUSE A LOT OF THE FUELS DOES HAVE SULPHUR THAT S WHY WE GET THAT ROTTEN EGG SMELL SOMETIME OFF THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER .
OH REALLY .
THE SULPHUR YES AND THAT S UH COURSE HYDROGEN SULFIDE WHICH IS WHEN YOU BURN GASOLINE YOU ALSO PRODUCE SOME WATER VAPOR .
SURE .
AND THAT GOES BACK IN WITH YOUR SULPHUR AND UNDER THE RIGHT CONDITION YOU GET H TWO S BUT ANYWAY UH .
WELL YOU ARE YOU ARE WELL VERSED ON THE SUBJECT I TELL YOU .
WELL I DO NT KNOW .
THIS IS NOT ONE OF MY BETTER ONES I GUESS I GUESS I NOTICE IT THE MOST JUST UH IN DRIVING AROUND DALLAS WITH ALL THE THE HIGHWAY EQUIPMENT THAT S WORKING ON THE .
UHHUH .
ON SIX THIRTYFIVE AND SEVENTYFIVE JUST THE CARS IN GENERAL THAT S WHERE I SEE MOST OF IT .
RO UH RON A LOT OF THIS IS CAUSED BY THE FACT THAT CARS SITTING IN TRAFFIC TEND TO RUN RICH BECAUSE THE WAY THE POLLUTION IS .
RIGHT .
AND WHEN THEY RUN RICH THEY THEY SPIT OUT A LOT OF HYDROCARBONS AND THAT S ANOTHER PART OF THE PROBLEM THE GAS IS NOT BEING BURNED COMPLETELY BUT UH HOPEFULLY IF WE EVER GET OUR ROAD SYSTEM FIXED UP THIS WILL GET A LOT BETTER .
OH I DO NT KNOW I VE LIVED HERE SINCE SEVENTYFOUR HOWARD AND I D I THINK I THINK THEY BEEN WORKING ON THE HIGHWAYS AROUND HERE SINCE I VE BEEN HERE .
AND I THINK I THINK THEY LL BE WORKING ON THEM LONG AFTER MY WIFE AND I ARE GONE .
WELL I GUESS I NOT TRYING TO TOP YOU BUT I GREW UP IN DALLAS COUNTY AND I CAN REMEMBER WHEN THEY BUILT THE NORTH PART OF NORTH CENTRAL WHICH WAS BUILT AFTER THE SOUTH PART OF .
RIGHT .
CENTRAL AND UH I CAN REMEMBER COMING OVER THE HILL DOWN THERE LONG ABOUT UH I DO NT KNOW LITTLE BIT NORTH OF MARK MOCKINGBIRD ON UP IN OVER THOSE HILLS AND I SAID I WONDER IF THEY LL EVER NEED THIS ROAD .
COURSE IT WAS DESIGNED FOR MOST OF US TO GO ABOUT FORTYFIVE MILES AN HOUR BECAUSE THE SHORT ON RAMPS AND ARE OFF RAMPS BUT GOSH SEEMS LIKE UH THOSE RAMPS MIGHT KILL US YET I HOPEFULLY THE NEW ONES WILL BE A LOT BETTER .
I UNDERSTAND I SURE HOPE SO I TELL YOU YOU KNOW YOU GET OUT ON THE UH INTERSTATE HIGHWAYS VERSUS I TRAVEL QUITE A BIT AND TRAVELING FROM LIKE DALLAS TO AUSTIN TO SAN ANTONIO IT S THE SAME THING AS FAR AS THE POLLUTION CREATED BY THE AUTOMOBILES IN THE IN THE STALLED TRAFFIC AND THE BUSY HIGHWAYS YOU YOU YOU RE AT YOUR BEST AND I GUESS WHEN YOU RE OUT ON THE INTERSTATE HEADING NORTH OR SOUTH AND YOU RE JUST CRUISING RIGHT ALONG AND THERE S NO BUILD UP OF CARS AND .
YEAH RON HAVE YOU NOTICED WHEN YOU RE DRIVING SOUTH ON THIRTYFIVE I GUESS TOWARDS WAXAHACHIE HILLSBOROUGH ON DOWN TO AUSTIN .
YOU HIT A POINT DOWN THERE ABOUT I THINK WHERE THEY CALL BEAR CREEK EXIT .
YES .
ON JUST THIS SIDE OF THE COUNTY LINE RIGHT ALONG IN THERE SOMEWHERE SUDDENLY THE AIR FEELS CLEANER HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT .
I TELL YOU WHAT I I DO NT THINK I REALLY HAVE BUT I M GOING THAT WAY TUESDAY AND I M GOING TO MAKE IT A POINT TO .
WELL SOMETIMES IT DEPENDS ON WHICH WAY THE WINDS BLOWING .
SURE .
BUT UH I ALSO TRAVEL A LITTLE BIT AND UH I DO NT KNOW IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THERE S A CERTAIN POINT DOWN THERE WHERE YOU CAN BREATHE EASIER IT MAY BE ALL IN MY MIND .

UH LOTS OF LOTS OF YOUNG COUPLES WITH YOU KNOW USU OH I M SURE THAT VIRTUALLY EVERYBODY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT S THEIR FIRST HOMES .
OH UHHUH .
AND UH LOTS OF KIDS AND STUFF AND SO IT IT FITS WELL IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD .

HE LIVES IN WICHITA KANSAS AND THE UM THE NEIGHBORHOOD ACTUALLY FOUGHT HIM ON IT BECAUSE HE HE WAS UM THE HOUSE WAS GOING TO COST LESS TO BUILD THAN ANY OTHER HOUSE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD .
OH .
NOW THAT S BECAUSE HE WAS HE S DOING A LOT OF IT .
HIMSELF .
YEAH .
AND YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE LANDSCAPING AND AND LOTS OF THE OTHER STUFF AND HIS HOUSE ACTUALLY ENDED UP BEING NICER THAN LOTS MUMBLEX IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD BUT .
YEAH .

WE COULD NT AFFORD IT AND BUT IT S FUNNY THAT YOU D SAY THAT BECAUSE THERE WERE HOMES IN HERE THAT DID NT HAVE ANY BRICK AT ALL .
RIGHT .
SO IT S KIND OF LIKE THEY WERE .
KIND OF DEPENDS ON WHEN THEY GET IN YOU KNOW .
YEAH YEAH AND I AND SO IT WAS KIND OF LIKE IT S THEY OURS IS THE LAST STREET THAT THEY BUILT ON .
SO THE HOUSES ACTUALLY ON OUR STREET ARE A LITTLE BIT THEY RE KIND OF GONE A LITTLE BIT NICER .
OH THEY HAVE IT S GOTTEN YEAH .
YEAH I MEAN JUST .
YEAH OH .
THEY YOU KNOW IT S LIKE THE SECOND PHASE .
UHHUH .
AND AND SO THEY VE KIND OF CHANGED THE THE CODES .
A LITTLE BIT AND SO THAT S KIND OF WHY I GUESS THEY STUCK US WITH MORE BRICK WHEN THERE WERE .
UM .
OTHER HOMES .
THAT DID NT HAVE ANY .
WELL SEE MY SISTER KIND OF GOT IN THE OPPOSITE END OF THAT BECAUSE THEY THEY MOVED INTO A NEIGHBORHOOD AND BOUGHT A A REAL NICE STONE HOUSE DOWN IN SOUTH AUSTIN .
OH UHHUH .
AND UH AND THE WHAT .
THE BUILDER APPARENTLY PLANS TO DO IS THEY THEY DO PHASE ONE AND THEY .
KIND OF GIVE IT .
A VERY UPSCALE AND VERY TIGHTLY CONTROLLED UH CODES AND AND AND STUFF AND THEN THEY COME BACK IN AND AND THEN THEY SELL .
WE RE TO DISCUSS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PROCESS OF PUTTING SOMEONE IN A NURSING HOME AND MAKING THE DECISION ON A FAMILY BASIS AND PROBABLY THE FIRST QUESTION WOULD BE WHETHER YOU VE EVER HAD TO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS .
WELL NOT SO MUCH PERSONALLY BUT MY UM HUSBAND HAS AN AUNT WHO HAS BEEN LIKE A SECOND MOTHER I MEAN ALWAYS LIVED IN THE SAME TOWN AND TOOK CARE OF HIM AND SUCH THEY LIVE DOWN IN COLLEGE STATION WHERE .
HIS PARENTS DO TOO AND THEY PUT HER IN A HOME LAST YEAR .
UHHUH .
SHE APPEARED TO HAVE A COUPLE OF LIGHT STROKES AND STARTED TO UH NOT BE ABLE TO BE IN HER APARTMENT ON HER OWN .
UHHUH .
SO THEY FOUND A A PLACE NEARBY THAT THEY PUT HER IN LAST YEAR .
SO IT WAS PRETTY MUCH A PHYSICAL DECISION .
UH YEAH ALTHOUGH SHE IS UH IN PRETTY GOOD HEALTH AND SHE S DOES NT TAKE ANY MEDICATION IT S JUST SHE HAD HAD HER OWN APARTMENT AND DROVE A CAR AND EVERYTHING UP UNTIL THAT POINT .
UM .
THEN SHE WAS STARTING TO GET UH YOU KNOW LOSE MEMORY SOMETIMES AND WHICH IS KIND OF FRIGHTENING WHEN SHE S IN THE CAR .
YEAH .
UH .
MY HUSBAND S FAMILY ARE REACHING THAT POINT BUT IT S IT S SO DIFFICULT WAS SHE IN FAVOR OF IT OR OR WAS SHE KIND OF OPPOSED TO IT .
WELL YEAH WHEN IT FINALLY CAME DOWN TO IT UM SHE JUST GOT TO THE POINT AFTER THE I MEAN IT WAS NT A VERY UM STRONG STROKE IT WAS JUST KIND OF ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE WAS NT HERSELF ANYMORE .
UHHUH .
AND SHE GOT KIND OF FEARFUL OF BEING ON HER OWN SHE NEVER REALLY ATE VERY WELL IT WAS ONE THING SHE HARDLY .
YEAH .
EVER TOOK CARE OF HERSELF AND SHE DID NT EAT SHE ATE VERY POOR SO I THINK SHE WAS YOU KNOW BAD UH NUTRITION ON TOP OF IT AND UH SHE GOT TO THE POINT SHE DID NT WANT TO ALONE ANYMORE SO .
SO OFTEN I THINK THOUGH ELDERLY PEOPLE DO NT REALIZE THAT THEIR DIET IS THAT BAD I WORK WITH A LOT OF ELDERLY PEOPLE I M A TRUST OFFICER .
UM .
AND SO OFTEN THEY THINK THEY RE ADEQUATELY CARING FOR THEMSELVES WHEN THEY RE REALLY NOT EATING VERY MUCH OR VERY BALANCED MEALS .
WELL SHE WAS ALMOST RIDICULOUS LIKE SHE D EAT ICE CREAM AND COOKIES SHE D .
YES WELL YOU KNOW THAT S PART OF THE AGING PROCESS .
DID NT ONE .
THAT YOUR TASTE BUDS GOES BACK TO THE SWEET TASTE .
IT REALLY IS .
OH REALLY .
YEAH UHHUH .
WELL SHE DID NT WANT TO COOK FOR HERSELF ANYMORE .
YEAH .
OH THAT S TOO MUCH TROUBLE THAT S TOO MUCH TROUBLE DID NT WANT TO COOK .
AND THE PORTIONS PEOPLE DO NT WANT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT LITTLE BITTY INDIVIDUAL MEALS I DO THAT RIGHT NOW .
YEAH .
AND I M NOT NEAR NURSING HOME AGE .
ALTHOUGH THEY VE GOT UH MEALS ON WHEELS .
YEAH .
WHICH I UNDERSTAND IS A REALLY GOOD YOU KNOW WAY TO HANDLE THAT SO THAT AT LEAST THEY EAT .
UHHUH SO AS A FAMILY YOU ALL JUST VISITED NURSING HOMES OR PROBABLY IN COLLEGE STATION THERE WAS NT A WHOLE LOT OF CHOICE .
NO I DO NT THINK THERE WAS UM I KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE FROM A A COWORKER HER MOTHERINLAW HAD BEEN IN FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND HAD DIFFERENT DEGREES OF A PLACE THAT SHE WAS IN .
UHHUH .
UM SHE WAS AMBULATORY AND SO THERE WAS A LESSER CARE UH THEN SHE GOT UH UH HIP BROKEN AND THEN UH SHE WAS NT AS AMBULATORY SO THEY .
UHHUH .
WERE ALMOST YOU KNOW TO THE POINT OF SAYING SHE CA NT BE HERE ANYMORE BUT I REMEMBER FROM HER CHECKING AROUND SHE ENDED UP STAYING AT THE ARKANSAS HOUSE I THINK OUT IN ARLINGTON SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
AND UH YOU KNOW THE TYPE OF FACILITIES WHETHER IT S A SHARED ROOM OR TWO SEPARATE ROOMS THAT SHARE UH A UH BATHROOM ALL OF THEM ALL SEEM TO SAY THAT PEOPLE THERE ARE GOING TO STEAL THEIR ITEMS .
OH YEAH THAT S A GIVEN .
THEY RE ALWAYS SAYING THAT SOMEBODY S GOING TO AND SOME OF THEM I THINK UNCONSCIOUSLY DO IT YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
AS A JUST YOU KNOW HALF SENI .
AND SOMETIMES THE THE HELP THERE DOES IT I THINK .
UH SO THEY THEY UH DO NT HAVE TOO MANY FACILITIES IT SEEMS FOR THEIR PERSONAL ITEMS .
UHHUH .
VERY LIMITED SPACE WASTE BUT UM AT LEAST THEY ALL SEEM TO HAVE UH YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT MONITOR THEIR UH MEDICATION INTAKE AND DINING FACILITIES YOU KNOW GO TO THE DINING ROOM .
UHHUH .
AND AND EAT SOME GOOD MEALS I KNOW WHEN MY FRIEND S MOTHERINLAW FIRST WENT IN I MEAN VERY ANTISOCIAL MAYBE IT TAKES A WHILE FOR THEM TO SAY OKAY WELL I LL BE WITH OTHER PEOPLE BUT .
ADAPT .
YEAH I DO NT UNDERSTAND .
YEAH .
THAT THEY THEY DO NT WANT TO BE WITH ANYBODY ELSE .
I AS I THINK I MENTIONED I WAS IN THE TRUST BUSINESS AND I VE SEEN SO MANY ELDERLY PEOPLE USUALLY THERE HAS TO BE SOME WEALTH INVOLVED WHICH IS GREAT IF IF YOU RE FINANCIALLY IF IF YOU DO NT MAKE THE DECISIONS SO LATE THAT YOU RE WORRIED ABOUT MONEY BUT .
UHHUH .
THE THE PLACES LIKE PRESBYTERIAN VILLAGE AND SOME OF THE THE RETIREMENT PLACES WHERE WHERE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF CARE SEEMS TO BE SO MUCH BETTER AS FAR AS ELDERLY PEOPLE ADAPTING THEY RE ABLE TO MOVE IN WHILE THEY RE STILL INDEPENDENT .
UHHUH .
AND STILL SOCIAL AND AND THEY DO GROUP THINGS AND THEN IF HEALTH OR OR MENTAL CAPACITY DETERIORATES THEY RE ABLE TO TAKE THE NEXT STEPS WITHOUT SO MUCH CHANGE AND OH I WISH EVERYBODY COULD GO THAT DIRECTION RATHER THAN JUST ALL OF A SUDDEN MOVING OUT OF THE HOME THEY VE ALWAYS BEEN IN IT S REALLY KIND OF DIFFICULT .
YEAH I HAVE A UM MY AUNT S MOTHER IS UH GOTTEN ILL RECENTLY AND UH SHE LIVES IN PENNSYLVANIA THEY LIVE IN ALABAMA AND THEY RE SAYING HEY WE NEED YOU TO BE CLOSER AND .
YEAH .
YOU HAVE WOMEN LIKE THAT I DO NT TO MEN IT SEEMS LIKE THE WOMEN OUT JUST OUT LIVE THEIR HUSBANDS BUT VERY RELUCTANTLY THAT .
UHHUH .
WHOLE I MEAN THEY DO NT GET OUT OF THE HOUSE THEY DO NT SOCIALIZE BUT IT S MY HOME AND I DO NT WANT TO LEAVE IT .
WELL AND IT S THE FIRST STEP IN IN ACTUALLY ACCEPTING THAT YOU ARE FAILING AND AND AGING .
UH .
YOU KNOW ONCE YOU MAKE THAT STEP YOU KNOW THAT IT S JUST GOING TO BE DOWNHILL FROM THEN ON AND AND I VE SEEN PEOPLE REALLY FIGHT IT THAT DESPERATELY NEEDED .
UM .
TO MAKE THE CHANGE THEY THEY BECAME IN FACT THAT S PROBABLY WHAT S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH MY HUSBAND S MOTHER SHE S GOING TO ENDANGER HERSELF BEFORE SHE LL WILLINGLY AND PROBABLY WILL NEVER WILLINGLY MAKE THE DECISION AND THAT SCARES ME THE THE THOUGHT OF FORCING SOMEBODY TO DO SOMETHING .
BUT IT S IT S SO LONELY YOU KNOW THEY CA NT GET OUT AND SEE ANYONE AND .
YEAH .
I MEAN IT S HARD FOR FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE I TH I THINK WHAT DO YOU HAVE THERE IT S A HOUSE .
UHHUH .
IT S WALLS AND IT S FURNITURE BUT .
NOT AS INDEPENDENCE .
THERE S NOBODY THERE DO NT YOU WANT TO BE CLOSE TO ME .
I MEAN YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
BE WITH OTHER PEOPLE I JUST DO NT UNDERSTAND WHY THEY SO MUCH WANT TO JUST STAY IN .
UHHUH .
THAT BUILDING .
UHHUH .
AND THERE S NO FAMILY THERE THEY DO NT GET TO SEE THEIR GRANDKIDS THEY DO NT GET TO SEE THEIR CHILDREN THEY JUST THERE IN THAT HOUSE .
YEAH AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE REALLY IS NT THERE .
YEAH .
OH IT S TOUGH IT REALLY IS .
THAT S FROM THE CHILD S STANDPOINT THE CHILD IS GOING WHY DO NT YOU WANT TO BE CLOSE TO ME AND YOUR OTHER FAMILY .
UHHUH .
WHAT DOES THAT HOUSE GOT ATTRACTION .
WELL THEY FEAR BEING DEPENDENT .
I KNOW THEY RE REALLY PROUD OF INDEPENDENCE .
ON SOMEBODY THEY THEY FEAR BEING A BURDEN .
UH .
TO TO FAMILY MEMBERS MY HUSBAND S MOTHER WILL HAVE MAJOR SURGERY AND WE LL FIND OUT ABOUT IT IN A CASUAL CONVERSATION .
SHE LL LET SOMETHING SLIP AND WE LL SAY WAIT A MINUTE AND AND THAT S IT SHE JUST WELL I DID NT WANT TO BOTHER YOU SHE CA NT ACCEPT THAT WE WANT TO BE THE CARE GIVERS .
WELL WHEN SHE GOT HOME WHO TOOK CARE OF HER .
YEAH WELL SHE STAYED SHE STAYED IN A TEMPORARY NURSING HOME .
OH .
UNTIL SHE WAS OKAY YOU KNOW IT S JUST BUT IT S FRIGHTENING TO US BECAUSE WE LIVE PRETTY FAR FROM HER SHE S DOWN IN TEMPLE .
UHHUH .
AND WE CA NT SEE HER OFTEN ENOUGH TO REALLY KNOW WHAT S GOING ON .
UM .
SO IT S DIFFICULT IT REALLY IS AND WE RE ALL HEADING THAT WAY AND .
YEAH MY .
HUSBAND AND I WE HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT HIS FOLKS ARE IN COLLEGE STATION AND WE VE PRETTY MUCH PLANNED THAT WE LL BE HERE IN THE DALLAS AREA AND .
UHHUH .
THERE S NOTHING TO HOLD THEM THERE IN COLLEGE STATION SINCE THEY RE RETIRED SO WE THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD GET THEM TO MOVE A LITTLE CLOSER HERE .
YEAH .
I GUESS YOU HEARD OUR CONV OUR TOPIC FOR TODAY WAS CLOTHING .
YES I CERTAINLY DID .
HOW YOU DRESS FOR WORK AND SEASON TO SEASON AND EVERYTHING .
UHHUH .
HOW DO YOU DRESS FOR WORK .
WELL UH UH ABOUT THE SAME I DRESS FOR SCHOOL I UH I AM A GRADUATE STUDENT SO I DO NT HAVE TO WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT UH WHAT I WEAR TOO MUCH OF THE TIME .
SURE .
WHICH IS NICE UH .
YOU BET .
UH UH ALTHOUGH I DO UH A LOT OF I AM A SPEECH PATHOLOGY MAJOR AND SO I DO A LOT OF CLINICAL WORK AND WHEN I DO CLINIC WORK THEN I HAVE TO UH UH LOOK MY BEST .
LOOK PROFESSIONAL .
YEAH .
UNFORTUNATELY .
YEAH I UNDERSTAND I AM A I OWN MY COMPANY I AM IN THE I AM UH MANUFACTURES REP SALES ORGANIZATION AND MY OFFICE IS A SMALL OFFICE AND I AM VERY CASUAL AND WEAR SLACKS AND SPORTS SHIRT AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
BUT THEN WHEN I TRAVEL IT IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT SITUATION .
YEAH SURE .
UH SUITS AND SPORTS COAT TIE AND THE WHOLE BIT .
UHHUH .
CAUSE YOU GO TO MEETINGS AND YOU ARE REQUIRED TO LOOK YOUR BEST AND LOOK PROFESSIONAL OF COURSE .
YEAH YEAH UH UH DO YOU FIND THAT UH ON THE AVERAGE DO PEOPLE GIVE UH MORE CREDIBILITY OR LESS CREDIBILITY TO A PROFESSIONAL UH TO PROFESSIONALLY DRESSED INDIVIDUAL .
YEAH I THINK IN TODAY S SOCIETY UH THERE IS MORE CREDIBILITY TO BE QUITE HONEST .
UHHUH .
I WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER I WILL TELL THIS REAL QUICK STORY WHEN I GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE MY FIRST JOB YEARS AGO UH THIRTY YEARS AGO TWENTYNINE YEARS AGO IN FACT WAS SELLING AGRICULTURAL FERTILIZER .
UHHUH .
I WORKED FOR THE UH SMITH DOUGLAS DIVISION OF BORDEN CHEMICAL AND I SOLD UH YOU KNOW MANURE .
UHHUH .
AND UH I WOULD GO OUT AND CALL ON FARMERS AND I WOULD ALWAYS TRY TO LOOK MY BEST WEARING SPORT COATS AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT I WAS CALLING ON GUYS THAT WORE BIB OVERALLS .
UHHUH .
AND SO ONE DAY I GOT UP AND THOUGHT WELL I WILL JUST GO CASUAL AND YOU KNOW THAT I CALLED ON A GUY WEARING EXACTLY THAT BIB OVERALLS AND HE SORT OF TOLD ME THAT HE EXPECTED ME TO BE PROFESSIONAL .
UHHUH .
AND HE SORT OF EXPECTED ME TO DRESS AS A PROFESSIONAL .
OH REALLY .
SO UH IT WAS SORT OF .
EVEN THE FARMERS .
YOU BET .
OH WOW .
EVEN BACK THEN SO I SORT UH BEEN AWARE OF MY DRESS EVER SINCE THEN AND .
UHHUH .
TRY TO LOOK MY BEST BUT HERE AGAIN I DRESS CASUAL QUITE A BIT SO .
UHHUH YEAH CERTAINLY .
IT GIVES YOU CONFIDENCE IN MY BUSINESS IF I CALL ON THE THE J C PENNEY COMPANY HERE IN DALLAS OR SAY SOMEONE SAY SEARS AND ROEBUCK IN CHICAGO THEN I WEAR COAT AND TIE IF I CALL ON JUST UH A NORMAL LITTLE DEALER OF MINE I MIGHT BE CASUAL .
UHHUH .
I CALL ON OSHMAN S SPORTING GOODS AGAIN IT MAY BE CASUAL OR IT MAY BE COAT AND TIE SO IT DEPENDS .
YEAH IT DEPENDS SURE UH SO YOU DO NT UH IF YOU HAD THE CHOICE WOULD YOU WEAR A TIE OR NOT .
UH PROBABLY NO .
UHHUH .
PROBABLY NO .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE UH TODAY I BELIEVE YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH BUT THEN IT DEPENDS ON WHO YOU ARE CALLING ON WHO YOU RE YOU LIKE YOUR MINISTER STANDING UP IN FRONT OF YOU WITH NO TIE YOU JUST UH HE WOULD BE MISSING SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
ALTHOUGH HE SHOULD NT BE EVALUATED ON THAT .
RIGHT RIGHT .
SO IT S ITS JUST DIFFERENT .
UHHUH YEAH THAT UH IF IF YOU WANTED TO UH UH REALLY GET INTO A HOT ISSUE UH WELL AT LEAST IN SOME IN SOME BELIEFS UH HOW PEOPLE DRESS WHEN THEY GO TO CHURCH IS UH IS UH SOMETIMES A PRETTY PRETTY HOT TOPIC .
YES IT IS .
UH UN UN UN UNFORTUNATELY .
I AM UH LIKE A CATHOLIC AND THE PEOPLE THAT GO TO MY CHURCH YOU KNOW CATHOLICS DRESS VERY CASUAL .
UHHUH .
A LOT OF THE TIMES PEOPLE IN JEANS AND IN WHATEVER BUT YET THE WAY I WAS RAISED I AM A CONVERTED CATHOLIC THE WAY I WAS RAISED I WAS RAISED A BAPTIST AND LIKE AS A YOUNGSTER I USE TO ALWAYS DRESS UP ALL THE TIME I GUESS THAT HAS CHANGED ALSO .
UHHUH UH YEAH I M I AM UH I GO TO THE CHURCH OF CHRIST I HAVE BEEN RAISED IN THE CHURCH OF CHRIST AND UH BUT UH I UH TOO MANY TIMES YOU HEAR YOU HEAR A LOT ABOUT WHAT WHAT YOU RE UH SUPPOSED YOU RE SUPPOSED TO LOOK YOUR SUNDAY BEST .
RIGHT .
UH UH AND DRESS AND PROPER ATTIRE AND UH AND SOMETIMES THAT REALLY DISAPPOINTS ME UH IN UH WHEN I SEE IN OTHER ECONOMIC AREAS LIKE IN KENTUCKY .
SURE .
YOU KNOW PEOPLE JUST DO NT HAVE THAT AND THEY ARE AFRAID TO GO TO CHURCH OR AFRAID TO GO SIMPLY BECAUSE .
BUT MUMBLEX .
THEY DO NT HAVE THE CLOTHES TO WEAR .
THAT IS A VERY GOOD POINT I AM FROM WEST VIRGINIA SO I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE SAYING THERE .
UHHUH .
AND IT S IT S A VERY GOOD POINT .
YEAH .
BUT YOU SHOULD NT WHAT S THE OLD SAYING YOU SHOULD NT JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER .
CERTAINLY .
AND UH EVALUATION OF AN INDIVIDUAL COURSE ALL OF IT DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF JOB RESPONSIBILITY YOU HAVE I THINK YOU HAVE TO DRESS SORT OF ACCORDINGLY .
UHHUH .
BUT UH YOU CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER AND UH OR EVALUATE A PERSON BY THAT .
UHHUH .
WHAT ABOUT SEASON TO SEASON DOES I GUESS YOUR DRESS CHANGES .
UH YEAH A LITTLE BIT UH UH OF COURSE IN THE SUMMER IF I CAN GET AWAY WITH IT I WEAR UH UH A PAIR OF SHORTS AND THAT S IT RUN AROUND BAREFOOT .
NO SHIRT OR ANYTHING BUT UH .
SO BEVERLY WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT DRUG TESTING .
I THINK IN SOME PROFESSIONS IT S UH ESSENTIAL THINGS LIKE PILOTS AND THINGS THAT INVOLVE THE SAFETY OF OTHER PEOPLE PARTICULARLY .
YEAH WE VE WE GOT A LOT OF MISTAKES HERE UH IN THE MARYLAND BALTIMORE AREA BECAUSE OF UH TRAIN CONDUCTORS .
UHHUH .
UH ON DRUGS I THINK WE VE HAD TWO TERRIBLE ACCIDENTS HERE RECENTLY AND ALSO ON UM JUST LIKE I BET YOU WITHIN FIVE DAYS A TRUCK WHERE THE UH A DUMP TRUCK WHERE THE DRIVER WAS UH HIGH ON MARIJUANA I GUESS HE SMOKED MARIJUANA FOR LUNCH AND UH DROVE HIS TRUCK UP THE BACK OF TWO SMALL CARS IN A TUNNEL THAT GOES UNDERNEATH THE UH A RIVER THAT LEADS INTO THE CHESAPEAKE BAY .
OH MY GOODNESS .
AND IT WOULD THAT WOULD TIED UP TRAFFIC FOR A LONG TIME EVERYBODY DIED THE FIRE WAS TERRIBLE IT WAS AWFUL SO YEAH I THINK YOU RE RIGHT I I THINK I IF IT S IF YOU RE IN A FIELD BUT THEN YOU KNOW WHO WOULD TEST ALL TRUCK DRIVERS .
THEY THAT S THAT IS A PROBLEM .
YOU KNOW .
AND EVERY TIME BEFORE THEY GET INTO A VEHICLE .
RIGHT YEAH .
I MEAN .
I THINK I THINK LOOKING AT ATHLETES BEING DRUG TESTED .
UHHUH .
I DO NT KNOW EVEN I THINK THE RANDOM DRUG TESTING I DO NT KNOW IN MY OWN MIND IF IT HAS REDUCED THE ATHLETES FROM TAKING DRUGS BECAUSE THEY RE STILL BEING CAUGHT .
RIGHT .
THAT MAKE SENSE .
YES UH IT MAY MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR SOME OF THEM .
YEAH AND THEN UH I THINK .
BECAUSE THEY DO NT WANT TO LOSE THAT LUCRATIVE UH .
YEAH .
CAREER .
I I I THINK IN THE LONG RUN I THINK IT S IT WOULD BE GOOD .
UHHUH .
I THINK IN THE SHORT RUN THEY THINK BECAUSE SO MANY OF THOSE TESTED HAVE GOTTEN AWAY WITH IT .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW THE THE TEST HAS NT COME DOWN HARD ON ANYONE .
UHHUH .
I DO NT I DO NT KNOW .
HOWEVER HERE IN DALLAS .
YEAH .
UH WE HAD A A PLAYER ROY TARPLEY ON THE MAVERICKS TEAM .
UHHUH .
AND HE HAD BEEN SUSPENDED A COUPLE OF TIMES BECAUSE OF DRUG TESTING AND WAS TO THE POINT HE WAS ON PROBATION HE WAS TO THE POINT THAT IF HE WAS CAUGHT ANOTHER TIME THAT HE WOULD LOSE HIS CONTRACT AND THEY WOULD NT HAVE TO PAY HIM AND THE MAVERICKS WANTED TO GET RID OF HIM BUT THEY COULD NT AFFORD TO REPLACE HIM AND STILL PAY HIS CONTRACT .
RIGHT .
AND UH JUST RECENTLY HE WAS UH MISSING FROM PRACTICE AND WHENEVER HE MISSED LIKE THAT USUALLY HE HAD SOME KIND OF PROBLEM AND .
UHHUH .
SO A MANDATORY DRUG TEST WAS DONE .
YEAH .
WAS POSITIVE SO THEY WERE ABLE TO .
GET RID OF HIM .
GET RID OF HIM AND NOT HAVE TO PAY HIS CONTRACT .
RIGHT YEAH B .
AND SO IN HIS CASE HE LOST HIS WHOLE CAREER HE S BEEN IN THE PAPER IN JAIL AND IT S JUST BEEN AWFUL .
YEAH .
AND TALK ABOUT A TERRIBLE ROLE MODEL .
RIGHT I I THINK THAT THAT THAT S A TERRIBLE THI YOU KNOW IT S REALLY FUNNY THOUGH UM I GUESS MY DAD WAS HIT BY A A DRUNK DRIVER WHO WAS ALSO HIGH .
UM .
UM WHEN I WAS PROBABLY EIGHTEEN MY SENIOR YEAR IN HIGH SCHOOL .
OH MY GOODNESS .
AND UM THOUGH HE S ALIVE TODAY AND EVERYTHING WORKED OUT FINE IT IT IT HAPPENED ABOUT TWO BLOCKS FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL AND A FRIEND CAME AND GOT ME AND I WAS THERE AND I COULD SMELL THE DOPE AND I COULD SEE THE BEER CANS FROM THE GUY THAT HIT HIM .
UHHUH .
AND NOTHING EVER HAPPENED AND FROM .
OH THAT S TERRIBLE .
FROM THAT POINT ON I BECAME SO ANTI DRUNK DRIVING .
UHHUH .
NOW I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DRINK I THINK THAT S AN ADULT RESPONSIBILITY WHATEVER BUT I REALLY UH I M SO ANTI DRUNK DRIVING AND AND DRUGS HAVE UH LONG LASTING EFFECTS .
UHHUH .
AND I GUESS WHEN I YOUNGER I WAS UM PROBABLY A LITTLE MORE LIBERAL ON THE SUBJECT .
I THINK MOST OF US ARE .
YEAH BUT AS I VE AS SOON AS THAT HAPPENED I GUESS WHEN I WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD IF YOU D HAVE ASKED ME I D HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS FINE .
UHHUH .
BUT BY THE TIME I WAS NINETEEN MY OPINION HAD TOTALLY CHANGED .
YES IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE UH SOME FRIENDS WHOSE SON WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK WAS HIT HEAD ON BY A DRUNK DRIVER .
UHHUH .
THE DRUNK AND HIS WIFE IN THE CAR WERE KILLED AND UH BOBBY MISSED HIS WHOLE JUNIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL .
RIGHT .
HE WENT THROUGH SURGERY AFTER SURGERY .
UM TRACTION AND ALL THAT TERRIBLE STUFF .
AND FOR A LONG TIME THEY DID NT EVEN KNOW WHETHER HE D BE NORMAL AGAIN AND HE AS FAR AS HIS ATH ATHLETICS HE S LOST ALL OF THAT .
RIGHT .
HE UH HAS BEEN TUTORED AND HE LL CATCH UP IN SCHOOL AND EVERYTHING BUT HE S STILL NOT BACK WHERE HE WAS .
RIGHT YEAH I DO NT THINK SOMEBODY .
HE MAY NEVER HAVE ALL THOSE MOTOR SKILLS BACK .
YEAH YOU DO NT YOU DO NT YOU DO NT HAVE THE RIGHT TO INTERFERE IN SOMEBODY ELSE S LIFE .
NO .
I CA NT EVEN SAY YOU KNOW I WOULD NT EVEN SAY RUIN SOMEBODY S LIFE YOU DO NT HAVE THE RIGHT TO INTERFERE IN SOMEBODY S LIFE .
ANOTHER THING THAT WE SAW HERE RECENTLY ONE OF SOME OF OUR HIGH SCHOOL KIDS WERE OUT GOOFING AROUND IN A PARK AREA THAT A A TRAIN TRACK RAN THROUGH .
UHHUH .
AND ONE BOY WHO HAD BEEN DRINKING DECIDED FOR SOME STUPID REASON TO TRY TO PLAY WITH THE TRAIN WELL HE THE TRAIN MISSED HIM BUT UH A BIG MIRROR TYPE THING STICKING OUT LIKE A METAL THING STICKING OUT HIT HIM IN THE HEAD .
YEAH .
HE WAS IN A COMA FOR .
UHHUH .
FOUR MONTHS HE S OUT OF THE COMA NOW AND EVENTUALLY THEY THINK HE WILL COME BACK BUT YOU DO NT KNOW THAT AND .
RIGHT .
BUT HE S LOST HE WAS AN OUTSTANDING FOOTBALL PLAYER .
WELL I WAS JUST WONDERING IF YOU HAD HAD ANY EXPERIENCE WITH UM THE CARE OF THE ELDERLY .
YES I HAVE IN FACT UH JUST A LITTLE OVER JUST A LITTLE LESS THAN A YEAR AGO UH MY MOTHER WENT TO BE WITH THE LORD AND WE CARED FOR HER THE LAST OH SEVENTEEN MONTHS OF HER LIFE HERE IN THE AT HOME .
UHHUH .
ASIDE FROM UH HAVING TO UH TAKE HER TO THE HOSPITAL AND UH YOU KNOW THOSE TIMES WELL SHE WAS THERE IN THE THE REGULAR HOSPITAL .
RIGHT .
AND THEN SHE WAS DIAGNOSED HAVING INOPERABLE TYPE OF CANCER AND SO THE DOCTOR ELECTED TO HAVE HER UH FINISH OUT UH IN THE HOSPICE PROGRAM .
UHHUH .
AND UH I AS FAR AS I M CONCERNED THAT IS FAR AND ABOVE ANY NURSING HOME BECAUSE UH SHE S AROUND HER OWN FA YOU KNOW THE THE ELDERLY PARENT IN QUESTION IS AROUND THEIR OWN FAMILY THE UH HOSPICE PROGRAM PROVIDES A HOSPITAL TYPE BED WELL IT IS A HOSPITAL BED AND ALL THE OXYGEN .
STUFF AND A UH AND A VISITING NURSE AT LEAST EVERY OTHER DAY ET CETERA ET CETERA ET CETERA .
WELL THAT S NICE .
AND IT S ALL TAKEN CARE OF BY BY UH MEDICARE UH AND UH IT IT S IT S REALLY NEAT UH AND I YOU KNOW I WOULD NT I WOULD NT BANISH UH MY OLD LOVED ONE TO A TO A WAREHOUSE .
NO .
AND THAT S THAT S WHAT I BASICALLY UH VIEW A NURSING HOME AS A WAREHOUSE SO THAT S .
IT S REALLY SAD .
PARDON ME .
IT S REALLY A SAD SITUATION .
UHHUH MUMBLEX .
AND UH I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE STRUGGLE WITH I .
OH .
I GUESS THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE SPOUSE OF WHOEVER YOU KNOW THE PARENT IS .
UHHUH .
DOES NT ALWAYS WANT THE INLAW LIVING IN THE HOUSE IS THAT RIGHT .
RIGHT .
WELL THAT S REALLY SAD .
YEAH I KNOW BUT UH IN THIS CASE UH SPOUSE AND I UH ARE UH WE RE ARE ARE UH UNITED IN THIS AREA BECAUSE .
UHHUH .
I GUESS HER FATHER HER GRANDFATHER AND GRANDMOTHER BOTH LIVED WITH UH HER PARENTS UH TH TH THEIR GOLDEN YEARS TOO SO .
UHHUH .
THIS IS NT LIKE UH UH JUST ONE ONE UH INSTANCE IN FACT UH HER UH UH EXPERIENCES WERE WERE INVALUABLE .
UHHUH .
TO ME UH IN FACT I DO NT KNOW IF I COULD HAVE UH HELD UP UH YOU KNOW WITHOUT MY WIFE UH HELPING IN THIS .
RIGHT .
THIS IN THIS CASE .
YES WELL I KNOW WHEN THE I REMEMBER BEING A CHILD AND MY GRANDMOTHER HAD HAD SE SEVERAL STROKES AND THINGS AND THAT WE HAD MY PARENTS TRIED TO KEEP HER IN THE HOUSE AND THEY DID FOR A LONG TIME I COULD NT .
UHHUH .
TELL YOU HOW LONG UNTIL SHE GOT UH WHERE SHE HAD TO HAVE COMPLETE CARE AND SO .
UHHUH .
THEY COULD NT YOU KNOW KEEP HER IN THE HOUSE ANYMORE AND IT WAS REALLY HARD ON EVERYONE SHE HAD TO HAVE YOU KNOW TWENTYFOUR HOUR A DAY CARE AND I DO NT REMEMBER MUCH ABOUT IT EXCEPT THAT THERE WAS A NURSING HOME AT THAT TIME .
UHHUH .
JUST A BLOCK OR TWO FROM OUR HOUSE .
UHHUH .
AND THAT UM THEY PUT HER THERE AND WE ALL WENT JUST CONSTANTLY UNTIL SHE DIED .
OH OKAY .
BUT IT WAS VERY HARD ON EVERYONE TO SEE YOU KNOW GRANDMOTHER BE LIKE THAT AND I DO NT KNOW THAT YOU KNOW I DO NT BEING SO YOUNG I DO NT REMEMBER WHY .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW WHAT WAS WHY SHE HAD TO GO THERE .
WELL MAYBE WELL AS AS YOU SAY THE CARE OF OF GRANDMOTHER OR WAS WAS JUST SUCH THAT SUCH MOM AND DAD COULD NT HANDLE IT .
UHHUH WELL I DO REMEMBER THAT SHE WAS YOU KNOW TOTALLY INCAPABLE OF TAKING CARE OF HERSELF IN ANY WAY .
OH BOY YEAH .
AND THAT THAT THEY COULD NT THEY FOUND THAT THEY COULD NOT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW GIVE HER THE HYGIENIC CARE AND EVERYTHING THAT SHE NEEDED .
UHHUH WELL THEN THEN THERE S ALMOST THEN THERE S ALMOST NO NO UH UH CHOICE LEFT TO HER THEN .
NO BUT LIKE YOU SAY THERE IS A TENDENCY FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABANDONED THOUGH YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
IN THE NURSING HOME I DO REMEMBER THE OTHER PATIENTS THERE UH BEING REAL EXCITED WHEN WE CAME TO SEE OUR OWN GRANDMOTHER BECAUSE THEY GOT SOME INTERACTION WITH SOMEONE .
RIGHT IN FACT JUST UH JUST UH SIT AND CHAT WITH THEM FOR FIVE MINUTES AND AND BE INTERESTED IN WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY .
UHHUH .
REGARDLESS OF WHAT IT IS .
RIGHT RIGHT AND I GUESS THAT S HARD ON PEOPLE TO GIVE GIVE UP THEIR LIVES IF THEY RE BUSY THEY DO NT YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
IT S EASY TO ABANDON PEOPLE BECAUSE WE DO HAVE THE NURSING HOMES I GUESS .
RIGHT .
IF YOU CAN AFFORD THEM BUT ANYWAY WELL I M .
AND THEN THEN .
GLAD IT WORKED OUT GOOD FOR YOUR FAMILY .
OH YEAH IT DID AND I WAS JUST PR I JUST PRAISED THE LORD THAT THAT WE WERE ABLE TO UH HAVE UH UH .
OKAY UH DO YOU HAVE YOUNG CHILDREN .
UHHUH I HAVE GOT TWO ONE IS UH TWO AND THE OTHER ONE S FOUR AND UH THIS IS MY FIRST YEAR OF STAYING HOME I VE ALWAYS HAD THEM IN CHILD CARE .

OH UHHUH .
UHHUH AND THEN I JUST DECIDED THAT I WAS JUST MISSING A LOT OF THEIR TIME WHETHER THEY WERE SO LITTLE AND AND I COULD NT GET OFF OF WORK AS OFTEN AS I WANTED TO WHEN THEY WERE ILL SO I JUST DECIDED IT WAS PROBABLY BEST JUST TO STAY HOME FOR A WHILE UNTIL THEY WERE A LITTLE MORE UH INDEPENDENT AND UH I COULD GO BACK TO WORK .
I KNOW THAT IN RAISING MY CHILDREN UH I WAS FORTUNATE I DID NT HAVE TO WORK WE DID NT NECESSARILY HAVE A LOT OF THINGS .
YEAH THAT S HOW IT S GOING NOW .

HER COOKBOOK AND SHE TALKS ABOUT CATERING AND UH YOU KNOW GOES INTO GOES INTO ALL THAT AND THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF UH UH DIFFERENT TYPES OF PARTIES YOU KNOW DIFFERENT TYPES OF FOODS .
OH WELL DO YOU WORK IN A UH IN A SETTING WHERE YOU UH ARE IN THE FOOD BUSINESS .
UM MY FATHER OWNS A RESTAURANT .
OH IN UH .
IT S IT S JUST A UH C A CAFE SO IT S NOT REALLY ANYTHING YOU KNOW THAT I WANT TO IT S NOT THE SAME .
IS IT IN DALLAS .
UH IT S IN LEWISVILLE .
OKAY ALL RIGHT .
SO YOU GRADUATED FROM WHICH .
HIGH SCHOOL .
TRINITY .
TRINITY OKAY .
AND THAT S A PUBLIC SCHOOL OR PRIVATE .
THAT S PUBLIC .
HUH OKAY I HAVE TO GET TO KNOW THIS AREA .
A LITTLE BETTER I GUESS .
UH WELL IS YOUR FATHER S CAFE UH ONE THAT YOU COULD CATER OUT OF .
NO UHHUH IT S NOT .
UM AND HE S NOT INTERESTED IN LETTING HIS TWENTYONE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER EXPERIMENT WITH IT PROBABLY .
UH .
WELL LET S SEE WHAT ELSE FOR CATERING .
UH .
LET S SEE WHAT ABOUT HAWAIIAN LUAU .
OH THAT WOULD BE GOOD .
COULD HAVE UH UH FRUITS AND AND PINEAPPLE UH LET S SEE UH .
AND YOU COULD ACTUALLY GO WITH UH A CHICKEN IF YOU WANTED TO .
I THINK I THINK DECORATING YOUR FOOD IS YOU KNOW REALLY .
HI WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT GUN CONTROL .
WELL UH SORT OF MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT IT I GUESS UH UH I I S I LEAN MORE TOWARDS THE CONTROL SIDE THAN THAN TOWARDS YOU KNOW JUST THE THE FREE FREE ARMY UH ON THE OTHER HAND I IT S IT S SORT OF AN ISSUE OF OF UH I M NOT I M NOT A GREAT FAN OF OF GOVERNMENT CONTROL IN GENERAL AND SO IT S IT S KIND OF A TOUGH ISSUE WHAT ABOUT YOURSELF .
WELL I GUESS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO TO SAY THAT PERHAPS SOMEPLACE IN THE MIDDLE WHERE PEOPLE COULD SOMEHOW QUALIFY OR UH HAVE A LEGITIMATE USE FOR THE THE THE WEAPON I SUPPOSE .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE ALSO LIVING IN THIS AREA THE THE PROBLEMS IN D C COME HOME VERY QUICKLY .
I M I M SURE YEAH UH SO YOU WOULD TAKE A POSITION WHERE SOMEBODY WITHOUT WITHOUT A UH UH SPECIFIC USE IN OTHER WORDS IF THEY JUST WANTED TO HAVE A A GUN TO HAVE IN THEIR HOME UH YOU WOULD NT YOU WOULD NT LIKE THEM TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT IS THAT .
WELL I M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THAT BUT I THINK SOMEHOW UH SAFETY COURSES OR I DO NT KNOW WHETHER THIS COULD BE SOMETHING THAT WAS DONE IN SCHOOL BUT SOMEHOW PEOPLE I D LIKE TO KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE WHO HAD THEM AT LEAST KNEW WHAT THE RESPONSIBILITIES WERE WHETHER THEY FOLLOWED THEM OR NOT YOU KNOW AT LEAST THERE S THE MORAL ISSUE THAT THEY THEY KNEW BETTER .
UH .
WHICH IS SORT OF YOU KNOW FLAKY BUT STILL .
YEAH I I HAVE UH I HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THAT THE THE MAJORITY OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE WITH GUNS ARE NOT ARE ARE PROBABLY NOT FROM THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ARE BUYING THEM THROUGH LEGITIMATE CHANNELS ANYWAY UH THAT MAY BE WRONG UH YOU KNOW I MEAN CERTAINLY THERE THERE ARE CASES OF OF YOU KNOW CHILDREN WHO FIND THEIR PARENTS GUN OR SOMETHING AND AND SHOOT A BROTHER OR SISTER OR YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE THAT THAT NEED TO BE DEFINITELY AVOIDED AND THAT S THAT S CERTAINLY WITHIN THE CHANNELS RIGHT .
UHHUH .
BUT UH A LOT OF THE THE CRIME I THINK THAT GOES ON I I DO NT KNOW TO WHAT THE DEGREE THE GUNS ARE ARE PURCHASED THROUGH REGULAR CHANNELS OR THEY RE ILLEGAL GUNS .
YEAH I DO NT KNOW THIS MORNING IN OUR PAPER IT THERE WAS AN ARTICLE ABOUT SOMEBODY WHO HAD BOUGHT THREE GUNS IN VIRGINIA BECAUSE ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GET A DRIVER S LICENSE SO HE WENT OVER THERE AND GOT A DRIVER S LICENSE THE SAME DAY BOUGHT THREE GUNS AND WENT UP TO NEW YORK AND SOLD THEM FOR YOU KNOW VERY HIGH MARKUPS NOW IN A SENSE THAT S A LEGAL .
UHHUH .
WAY OF GETTING THE GUNS BUT CERTAINLY THE .
YEAH .
THE PURPOSE IS NOT VERY LEGAL .
UHHUH YEAH I I MEAN I THINK UH SOME STA OR I I DO NT KNOW IF IT S BEEN ACTUALLY BEEN IMPLEMENTED I THINK SO UH OR AT LEAST THERE S BEEN TALK ABOUT DOING UH YOU KNOW LIKE WAITING PERIODS AND .
UHHUH .
AND THINGS LIKE THAT UH AND AND UH YOU KNOW I I THINK STUFF LIKE THAT IS PERFECTLY GOOD I MEAN BASICALLY IF YOU IF YOU DO NT INTEND TO DO ANYTHING STRA YOU KNOW IF YOU IF YOU RE BUYING IT FOR LEGITIMATE PURPOSES WAITING TEN DAYS SHOULD NT BE A PROBLEM .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW AND AND THINGS I DO NT KNOW I VE YOU KNOW I I DO NT OWN A GUN AND AND DO NT REALLY WANT ONE .
AND I D JUST AS SOON A LOT FEWER PEOPLE DID .
UHHUH .
UH BUT ON THE OTHER HAND YOU KNOW UH LIKE I SAY I KIND OF KIND OF AGAINST GOVERNMENT CONTROL IN GENERAL UH .
RIGHT AND I SUPPOSE COM UH YOU KNOW C TOTAL BAN WOULD LEAD TO MORE ILLEGAL WEAPONS .
YEAH AND I YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT BANNING IS THAT YOU KNOW THERE THERE ARE SO MANY WEAPONS OUT THERE THAT THAT THEY RE NOT GOING TO DISAPPEAR ANYTIME SOON UH AND THEY RE ALREADY I KNOW THERE S A READY MARKET FOR THEM YOU KNOW IN THE S THE STOLEN STOLEN GUNS CAN BE SOLD I MEAN THE FIRST THING A A A BURGLAR WILL PICK UP IF HE CAN IS A GUN .
UHHUH UHHUH .
RIGHT BECAUSE UH BECAUSE THEY THEY CAN BE SO EASILY SOLD AND YOU KNOW THEY RE THEY RE I DO NT KNOW HOW MANY MILLIONS OF GUNS HAVE BEEN SOLD IN THIS COUNTRY BUT UH IT S NOT LIKE THEY RE GOING TO DISAPPEAR ALL OF A SUDDEN UH EVEN IF YOU DO DO A TOTAL BAN ON THEM UH IT S A REAL TOUGH PROBLEM .
RIGHT .
I I DO NT KNOW I DO NT KNOW WHERE I REALLY COME DOWN ON IT I MEAN I I GREW UP MY FATHER WAS A HUNTER RIGHT AND THAT S AND THAT S SORT OF ALMOST A SEPARATE ISSUE I THINK WE VE GENERALLY BEEN TALKING ABOUT HANDGUNS AND THAT KIND OF THING RIGHT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND .
BUT THAT S TRUE I MEAN SOME PEOPLE GREW UP WITH GUNS IN THE HOUSE WE NEVER HAD ANY IN THE HOUSE .
UHHUH .
SO TO ME THE YOU KNOW THE FIRST TIME I SAW A GUN UP CLOSE WAS A PRETTY SCARY THING .
UM .
AND I M NOT SURE THAT S GOOD EITHER .
YEAH WELL WE YOU KNOW WE I GREW UP WITH THEM I NEVER REALLY TOOK TO HUNTING I MEAN I DID SOME OF IT BUT UH YOU KNOW WE DID NT HAVE ANY WE NEVER HAD ANY HANDGUNS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT WE HAD YOU KNOW HAD SHOTGUNS FOR FOR QUAIL AND PHEASANT HUNTING AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
AND YOU KNOW IT WAS A WHOLE DIFFERENT THING AND AND GUN SAFETY WAS TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY AND IT WAS YOU KNOW I MEAN BEFORE WE GO HUNTING WE WE TOOK SAFETY COURSES UH YOU KNOW AND AND AND IT BUT YOU KNOW THAT S THAT SEEMS TO ME TO BE JUST A WHOLE ANOTHER ISSUE .
UHHUH .
UH YOU KNOW THE THE THING THE THE YEAH I M NOT CERTAIN THAT PEOPLE ARE ARE ARE TERRIBLY CONCERNED ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE .
WELL I VE BEEN REAL UM THINKING I D LOVE TO BUY A NEW CAR .
OH .
RIGHT NOW IF I COULD AFFORD IT BUT WE HAVE TWO CARS RIGHT NOW AND WE RE STILL PAYING ON THEM BUT I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE ONE OF THESE NEW MINI VANS I VE GOT TWO LITTLE ONES AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE JUST THE PERFECT FAMILY CAR .
I RIGHT NOW MY CAR IS TERMINALLY ILL .
OH .
SO I AM REALLY LOOKING AT UH FACING THE PURCHASE OF A CAR AND .
UH WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IS SO TOTALLY IMPRACTICAL FOR ME THAT .
I WO NT DO IT BUT .
WHAT IS IT .
UH WELL I WOULD LIKE FOR ONE TIME IN MY LIFE TO HAVE A CONVERTIBLE .
OH .
AND UH YOU KNOW I DO NT EVEN LIKE THE WIND BLOWING IN ON ME SO I DO NT KNOW WHY I THINK I WANT ONE BUT I DO .
UH I WILL PROBABLY STAY WITH A FOREIGN MAKE .
I VE HAD REAL GOOD LUCK WITH THEM .
YEAH WE HAVE UM WE HAVE WE WENT OUT TO BUY AN AMERICAN CAR SO WE BOUGHT UM A CHEVY NOVA ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO AND AND WE OPENED UP THE THE HOOD AND IT SAID TOYOTA MADE IN JAPAN RIGHT ACROSS THE FRONT OF ALL THE ENGINE PARTS .
IS THAT RIGHT .
UHHUH TOYOTA UH WELL THE CHEVY NOVA IS THE SAME CAR AS THE TOYOTA CAMRY UH AT THAT TIME WAS THE SAME CAR SO THEY JUST PUT DIFFERENT NAMES ON THEM DEPENDING ON WHO THEY RE BEING SHIPPED TO .
OH .
I THOUGHT THAT WAS PRETTY N .
WELL I DID NT REALIZE IT I KNEW THAT ONE OF THE THAT NISSAN WHICH IS TOYOTA HAD UH JOINED WITH HAD A PLANT OVER HERE AND AND I .
DID NT KNOW IF IT WAS GENERAL MOTORS OR WHO BUT I I NEVER THOUGHT OF .
YEAH .
I KNOW UH YOU THINK IT S A CHEVROLET IN THE GOOD OLD U S A .
UHHUH UHHUH THAT S WHY WE WERE SO SURPRISED TO SEE TOYOTA WRITTEN I MEAN IMPRINTED ON THE ENGINE IT WAS REAL INTERESTING .
HUH .
BUT UH I WITH SO MANY OPTIONS NOW AVAILABLE YOU KNOW WHERE WHERE CARS ARE CONCERNED IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THERE IS THERE S ALMOST TOO MUCH OF A CHOICE ANYMORE YOU KNOW THERE S SO MANY DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND SO MANY DIFFERENT PRICES AND WHO HAS THIS CASH BACK AND WHATEVER I THINK THAT IF I WERE REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT LOOKING FOR ANOTHER CAR I WOULD TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE PRICE NATURALLY BUT UM YOU KNOW I WOULD REALLY WANT SOMETHING THAT I WOULD WANT FOR THAT MUCH MONEY FOR TEN OR TWELVE OR FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OR WHATEVER .
WELL YEAH AND THAT S MINIMUM .
OH YEA DEFINITELY .
IT YOU KNOW IT S .
IT S A MAJOR PURCHASE .
NOW WHAT WE USED TO PAY FOR HOMES IS NOW WHAT A CAR .
CAN COST .
I CAN NOT IMAGINE THAT YOU KNOW SOMEBODY I HEARD A COMMERCIAL OR SOMETHING ABOUT A SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLAR CAR ABOUT OH IT WOULD HOW .
EXCITING IT IS TO MAKE THAT KIND OF A PURCHASE AND I THOUGHT I DO NT THINK I D FIND THAT EXCITING I D BE WONDERING YOU KNOW HERE I AM BUYING THIS EXPENSIVE OF A CAR AND MY HOUSE IS NT WORTH THAT MUCH MONEY .
IF THEY HELD THEIR VALUE THAT WOULD BE ONE THING .
THAT S TRUE .
BUT WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT WHEN YOU DRIVE THEM OFF OF THE SHOW LOT .
THEY RE IMMEDIATELY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS DEPRECIATED .
YEAH .
AND YOU KNOW THAT I DO NT KNOW THAT .
I LL GO WITH I VE BOUGHT A NEW CAR THE LAST THREE THAT I VE BOUGHT AND I DO NT KNOW THAT I LL BUY A BRAND NEW ONE AGAIN .
YEAH WELL WE HAD A PRETTY WE BOUGHT OUR CHEVROLET BRAND NEW AND THEN WE BOUGHT A USED CAR JUST A MINUTE I LL CHANGE YOUR DIAPER .
THEN WE BOUGHT OUR OUR NEXT CAR USED AND UH WE HAD BETTER LUCK WITH OUR USED CAR AND I LIKE IT MORE IT COST US LESS MONEY AND WE GOT MORE FEATURES AND AIRCONDITIONING AND WHATEVER ON IT THEN WE DID ON OUR BRAND NEW ONE FOR TWICE AS MUCH MONEY .
WELL I M I M SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING GOING THAT ROUTE INSTEAD OF A BRAND NEW CAR .
IF YOU CAN FIND ONE THAT S R UH YOU KNOW RELIABLE IF YOU CAN GET SOMEONE THAT YOU TRUST TO BUY ONE FROM OR YOU KNOW MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN HAVE IT CHECKED OUT WELL ENOUGH .
WELL SOME PEOPLE YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE HAVE TO HAVE A NEW CAR EVERY YEAR .
UH I WOULD NT .
OR IT YOU KNOW AT THE MOST EVERY TWO YEARS AND THEY DO NT DRIVE THEM THAT MUCH ESPECIALLY .
YOUR FOREIGN CARS YOU KNOW .
UHHUH SH .
LIKE A HONDA OR UH A TOYOTA SIX THOUSAND IS JUST GETTING BROKEN IN FOR THEM .
YEAH .
AND IF I CAN FIND ONE OR A REPOSSESSION .
THAT S WE BOUGHT ONE LIKE THAT .
AND WITH THE BANKS BEING IN SUCH FINANCIAL YOU KNOW PROBLEMS NOW THAT PEOPLE YOU CAN FIND THE BANKS WILLING TO SELL YOU A CAR .
UHHUH WE BOUGHT ONE CAR THAT WAY AND HAD WE BOUGHT IT REAL REASONABLY AND IT WAS IN REAL NICE CONDITION SO BECAUSE APPARENTLY WHATEVER THE BANK GET .
NOW THEN I THINK THAT .
UHHUH .
ARE YOU THERE .
YEAH I M HERE .
ALL RIGHT DO YOU HAVE ANY ONE THAT HAS BEEN IN A NURSING HOME .
UH WELL ONLY MY UM MY GRANDMOTHER BUT FOR A VERY SHORT TIME UM SHE UH SHE WAS JUST MORE OR LESS IN A IN A NURSING HOME FOR UH RECOVERY FROM A BROKEN HIP .
OH .
BECAUSE SHE COULD RECEIVE MORE MEDICAL ATTENTION .
YES .
BUT UM THAT PHYSICAL THERAPY WAS THERE AND WHATEVER BUT I THINK IN VISITING HER THERE UM IT WAS VERY OBVIOUS TO SEE THAT A LOT OF THE PEOPLE IN THE NURSING HOME THAT SHE WAS IN UH WERE NT THERE MENTALLY UH SHE WAS PROBABLY THE ONLY PERSON IN THE UM WHOLE NURSING HOME THAT UH STILL HAD ALL OF HER MENTAL FACILITIES ABOUT HER SO THAT WAS UH THAT WAS VERY DISHEARTENING .
WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK CAN BE DONE ABOUT THAT I MEAN WHAT CAN WE DO .
OH YEAH IT S REALLY HARD I GUESS I I COME FROM A FAMILY OF UM OF UH TAKE CARE OF YOUR ELDERS I GUESS UH MY MY DAD S MOTHER IS AN INVALID AND SHE LIVES WITH MY AUNT AND UNCLE AND THEY CARE FOR HER YOU KNOW ALL AROUND THE CLOCK THOUGH SHE S NOT UH SHE DOES NT HAVE TO RECEIVE CONSTANT MEDICAL ATTENTION SHE BECAUSE OF ARTHRITIS SHE S JUST UNABLE TO GET OUT OF BED SO I GUESS YOU KNOW THERE S THAT FAMILY COMMITMENT UM I KNOW THAT MY PARENTS MY MOTHER IS TRYING TO LET MY GRANDMOTHER STAY IN HER HOUSE AS LONG AS SHE CAN UM .
WELL I CAN REMEMBE OF COURSE I M .
YEAH .
OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER WHEN THE FAMILY OR THE CHURCH TOOK CARE OF ALL OF THIS .
RIGHT YEAH .
WE DID NOT HAVE TO CALL ON ON SOMEONE ELSE AND I FEEL NO YOU TELL ME HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT .
YEAH WELL PROBABLY I THINK AS LONG AS THE PERSON S ABLE TO UM TO UNDERSTAND WHAT S GOING ON AROUND THEM AND I THINK YOU KNOW MY GRANDMOTHER RIGHT NOW IS STILL ABLE TO WALK AROUND AND SHE S STILL ABLE TO UH TO DO SOME THINGS FOR HERSELF THOUGH SHE GETS MEALS ON WHEELS .
YEAH .
WHICH I THINK IS A GREAT THING BECAUSE UM IT SAVES PEOPLE FROM HAVING TO PREPARE FOOD FOR HER BECAUSE YOU WORRY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HER LEAVING A STOVE ON OR WHATEVER ALTHOUGH SHE DOES MOST THINGS VERY WELL IT STILL MAKES A LITTLE BIT EASIER FOR HER .
CERTAINLY D .
UH .
I WORKED WITH AN AGENCY IN WEST TEXAS THAT THEY IT S WHERE THEY REALLY STARTED THIS CONCEPT OF MEALS ON WHEELS .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK IT S SUCH A VALUABLE THING FOR OUR ELDERLY .
UHHUH .
IF THEY DID NT HAVE TO YOU KNOW GO INTO A KITCHEN .
RIGHT .
MY MOTHER EXPIRED JUST JUST A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO AND WE HAD FINALLY SHE DID NT WANT TO LIVE WITH EITHER MY SISTER OR ME .
UHHUH .
BUT WE WE GOT FOUND A RETIREMENT CENTER FOR HER AND IT WAS BEAUTIFUL AND THEY HAD ALL THESE THEY DID NT EVEN HAVE NURSING CARE THERE SO UNTIL AS LONG AS MOTHER WAS YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
MOBILE AND .
RIGHT .
GOT HER FOOD AND SHE WAS WITH PEOPLE WITH WHOM SHE ENJOYED .
YEAH THAT I THINK YOU KNOW IT S REALLY FUNNY I HAVE TWO GRANDMOTHERS STILL ALIVE AND MY ONE GRANDMOTHER SAYS THAT SHE WANTS TO STAY IN HER HOUSE FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE SHE S LIKE OPENLY TOLD PEOPLE SHE S ALWAYS BEEN VERY GOOD ABOUT KNOWING YES SHE S EIGHTYNINE AND SHE SAID THAT SHE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO STAY IN HER HOUSE AS LONG AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT S HER HOME .
SURE .
BUT WHEN THE TIME COMES UM SHE AND SHE CA NT DO THINGS AND SHE HAS TO BE CARED FOR WHATEVER SHE WOULD PREFER AND SHE S ACTUALLY SAID THIS TO MOVE INTO SOME TYPE OF COMMUNITY WHERE SHE HAS HER OWN APARTMENT UH PROBABLY WITH LIKE A LIVING SPACE AND A BEDROOM .
YES SIR .
WITH MAYBE A KITCHENETTE SO THAT IF SHE YOU KNOW IF SHE WANTS TO FIX HERSELF SOMETHING LIGHT SHE CAN DO THAT BUT IF SHE WANTS TO GO TO A MEAL SHE CAN GO DOWN THE HALLWAY UH TO A ROOM WHERE THERE S A CAFETERIA .
UHHUH .
AND THERE S OTHER PEOPLE THERE AND SHE CAN MIX WITH THEM AND TALK WITH THEM AND ENJOY THEIR COMPANY .
BEING A WIDOW .
UHHUH .
I FIND THAT EATING ALONE IS ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS .
YES .
I HAVE TO DO .
UHHUH .
I HAVE JUST RECENTLY RETIRED AND I AM FINDING IT EXTREMELY HARD TO ADJUST TO .
RIGHT .
SO UH MOTHER HAD THE LITTLE KITCHENETTE .
UHHUH .
AND SHE COULD DO ALL THESE FINE THINGS THAT SHE JUST HA HAD A MICROWAVE HAD TO POP .
RIGHT .
HER POPCORN NOW THIS IS WONDERFUL .
UHHUH .
BUT WHEN IT CAME TIME FOR A FULL MEAL THEN MOTHER WAS ABLE TO GO WITH PEOPLE .
RIGHT .
AND AND ENJOY .
YEAH I THINK I THINK THAT PROBABLY UNTIL UNTIL THEY RE REALLY INVALIDS UH THE ELDERLY ARE INVALIDS I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO INTERACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE .
OH I THINK SO .
IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY CHOOSE IF THEY CAN IF THE FAMILY CAN AFFORD IT .
WELL .
I MEAN UM SEE I KNOW THAT MY GRANDMOTHER WOULD LIKE TO STAY IN HER HOUSE AND MY PARENTS ACTUALLY SAID YOU KNOW THAT THEY MAY HAVE TO TAKE THEIR END SOMETIME SO BECAUSE YOU KNOW MY GRANDMA SHE SAYS WHO SHE WANTS TO LIVE WITH SHE S PRETTY YOU KNOW SHE LETS PEOPLE KNOW .
SO DO YOU HAVE P C S .
I HAVE A PERSONAL COMPUTER AT HOME .
IT S AN .
A T COMPATIBLE .
I DO NT USE IT VERY MUCH ANY MORE .
I USED TO USE IT QUITE A BIT .
UHHUH .
I ALSO HAVE A P C AT WORK THAT I USE AS A TERMINAL .
I DO SOME P C STAND ALONE WORK ON IT AND I CAN TRANSFER DATA BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE P C AND THE MAIN FRAME .
UHHUH .
WHAT ABOUT YOU .
DO YOU OWN A COMPUTER .
UM WELL I SORT OF OWN A COMPUTER .
WE HAVE TWO P C S AT HOME BUT NEITHER .
ONE DO WE REALLY OWN .
UM .
ARE YOU LEASING THEM .
NO BOTH OF THEM ARE SORT OF WORK RELATED AND .
LOANERS FROM WORK .
YEAH THAT S THE NICER WAY RIGHT .
DO YOU WORK FOR T I .
NO NO .
UM I ACTUALLY I M DOING CONSULTING RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I JUST HAD A BABY AND MY HUSBAND S WORKING AT BELL LABS BUT HE S REALLY FROM FRANCE AND THESE COMPUTERS ACTUALLY ARE FROM FRANCE .
WHAT BRAND ARE THEY .
ONE OF THEM S A COMPAQ .
UHHUH .
IT S A THREE EIGHTYSIX .
I M JEALOUS .
AND THE OTHER IS ACTUALLY A .
I B M P C COMPATIBLE IT S A THREE EIGHTYSIX I GUESS IT S TWENTYFIVE YEAH THREE EIGHT SIX TWENTYFIVE C MAYBE I DO NT KNOW NO WE DO NT HAVE THE MUMBLEX MUMBLEX WE DECIDED NOT TO GET THE MUMBLEX .
WHICH IS ACTUALLY ANOTHER LOANER .
ONE TOO THAT WE PICKED UP FOR A CONSULTING JOB THAT MY HUSBAND WAS DOING AND .
WHAT KIND OF CONSULTING DO YOU DO .
UM WELL I ACTUALLY DO SOME WORK WORKING AT M I T AND AT NIST NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY .
UHHUH .
IN WASHINGTON AND THEN I WORKED FOR DRAGON SYSTEMS FOR A WHILE .
WHAT KIND OF WORK DO YOU DO WHEN YOU RE CONSULTING .
UM WELL IT DEPENDS IT S VERY DIFFERENT IN THE DIFFERENT PLACES BUT .
IS IT PROGRAMMING RELATED .
YEAH YEAH .
PROGRAM RELATED RESEARCH RELATED AND I WORK IN THE SPEECH FIELD AND I DO A LOT METACOUSTIC PHONETICS AND .
UHHUH .
LOOKING AT THE ACOUSTIC CHARACTERISTICS OF SPEECH AND I DO THAT TYPE OF STUFF TYPICALLY FOR OTHER PEOPLE AND WE LIKE HERE WE USE THE P C S TO DO THAT .
MOSTLY I USE IT FOR WRITING PAPERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
WORD PROCESSING .
WELL MORE UH DO YOU KNOW LATEK .
NO I M .
WO .
NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT .
WORD TEXT PROCESSING SO I DO NT I DO NT USE I MEAN YOU CAN CALL IT .
WORD PROCESSING BUT I DO NT USUALLY USE A WORD PROCESSOR TO DO IT .
UHHUH .
AND WE DO NT HAVE TOO MUCH STANDARD SOFTWARE .
LIKE I HAVE NT BOUGHT WE HAVE NT REALLY BOUGHT ANY COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE SOFTWARE AT ALL .
SO WE DO NT USE IT FOR THINGS LIKE OUR ACCOUNTS AND ADDRESSES AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
WE USE IT MORE FOR JUST WRITING PROGRAMS WHEN WE NEED TO OR UM DOING RESEARCH LOOKING AT THE SPEECH SIGNAL AND THEN DOING WRITING AND ALSO AS A JUST AS A TERMINAL AND WE CONNECT TO OTHER COMPUTERS TO READ OUR NET MAIL AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
SO YOU VE GOT YOU VE GOT A MODEM IN IT THEN .
UH NEITHER ONE HAS A MODEM BUT WE HAVE A MODEM .
AT HOME .
NEITHER ONE .
YOU HAVE A MODEM THAT YOU CAN CONNECT TO EACH OF THEM .
RIGHT .
UH AND SO IT S AN EXTERNAL MODEM .
YEAH WE HAVE MUMBLEX .
I GOT WHEN I GOT MINE .
I HAD AN INTERNAL MODEM IN IT .
UHHUH .
I USED IT UH QUITE A BIT WHEN I WAS UH UH LOOKING AT UH INFORMATION ON A LARGE BULLETIN BOARD SPONSORED BY A NEWSPAPER IN A IN FORT WORTH .
UHHUH .
BUT UH WENT OUT OF TOWN FOR A WHILE AND AND SORT OF GOT OFF THE UH BULLETIN BOARD AND OFF OF MY MICRO COMPLETELY .
UHHUH .
AND AFTER A WHILE .
THE MODEM STARTED MAKING NOISES ON ITS OWN WITHOUT UH EVEN WITHOUT USING IT ON THE COMPUTER I COULD TURN A COMPUTER ON IT D START SQUAWKING .
SO I FINALLY OPENED UP THE BOX AND TOOK IT OUT .
SO THAT WAS IT .
I THINK THAT S THE THIRTY SECOND WARNING .
OH I DID NT HEAR IT .
DO YOU HEAR THE THE BEEP IN THE BACKGROUND .
YES .
OH THAT S A AN AMBULANCE OR SOMETHING GOING ON HERE I THINK .
OKAY .
WHERE .
I HAVE NT EVER NOTICED THE THIRTY SECOND WARNING ACTUALLY .
WHERE ARE YOU AND UH .
IN MANHATTAN .

YEAH I M AT HOME .
SO YOU VE GOT A LOT OF TRAFFIC NOISE REAL CLOSE .
UHHUH .
SO IT D BE INTERESTING FOR THE PEOPLE .
THAT LOOK AT THIS SIGNAL .
I MEAN BECAUSE THERE S A LOT OF BACKGROUND NOISE THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE CAN HEAR .
SO IT LL BE INTERESTING HOW MUCH OF IT ACTUALLY GETS PICKED UP .
UM YEAH AND OFTEN TIMES .
THAT I CA NT TALK ON TH CA NT DO THIS MUCH LATER THAN NOW BETWEEN SORT OF LIKE SIX FIVE THIRTY AND SIX THIRTY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE TRAFFIC OUTSIDE THEY HONK THE HORN SO LOUD I CA NT EVEN HEAR THE PHONE CALL .

SOME OF THE THINGS YOU CAN DO AND IT S JUST A A VERY HANDY TOOL TO HAVE .
UHHUH .
YEAH AND YOU CAN DO A L IT MAKES THINGS VERY CONVENIENT .
YOU CAN SAVE A LOT OF MONEY TOO .
CERTAINLY CUT DOWN ON LONG DISTANCE CHARGES IF YOU IF THAT S WHAT .
YOU HAVE IN MIND .
UHHUH YEAH I VE NEVER TRIED USING THAT I DO NT KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT IT .
WHAT ABOUT HAVE YOU DID YOU USE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE SOFTWARE OR .
I HAVE I HAVE USED LOTUS .
I HAVE USED UH WORD PERFECT .
UHHUH .
UH I NOT HEAVY USE .
I VE USED UH D BASE AND UH I VE USED A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF SHAREWARE .
UM I HAVE NT DONE MUCH LOTUS WORK CONNECTED WITH MY JOB .
I VE BEEN THROUGH THREE CLASSES .
UHHUH .
AND I HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT FOR IT .
UHHUH .
UM I HAVE NT DONE MUCH WORD PROCESSING WORK WITH MY JOB .
I DO SOME .
UHHUH .
AND I AND THE D BASE WORK I VE DONE WAS STRICTLY CLASS RELATED .
I VE NEVER USED D BASE UM BUT I VE HEARD BOTH GOOD THINGS AND BAD THINGS ABOUT IT .
WELL IT S PROBABLY THE GRANDDADDY OF MOST UH DATA BASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS .
UHHUH .
IT .
S GOT SOME .
PRETTY STRONG COMPETITORS .
SOME OF THEM HAVE REVIEWS .
THAT ARE BETTER THAN D BASE SO I I THINK BY NOW IT S A MATTER OF UH PERSONAL TASTE .
YEAH PEOPLE TOLD ME THAT IT WAS SORT OF CUMBERSOME TO USE .
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT VERY EASILY .
I VE USED I VE HAD A CLASS ON UM R BASE AND ALSO IN PARADOX .
UHHUH .
AND BOTH OF THOSE SEEM VERY EASY TO USE COMPARED TO D BASE .
UHHUH .
DO YOU THINK YOU .
D BASE IS MORE FLEXIBLE OR ALLOWS YOU TO DO MORE .
OR DO YOU THINK THE OTHERS ARE PRETTY MUCH COMPATIBLE THESE DAYS .
UM I WOULD NT SAY COMPATIBLE BUT .
BUT UH .
CERTAINLY COMPARABLE .
YEAH I DID NT MEAN COMPATIBLE I MEANT COMPARABLE .
MY BRAIN IS GOING TO MUSH .
UHHUH .
AND WHAT DO YOU WORK ON AT T I .
I M A COMPUTER PROGRAMMER .
UHHUH .
ON THE .
I B M MAIN FRAMES .
UHHUH .
I DO UH MAIN MAINLY BUSINESS DATA PROCESSING .
UHHUH .
I ALSO HANDLE PRODUCTION SUPPORT FOR THE SYSTEMS IN MY AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY .
UHHUH .
UM SOMETIMES I GET CALLED LATE AT NIGHT AT HOME BECAUSE THERE S A PRODUCTION PROBLEM AND THAT GIVES ME .
THE OPPORTUNITY TO UH COME IN TO WORK AND FIX IT IF I CA NT THINK OF .
SOME THING TO TELL THE TROUBLE SHOOTER WHILE WE RE ON THE PHONE .
RIGHT .
UM I ALSO UH HANDLE MOST OF THE CALLS FROM OUR USERS AND OTHER PROGRAMMERS .
WHO NEED TO FIND OUT SOMETHING CONNECTED .
OKAY .
WELL LET S SEE WELL WE KEEP OUR PAPER PAPER BAGS LINED UP IN THE GARAGE FOR GLASS AND GLASS AND UH PLASTICS AND UH WE MAKE THE DUMP OVER TO THE WALMART BINS THERE AS SOON AS THEY RE FULL .
I GUESS WE COLLECT M MILK CARTONS AND WHATEVER P OTHER PLASTICS ARE ACCEPTABLE .
ARE YOU IN THE PART OF TOWN WHERE UH THEY HAVE GOTTEN INTO THE OTHER CONTAINERS YET FOR RECYCLING .
NO NO I DID NT THINK THAT ANYBODY HAD THOSE AT ALL YET .
WELL MAYBE THEY DO NT .
I I KNOW THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN MAY AND I COULD NT TELL WHETHER SOME PARTS OF TOWN HAD STARTED IT OR IF IT WAS JUST EVERYBODY WAS WAS WAITING FOR THE DELIVERY OF WHATEVER .
THOSE CONTAINERS WERE .
RIGHT .
WELL NO I HAVE NT SEEN ANY SO I I THOUGHT THAT .
IT .
ALL HAD ALL BEEN DELAYED SEVERAL TIMES .
SO I HAVE NO IDEA .
WHAT .
THEY LOOK LIKE AND I M .
YEAH TH .
KIND OF ANXIOUS TO SEE THEM .
THAT S GOING TO BE INTERESTING BECAUSE IT S UH WE VE GOTTEN SO CONVENIENT AND CONVENTIONAL IN TRASH DISPOSAL .
WHICH IS UH I LOOK AT OUR BIG GREEN CONTAINERS AND I SAY WELL THEY WORK FINE AND I KEEP MINE OUTSIDE THE GARAGE SO THAT I DO NT HAVE ANY ODORS BUT .
OH RIGHT .
IT S CLEARLY A PLACE WHERE UH UH IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW WELL THAT WORKS AND I AM I M GLAD THE COMMUNITY IS DOING IT .
UH IT S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT KIND OF HAS TO BE FORCED ON PEOPLE .
UH I DO NT KNOW IF WHERE YOU GREW UP IN YOUR WHAT .
YOU SAW BACK UH YEARS AGO BUT FOR ME .
THE THING .
THAT STRIKES ME IS I UH GROWING UP IN RURAL SOUTH DAKOTA WHERE HEY THE FARMERS BROUGHT THEIR EGGS TO TOWN AND THE LOCAL HATCHERY .
RIGHT .
WOULD CANDLE THEM AND PACKAGE THEM IS THAT UH IN THE FIFTIES UH YOU COULD SAY WE HAD THE RECYCLING GOING ON THEN THAT WE SHOULD HAVE NOW .
RIGHT .
WHICH WAS ALL THE MILK BOTTLES WERE GLASS AND YOU GOT A NICKEL OR DIME WHICH IN THAT TIME WAS A LOT OF MONEY WHEN YOU RETURNED THEM .
POP BOTTLES .
OH .
ALL HAD A DEPOSIT ON THEM .
OH OF COURSE .
THAT THEY DID .
YOU KNOW ACTUALLY WE HAD MILK DELIVERED TO OUR HOUSE .
OH .
IN GLASS BOTTLES AND WE HAD A MILK SHOOT AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE .
UHHUH .
YOU COULD JUST LEAVE THE MILKMAN .
A NOTE .
YEAH .
ON WHAT .
YOU NEEDED AND SO YOU JUST PUT THE EMPTY ONES BACK OUT THERE AND HE TOOK THEM AWAY AND PUT YOU KNOW PUT ANOTHER GALLON OF GLASS GLASS BOTTLE IN THERE .
YEAH .
SO UH YEAH .
SO UH YOU KNOW I LOOK BACK AT AT UH MY CHILDHOOD AND I D SAY YOU KNOW THEY WERE DOING THINGS THEN THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING NOW AND SO IT DOES NT BOTHER ME AT ALL THAT WE RE WE RE UH KIND OF STARTING TO PUT THE PRESSURE ON PEOPLE TO GET AWAY FROM ALL THIS UH THROWAWAY SOCIETY .
THAT GOT DEVELOPED IN THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES .
RIGHT RIGHT IT WOULD BE NICE IT WOULD BE NICE TO SEE IT TAKE A GOOD TURN HERE .
IT SEEMS LIKE IT STARTED TO TAKE A TURN AND THEN IT WENT AWAY SO I HOPE THAT THIS TIME .
IT IT STAYS .
JUST .
YEAH .
TO SEE STACKS AND STACKS OF NEWSPAPERS JUST TO THE TRASH IS JUST AMAZING .
SO UH YOU KNOW WE WHEN WE GO DUMP ACTUALLY WHEN WE GO DUMP OUR THINGS OH WE COLLECT NEWSPAPERS TOO AND THEN TAKE THEM SEEMS LIKE THERE S A PRETTY WELL THERE S A P PRETTY CONTINUAL FLOW OF PEOPLE COMING AND DUMPING GLASS AND DUMPING PLASTICS .
UHHUH .
SO THAT S KIND OF ENCOURAGING .
I DID NT KNOW YOU KNOW I DID NT KNOW IF WE STARTED TO DO THAT .
I DID NT KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT .
YEAH WELL I LL HAVE TO SAY I M I M THE ONLY ONE .
I M GOOD AT AT THIS POINT IS THE NEWSPAPER .
UH TAKING THAT TO THE BOY SCOUTS AND MY ALUMINUM CANS .
RIGHT .
UH GETTING RID OF THOSE BUT ON THE PLASTIC I HAVE UH I DO NT HAVE ANY HABITS .
THERE YET AND I M GUESS I M WAITING FOR THE CITY TO TO PUSH ME IN THAT DIRECTION BUT .
WELL I GUESS THEY WILL SHORTLY .
I UH .
BUT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE ON THE LARGER SCALE THAT YOU KNOW THE WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT IN OUR SOCIETY IS THAT ECONOMIC STRIFE THINGS AND I THINK IF UH IF WE JUST START TO PUT YOU KNOW THE NICKEL DEPOSIT ON THINGS LIKE UH WAS THE CASE YEARS AGO THAT UH IT WOULD HAVE MORE IMMEDIATE EFFECT UH THAN BECAUSE I REMEMBER SEARCHING DITCHES FOR BEER BOTTLES BECAUSE THEY WERE WORTH MONEY .
OH RIGHT .
AND IT SEEMS LIKE BEER DRINKERS ARE AMONG THE WORST FOR THROWING THINGS OUT THE WINDOW AND SO OUTSIDE MY LITTLE TOWN .
WE WOULD UH GO OUT AND .
YEAH .
LOOK FOR LONG NECK BEER BOTTLE BECAUSE THEY WERE WORTH .
SOMETHING .
RIGHT .
DO YOU KNOW I SAW IN TOM THUMB YESTERDAY I SAW THE RETURN TO THE UH THE SMALL COKE BOTTLES .
YEAH .
AND I DO NT KNOW IF THERE S A DEPOSIT ON THOSE OR NOT .
I WELL THAT S INTERESTING BECAUSE THEY RE BACK TO GLASS YOU RE SAYING .
THEY WERE GLASS THEY WERE THE GLASS UH WELL LET S SEE THEY D BE I DO NT KNOW MAYBE TEN OUNCE OR .
UHHUH .
SIX OUNCE OR TEN OUNCE .
YEAH .
SORT OF A SMALL SIZE SORT OF A SMALL SIZE AND AND WE ANYWAY WE JUST WE DID NT STOP AND LOOK THEM LOOK AT THEM .
A LONG TIME BUT AND THEY WERE PACKED IN THE OLD SORT OF SIX PACK STICK THEM DOWN YOU KNOW UH .
UHHUH .
SORT OF SORT OF A BASKET .
THE CARTON .
TYPE THING .
THE PAPER CARTON .
RIGHT RIGHT SO I HAD NT SEEN THAT IN A LONG TIME .
YEAH .
WELL I MEAN THE YOU REALLY LOOK AND SAY A LOT OF THE THINGS WE NEED TO DO WE WERE DOING AND WE HAD ALL THE MECHANISMS IN PLACE WITH THE FOLD UP PAPER CARTONS THE WOOD UH RACKS WHICH NOW BASICALLY YOU COULD TURN THEM INTO THE PLASTIC ONES .
THAT WOULD HOLD UH TWENTYFOUR BOTTLES .
AND AND UH UH I M NOT REALLY SAY GOING BACK TO GOOD OLD DAYS BUT CERTAINLY WE WERE DOING THINGS .
THE WAY .
WE THINK WE SHOULD DO THEM NOW .
YEAH YEAH WELL .
WELL IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW OVER THE NEXT YEAR THIS .
ALL WORKS OUT BECAUSE LIKE ON THE UH GRASS I M I KNOW YOUR HUSBAND UH DOES NT REALLY LIKE THE PAPER SACKS .
NO HE DOES NT LIKE THE PAPER SACKS AND UH BUT HE BUT YOU KNOW HE LIKES TO PICK THE GRASS UP TOO .
HE DOES NT .
YEAH .
DOES NT .
I M THE I M THE SAME WAY BECAUSE OTHERWISE UH OH I M I GENERALLY LISTEN TO NEAL SPERRY ON SATURDAYS AND NEAL UH NEAL S A PERSON .
WHO SAYS I LIKE TO PICK IT UP BUT I DO NT BELIEVE IN THROWING IT INTO THE UH THE LANDFILL SO I HAVE MY COMPOST PILE BUT MOST OF US DO NT HAVE THE UH SUFFICIENT .
LOT SIZE TO UH TO DO THAT .
RIGHT RIGHT .
UH SO I M GLAD THE CITY S WILLING TO TAKE THAT ON .
THAT S NICE .
I GUESS THEY DUMP IT .
THE SAME PLACE I WONDER WHERE THEY DUMP THAT .
WELL THERE S SOMEPLACE YOU KNOW IF IT S BECAUSE REALLY WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT .
MY GRASS DOES IN IN ACTUALLY ABOUT TWENTYFOUR HOURS UH KNOWING WHAT .
THE FARMERS DO IN RURAL AREAS THEY JUST TAKE THEIR HAY AND JUST BUILD A BIG MOUND OF IT AND IT NATURALLY UH COMPOSTS OR STORES AND UH SO ALL .
YOU HAVE TO DO IS JUST PLACE IT SOMEWHERE AND CHURN IT AND IT WILL NATURALLY DECOMPOSE UH SO YOU JUST HAVE TO KIND OF KEEP IN SEPARATED AND THEN UH WHO KNOWS HOW THEY PROCESS IT FROM THERE AND WHAT .
THEY TURN IT INTO BUT IT S CERTAINLY USABLE MATERIAL .
YEAH YEAH WELL THEY MUST THEY MUST KEEP IT SEPARATE IF THEY HAVE THIS DATE IN .
UHHUH .
THEY HAVE THIS DAY NOW THAT IT S YOU KNOW SEPARATE FROM THE OTHER TRASH PICK UP .
RIGHT .
BUT I THE THING .
I DO NT UNDERSTAND ABOUT THAT IS LIKE WHEN IT .
S ONE THING TO SEND GRASS THERE BUT I VE TRIMMED TREES AND OTHER THINGS .
WHICH UH END UP BEING SOMETHING THAT CLEARLY WO NT DECOMPOSE NEARLY AS RAPIDLY .
NO .
OKAY DO YOU HAVE ANY PETS .
YES I VE HAD I HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF THEM IN MY LIFETIME AND I VE I AM A GOLDEN RETRIEVER FAN .
OH .
BUT I HAD TO REPLACE IT WITH SOMETHING THAT THE KIDS COULD CARRY .
OH .
YES YES .
INSTEAD OF BEING CARRIED .
YES WELL THEY WERE THEY REALLY WANTED SOMETHING TEENY TINY AND I UH REALLY WANTED THAT RETRIEVER S DISPOSITION .
YEAH .
UH THE ULTIMATE TO TOLERANT TRAINABLE DISPOSITION .
REALLY .
SO I CALLED FOUR OR FIVE DOG TRAINERS BECAUSE I DO NT LIKE THE LITTLE DOGS .
UHHUH .
AND AND I ASKED THEM YOU KNOW THESE ARE THE AGES OF THE KIDS WHAT DO I GET AND THEY ALL SAID GOLDEN RETRIEVER AND I SAID OKAY .
PUT IT UNDER TWENTY POUNDS AND THE ONLY THING THAT THEY COULD COME UP WITH WAS A BICHON FRIZE WHICH IS A .
HUH .
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS .
YES I VE SEEN THOSE THEY RE CUTE .
THEY RE CUTE THEY LOOK LIKE AN AIR HEADED MUMBLEX LET ME TELL YOU THEY RE CALM THEY RE NOT YUPPIE THEY RE TRAINABLE THEY RE UH VERY PERSONABLE IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAT A GOLDEN RETRIEVER IS THEY RE NOT DIGNIFIED LIKE A RETRIEVER CAN BE .
UHHUH .
YEAH SO HOW OLD IS YOUR RETRIEVER .
OH SHE S ABOUT FOUR SHE S NOT COMPLETELY PURE WE GOT HER FROM THE UH HUMANE SOCIETY WHEN SHE WAS A PUPPY SHE LOOKS LIKE A GOL SHE LOOKS JUST LIKE A GOLDEN RETRIEVER BUT SHE S A LITTLE BIT SMALLER SHE S LIKE FIFTYFIVE POUNDS .
WELL ACTUALLY YOU KNOW THAT S THE BREED STANDARD FOR FEMALES WHAT YOU .
IS IT .
YEAH WHAT YOU SEE SHOWN AND BRED NOW AS GOLDEN RETRIEVERS THIS YOU KNOW PLUS EIGHTY TO A HUNDRED POUND RANGE .
UHHUH .
THAT IS NOT BREED STANDARD .
HUH .
FIFTYFIVE IS THE MINIMUM BUT THEY USUALLY RUN ABOUT SIXTY TO SIXTYFIVE AND THE ONES THAT ARE SHOWN THEY ARE INSIDE THAT WEIGHT ALLOWANCE .
UHHUH .
YOU CAN NOT SHOW YOUR RETRIEVER IF IT S YOU KNOW A HUNDRED PLUS POUNDS .
OH HUH .
SO DO NT SAY SHE S SMALL .
YEAH .
JUST SAY SHE S PERFECT .
SHE S PERFECT WELL SHE S GOT A BROWN NOSE INSTEAD OF BLACK TOO .
UHHUH .
WHICH MAKES HER I GUESS UNSHOWABLE .
YEP .
EVEN IF SHE HAD PAPERS WHICH SHE DOES NT BUT BUT WE LOVE HER ANYWAY SHE S JUST A LOT OF COMPANY TO US WE DID NT WE HAVE NT HAD ANY KIDS AND WE RE EXPECTING A BABY THIS SUMMER BUT UP UNTIL THEN SHE S BEEN OUR SUBSTITUTE KID AND SHE WAS A LOT OF FUN .
WELL THEY ARE THEY ARE THE ULTIMATE DOG TO HAVE AROUND KIDS SO LONG AS YOUR KID IS NOT SCARED OF A BIG DOG .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE I HAD A RETRIEVER ACTUALLY I HAD A RETRIEVER IRISH SETTER CROSS .
OH .
WHICH IS A REALLY NICE ANIMAL AND FORTUNATELY IT WAS JUST LIKE A RETRIEVER AND THEN I VE HAD A RETRIEVER .
I BET IT HAD A PRETTY COAT TOO .
IT WAS GORGEOUS IT WAS JUST GORGEOUS I MEAN JUST GORGEOUS UM AND THEY BOTH YOU KNOW BOTH THE HALF BREED AND THE PURE BREED HAD THE UH WHAT I CONSIDER THE THE THE PERFECT DISPOSITION BUT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT SCARES ME ABOUT GOLDEN RETRIEVERS .
HUHUH .
SINCE THEY VE BECOME SO POPULAR YOU GET WHAT I CALL BACKYARD BREEDERS .
YEAH .
WHICH IS PROBABLY WHERE YOURS CAME FROM PEOPLE THAT DO NT KNOW WHAT THEY RE DOING AND THEY BREED THEM YOU KNOW FOR A CERTAIN CHARACTERISTIC AND IN THE RETRIEVERS IT HAPPENS TO BE THEY LIKE THEM BIG FOR SOMEHOW BIG IS PERCEIVED AS THE BETTER AND WHEN YOU START DOING THAT YOU REALLY TAMPER WITH YOU KNOW THE ALL THE THE YEARS OF UH CULLING LITTERS AND AND UH YOU TAMPER WITH WHAT THE DOG INNATELY IS .
YEAH .
WE W WHEN I WAS WHEN I BOUGHT MY LAST PUREBRED RETRIEVER I MEAN I LOOKED ALL OVER BECAUSE I WANTED ONE THAT STILL LOOKED LIKE A RETRIEVER YOU KNOW THE SHORT TO THE GROUND STOCKY GOLDEN UH TRAINABLE TRACTABLE QUIET .
RIGHT .
ANIMAL THAT COULD HUNT AND STILL BE IN THE HOUSE AND I ENDED UP GETTING ONE THAT UH CAME OUT OF A A A HUNTING STOCK .
OH .
BECAUSE I WANTED ONE THAT COULD STILL PERFORM LIKE A RETRIEVER DID AND I VE SEEN AN AWFUL LOT OF LATELY REALLY DUMB .
DUMB RETRIEVERS AND I M AND I REALLY FEAR FOR THE BREED BECAUSE I LOVE THAT BREED .
YEAH .
BUT I REALLY FIGURE RIGHT WHEN IT BECOMES REALLY POPULAR THAT IT S GOING TO BE RUINED .
WE HAVE SOME FRIENDS WITH A BROTHER AND SISTER GOLDEN RETRIEVER AND THOSE DOGS HAVE BEEN HAVING SEIZURES AND I WONDER SINCE BOTH OF THEM ARE HAVING THEM IF IT S SOME KIND OF BREEDING .
OH YEAH .
PROBLEM .
YOU BET YOU YOU BET YOU YOU KNOW HOW THEY CAME UP WITH THE RETRIEVER DO NT YOU THE GOLDEN .
HUHUH .
IT WAS BRED OUT OF SEVERAL DIFFERENT RETRIEVERS AND THEY BRED IT FOR COMPANIONSHIP AND UH UH DISPOSITION AND AND ABILITY TO HUNT IT WAS KEPT ONLY BY KINGS .
OH .
BUT THEY SELECTIVELY CULLED THOSE LITTERS I MEAN FOR MANY HUNDREDS OF YEARS AND SINCE IT SLEPT IN THE CASTLE WITH ITS MASTER I MEAN IT HAD IT HAD TO BE OF A DISPOSITION TO MAKE IT YOU KNOW AN ANIMAL YOU COULD KEEP AROUND THAT CLOSELY BUT THEY WOULD GO THROUGH ALL THE LITTERS AND DESTROY THE PUPPIES IF THEY WERE ANYTHING OTHER THAN PERFECT NOW YOU KNOW THAT SEEMS LIKE A CRUEL THING TO DO .
YEAH .
ON THE OTHER HAND YOU SURE YOU KNOW THEY SURE CREATED A A WONDERFUL BREED .
YEAH THEY DID .
I MEAN A WONDERFUL BREED .
I I HAD NEVER REALLY HAD A GOLDEN RETRIEVER BEFORE WE WERE GOING TO GET A SHEPHERD AND SOMETHING MIXED BECAUSE MY HUSBAND S FAMILY HAD HAD SHEPHERDS AND ALL THE OTHER WE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE SHEPHERD MIXES AND THE PUPPIES WERE NT VERY UH SOCIAL AND STUFF .
UHHUH .
AND WE WENT TO A PEN OF A LITTLE BIT BIGGER DOGS AND ALL THE OTHERS WERE STANDING THERE BARKING AND JUMPING UP AND DOWN AND ONE DOG WOULD STAND THERE WAGGING HER TAIL AND SMILING AND THAT .
WELL I TELL YOU .
WAS MINE .
YOU KNOW THE THE GERMAN SHEPHERD IS THE CLASSIC CASE OF WHAT I M TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE IN AMERICA THAT S CALLED A RIN TIN TIN PHENOMENA .
UHHUH .
ONLY IN AMERICA IS THERE A DOG CALLED A GERMAN SHEPHERD .
OH REALLY .
THAT DOG IS BRED OUT OF THREE EUROPEAN DOGS THE BELGIAN TERVURIEN A GERMAN SKUTZHUND AND A I ALWAYS FORGET THE THIRD ONE I CAN SEE IT UH UH I BUT THE THIRD ONE IS A CHILDREN S DOG .
OH .
AND THERE ARE DISTINCT BREEDS IN EUROPE NOW WHAT HAPPENED OVER HERE WAS IS THAT PEOPLE SAW THE THE FIRST UM WHICH WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN A SKUTZHUND WHICH IS WHAT RIN TIN TIN WAS .
UHHUH .
AND EVERYBODY WANTED RIN TIN TIN .
AND IT WAS KNOWN AS A GERMAN SHEPHERD HERE SO THEY CREATED A BREED STANDARD THE AMERICAN KENNEL CLUB DID .
OH .
THAT SAID ANYTHING THAT IS A SKUTZHUND A A TERVURIEN AND UH ALSATIAN THAT S THE OTHER ONE ALSATIAN ANY INNER BREEDING OF THAT CAN BE CALLED A GERMAN SHEPHERD HERE .
HUH .
AND WHAT HAPPENED IS IS THAT PEOPLE WANTED THIS SHEPHERD TO SHEPHERD AND PROTECT AND THEY BRED A DOG THAT I TH IT S CALLED A AN ANIMAL S CRITICAL SPAN WHICH BASICALLY TRANSLATES TO HOW MUCH SHIT WILL IT TAKE BEFORE IT BITES YOU .
THAT GERMAN SHEPHERD THE AMERICAN GERMAN SHEPHERD HERE WAS A A A SUCH AN UNRELIABLE ANIMAL THAT THE AMERICAN SEEING EYE INSTITUTE .
UHHUH .
REFUSED TO USE THEM .
HUH .
BECAUSE THEY WOULD TURN ON TH ON THEIR HANDLERS .
UHHUH .
AND EVEN UM UH POLICE CORPS WHICH STARTED YOU KNOW FINDING OTHER BREEDS TO USE BECAUSE THIS THING THIS THIS THING KNOWN AS A GERMAN SHEPHERD HERE ITS PERSONALITY AND ITS DEPENDABILITY AND ITS RELIABILITY WAS JUST TERRIBLE SO ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO THE GERMAN SHEPHERD CLUB OF AMERICA DECIDED AMONGST THEMSELVES THAT THEY WERE GOING TO CHANGE THIS SO THEY WENT BACK TO EUROPE AND BROUGHT BACK SOME GOOD EXAMPLES OF EACH OF THE THREE BREEDS .
UHHUH .
AND BRED TO A STANDARD WHAT THEY WANTED AN AMERICAN GERMAN SHEPHERD TO BE WHICH IS A VERY HEAVILY NOW SKUTZHUND AND ALSATIAN AND IT S THE ALSATIAN THAT S THE KID S DOG IT S JUST YOU SEE THEM IN EUROPE AND THEY RE JUST LOVELY .
HUH .

NO SHORTS DEAL AND SOME OF THESE MINI SKIRTS YOU KNOW ARE WORSE THAN SHORTS EVER THOUGHT ABOUT BEING .

ALL RIGHT GOOD DAY .
UHHUH BYEBYE .
I WAS GOING TO SAY MY UH COLLEGE IS NORTHERN STATE UNIVERSITY IN ABERDEEN SOUTH DAKOTA AND OUR HEAD FOOTBALL COACH DENNIS MUIR USED TO BE AN ASSISTANT COACH AT B Y U .
OH REALLY .
SO I THOUGHT THAT WAS KIND OF AN IN INTERESTING COINCIDENCE .
HUH SO YOU WENT TO WHAT COLLEGE .
UH NORTHERN STATE UNIVERSITY IN ABERDEEN SOUTH DAKOTA .
AND WHAT DID YOU GRADUATE IN .
I JU IN WHAT MAJOR OR WHAT YEAR .
YEAH MAJOR .
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS .
OH REALLY .
YEAH AND YOU .
I M GOING TO B Y U AND I M GOING INTO NURSING .
OKAY .
SO .
WELL THAT SOUNDS INTERESTING HOW LONG OF A PROGRAM IS THAT .
FOREVER .
SEEMS LIKE ANYWAYS IT S ABOUT FIVE YEARS BUT IT S PROBABLY GOING TO TAKE ME LONGER BECAUSE I DID NT DECIDE TO MAJOR IN THAT UNTIL UH ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AFTER I WAS ALREADY IN SCHOOL SO .
YOU KNOW I READ A STUDY ONCE AND IT SAID THAT UH LIKE THIRTYFOUR PERCENT OF UH COLLEGE STUDENTS ACTUALLY GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS FROM A FOUR YEAR PROGRAM .
OH REALLY THAT SOUNDS .
IT TOOK ME IT TOOK ME FIVE YEARS .
YEAH .
SO YOU JUST YOU GET STARTED AND YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND OR YOU WANT TO PICK UP A SECOND MAJOR IF YOU RE MANAGEMENT YOU YOU THOUGHT I I LL TAKE THAT MARKETING IT S JUST ONLY WAS THREE MORE CLASSES .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW AND YOU JUST DOES NT HAPPEN THAT YOU GET OUT IN FOUR YEARS .
UHHUH .
BUT .
SO WHAT IS YOUR ADVICE TO .
MY ADVICE IS .
PICKING A COLLEGE .
IS UH LOOK FOR AT THE STUDENT TO FACULTY RATIO YOU KNOW IF YOU RE GOING TO GO TO A COLLEGE WHERE STUDENT FACULTY RATIO IS THREE AND FOUR HUNDRED TO ONE I DO NT THINK YOU RE GOING TO HAVE AS MEANINGFUL OF A COLLEGE EXPERIENCE AS IF YOU RE DOWN TO THE THIRTY TO FORTY TO ONE .
UHHUH IS THAT WHAT WAS YOURS MORE LIKE .
YEAH .
WAS THERE A .
IT WAS ABOUT TWENTYSIX TO ONE .
REALLY .
YEAH .
OH THAT S GREAT .
WHICH IS YOU KNOW IT IT S INTERESTING BUT IT IT S WHAT I THOUGHT WAS NICE IS YOU COULD AL THERE WAS ALWAYS TIME TO TALK TO PROFESSOR YOU KNOW AND AND THEY KNEW YOU .
UHHUH .
YOU WERE NT JUST IN THEIR CLASS YOU KNOW AND SO YOU COULD YOU COULD GO TALK TO THEM IN THEIR OFFICE ALMOST AT ANY TIME AND OR IF YOU RAN INTO THEM IN THE STUDENT UNION OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW YOU COULD SIT DOWN TALK TO THEM ABOUT A PROBLEM THEY RE ALWAYS WILLING TO HELP YOU OUT SO BUT I I S I I PUT THAT AGAINST UH MY HIGH SCHOOL WHERE WE HAD UH A BIOLOGY CLASS OF THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY STUDENTS AND .
WOW IN HIGH SCHOOL .
YEAH .
OH .
IT WAS A BIOLOGY LECTURE CLASS .
WOW .
AND YOU KNOW IT IT JUST WAS NT THE SAME YOU RE SITTING THERE AND YOU RE TAKING NOTES AND YOU KNOW YOU GOT A COMPUTERIZED TEST SCORES MULTIPLE CHOICE BECAUSE THERE S NO WAY THEY COULD CORRECT A THREE HUNDRED FIFTY POINT SHORT ANSWER TEST .
UHHUH .
UH YOU KNOW A THREE HUNDRED FIFTY PERSON SHORT ANSWER TEST AND IT JUST WAS NT THE SAME YOU YOU D RUN YOU D PASS THE TEACHER IN HIGH SCHOOL AND EVEN IN HIGH SCHOOL YOU COULD SAY HIGH TO YOUR TEACHERS UNLESS YOU RE IN THAT BIOLOGY CLASS AND THEY JUST THEY D LOOK AT YOU LIKE DO I KNOW YOU OR SHOULD I KNOW YOU .
UHHUH YEAH THERE S IT S THE CLASSES HERE ARE PRETTY BIG SO IT S HARD TO GET INDIVIDUAL HELP IT S KIND OF YOU RE ON YOUR OWN .
DO YOU GET UH A LOT OF TUTORING OR .
NO VERY LITTLE I MEAN WELL LIKE MY FOR EXAMPLE I HAVE I M IN A CHEMISTRY CLASS RIGHT NOW .
UHHUH .
AND THERE S TONS OF STUDENTS IN IT AND THERE S ONE T A FOR THE WHOLE CLASS .
AND HE ONLY HAS CERTAIN OFFICE HOURS AND SO THERE S ONLY CERTAIN TIMES YOU CAN TALK TO HIM AND .
AND YOU COULD GET THERE AND HIS OFFICE HOURS COULD I MEAN HE COULD HAVE LIKE A NINE TO ELEVEN IN THE MORNING OFFICE HOURS AND HAVE FORTYTWO PEOPLE WAITING TO TALK TO HIM AND YOU STILL DID NT GET TO TALK TO HIM ANYWAY .
RIGHT YEAH .
WELL WHAT WOULD BE YOUR ADVICE TO A PARENT OF A CHILD THINKING OF ATTENDING COLLEGE .
OH MAN I THINK YOUR ADVICE IS GOOD UM LET S SEE MY ADVICE WOULD BE TO PICK A MAJOR BEFORE YOU GET INTO COLLEGE .
THAT S EXCELLENT ADVICE .
BECAUSE I I DID NT AND I TOOK TONS OF CLASSES THAT I DID NT NEED TO AND UM I DO NT KNOW I JUST FEEL LIKE I M IT S IT S GOING TO TAKE ME A LOT LONGER THAN AND NOT THAT S ALWAYS BAD BUT IT S I DO NT KNOW IT S FRUSTRATING I GUESS .
WELL IT IT IT DOES GET IT YOU KNOW YOU GET TO THE POINT WHERE IT S I M NEVER GOING TO GET DONE .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW I I MEAN I WAS TAKING SUMMER CLASSES AND MUMBLEX LET ME GET OUT OF HERE .
YEP .
BUT UH NO THAT S GOOD ADVICE EVEN IF YOU DO NT HAVE YOUR MAJOR DECIDED ON HAVE AN IDEA WHAT YOU THINK YOU MIGHT WANT YOU KNOW SO YOU DO NT WANT MANAGEMENT BUT YOU THINK YOU WANT BUSINESS .
WELL LET S SEE UM I I LIKE TO GO OUT TO EAT I REALLY DO BUT BEING FROM DALLAS UM I THINK WE HAVE AN AVERAGE OF SIX OR SEVEN RESTAURANTS THAT OPEN AND CLOSE EVERY WE MONTH AND WE AVE WE HAVE A REALLY HIGH TURN OVER RATE .
OH REALLY .
OH YEAH AND AND THIS IS I MEAN THERE ARE STREETS JUST CALLED RESTAURANT ROWS AND UH YOU CAN GET EVERYTHING HERE FROM UM A VERY SPICY INDIAN MEAL TO YOU KNOW THE FAVORITE BARBECUE AND AND UH JUST ANYTHING YOUR LITTLE HEARTS DESIRES AROUND HERE SO HERE THEY HAVE TO ENTERTAIN US TO MAKE US COME BACK .
UH .
AND I GUESS IT S ALL ONE BIG GAME BECAUSE YOU YOU JUST NEVER RUN OUT OF PLACES TO GO YOU REALLY DO NT .
THAT S GOOD .
YEAH .
I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT THAT BUT UH A GOOD TURN OVER WOULD BE SORT OF NICE COURSE IF YOU FIND A PLACE YOU LIKE AND IT WORKS OUT THAT NO ONE ELSE LIKES IT IT WOULD BE SORT OF SAD TO SEE IT GO UNDER .
REALLY AND AND WE GO TO YOU KNOW LIKE AN OLDER PART OF TOWN AND WE JUST NOTICE HOW MANY OH WELL THAT RESTAURANT S CHANGED AND OH GEE THERE THEY VE CHANGED AND OH WE VE GOT TO GO TRY THAT ONE YOU KNOW AND IT S IT S REALLY YOU HAVE THE PICK OF THE YOU KNOW THE CROP HERE .
ARE THEY BIG INTO AM AMBIANCE DOWN THERE OR IS IT MORE LIKE .
OH .
UH TEXAS TO ME MAKES IT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE PORTIONS WOULD BE THE BIG THING .
YOU KNOW YOUR YOUR FOURTEEN OUNCE STEAK WITH YOUR POTATO AND STUFF .

UM YOU CAN GET THAT TOO NO THEY VE GOT EVERYTHING HERE FROM THE UH FRENCH ROOM WHICH IS ULTRA ULTRA TO UM UM DEAN FERRINGS UH UH RESTAURANT WHICH IS THE MANSION ON TURTLE CREEK I MEAN WE VE GOT BEAUTIFUL PLACES TO GO YOU CAN GET AS DRESSED UP OR A YOU KNOW JUST GOING TO THE LOCAL BARBECUE AND JUST DOING TAKE OUT .
UHHUH .
SO YOU KNOW I GUESS UH SOME OF THE FOODS THAT WE REALLY ENJOY THOUGH ARE THE UM UM LIKE CHINESE .

AND WE RE ALWAYS SEARCHING AROUND FOR CHINESE AND NOW OF COURSE THEY VE ADDED THE TAIWANESE AND AND UM UH VARIOUS YOU KNOW ANY ANY PART OF THE COUNTRY YOU WANT TO HIT THEY HAVE GOT IT I MEAN VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT WE WENT TO YOU KNOW LAST WEEK IT S GREAT IT S GOOD STUFF YOU KNO .
UHHUH .
BUT UH IT S SO IT S VERY VERY MIXED AND UH YOU KNOW I THINK IF YOU LIKE FOOD LIKE WE DO I I DO NT KNOW IF THAT HAPPENED BEFORE OR AFTER WE MOVED HERE BUT UM .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW YOU GET A LOT OF UH GREAT VARIETY OF THINGS HERE SO BUT IF YOU WERE GOING TO A RESTAURANT SAY UM WHERE WOULD YOU GO .
OH WELL WE HAD UH WE HAVE A LOT OF FAVORITES HERE UH IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA AND OF COURSE WE VE GOT D C TO CALL ON YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
AND THERE S ALL SORTS OF THINGS DOWN THERE ONE THING ABOUT D C IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF TRADITIONAL RESTAURANTS WHERE YOU KNOW IT S THE GUY USED TO BE THE COOK FOR THE CAPITOL AND SO HE STAYS IN THE SAME RESTAURANT FOR TWENTY YEARS YOU KNOW .
OH OKAY .
AND HE S GOT A BIG CLIENTELE AND UM SO THERE ARE THERE ARE SOME HANG OUTS WHERE YOU CAN GO IF YOU WANT TO SEE PEOPLE YOU KNOW IT S IT S SORT OF LIKE HOLLYWOOD IN A WAY BECAUSE THERE S THERE S FAVORITE HAUNTS FOR SOUTHERNERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT .

YEAH RIGHT .
SO UH BUT UH MY WIFE HAS A A FRIEND THAT W RUNS ONE OF THE RESTAURANTS DOWN THERE AND WE VE BEEN DOWN THERE AND HAD FRENCH CUISINE AND UH I DO NT KNOW I DO NT PARTICULARLY CARE FOR THAT SORT OF THING JUST TH THE TYPE OF FOOD JUST BECAUSE I DO LIKE UH YOU KNOW GETTING A MEAL .

THAT S TRUE TOO .
AND UH BUT THE THE ATMOSPHERE IS JUST WONDERFUL YOU DO FEEL LIKE YOU VE GONE OUT YOU KNOW AND DONE SOMETHING .

WHEN YOU GO TO A FRENCH RESTAURANT OR A RESTAURANT DOWNTOWN WELL AS OUT HERE YOU MIGHT HAVE ENJOYED THE MEAL AND GO AWAY FEELING SATISFIED IT S NOT SO MUCH A AN EVENT YOU KNOW OUT IN THE SUBURBS WHEN YOU GO TO A LOCAL RESTAURANT .
YEAH WELL .

OH THERE YOU GO YEAH .
WHICH IS KIND OF NICE BECAUSE .
OH WE RE SORT OF IN THE MIDDLE OF UH THE EXTENSION OF THE CAJUN COUNTRY TOO SO WE HAVE UM A LOT OF AMBIANCE PROVIDED BY YOU KNOW THE THE BANDS AND EVERYTH YOU KNOW LIKE YOU SAID JAZZ BANDS AND THINGS LIKE THAT YOU KNOW .

WELL SAME HERE .
OKAY .
YOU ALL HAVE A GOOD DAY .
YOU TOO .
BYEBYE .
BYE NOW .
ALL RIGHT WHY DO NT YOU GO AHEAD FIRST AND TELL WHAT KIND OF CAR .
YOU D LOOK FOR IN YOUR NEXT .
I THINK OUR NEXT CAR I WOULD LIKE SOMETHING LIKE A AN ECONOMY CAR .
THAT GETS REALLY GOOD MILEAGE AND UH ONE .
THAT S REALLY RELIABLE .
I WOULD I THINK PROBABLY NOT A A BRAND NEW CAR BUT MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE A NISSAN SENTRA .
UHHUH .
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT UH SOMETHING .
MY HUSBAND .
AND OF COURSE IT HAS TO HAVE AIRCONDITIONING .
OH ABSOLUTELY AIRCONDITIONING AND A RADIO UH A M F M AND A CASSETTE PLAYER AND UH WHAT ELSE DO I WANT .
DOES IT HAVE TO BE A SPECIAL COLOR .
UH I WOULD THINK KIND OF A SUBDUED COLOR WOULD BE NICE .
YOU KNOW A A NAVY BLUE OR A .
IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING .
YOUR HUSBAND WOULD DRIVE RIGHT .
YEAH THAT S WHAT .
IT WOULD BE FOR IS FOR HIM TO DRIVE BACK AND FORTH TO WORK .
YES .
WELL I DO NT THINK WE RE LOOKING FOR ANOTHER CAR RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE JUST BOUGHT ONE BUT WHEN WE WERE LOOKING WE WERE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING .
THAT HAD ENOUGH SEAT BELTS OF COURSE AND WE WANTED AIRCONDITIONING AND A FIVE SPEED AND THAT WAS KIND OF IFFY BUT THAT MADE IT BETTER ECONOMICALLY SO .
I THINK THAT S SOMETHING .
WE MIGHT WANT TOO IS SOME KIND OF STANDARD TRANSMISSION .
YEAH .
AT LEAST RATHER THAN AUTOMATIC .
WE LL PROBABLY HAVE TO LOOK FOR ANOTHER SECOND CAR SOMETIME AND WE D LOOK FOR ABOUT WHAT .
YOU RE LOOKING FOR .
S BUT PROBABLY REAL CHEAP TOO .
IT WOULD NT BE A USED USED CAR SO BUT NO .
I THINK WE WOULD WANT ONE THAT EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A COMPACT CAR OR WHATEVER THAT IT WOULD STILL BE NICE ENOUGH THAT UH YOU COULD TAKE SOMEONE IN IT AND NOT BE EMBARRASSED .
UHHUH .
WOULD YOU LIKE FOUR DOORS OR DOES NT REALLY MATTER .
PROB WELL PROBABLY PROBABLY THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA YEAH .
YEAH IT IT S HARD FOR PEOPLE TO GET IN WITH A TWO DOOR SOMETIMES .
THAT S RIGHT .
SO IF WE WANTED IT TO TAKE PEOPLE OUT IT S THAT S A GOOD THOUGHT .
I THAT HAD NT CROSSED MY MIND .
IT WOULD BE FUN JUST TO WIN ONE WOULD NT IT .
YES I WOULD GO FOR THAT .
THAT WOULD BE GREAT .
ALL RIGHT WELL I THINK THAT S ALL THAT WE NEED TO SAY .
WELL THANK YOU FOR CALLING .
ALL RIGHT WE LL TALK TO YOU LATER .
ALL RIGHT .
BYEBYE .
BYE .
OKAY BILL UM AS YOU THINK OVER THE PLANS AND SO FORTH THAT THE COMPANY YOU RE WORKING WITH NOW WHO DO YOU WORK WITH AT THIS TIME .
WELL I OWN THE COMPANY .
YOU OWN THE COMPANY ALL RIGHT .
I M THE PRESIDENT AND C E O OF THE COMPANY .
MY GOODNESS .
SO UH I GUESS UH I DETERMINE WHAT THE BENEFITS ARE .
YEAH I GUESS YOU DO .
BUT UH SO WHAT ARE YOU ASKING ME WHAT WHAT BENEFITS I THINK ARE MOST IMPORTANT .
WELL WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE LET S PUT IT THIS WAY WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT BENEFITS FOR THOSE WORKING FOR YOU OTHER THAN OTHER THAN THEIR PRESENT SALARY .
UM I D SAY IN TODAY S ECONOMY BESIDES BASIC BENEFITS UH SUCH AS UM HEALTH INSURANCE AND LIFE INSURANCE AND THE SOME TYPE OF RETIREMENT PLAN .
UHHUH .
I D SAY THAT UH MOST OF THE EMPLOYEES UH UM THAT WE HAVE REALLY LIKE A A PROFIT SHARING PLAN .
A PROFIT SHARING PLAN THAT S INTERESTING UHHUH .
THEY LIKE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROFITS OF THE COMPANY LIKE THEY RE YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE WELL WE RE CONTRIBUTING TO IT SO WE D LIKE TO PARTICIPATE IN IT AND SO THAT MEANS I MAKE A LITTLE BIT LESS BUT THE THING IS THAT REALLY YOU MAKE A LITTLE MORE BECAUSE EVERYBODY HAS A INTEREST IN IN IT WORKING .
YES BECAUSE THEY THEY HAVE A SPECIFIC REASON TO DO SO BECAUSE THEY THEMSELVES BENEFIT FROM DOING A BETTER JOB .
RIGHT I THINK MOST PEOPLE UH DO NT WANT MONEY UM IT S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE MOST PEOPLE WANT UH TO FEEL LIKE THEY RE PARTICIPATING IN SOMETHING THAT UH THAT IS NOT A DRUDGERY YOU KNOW THAT THEY .
UHHUH .
ENJOY AND THAT THEY CAN GET SOME BENEFITS OUT OF .
AND IT S A CONTRIBUTION .
RIGHT .
WELL BILL UH THAT IDEA FITS ME EXACTLY I JUST RETIRED FROM UH THE UNIVERSITY HERE AND THAT S BEEN THE GOAL IN MY LIFE WAS TO CONTRIBUTE AND TO THE WORK THAT I WAS DOING IN MY RESEARCH AND THAT S WHAT MADE ME HAPPY AND UH THAT S THE TYPE OF GOAL I THINK MOST PEOPLE OUGHT TO LOOK FOR AND I M SURE A LOT OF THEM DO NT YOU CA NT STAND IN FRONT OF A COUNTER AND DO THAT KIND OF STUFF ALL DAY AND FEEL LIKE THAT YOU RE CONTRIBUTING SOMETHING TO A SCIENTIFIC LEVEL OF KNOWLEDGE OR SO FORTH .
YEAH .
WELL UH OUR PEOPLE GET A LOT OF SATISFACTION UM WE RE A FINANCIAL PLANNING FIRM .
YOU RE A FINANCIAL PLANNING FIRM .
YES .
HOW MANY UH .
YOU SAID YOU RETIRED I JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE A PERSON THAT I HAPPENED TO DO SOME PLANNING FOR THIS MORNING BUT .
UHHUH .
ANYWAY UH UH WE DO WE DEAL WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE RETIRED OR TRYING TO RETIRE .
UHHUH WELL .
AND UH IT S REAL IMPORTANT UH THAT THEIR BENEFIT PLANS THAT THEY GET FROM THEIR COMPANIES AND FROM THEIR WORK THAT WHERE THEY WERE THAT UH UH THAT IT TAKE CARE OF THEM THEY DO NT NONE OF THEM REALLY WANT TO BE RICH BUT THEY LIKE TO HAVE ENOUGH TO BE COMFORTABLE .
WELL WHAT WHAT CHANGES WOULD YOU HAVE YOU CONSIDERED UH IN DOING IT TO TO YOUR COMPANY THAT MIGHT BENEFIT THE EMPLOYEES OR PERHAPS THE COMPANY ITSELF BETTER .
WELL UM WE CONSIDERING INSTEAD OF TYING A PROFIT SHARING PLAN TO A A SALARY IS UH IS TIE UM UH A PERCENTAGE UM OF BUSINESS THAT UH THAT A PERSON WOULD PARTICIPATE AND BRING INTO THE COMPANY UH PAY THEM UH BASED ON THE PERCENTAGE OF BUSINESS THEY BRING INSTEAD OF BASED ON THEIR SALARY AND THE RE .
WHEN YOU SAY BRING IN DO YOU MEAN THAT THEY NEGOTIATED WITH PEOPLE TO TO COME IN AND UH ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT .
NO NOT NECESSARILY UM IT CAN BE INHOUSE PEOPLE WHO HELP YOU HANDLE X AMOUNT OF DOLLARS .
OH OKAY UHHUH EVEN THOUGH THEY DID NT BRING IT IN THEY HELP IT ONCE IT S THERE .
RIGHT WELL .
YEAH .
SEE WE HAVE DIF WE HAVE MARKETING PEOPLE AND THEN WE HAVE FINANCIAL PLANNERS AND UH THEN WE HAVE UH STAFF SECRETARIES AND ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANTS AND THESE SECRETARIES AND ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANTS UM YOU KNOW IF WE DO NT HAVE THEIR COOPERATION AND THEY RE NOT PARTICIPATING IN THE PROFIT OF THE COMPANY THEY THEY CAN GET VERY DISSATISFIED VERY QUICKLY .
UHHUH .
AND SO UH WE RE THINKING ABOUT PAYING THEM INSTEAD OF A PERCENTAGE ON SALARY PAYING THEM A PERCENTAGE ON THE BUSINESS THEY HANDLE SO ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT THAT WOULD HANDLE TWO MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF BUSINESS IS A LOT MORE VALUABLE THAN A PERSON THAT HANDLES A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF BUSINESS AND UH .
YES BUT IT IT MIGHT NOT BE NECESSARILY BECAUSE HE DID A GOOD OR BAD JOB BUT IT MIGHT BE WHETHER THE LOCALITY THERE THOSE PEOPLE WANT THAT KIND OF SUPPORT .
WELL AND AND BUT TO SEE THE THING IS THAT THEY GIVE SUPPORT TO THE FINANCIAL PLANNER THAT THEY RE THE ASSISTANT TO OR THAT THEY USUALLY HAVE SEVERAL PEOPLE THEY REPORT TO THAT YOU KNOW THAT THEY WORK .
UHHUH .
TOGETHER WITH .
UHHUH .
IT ENCOURAGES THEM NOT TO UH COMPLAIN WHEN THEY REALIZE THAT THEY GET A PART OF THE OF THE ACTION BASED ON THEIR EFFORTS AND NOT BASED ON BEING SITTING BACK SAYING WELL MAKE ME DO IT .
UHHUH .
SEE WE DO NT WANT ANYBODY AROUND HERE THAT SAYS MAKE ME DO IT I DO NT THINK ANYB ANY .
YEAH .
I THINK MOST PEOPLE WANT TO BE LACK OF BETTER TERM TERMINOLOGY THEY WANT TO BE SELFEMPLOYED BUT THEY DO NT WANT TO TAKE THE RISK IN OTHER WORDS THEY LIKE TO CONTROL THEIR OWN FUTURE BUT THEY ALSO WANT TO BE SOMEWHAT CONTENT TO GO AND COME AS THEY PLEASE .
THAT S TRUE .
WITHOUT SOME REAL STRICT ADHERENCE WHICH THAT S WHAT WE HAVE .
UHHUH .
LAURIE .
YES .
OKAY I M SUPPOSED TO ASK YOU HOW DO YOU MAKE USE OF YOUR CREDIT CARDS AND I M SUPPOSED TO COMPARE THOSE WITH MY MY HABITS .
OKAY HOW DO I MAKE USE OF CREDIT CARDS .
YES .
UM LET S SEE I CARRY A LOT OF CREDIT CARDS WITH ME MOSTLY BECAUSE I DO NT EVER HAVE CASH .
RIGHT .
AND I DON I DO YOU WORK FOR TEXAS INSTRUMENTS .
NO I DO NOT .
OKAY WELL AT T I WE HAVE TO USE WHAT S CALLED A TEX TELLER .
UHHUH .
IF WE WANT TO GET CASH OUT AND THOSE ARE ONLY AVAILABLE AT T I .
OH OKAY .
SO IF I M IN A MALL OR SOMETHING I CA NT GET CASH OUT WITHOUT PAYING EXTRA MONEY SO I M ALWAYS USING CREDIT CARDS .
SURE WELL MYSELF I ALWAYS TR I M I M A TRAVELING PERSON .
UHHUH .
AND I M OUT OF TOWN QUITE A BIT SO I USE CREDIT CARDS QUITE A LOT ALSO AS FAR AS EVERYTHING FROM SERVICE WORK AND GASOLINE IN MY CAR TO MY LOUNGING ENTERTAINMENT AND FOR EVERYTHING .
UHHUH YEAH ME TOO .
SO THAT S UH AS FAR AS USING THEM OUTSIDE THAT I M NOT I DO NT USE THEM TOO MUCH BUT MUMBLEX I I THINK MY WIFE IS SORT OF LIKE YOU SHE USES A CREDIT CARD .
MOST OF THE TIME .
YEAH .
SO SHE DOES MOST OF THE SHOPPING FOR OUR HOUSEHOLD SO SHE LL USE THEM MORE THAN I WILL .
UHHUH BUT DO YOU GET TO PAY THE BILLS .
YES .
SAME AT MY HOUSE .
SO IT S ME I M ALWAYS I M THE GUY THAT ALWAYS GOES TO LIKE DILLARD S AND I LL GO IN AND CHARGE SOMETHING AND I LL HAVE TO GIVE THEM MY DRIVER S LICENSE THEY LL HAVE TO LOOK UP THE NUMBER BECAUSE I M NEVER CARRYING A CREDIT CARD .
UHHUH YEAH .
BUT I DO CARRY LIKE MY AMERICAN EXPRESS AND MY VISA WHICH I USE FOR YOU KNOW PRIMARILY WORK TYPE THINGS .
UHHUH YEAH .
THIS IS MY FIRST CALL BY THE WAY SO .
OH IT S MINE TOO .
OH IS IT REALLY .
YES .
ALL RIGHT SO WE RE BOTH BEGINNERS THEN .
YEAH .
I VE HAD THIS FOR A COUPLE WEEKS AND I VE BEEN OUT OF TOWN SO THIS IS MY FIRST TIME TO .
OH OKAY .
TO USE IT .
OKAY .
SO .
NOW DID YOU PICK THIS TOPIC OR WERE YOU GIVEN .
NO I WAS GIVEN THIS TOPIC .
I SEE OKAY .
YEAH THEY GIVE YOU THEY ASSIGN YOU A TOPIC YOU CALL THE EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER .
RIGHT .
HAVE YOU TRIED IT YET .
NO .
OKAY WHEN YOU CALL THE EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER THEY ASSIGN YOU A TOPIC AND UH PRETTY UH CUT AND DRIED .
HUH OKAY UM LET S SEE SO HOW LONG ARE WE SUPPOSED TO TALK FOR .
I M NOT SURE A COUPLE ABOUT TWO MINU THREE MINUTES I THINK .
OKAY .
BUT I REALLY DO NT HAVE TOO MUCH MORE TO SAY IN REGARDS TO CREDIT CARDS I ONE THING I VE ALWAYS TRIED TO DO IS WHEN I GET MY CREDIT CARDS I ALWAYS TRY TO PAY THEM OFF BECAUSE I JUST SORT OF DETEST PAYING INTEREST .
OH YES .
AND UH .
DEFINITELY .
LIKE YEARS AGO MY WIFE AND I GOT MARRIED .
UHHUH .
SHE WAS THE ONE WITH A LITTLE BIT MUMBLEX THAN I WAS BECAUSE I HAD MY CREDIT CARDS I THINK UP TO THE LIMIT AND I WAS GIVING EVERYONE TEN DOLLARS A MONTH AND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT .
OH THAT WILL COST YOU A FORTUNE .
THAT WAS LIKE THIRTY YEARS AGO SO NOW IT S A LITTLE DIFFERENT WE I GET A BILL AND I LL PAY IT THE SAME DAY IT COMES IN .
YES YES .
OR AT LEAST I TRY TO AND I JUST KIND OF TELL MY KIDS HOW MUCH I HATE PAYING INTEREST SO THEY SHOULD FOLLOW THE SAME RULE .
THAT S RIGHT WELL YEAH IF YOU PAY IT THAT WAY IT I MEAN IT REALLY IS IT S LIKE GETTING A FREE LOAN FOR A WHILE .
OH YOU BET IT S JU .
WHICH IS WHAT I DO .
IT S AN ABSOLUTE SAVINGS .
OR IF YOU TRAVEL FOR WORK AND YOU GET YOUR REIMBURSEMENT BEFORE THE BILL COMES IN .
YOU BET .
YOU GET TO KEEP THE MONEY .
THAT S THAT S VERY HANDY .
YEAH IT WORKS GREAT .
WELL I THINK THAT S ALL I HAVE .
OKAY WELL IT WAS NICE TO MEET YOU .
NICE TO MEET YOU AND UH GIVE IT A TRY I THINK YOU LL ENJOY IT .
OKAY .
OKAY .
THANKS .
THANK YOU .
BYEBYE .
BYE .
OKAY BRIAN .
HI HOW YOU DOING KEVIN .
FINE THANKS .
GOOD GOOD GLAD TO HEAR THAT I UNDERSTAND .
ARE YOU A TOTAL BANNER .
TOTAL BANNER .
YEAH .
NO I I BELIEVE THAT UH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AND I AS AN INDIVIDUAL AND PRIVATE CITIZEN HAVE A RIGHT TO TO BEAR ARMS AND TO HAVE A GUN AS LONG AS I UH AM RESPONSIBLE WITH IT AND PROTECT THE SAFETY AND WELFARE OF MY KIDS AND AND SO THAT THEY RE NOT PLAYING WITH IT AND SO THAT THEY CA NT HURT THEMSELVES OR ANYONE ELSE PLAYING WITH IT I THINK THAT EDUCATION WITH A GUN IS IS CRITICAL AND IMPORTANT UH HOWEVER I DO BELIEVE THAT UH GUNS OUGHT TO BE MAINTAINED AND AND CONTROLLED THAT YOU CA NT GO OUT AND JUST BUY ONE OFF THE CORNER AND DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH IT BECAUSE PEOPLE THAT ARE ANGRY OR HAVE CONCERNS OR WANT TO SEEK VENGEANCE RIGHT AWAY HAVE EASY ACCESS TO GUNS AND IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT THEY CAN GO AND DO SOME DAMAGE THAT CAN HURT THEMSELVES AND OTHER PEOPLE SO ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN I I THINK I WOULD RATE MYSELF AS A IN THE SIX OR SEVEN OR EIGHT .
OKAY .
BUT I THINK THAT THERE OUGHT TO BE SOME CONTROL BUT I STILL THINK THAT UH INDIVIDUALS HAVE A RIGHT HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IT .
WELL SO LET ME MAKE SURE SO YOU THINK THAT UH MAYBE A FIVE DAY WAITING PERIOD FOR HANDGUNS OR THAT STUFF WOULD BE LEGITIMATE .
WELL I DO NT KNOW IF A FIVE DAY WAITING PERIOD WOULD BE LEGITIMATE UH THAT UH THAT MIGHT COOL DOWN SOME TEMPERS I THINK A A ONE DAY WOULD BE SUFFICIENT THE REASON I SAY THAT IS THERE IS AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE WHO GO TO GUN SHOWS AND IF YOU SEE AN AWFUL LOT OF EXHIBITS AND THINGS AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO PURCHASE A GUN IF THAT FIVE DAY WAITING PERIOD WERE IN EFFECT YOU WOULD NT BE ABLE TO PURCHASE ONE AT THAT GUN SHOW .
UH YOU JUST YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO BUY IT BUT THEY D JUST HAVE TO MAIL IT TO YOU I SUPPOSE HUH .
WELL I DO NT THINK YOU CAN MAIL THING GUNS THROUGH THE MAIL I DO NT KNOW .
OH .
OKAY .
I THINK THAT S A AGAINST THE LAW EVER SINCE KENNEDY WAS ASSASSINATED .
OH YEAH .
SO HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT GUNS .
LET S SEE I THINK THAT GUN CONTROL HAS COME UP BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN SOME CRAZIES THAT KILLED PEOPLE WITH GUNS AND I THINK THAT S THE PROBLEM THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS IS WHY THESE PEOPLE WANT TO KILL OTHER PEOPLE RATHER THAN THE INSTRUMENT THEY PARTICULARLY USED IN THE ASSAULT .
UHHUH .
WHETHER YOU KNOW .
WELL DO YOU THINK THAT THERE WILL CONTINUE TO ALWAYS BE CRAZIES .
SURE .
THEN UH HOW DO YOU PROPOSE THAT WE PROHIBIT THOSE TYPES OF INDIVIDUALS FROM GAINING ACCESS TO GUNS .
WELL WE HAVE SOME LAWS ON THE BOOKS THAT UH DO NT ALLOW CONVICTED FELONS TO PURCHASE GUNS IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY AND UH I WOULD AGREE A A SHORT WAITING PERIOD WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO UH TAKE CARE OF THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT TYPE THINGS BUT .
UHHUH .
UH I THINK BANNING SEMIAUTOMATIC TWENTYTWO RIFLES IS A A BIT ON THE EXTREME SIDE .
UHHUH .
AND A TOTAL BAN ON GUNS WOULD JUST LEAVE GUNS IN THE HANDS OF CRIMINALS WHO DO NT CARE WHAT THE RULES ARE ANYWAY .
OKAY DO YOU UH DO YOU FEEL THERE IS A NEED IN THE WORLD TODAY TO HAVE A AN AUTOMATIC HANDGUN .
THE ONLY PURPOSE FOR HANDGUNS IS TO SHOOT PEOPLE IN MY OPINION O OR YOU COULD DO IT JUST FOR FUN YOU KNOW KIND OF LIKE A GAME BUT UH .
WELL I THINK THAT THE THE POLICE UH OR LAW ENFORCEMENT HAVE A NEED BECAUSE OF THE TIGHT QUARTERS THEY MIGHT FIND THEMSELVES BUT THE PUBLIC I DO NT KNOW .
I THINK THAT I SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO OWN A HANDGUN .
UHHUH .
NOT A AUTOMATIC SEMIAUTOMATIC .
YES NOT AN UZI .
NO NO UH BUT I THINK A PERSON NEEDS A WAY OF DEFENDING THEMSELVES .
UHHUH .
YOU SAW INDIANA JONES THE GUY CAME AFTER HIM WITH THAT BIG KNIFE .
YES .
AND JUST HE TOOK CARE OF IT .
JUST ONE SHOT .
YES THAT S TRUE .
AND HE UH SAVED HIMSELF IN THE IN THE IN THE PROCESS ALSO .
THAT S RIGHT SO HOW IS WORK GOING .
VERY FINE VERY .
THEY DO NT LET YOU TAKE GUNS TO WORK DO THEY .
NO THEY .
THAT S UH THAT S PROHIBITED WHERE WE WORK ALTHOUGH DOWN HERE IN TEXAS UH .
UHHUH .
YOU DO HAVE A RIGHT TO TO WEAR AND CARRY ARMS WITH YOU AT ALL TIMES THAT S STILL .
CAN THEY BE .
THAT S STILL YOU CAN STILL DO THAT DOWN HERE .
IS IT CONCEALED OR DOES IT HAVE TO .
OH YOU CA NT NO IT SHOULD NOT .
HAS TO BE ON THE HIP .
BE CONCEALED IT HAS TO BE ON THE HIP .
HAS TO BE IN SIGHT SO THAT UH YOU KNOW THAT YOU RE NOT UH A MENACE OR .
CAN A S .
A PROBLEM TO INDIVIDUALS HOW ABOUT WHERE YOU LIVE THERE IN UTAH .
OKAY WOW I DO NT KNOW WHAT THAT WAS .
WHAT WAS THAT .
I DO NT KNOW .
AND UH TO UH THE BRAZOS RIVER .
UHHUH .
NEAR DINOSAUR VALLEY STATE PARK .

UHHUH .
UH NOW DAINGERFIELD IS LET S SEE I THINK THAT S A LITTLE BIT MOR MORE EAST FURTHER EAST AND AND MAYBE SOUTH IF I AM REMEMBERING WHERE THAT IS NO I THINK IT S A LITTLE BIT FURTHER NORTH WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT AT ANY RATE IT WAS IT WAS VERY NICE AS WELL BUT TYLER WE SORT OF GOT SPOILED WITH I THINK .
UHHUH .
BUT UH WE HAD LIVED IN MICHIGAN BEFORE WE CAME HERE AND UH HAD DONE A LOT OF CAMPING IN MICHIGAN I THINK THE UPPER PENINSULA OF MICHIGAN ESPECIALLY AND THEN ALSO WE HAD DONE SOME CAMPING IN COLORADO IN THE MOUNTAINS SO UH MY PARENTS WERE REAL AVID CAMPERS MUMBLEX AND MY HUSBAND S PARENTS WERE REALLY AVID CAMPERS AS WELL SO I GUESS WE JUST KIND OF CAME BY IT NATURALLY .

WELL SORT OF EARLY ON ESPECIALLY AS OUR CHILDREN GOT A LITTLE BIT BIGGER UH WE INVESTED IN SOME STACKING UH COTS YOU KNOW THAT WERE LIKE BUNK BUNK BEDS BUT THEY WERE COTS FOLD UP COTS THAT REALLY GAVE US A LOT MORE SPACE UM FLOOR SPACE AND SO YOU DID NOT HAVE TO BE CONSTANTLY GETTING THINGS OFF THE FLOOR IN ORDER TO WALK AROUND AND .
RIGHT .
UH GAVE US A PLACE TO STACK THINGS DURING THE DAY SO THAT WAS REAL NICE BUT UH WE UH LIKE MY INLAWS ALSO HAD A CAMPER OR UH A POP UP TENT YOU KNOW ONE OF THOSE TRAILER TOPS AND THOSE ARE REALLY NICE TOO A LITTLE MORE UH LUXURIOUS SO TO SPEAK BUT NOT MUCH .
DI DO THEY HAVE A KITCHEN IN THEM .
YES UHHUH IT S REALLY NICE IN FACT IT EVEN HAD HAD A LITTLE REFRIGERATOR UH AND THE WHOLE BUSINESS IT WAS QUITE NICE IN THAT RESPECT UH AND EVERYTHING WAS VERY CONVENIENT AND YOU DID NOT HAVE TO TO BE HAULING THINGS OUT OF YOUR THE TRUNK OF YOU CAR .

UM I M MAKING DRAPES FOR MY HOUSE JUST BECAUSE I M .
OH BOY THAT S HARD SEWING .
YEAH WELL IT IS NT AND IT IS .
IT IS YOU KNOW ACTUALLY THE SEWING IS NT THE HARD PART IT S JUST BEING ABLE TO LAY OUT THE MATERIAL AND MEASURE IT .

BECAUSE YOU NEED SO MUCH ROOM .
WELL IF IT IT DEPENDS ON HOW ELABORATE YOU GET IT .
IF YOU GET PLEATS AND ALL KINDS OF .

A FEW TIMES .
TRYING TO GET IT THROUGH BUT .
THAT FEELS REALLY GOOD .
YEAH SO THAT S NOT REALLY MY FAVORITE THING TO DO OR ANYTHING BUT I I NEED TO DO IT .
TO DO IT RIGHT .
I HAVE LET S SEE I HAVE A DOG AND A LOT OF FISH .
KEEPING FISH I GUESS .
KEEPING FISH MUMBLEX .
IS MY BIGGEST HOBBY .
WELL THEY RE PROBABLY EASIER THAN KEEPING DOGS THOUGH ARE NT THEY .
UM YES AND NO .
IT DEPENDS ON HOW FREQUENTLY THEY DIE AND .
OH NO .
HOW MUCH THAT BOTHERS YOU .
HOW MUCH THAT BOTHERS YOU AND YOU PROBABLY HAVE TO CLEAN OUT THE TANK TOO .
THAT S YOU DO NT HAVE TO DO AS MUCH AS AS I THOUGHT .
IN FACT MY PROBLEM I HAD FISH AS A KID AND THEY ALWAYS DIED .
OH NO .
IMMEDIATELY AND WHAT I M WHAT .
I THINK NOW IS THE REASON IS I KEPT THE TANK TOO CLEAN .
OH YOU RE KIDDING .
BECAUSE YOU HAVE .
BECAUSE THEY NEED TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF THE .
RIGHT YOU NEED TO LET THE BACTERIA BUILD UP AND THEN IT KEEPS ALL THE CHEMICALS IN BALANCE .
I SEE .
AND I WOULD JUST TAKE EVERYTHING OUT AND JUST LIKE YOU KNOW WASH IT WITH SCALDING HOT WATER .
OH NO .
AND IT WOULD KILL ALL THE BACTERIA AND THAT WOULD SCREW UP ALL THE CHEMICAL CYCLES AGAIN .
AND SO YOU D HAVE TO .
SO .
START ALL OVER .
RIGHT .
TO BUILD THAT UP PROBABLY .
THAT S RIGHT .
SO NOW ONLY I ONLY CLEAN THINGS TO MAKE THINGS LOOK MORE AESTHETICALLY PLEASING .
RIGHT RIGHT .
AND I DO NT TRY AND STERILIZE THINGS .
DO NT GO THROUGH THE WHOLE NINE YARDS AND .
THAT S RIGHT .
THEY .
KIND OF NEED .
A LITTLE BIT OF THAT .
THAT S RIGHT .
SO YOU VE HAD FISH FOR A LONG TIME .
WELL I VE HAD THEM I GUESS IT .
S BEEN TWO YEARS NOW I VE HAD A A TANK HERE AND THEN BACK AT HOME .
I USED TO HAVE A SMALL YOU KNOW FIVE GALLON TANK .
BUT THAT NEVER WORKED WELL .

WHAT SIZE DO YOU HAVE NOW .
I HAVE FIFTYFIVE GALLONS NOW .
OH THAT S A GOOD SIZE .
IT S A LOT EASIER .
HAVE YOU EVER HAD IT UH CRACK OR BREAK OR LEAK .

FIFTYFIVE GALLONS YOU D HOPE IT WOULD NEVER DO THAT .
THAT S RIGHT I REALLY DO .
BUT YOU KNOW .
DO YOU HAVE ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT FISH OR .
YEAH I JUST HAVE YOU KNOW WHAT .
THEY CALL COMMUNITY FISH .
UHHUH .
GUPPIES AND PLATIES AND AND BASIC THINGS .

THEY ARE .
THEY RE VERY EXPENSIVE AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU DIE IT S LIKE WHEN THEY DIE IT S MORE LIKE AN INVESTMENT .
YES I BET IT IS .
YOU LOST AN INVESTMENT SO .
DO YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THEM UH THE FISH EATING EACH OTHER .

A JAR OR SOMETHING OR .
WELL NO THEY HAVE BREEDERS .
OKAY .
IT S A LITTLE PLASTIC THINGS THAT SORT OF FLOATS .
OKAY .
AND YOU PUT THE MOTHER FISH IN THERE AND THEN IT .
S GOT LIKE A TROUGH UNDERNEATH HER .
OKAY .
SO AS THE BABIES COME OUT THEY FALL DOWN IN THE TROUGH AND THERE S A HOLE IN THE MIDDLE SO THEY FALL INTO THE BOTTOM PART OF THE CHAMBER .
OH .
SO THE MOTHER CA NT GET TO THEM EITHER .
AND THAT S YOU KNOW IT .
KIND OF WORKS BUT IT S ALSO GOT SLOTS IN IT SO THE WATER CAN CIRCULATE .
RIGHT .
AND ON OCCASION IF YOU GET A REAL SMALL ONE IT LL FIT OUT THE SLOTS .
IT LL GO THROUGH THE SLOT .
THAT S RIGHT SO .
BUT YOU KNOW IT WORKS I GUESS .
THAT WORKS ALL RIGHT THEN .
THEY DO NT UH WANT THE MOTHERS TO BE WITH THE LITTLE FISH EITHER .
OH THEY LL EAT THEM .
THEY WILL .
YEAH .

WE PAY FOR .
WHAT S YOUR OPINION .
WELL IT S KIND OF A BROAD SUBJECT UH I .
I THINK THERE ARE SOME AREAS WHERE WE WHERE WE UH PRETTY WELL YOU KNOW GET OUR MONEY S WORTH BUT I I ALSO THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF AREAS ESPECIALLY IN UH BIG GOVERNMENT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UH WHERE WE RE SHORT CHANGED .
UH LOT OF MONEY SPENT FOR UH THINGS .
THAT ARE NOT USED AND UH I WAS I WAS IN THE AIR FORCE AND I WAS AT THERE WERE THERE WAS EQUIPMENT AT EVERY BASE .
I WAS EVER ON THAT WAS JUST GOING TO WASTE .
IT WAS JUST SITTING AND RUSTING AND YOU KNOW AND .
OKAY .
I I TEND TO AGREE WITH YOU .
WHEN IT COMES TO GOVERNMENT SPENDING THERE ARE SO MANY STUDIES DONE THAT DO NT MEAN ANYTHING .
YEAH .
BUT WE LL SPEND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS IF NOT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON .
YEAH .
AND IT S NICE TO KNOW SOMETHING DOES NT WORK OR SOMETHING DOES NT EXIST BUT IT COULD BE PUT TO MORE PRACTICAL USE .
YEAH AND I I THINK THAT UH IT S A A TONE OF OUR TIMES THAT POLITICIANS UH ARE INTO THEMSELVES MORE THAN THEY ARE INTO YOU KNOW DOING SOMETHING WORTHWHILE FOR THE PEOPLE THEY REPRESENT WHICH IS REALLY UNFORTUNATE .
THAT IS TRUE .
I AGREE WITH YOU IN THAT AREA .
UH I HAVE A TENDENCY TO I M IN FROM TEXAS AND I READ YOU KNOW HOW OUR POLITICIANS VOTED EACH WEEK IN THE PAPER .
YEAH .
AND IT S YOU KNOW IT S INTERESTING HOW THE VOTES VARY AND WHAT .
THEY RAN ON IN PLATFORM .
UHHUH .
DO NT NECESSARILY COME TRUE IN THEIR VOTING IN THE SENATE OR CONGRESS WHATEVER .
AND DO NT REALLY RESPOND TO UH PEOPLE .
WHO WRITE THEM AND CALL THEM AND UH YOU KNOW UNLESS THEY RE IN THE LIMELIGHT AND UNDER PRESSURE .
SO YEAH I THINK WE GET SHORT CHANGED ON THAT .
RIGHT THAT S VERY TRUE .
WHAT WHAT STATE DO YOU LIVE IN .
TEXAS .
OKAY .
THAT S .
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT ROBIN HOOD .
WELL I WORK FOR SCHOOL DISTRICT AND UH IT S IT HAS HURT US .
A LOT .
UH THERE HAS TO BE SOME WAY I THINK TO EQUALIZE EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES .
BUT UH YOU KNOW OUR WE WE TEND TO THINK I THINK E ESPECIALLY BIG GOVERNMENT TENDS TO THINK THAT THE SOLUTION TO EVERYTHING IS TO THROW MONEY AT IT .
AND I DO NT YOU KNOW THAT S JUST NOT TRUE .
I DO NT THINK THE YOU KNOW I DO NT THINK MONEY IS GOING TO TAKE THE PLACE OF INTELLIGENCE OR UH PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS .
UH I THINK THERE ARE THERE ARE TOO MANY THINGS .
THAT MONEY CA NT UH THAT THAT MONEY CA NT BUY THAT THAT ARE IMPORTANT AS FAR AS EDUCATION IS CONCERNED .
THAT S TRUE .
WHAT SCHOOL DISTRICT DO YOU WORK FOR .

WELL I THINK OUR TASTES ARE FAIRLY SIM SIMILAR ALTHOUGH I AM I GOVERNMENT WORKER I DO TEND TO I M UH A SCIENTIST .
OH .
SO THAT TECHNICALLY I SUPPOSE I COULD GET AWAY WITH WITH EXTREMELY CASUAL CLOTHES BUT FOR THE MOST PORT PART I DO NT I WEAR FAIRLY RESPECTABLE LOOKING SHOES AND .
RIGHT .
AND A PANTSUIT OF ONE SORT OR ANOTHER AND UH I GUESS DRESS IT UP WITH A WITH A A VERY NICE BLACK JACKET WHEN I HAVE HAVE VISITORS OR HAVE TO GIVE TALKS .
WELL THAT SOUNDS NICE .
RIGHT .
UH IT SAID THE SEASONS DO DO YOU CHANGE MUCH THROUGH THE SEASON OR .
NO ACTUALLY I GUESS THIS SUMMER I I WORE SOME FAIRLY NICE JEANS .
UHHUH .
UH MORE THAN I HAVE IN PREVIOUS SEASONS BUT UH NO I TEND TO TO USE THE SAME THINGS BECAUSE ACTUALLY OUR OFFICES ARE VERY COLD IN SUMMER I DO NT KNOW WHETHER THEY THINK BY YOU KNOW FREEZING THEM UP OVERNIGHT THEN THEY CAN SAVE ELECTRICITY DURING THE DAY OR SOMETHING .

NO .
BUT YOU KNOW YOU WEAR A HEAVY SWEATER IN YOUR OFFICE .

IN A S IN A SENSE THE PEOPLE I KNOW WHO SPEND THE MOST ON CLOTHES ARE SECRETARIES ALTHOUGH THE FACT THAT MOST OF THE ONES I KNOW ARE IN THE GOVERNMENT AND THEY RE NOT MEETING THE PUBLIC .
RIGHT .
IT I FIND IT A LITTLE BIT STRANGE THAT THEIR PRIORITIES WOULD WOULD BE TO SPEND THIS MONEY HERE YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
I MEAN I SUPPOSE IF YOU WERE A A MORE A RECEPTIONIST AND MEETING THE PUBLIC AND IT WAS THE IMAGE OF YOUR COMPANY AT STAKE .
THEN MAY .
PERHAPS YOU WOULD HAVE TO DRESS UP .
UH WELL I DO NT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO JUST GO OUT AND BUY BUY BUY ANYWAY AND SO MY DO NT CHANGE DRAMATICALLY OVER THE YEARS IF I NEED SOMETHING NEW I WILL GO AND BUY IT BUT BASICALLY I M A A PRETTY MUCH THE SAME IN THE SUMMERTIME I WEAR THE LIGHT COTTON AND IN THE WINTERTIME I CHANGE TO THE SWEATERS .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND SO IT S NOT A WHOLE LOT OF OF CHANGE FOR ME EITHER AND UH ESPECIALLY WHEN I GO TO THE MEETINGS AND WEAR THE DRESSES I I I ENJOY THAT BUT IT JUST WOULD NT BE UH SMART FOR ME TO DO THAT IN MY HOME WITH MY CHILDREN .
UHHUH .
SO I HAVE TO UH THINK ABOUT THINGS LIKE THAT TOO I HAVE GIVEN SEMINARS BEFORE IN IN CREATIVE WRITING AND THINGS LIKE THAT NOW I DO NT KNOW IF THEY CONSIDER THAT A JOB I DO NT REALLY GET PAID FOR THAT UH OFTEN BUT UH WHEN I DO THAT THEN I I THINK I BECOME MORE BUSINESSLIKE UH BUT IT DOES NT REALLY CHANGE MY CLOTHING STYLE .

HOW THEY WORK IS FASCINATING TO ME .
OH YES I ENJOY IT MYSELF THE UH LAB FOR THAT UH COMPUTER LOGIC CLASS WAS A LOT OF FUN .
WAS IT DID DI .
YEAH WE GOT TO HOOK UP A FEW UH COUNTERS AND UH DECO ENCODERS .
HARDWARE STUFF HUH .
YEAH .
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT FUZZY LOGIC .
I VE NOT HAD A CHANCE TO WORK WITH IT ALTHOUGH UM MY UH DATA STRUCTURES TEACHER WAS TELLING US SOMETHING ABOUT HOW FUZ FUZZY LOGIC WORKS AS FAR AS THE CONCEPT BEHIND IT .
UHHUH .
NOW HOW YOU D IMPLEMENT THAT SOFTWARE WISE OR MECHANICALLY I DO NT KNOW BUT UH IT SOUNDS LIKE A VERY IMPRESSIVE PIECE OF PIECE OF WORK .
YEAH THEY RE PRETTY AMAZING UH I VE WRITTEN A COUPLE OF PROGRAMS FOR COMMERCIALLY UH .
YES .
AND IT S A FUN FIELD .
IN THE FUZZY LOGIC DIRECTION .
WHAT NO IN UH NO JUST REGULAR UH BUT YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT YOU KNOW WITH ANY COMPUTER PROGRAM ALL THE TYPE OF THINGS PEOPLE CAN DO TO YOU TO MAKE YOUR PROGRAM CRASH OR THINGS YOU .
YEAH .
NORMALLY DO NT CONSIDER .
ENTERING BAD INFORMATION OF ONE SORT OR ANOTHER AND .
YEAH PUSHING KEYS CERTAIN TIMES AND .
YEAH .
UH MESSING UP YOUR FILES AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
AND YOU RE GOING TO BE AN ENGINEER COMPUTER ENGINEER TYPE .
UH YEAH WELL WHAT THE COMPUTER WHAT THE C E T PROGRAM SEEMS TO BE SO FAR IS JUST A BROAD BASED SPECIALIZED FROM YOU GET PROGRAMMING A FAIR AMOUNT OF PROGRAMMING YOU GET HARDWARE YOU GET UH MORE OR LESS UH YOU GET BASIC ELECTRONICS COURSES THAT UH DEAL WITH YOU KNOW NOT ONLY THE DIGITAL CIRCUITRY BUT UH YOU KNOW POWER SUPPLIES AND AND UH JUST THE WHOLE GAMBIT BUT MOSTLY TOWARDS UH COMPUTER ELECTRONICS SO THE IDEA IS THAT UM YOU CAN GO IN A VARIETY OF DIRECTION FROM C E T MAJOR BUT I SA I HAVE MORE MUMBLEX WITH THE HARDWARE THAN I DO WITH THE SOFTWARE SO YEAH I .
I DO NT .
PRETTY MUCH PLAN ON I MEAN SO FAR I M PLANNING TO GO IN THE ENGINEERING DIRECTION .
THAT S GOOD UH .
OKAY DO YOU WORK .
YES I DO .
I THINK THAT S THE MAIN CHANGE WHAT DO YOU THINK .

UM HUH WELL I DO NT LIKE IT WHEN UH PEOPLE LISTEN TO MY PHONE CONVERSATIONS LIKE IF THEY RE OUTSIDE MY DOOR WHILE I M TALKING IN MY ROOM .
OR WHEN PEOPLE LIKE LOOK THROUGH MY THINGS IN MY BEDROOM .
YEAH THAT S RIGHT THAT IS REALLY AN INVASION OF PRIVACY .
YEAH .
I I FIND IT VERY ANNOYING WHEN I VE WORKED ALL DAY TO COME IN AND MY PHONE TO RING CONSTANTLY THE SOLICITORS AND THE CARPET CLEANING COMPANIES AND .
UHHUH .
DOES THAT HAPPEN IN YOUR PART OF THE COUNTRY .
YES UHHUH .
I UH .
DEFINITELY .
I COME HOME AND I AM TRYING TO GET A FEW THINGS DONE AND I CA NT DO ANYTHING BUT ANSWER THE TELEPHONE .
RIGHT .
SOME EVENINGS ARE WORSE THAN OTHERS BUT I WISH I COULD PUT A STOP TO IT BUT I DO NT KNOW WHAT TO DO TO STOP IT .
RIGHT EVEN UH WE USED TO HAVE A SIGN ON OUR DOOR THAT SAID NO SOLICITING AND THEY WOULD STILL COME TO OUR DOOR .
UHHUH .
AND KNOCK AND .
THEY WOULD THINK IT DID NT MEAN THEM I GUESS .
I GUESS NOT NO .
EVERYBODY BUT ME .
YEAH .
OH GOODNESS ARE YOU STIL DO YOU LIVE AT HOME WITH YOUR PARENTS .
YES UHHUH .
UHHUH .
YEAH .
SO YOUR PRIVACY IS INVADED PROBABLY BY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY .
YEAH MOSTLY .
YEAH .
NOW WHAT CAN YOU DO TO STOP THAT .
OH I DO NT KNOW .
WELL I AM USED TO IT NOW BUT SOMETIMES IT SORT OF GETS GETS TO ME BUT THERE IS NOT MUCH I CAN REALLY DO .
NO .
NO .
JUST HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT I GUESS .
YEAH .
TRY TO REMEMBER TO RESPECT THEIR PRIVACY AND MAYBE THEY WILL RESPECT YOURS AND .
WELL I DO NT KNOW .
I ALWAYS .
DO YOU HAVE BROTHERS .
UH NO YES I DO BUT THEY DO NT LIVE AT HOME .
OH OKAY I WAS RA I HAD TWO YOUNGER BROTHERS AND THEY NEARLY DROVE ME CRAZY LISTENING TO TELEPHONE CONVERSATIONS AND .
OH I USED TO DO THAT THOUGH BECAUSE I WAS THE YOUNGEST I WOULD PICK UP THE PHONE AND LISTEN TO THEIRS .
BUT I .
I WOULD GET IN THE BATHROOM AND LOCK THE DOOR SO MAYBE THEY COULD NT HEAR ME AND THEN THEY WOULD GO GET ON THE OTHER EXTENSION .
OH .
AND I COULD HEAR THEM BUT I COULD NT GET THEM TO HANG UP YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
BUT I STOPPED DOING THAT A LONG TIME AGO .
AND THEY STILL DO IT TO ME .
EVEN IT IN THE OFFICE I UH FIND THAT PEOPLE WALK UP AND AND WHEN YOU RE ON A CONVERSATION INSTEAD OF WALKING OFF OR JUST MAKING THEMSELVES BUSY THEY LL STAND THERE AND LISTEN TO WHAT YOU SAY UNTIL YOU HANG UP .
OH LIKE S YEAH THIS LADY DOES THAT TO ME AT WORK .
UHHUH .
WHEN I M TAKING AN ORDER OR SOMETHING AND SHE LL JUST SIT THERE AND LISTEN LIKE I M DOING SOMETHING WRONG AND SHE JUST STARTED AND SHE IS NICE BUT OKAY BUT YOU KNOW IT GETS ANNOYING WHEN THEY STAND RIGHT OVER YOU WATCHING EVERYTHING YOU DO .
YEAH .
BUT I .
LET S SEE I CA NT THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE .
NO .
I D REALLY CONSIDER AN INVASION OF PRIVACY OTHER THAN THE PHONE SOLICITORS ABOUT THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY BOTHERS ME I DO NT HAVE THAT MANY PEOPLE COMING TO MY DOOR .
RIGHT WELL OCCASIONALLY WE LL HAVE A PERSON HERE OR THERE BUT NOT NOT AS MANY AS THE PHONE CALLS .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW SO BUT .
AND I GUESS THAT S REALLY TH THE THING THAT REALLY BUGS ME THE MOST I CA NT THINK THA OUR KIDS IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD USED TO BOTHER ME BUT THEY VE ALL GOTTEN GROWN UP NOW .
UH .
AND WE LIVE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THERE IS NOT ANY LITTLE KIDS TO BOTHER ME .
OH .
SINCE MINE ARE ALL GROWN UP BUT WHAT ELSE WOULD BE AN ANNOYANCE WELL I GUESS TRAFFIC COULD BE AN ANNOYANCE .
OH YEAH ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU RE IN A HURRY .
DO YOU HAVE A LOT OF TRAFFIC IN YOUR AREA .
UM IT CAN GET BUSY YEAH USUALLY IN THE WEEK I M MUMBLEX .
UHHUH SOME DAYS IT S REAL REAL BAD HERE AND YOU WOULD LIKE TO FEEL LIKE IT S AN INVASION OF PRIVACY BECAUSE YOU CA NT EVEN RIDE DOWN THE ROAD WITHOUT PEOPLE ALL THE WAY AROUND YOU .
YEAH UHHUH .
YOU KNOW BUT .
YEAH I VE TRAVELED QUIET A BIT AND I VE BEEN THROUGH DALLAS TEXAS IT S PRETTY BUSY .
IT REALLY IS AND PRETTY NOISY .
YEAH .
IT REALLY IS .
YEAH .
I LIVE RIGHT ON A MAIN THOROUGHFARE SO WHEN I FIRST MOVED HERE I PROBABLY DID CONSIDER THAT AN INVASION OF PRIVACY BECAUSE IT AT FIRST YOU D HEAR A LOT OF NOISE ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GO TO BED .
OH YEAH .
AND EVERY TIME A A FIRE TRUCK OR ANYTHING WENT DOWN THE ROAD I WOULD WAKE UP BUT I GUESS I HAVE GOTTEN USED TO IT BECAUSE I DO NT EVEN HEAR IT ANYMORE .
OH YEAH I SUPPOSE YOU DO .
AND UH I JUST CLOSE IT OUT I GUESS BECAUSE I DO NT I DO NT REMEMBER WAKING UP IN SEVERAL YEARS AT NIGHT WHEN I D HEAR A FIRE TRUCK GO BY YOU KNOW .
UHHUH YEAH .
I THINK THEY WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO PULL INTO MY DRIVE BEFORE IT BOTHERED ME .
YEAH I AM A REAL SOLID SLEEPER THOUGH SO THAT PROBABLY WOULD NT BOTHER ME I D SLEEP RIGHT THROUGH IT .
THEY WOULD HAVE TO CHOP DOWN THE DOOR AND GET YOU OUT I GUESS .
YEAH IT TAKES A LOT .
LET S SEE WHAT ELSE IS AN INVASION .
I HAD AN OLD BOYFRIEND WHO LOOKED THROUGH MY NOTES ONE TIME .
OH .
I WAS MAD BECAUSE THOSE WERE MINE MUMBLEX .
WELL DID YOU HAVE HAS NAME ALL OVER THEM .
NO .
IT WAS A A LETTER FROM A GIRLFRIEND OF MINE I I JUST I WAS UPSET BECAUSE THOSE WERE MINE AND YOU KNOW I THOUGHT HE .
THAT WAS YOURS YEAH .
RIGHT I THOUGHT HE WOULD RESPECT ME MORE THAN THAT .
YEAH .
TO LOOK THROUGH MY THINGS AND NOT TRUST ME SO THAT WAS UPSETTING I WAS MAD ABOUT THAT AND MY PRIVACY THERE .
YEAH .
OKAY WHAT KIND OF FISHING DO YOU DO .
WELL MOSTLY UH A A LITTLE FRESH WATER FISH BUT MOSTLY LAKE FISHING LIKE RAINBOW TROUT AND STUFF BECAUSE I USED TO LIVE IN UTAH .
UHHUH .
BUT UH DOWN HERE I HAVE NT FISHED MUCH IN TEXAS .
THAT S ONE OF THE FEW THINGS I VE EVER FISHED FOR IS RAINBOW TROUT .
OH THEY RE REALLY NOT I THINK THEY RE GOOD TO EAT .
WHAT WHAT KIND OF BAIT DO YOU USE TO CATCH THEM .
OH JUST USUALLY WORMS NIGHT CRAWLERS SOMETIMES FISH EGGS .
OH REALLY .
SOMETIMES .
FISH EGGS .
YEAH .
OH I DID NT KNOW THAT HUH .
JUST LITTLE JUST LITTLE FISH EGGS .
UHHUH .
AND UH THERE S THIS ONE KIND OF CHEESE THAT YOU CAN PUT ON THE END OF A HOOK AND IT WILL STAY RELATIVELY WELL .
OH I DID NT KNOW THAT .
YEAH .
THAT S A GREAT WAY .
AND AND THEY REALLY LIKE THAT .
I THINK THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE A GOOD WAY TO CATCH CATFISH ALSO .
NOW I HAVE NEVER CAUGHT CATFISH .
OH LOOK CATFISH UH PERSONALLY I LIKE TO CATCH LARGE MOUTH BASS .
UHHUH .
AND CATFISH BECAUSE THEY FIGHT THE BEST .
BECAUSE THEY FIGHT THE BEST .
BUT A A CATFISH WILL REALLY JUST TEAR INTO ANYTHING LIKE THAT LIKE LIVER .
OH IS THAT RIGHT .
OR UH CHEESE OR ANYTHING THAT SMELLS TERRIBLE .
NOW IN AMARILLO DID YOU FISH ANY OF THIS .
UH NO ACTUALLY I ALWAYS USED TO GO TO MY GRANDPARENTS IN OKLAHOMA .
UM .
AND THEY HAVE THE UH LAKE TEXOMA RIGHT NEXT TO THEM .
UHHUH .
SO THE WE USED TO CATCH SOME UH SAND BASS OFF LAKE THERE S A ROOSEVELT BRIDGE AND WHAT WE D DO IS LET THE LINE ALL THE WAY TO THE BOTTOM AND CRANK UP YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
TURNS ON THE .
RIGHT .
REEL ABOUT SIX TO TWELVE TIMES AND THE FISH WOULD BE SITTING AT DIFFERENT LEVELS .
OH HOW ABOUT THAT .
SO YEAH YOU JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT LEVEL AND IN NO TIME SOMETHING WOULD HIT IT AND YOU COULD PULL THEM UP TWO AND THREE TIMES IN A ROW BUT YOU HAD TO FIND OUT WHAT LEVEL HOW MANY CRANKS THEY WERE OFF THE BOTTOM AND IF YOU LEFT IT ON THE BOTTOM THERE WAS A GOOD CHANCE THAT YOU D CATCH CATFISH .
OH .
AND OF COURSE DEPENDING ON HOW BIG YOUR BAIT WAS UH YOU KNOW WOULD BE DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU CAUGHT .
OH I THINK THAT IS REALLY INTERESTING .
YEAH THAT WAS A LOT OF FUN MY GRANDFATHER USED TO DO THAT AND WE USED TO HAVE A LIGHT AT THE TOP OF THE WATER .
UHHUH .
HE D REALLY SPOILED ME IN THAT RESPECT .
I THINK THEY RE SEE AND I WISH I COULD GO FISHING HERE BECAUSE I DO NT REALLY KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE FISHING HERE I GUESS IT WOULD IF YOU DID IT LIKE YOU WERE JUST UH SAYING THAT S PRETTY MUCH LIKE RAINBOW TROUT .
UHHUH .
YOU BAIT THE HOOK YOU THROW IT IN YOU TROLL IT .
UHHUH .
A LITTLE BIT AND THEN YOU WAIT .
YEAH .
AND THEY TROLL IT A LITTLE BIT .
WELL IF YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY FRIENDS WITH PONDS .
NO I DO NT .
I UH WELL IF YOU CAN FI WELL OR EVEN A LAKE IF UH SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME SOMEBODY S ON THE BANK ALL THEY WANT TO DO IS THROW IT OUT JUST AS FAR AS THEY CAN .
YEAH .
AND UH BRING IT IN TO YOU BUT IT S THE OPPOSITE WHEN YOU RE FISHING FROM A BOAT YOU YOU WANT TO L MAKE IT LAND RIGHT ON THE SHORE AND THEN DRAG LIKE A PLASTIC WORM .
OH UHHUH .
AND JUST HAVE IT COME INTO THE WATER LIKE A A REGULAR ANIMAL OR OR FISH .
UHHUH .
UH WELL YOU KNOW SOMETHING COMING OFF FROM THE BANK LIKE THEY USUALLY DO SO YOU DO NT HAVE TO REALLY GET UH FISH FROM A BOAT YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY RE ACTUALLY RIGHT THERE AT THE SHORE .
HUH .
BUT I DID NT USED TO BE SOLD ON PLASTIC WORMS BUT UH IF I AM NOW .
YOU ARE NOW .
OH YEAH .
I VE NEVER USED THOSE THAT S REALLY INTERESTING .
YEAH IT JUST UH JUST A SLOW REEL AND THEN LET IT SIT ON THE BOTTOM BUT THE KEY IS TO ALWAYS HAVE YOUR LINE TIGHT .
YEAH YEAH .
AND THAT WAY YOU CAN FEEL WHEN THEY RE HITTING IT AND BELIEVE ME YOU LL KNOW THE DIFFERENCE .
UH WHAT KIND OF FISH DO YOU LIKE THE BEST TO EAT .
OH CRAPPIE ACTUALLY .
OH DO YOU .
YEAH I VE BEEN FISHING IN THE THE OCEAN WE RE ABOUT THREE HOURS FROM THE OCEAN AND I ALSO LIKE SPANISH MACKEREL .

I AM TOO .
ARE YOU .
YES .
I DO NT DO THAT OH I GUESS I LL CALL IT THAT FANCY TYPE WALKING WHERE THEY KIND OF MOVE THEIR HIPS YOU KNOW AND .
UHHUH .
KEEP THEIR ARMS UP I DO NT DO THAT I MOSTLY JUST TAKE A A WALK AROUND THE BLOCK OR WITH MY BABY OR YOU KNOW AND I HAVE TO DO THAT AT LEAST ONCE A DAY IF IT .
OH THAT S GOOD .
IF IT S GOING TO MAKE ANY EFFECT ON SINCE I HAVE TO EAT THE SAME AS I DID BEFORE I CA NT NEGLECT THAT BECAUSE OF THE BABY EITHER .

SHE JUST UH WELL SHE WAS PREMATURE SO SHE S ABOUT NINE MONTHS NOW THOUGH GOLL TIMES GOES FAST .

WELL I WALK TWO AND A HALF TO THREE MILES EVERY NIGHT .
OH THAT S GREAT .
MY HUSBAND AND I WERE ON NUTRISYSTEM ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO .
UHHUH .
AND HE LOST SIXTYTWO POUNDS .
AND I LOST TWENTYONE .
OH MY GOODNESS .
SO WE VE DECIDED TO MAINTAIN OUR WEIGHT THAT WE WILL DO THIS EXERCISE WALKING PROGRAM AND WE WALK OUR DOG EVERY NIGHT .
UHHUH .
AND GO UP AROUND THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WE HAVE A LITTLE PATH THAT WE DO .
UHHUH .
AND UH EXCEPT IF IT S RAINING OR REAL COLD .
YEAH .
WHICH IT HAS NT BEEN .
EXACTLY .
WE TRY TO GET OUT UH EVERY EVERY NIGHT .
UHHUH .
AND HE PLAYS RACQUETBALL TWICE A WEEK BUT I M NOT INTO THAT SO .
I THINK THE WALKING IS ENOUGH TO HELP US STAY IN SHAPE AND TONED .
WELL I THINK THAT IS JUST WONDERFUL NOW AS FAR AS I M CONCERNED I HAVE SEVERAL OTHER CHILDREN AND SO UH I THINK AT THIS POINT TO FIT IT INTO TO OTHER THINGS IT S KIND OF A TASK .
YES .

NO .
I HAVE TO .
MY HUSBAND NEVER WAS EITHER UNTIL HE LOST THE WEIGHT .
UHHUH .
THAT WAS HIS DECISION HE HAD ARTHRITIS IN HIS HIPS AND HIS DOCTOR SAID HE NEEDED TO LOSE WEIGHT AND EXERCISE .
I THINK THAT IS SO WONDERFUL .
SO ONCE HE GOT MOTIVATED NOW HE S READY TO WALK EVERY NIGHT AND OUR DOG HAS LOST A LITTLE WEIGHT HE WALKS EVERY NIGHT TOO .
SO HE GETS EXCITED WHEN HE SEES US PUT ON OUR OUR SHOES OUR WALKING SHOES .
I BET I THINK THAT S REALLY REALLY GOOD AND AND YOU KNOW I THINK THIS AFTER YOU VE DONE IT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME IT KIND OF DOES GET TO BE A ROUTINE .
YES .
IT S NOT LIKE WHEN I FIRST STARTED IT YOU KNOW THAT WAS THE HARDEST THING WAS .
MAKING TIME FOR IT .

THAT ARE MORE COMMON IN THE METROPOLITAN YOU KNOW IN THE .

IT IT IS CONVENIENT IS NT IT .

WELL I CERTAINLY HOPE SO .
I MEAN I VE GOT A DAUGHTER .
THAT S A SOPHOMORE AT U T AND I M I M GOING TO U T .
A RIGHT NOW MYSELF SO .
UHHUH .
IT S NEVER TOO LATE .
WELL IT S OH I AGREE IT S NEVER TOO LATE .
RIGHT .
AND .
ESPECIALLY IN SOME OF THESE SCHOOLS AROUND HERE I THINK THEY HAVE ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT OLDER STUDENTS .
YEAH AND WHEN YOU RE SAYING OLDER WE RE TALKING FIFTY UP .
OH YEAH I VE SEEN SOME PEOPLE .
THAT ARE REALLY QUITE UP THERE .
YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
THEY LOOK LIKE IN THEIR VERY LATE SIXTIES AND I SAY .

NO .
BUT WE ARE SEASONED MINDS .
OH YEAH YOU RE REALLY READY TO LEARN FINALLY .
YES UHHUH .
I MEAN I DO NT KNOW WHY I EVEN WENT TO COLLEGE WHEN I WAS SEVENTEEN .

IT WAS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY .
YEAH SETTLE DOWN WE KNOW WHAT .
WE RE WANTING TO TO UH STUDY AND UH .
RIGHT RIGHT .
WE .
WE KNOW OUR LIMITATIONS .
RIGHT AND UH .
AND WE DO NT TRY TO BURN THE CANDLE AT BOTH .
ENDS AND IN .

THE MIDDLE ALTOGETHER .
WE DO NT GO OUT DRINKING BEER TILL THREE AND TRY TO GO TO CLASS IN THE MORNING .
AT SEVEN YEAH .
WE RE PAST YEAH WE RE PAST THAT AGE .
YES WE RE WE RE SMARTER NOW .
WE KNOW WHAT .
WE CAN DO .
YEAH RIGHT UH SO LET S SEE .
SO MINE I DO NT SPEND A WHOLE LOT OF TIME BECAUSE THEY RE NOT HERE .
UHHUH .
AND SO THE SECOND QUESTION FORGOT WHAT .
THE SECOND QUESTION .
WHAT WAS IT UH H WHAT DO THE TRENDS IN FAMILIES AND DO WE APPROVE WHAT .
OTHER .
FAMILIES DO .
WELL UH THE TRENDS IN THE FAMILIES WERE TO SPREAD APART DO YOUR OWN THING .
THAT S RIGHT .
BUT I HAVE SEEN .
A CHANGE .
LATELY YES I AM SEEING .
I WAS GOING TO SAY THE SAME THING .
I M SEEING A CHANGE THAT WHOOPS GOVERNMENT CA NT DO IT SCHOOLS ARE .
UHHUH .
NOT ABLE TO .
UHHUH .
AND BETWEEN A PERSON S RELIGION UH THEIR THEIR FAITH IN THEIR MAKER .
RIGHT .
W WHETHER YOU KNOW UH WHETHER YOU RE CHRISTIAN OR JEWISH .
RIGHT .
OR WHATEVER UH AND THE FAMILY .
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO SOLVE SOME OF THE PROBLEM HUH .
THOSE ARE THE TWO .
THAT CAN THAT THAT HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL AND OF COURSE JUDEOCHRISTIANITY UH AND OF THE JEWISH FOLKS TOO BELIEVE THAT THE FAMILY UNIT IS THE ONE .
THAT WAS GIVEN THE UH UH MISSION BY THE LORD .
UHHUH .
TO DO THIS VERY THING .
SO WHEN ANOTHER GROUP OF OF UH PEOPLE STEP IN TRY TO DO IT THEY RE THEY RE TROMPING ON OUR TERRITORY SO TO SPEAK SO .
OH .
I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT UH .
OKAY UM DOES IS THIS SOMETHING THAT CONCERNS YOU .
WELL I THINK IT DOES UM ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I JUST MOVED TO MASSACHUSETTS AND UH THEY RE HAVING REAL PROBLEMS BECAUSE THEY HAVE SO MANY UH POLICE LAYOFFS .
UHHUH .
AND UH PERSONALLY I DO NT LIVE IN A REAL BAD SECTION OF TOWN BUT UH JUST BECAUSE OF THE GENERAL AREA I LIVE IN THE INSURANCE RATES ARE REAL HIGH ON YOUR CAR AND THERE S A LOT OF CRIME WITHIN A FEW MILES OF ME .
RIGHT .
HOW ABOUT YOU .
YEAH WELL I LIVE OUTSIDE OF DALLAS AND IT S KIND OF IN A LITTLE SUBURB SO I FEEL PRETTY SAFE OUT HERE BUT I KNOW THE MURDER RATE IS GOING UP EVERY YEAR .
YEAH I UH .
IN DALLAS AND THAT WORRIES ME .
YEAH I RECENTLY MOVED HERE AND WHEN I WAS LOOKING FOR A JOB THERE WAS A LOT OF OPENINGS RIGHT IN THE IN THE WORST AREAS OF TOWN AND UH MY HUSBAND WAS WAS WHAT HE HIS CONCERNS WERE WELL NOT THAT I THINK YOU LL GET INVOLVED IN ANYTHING BUT IT JUST BE AN INNOCENT BYSTANDER JUST TO BE IN THAT LOCATION AND I THOUGHT HOW SAD IT WAS THAT .
YEAH .
JUST TO BE IN A WRONG LOCATION AT THE WRONG TIME AND AND A LOT OF KIDS YOU KNOW ARE CAUGHT THAT WAY BUT .
YEAH THERE S A LITTLE BOY JUST GOT SHOT AND KILLED LIKE LAST WEEKEND DOWN IN WHAT THEY CALL THE PROJECTS WHICH IS .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW SORT OF A BAD AREA BUT HE WAS JUST OUT RIDING HIS BIG WHEEL AND A COUPLE OF DRUG PEOPLE GOT INTO A FIGHT WITH A GUN AND HE GOT HIT AND KILLED BY A STRAY BULLET .
YEAH THAT EX .
THAT S REALLY SAD I VE SO YOU KNOW IT MUST BE FRUS .
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED DOWN HERE .
FRUSTRATING FOR THE PARENTS WHO CA NT GET OUT OF A SITUATION LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
IT D BE SO SCARY .
I KNOW THEY ASKED IN THE TOPIC FOR IDEAS ON HOW TO CONTROL CRIME AND IT DOES NT SEEM LIKE ANYTHING IS WORKING .
IT REALLY DOES NT IT S KIND OF SCARY I THINK THAT UH I THINK THE LAWS HAVE GOTTEN SO LENIENT YOU KNOW THE COURT SYSTEMS ARE TOO LENIENT I THINK THAT S PART OF THE PROBLEM .
BUT IN IN ON THE OTHER HAND THEY HAVE TO BE BECAUSE THE JAILS ARE FULL WE CA NT AT LEAST IN THIS AREA YOU KNOW THEY DO NT HAVE ANY ROOM TO PUT ANYBODY SO A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST GET OUT YOU KNOW BACK ON THE STREETS BECAUSE THERE S NO THEY CA NT KEEP THAT MANY PEOPLE IN THE BUILDINGS THEY HAVE .
YEAH THEY DO THAT HERE TOO BUT I SAY YOU KNOW THEY COMMIT CRIMES LET THEM BE OVERCROWDED YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
LET THEM SUFFER A LITTLE BIT .
I KNOW IT THEY HAVE ALL SORTS OF OF RIGHTS THAT YOU KNOW ARE QUESTIONABLE MAYBE THEY GAVE UP THAT RIGHT WHEN THEY COMMITTED THE CRIMES .
YEAH I THINK SO I THINK IF THEY KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE REALLY HORRIBLE WHEREVER THEY WERE GOING MAYBE THEY D THINK TWICE ABOUT DOING IT .
THAT S TRUE MAYBE THE PUNISHMENT SHOULD BE MORE SEVERE .
YEAH YOU KNOW THE OTHER THING THAT WORRIES ABOUT IT IS KIDS THAT ARE DOING SUCH BAD CRIMES SO YOUNG YOU KNOW LIKE ELEVEN AND TWELVE AND THIRTEEN YEAR OLDS THAT JUST GO OUT AND KILL .
I KNOW IT .
PEOPLE THEY I DO NT KNOW IF THAT S JUST A SYMPTOM OF SOCIETY AND THE BREAKDOWN OF FAMILY AND EVERYTHING BUT THAT WORRIES ME I WONDER .
YEAH .
WHAT THE NEXT GENERATION WILL BE LIKE .
EX EX EXACTLY BECAUSE THEY GET INVOLVED IN THINGS SO YOUNG THAT THEY DO NT REALLY .
REALIZE WHAT THEY RE INVOLVED IN .
YEAH .
AND UH SOME PEOPLE PREY ON THAT YOU KNOW THEY LL TAKE UH KIDS WHO DO NT REALLY REALIZE THE SERIOUSNESS EVEN AT FIFTEEN .
YEAH .
AND UH GET THEM INVOLVED IN THINGS BECAUSE UH WELL I DO NT KNOW I WAS WATCHING ON A MOVIE ON T V I DO NT KNOW HOW TRUE THOSE CAN BE BUT YOU KNOW THEY ONE GUY GOT ALL SORTS OF KIDS UNDER EIGHTEEN TO DO IT BY TELLING THEM YOU KNOW YOU WO NT HAVE A RECORD BECAUSE YOU RE UNDER EIGHTEEN THEY D STEAL CARS AND EVERYTHING .
OH .
SO I GUESS IF THEY HAD .
MORE OF A DETERRENT IF THEY HAD MORE SEVERE PUNISHMENTS IT MIGHT BE BUT THE COURTS ARE SO BACKLOGGED RIGHT NOW IT TAKES FOREVER JUST TO GO TO TRIAL .
YEAH SEEMS LIKE IF THEY HAD IMME MORE IMMEDIATE UH CONSEQUENCES TO THEIR ACTIONS IT WOULD SINK IN FASTER .
I THINK IT WOULD CONCERN ME EVEN MORE IF I HAD CHILDREN WHICH I DO NT BUT IF I HAD CHILDREN I WOULD NT KNOW WHERE TO RAISE THEM .
REALLY YEAH .
TO PROTECT THEM .
YEAH BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE NOW EVEN IN THE COUNTRY YOU HEAR ABOUT BAD THINGS HAPPENING .
UHHUH IT S TRUE THEY UH AND THEY THEY TALK ABOUT TOO THE GANGS SPREADING YOU KNOW LIKE EVERYBODY THINKS OF THEM ONLY IN L A AND NEW YORK BUT THEY SPREAD OUT TO COVER MORE AREA AND I DO NT KNOW IF IF GANGS OCCUR MUCH DOWN IN TEXAS DO THEY .
YEAH I THINK THEY HAVE THEM IN DALLAS BECAUSE I HEAR THEM TALKING ABOUT IN THE SCHOOLS DIFFERENT THINGS HAPPENING AND THEY VE HAD SOME DRIVEBY SHOOTINGS OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOLS .
YEAH THE SAME IN SOME OF THE AREAS AROUND HERE BUT I VE NEVER HAD ANY PERSONAL YOU KNOW I NEVER MET ANYBODY THAT I KNEW HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT .
ME EITHER .
OR SEEN ANYBODY BUT UH THAT S A SCARY THING TOO BECAUSE AT THAT AGE KIDS WANT SO MUCH TO BELONG TO A GROUP AND I THINK THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT SORT OF CONTROL THEM CONTROL WHAT THEY RE DOING ARE OLDER YOU KNOW BUSINESS YOU KNOW TRYING TO CONTROL WHATEVER YOU KNOW .
YEAH SEEMED LIKE LIKE IN THE FIFTIES WHEN GANGS WERE BIG IT WAS JUST TO BE PART OF THE GANG BUT NOW THEY RE SO MUCH INTO SELLING DRUGS .
UHHUH .
AND WEAPONS AND ALL THAT IT S PRETTY SCARY .
IT S TRUE AND THE WEAPONS MY GOD THE WEAPONS THAT PEOPLE HAVE ARE SOME PEOPLE ARE MOR SEEMED TO BE ARMED BETTER THAN THE MILITARY OR THE SAME AS THE MILITARY I DO NT KNOW WHERE THEY GET THEM .
REALLY YEAH THOSE MACHINE GUNS AND ALL THAT .
UHHUH .
YEAH THAT S SCARY IT S A WONDER THERE S ANYBODY WHO S WILLING TO BE A POLICEMAN ANYMORE .
THAT S THE OTHER THING UH IS IT S HARD TO EVEN I CA NT EVEN THINK OF WHAT THE BENEFITS OF THE JOB WOULD REALLY BE ESPECIALLY IF YOU RE AN INNER CITY YOU KNOW YOU CA NT REALLY FEEL LIKE YOU RE PUTTING MUCH OF A DENT IN WHAT S GOING ON AND YOU RE PUTTING YOUR LIFE ON YOUR ON THE LINE EVERYDAY .
YEAH DALLAS THEY WERE SAYING IN DALLAS THAT THEY CA NT HIRE ANYMORE POLICEMEN BUT THEY KEEP LOSING THEM ALL THE TIME AND THAT UH YOU KNOW EVENTUALLY WE RE GOING TO BE WAY SHORT ON THE NUMBER WE NEED BECAUSE .
I .
THEY WO NT LET THEM HIRE ANY NEW ONES AND .
UH .
THEY KEEP LEAVING .
YEAH I JUST READ AN ARTICLE YESTERDAY UM WHERE THIS WHAT USED TO BE A NICE TOWN IN THIS AREA THEY HAD A LOT OF BUDGET CUTBACKS MASSACHUSETTS IS BROKE RIGHT NOW AND A LOT OF THE TOWNS ARE DECLARING BANKRUPTCY AND THEY HAD TO CUT TWENTY GUYS FROM THEIR FORCES AND THE CRIME WAVE RATE WENT UP ALMOST INSTANTLY BECAUSE IT WAS SO WELL PUBLICIZED THAT EVERYBODY IN THE AREA KNEW THAT TOWN WOULD NT BE PATROLLED AS WELL AND SO .
IT S LIKE .
YEAH THEY FIGURE WHAT A HEYDAY HUH .
THIS IS A DEPRESSING CONVERSATION THOUGH .
IT REALLY IS WELL THERE S SOMEONE AT THE DOOR SO I GUESS I LL HAVE TO GO SEE WHAT MY DOG IS BARKING ABOUT BUT IT WAS NICE TALKING TO YOU .
OKAY I HOPE THINGS LOOK UP .
WELL THANKS SAME FOR YOU .
BYEBYE .
BYE .
WELL LET S SEE .
SO WHAT .
AS FAR AS I M .
SO WHAT GETS YOU .
WELL THE THING .
I THINK THAT ANNOYS ME .
THE MOST IS I HAVE I HAVE YOUNG CHILDREN A BABY IN THE HOUSE AND AND INEVITABLY AS SOON AS THEY RE ASLEEP SOMEONE CALLS ON THE PHONE TRYING TO SELL ME .
SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK THAT THAT IS PROBABLY THE MOST AGGRAVATING .
UHHUH .
UH YOU KNOW IT INVADES MY TIME .
I M THE ONE .
THAT PAYS FOR THE PHONE .
UH IF I WANT TO BUY SOMETHING I LL TAKE THE INITIATIVE AND AND GO FIND IT YOU KNOW .
AND THAT JUST REALLY DOES AGGRAVATE ME .
UH WHAT DO YOU THINK .
WELL I MEAN I THAT S EXACTLY THE KIND OF THING .
I WOULD HAVE SAID .
ALTHOUGH IN MY CASE .
IT .
S MY WIFE AND I .
BOTH WORK WE COME HOME AND JUST AS WE RE PREPARING DINNER OR EATING DINNER .
THE PHONE RINGS AND IT S ONE SOLICITATION CALL AFTER ANOTHER AND YOU KNOW .
YOUR TIME IS IS .
YEAH IT S IT S .
VALUABLE AND .
LIKE YOU SAY VERY ANNOYING AND UH WHY WHY DO WE LET THIS HAPPEN .
OH I THAT S THAT S INTERESTING .
I .
THE THE MARKET SEEMS TO JUST BE GROWING TOO .
I I GUESS ENOUGH PEOPLE ARE NOT SPEAKING OUT .
I M NOT SPEAKING OUT THAT S FOR SURE .
I JUST GET AGGRAVATED ABOUT IT .
AND .
WOULD WOULD YOU I MEAN IF YOU COULD LEGISLATE SOMETHING WHAT WOULD YOU LEGISLATE .
I REALLY DO NT KNOW .
I M I M NOT INTO UH HEAVY GOVERNMENT LEGISLATE LEGISLATING OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT AREAS BUT I I DO NT KNOW .
I JUST I DO PARTICULARLY FIND IT ANNOYING .
UH I M REALLY NOT SURE .
I HAVE NT GIVEN THAT A LOT OF THOUGHT IF IF IT SHOULD SHOULD GO YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
TO BE .
IT IT SEEMS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO DESIGNATE WITH THE PHONE COMPANY THAT WE DO NT WANT TO RECEIVE CALLS LIKE THAT .
WELL THAT YEAH THAT MIGHT .
AND THE PEOPLE MAKING THESE CALLS WOULD BE OBLIGED TO C COMPARE .
IDENTIFY THEMSELVES YEAH .
THE THEIR LISTS .
RIGHT .
THAT THEY RE GOING TO CALL AGAINST THIS LIST OF PEOPLE .
WHO DO NT WANT TO BE CALLED .
WELL THAT WOULD BE A GOOD .
UH .
AN INTERESTING WAY YEAH .
AND THAT THAT WAY THOSE .
WHO WANT IT CAN HAVE IT AND THOSE .
WHO DO NT WANT IT DO NT HAVE TO HAVE IT .
RIGHT .
SORT OF LIKE AN UNLISTED NUMBER WHERE YOU HAVE NT GONE TO THE TROUBLE OF ENLISTING YOURSELF .
RIGHT YOU RE .
EXCEPT EVEN UNLISTED NUMBERS ARE NT SAFE NOW BECAUSE THEY HAVE THESE THINGS JUST SORT OF DIAL THROUGH ALL THE NUMBERS .
OH IS THAT RIGHT .
OH THAT S INTERESTING .
UH AUTOMATICALLY AND .
AND THEY JUST GET EVERYBODY .
RIGHT .
OH BOY .
WELL I I DO WISH THAT IT WOULD STOP ON MY END .
YEAH .
BECAUSE IT IT SEEMS TO HAPPEN AT THE WORST POSSIBLE MOMENTS .
AND I I GUESS THE NEXT ONE IS IS DOORTODOOR .
UHHUH .
SOLICITORS .
I DO NT MIND THE CHILDREN WHEN THEY RE SELLING THINGS FOR SCHOOL .
I HAVE KIDS AND YOU KNOW THAT S JUST KIND OF .
YEAH .
PART OF IT BUT WHEN IT S ADULTS SELLING A VARIETY OF THINGS AND ESPECIALLY WHEN MEN ARRIVE AT ABOUT TEN OCLOCK IN THE MORNING .
UHHUH .
UH THAT REALLY IT MAKES YOU NOT FEEL PARTICULARLY SAFE .
YES .
AND IT S ANNOYING AS WELL .
AND THESE AND THESE PEOPLE MAY IN FACT BE JUST LOOKING TO S FIND AN UNOCCUPIED HOUSE TO ROB .
RIGHT YOU JUST YOU REALLY DO NT KNOW SO I I FIND MYSELF BEING A L A BIT ABRUPT AND A LITTLE BIT RUDER THAN THAN I MIGHT NORMALLY BE .
UHHUH .
BUT I DO FEEL LIKE IT S A AN INVASION OF MY SPACE .
YEAH .
AND UH .
WHAT ABOUT THESE TELEPHONE CALLERS .
SOMETIMES THEY RE DOORTODOOR BUT USUALLY THEY RE TELEPHONE CALLERS .
WHO WHO WANT YOU TO BASICALLY HELP THEM FILL OUT A QUESTIONNAIRE .
I VE NEVER QUITE UNDERSTOOD THE PURPOSE OF THAT .
YEAH I UH .
WELL I THINK THESE PEOPLE WERE HIRED BY FROM FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES .
JUST BE .
UH WITH YOU KNOW AND SO THEREFORE THERE S NO ONE ANSWER .
BUT BUT YEAH SOMETIMES IT S A MARKET SUR BASICALLY IT S A MARKET SURVEY .
JUST A SURVEY .
BUT THEY NEVER SAY WHO WHO .
THEY RE REALLY WORKING FOR OR WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT .
YEAH .
WHAT WHAT QUESTIONS ARE YOU KNOW .
THERE HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OF TIMES WHEN THE THE UH WHATEVER .
THE SUBJECT WAS I GUESS CAUGHT MY INTEREST AND I WENT ALONG WITH IT AND THEN THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL TIMES WHEN I JUST SAID WELL I JUST REALLY DO NT HAVE THE TIME YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
TO DEAL WITH IT AT THAT MOMENT .
YEAH .
BUT UH I DO NT GET TOO MANY OF THOSE .
YEAH .
I VE HAD JUST A FEW .
YEAH .
UH GENERALLY SOMEONE S TRYING TO SELL ME .
SOMETHING OR .
RIGHT WELL AND SOMETIMES THAT S THIS IS JUST THE LEAD IN TO A SALES PITCH .
RIGHT RIGHT .
TOO .
OTHER TIMES .
IT S YOU KNOW WASTING YOUR TIME .
TO COLLECT THE DATA THEY WANT FOR THEIR .
RIGHT .
MARKETING PURPOSE .
FOR WHICH IF THEY WOULD JUST PAY ME ENOUGH MONEY .
YEAH .
I WOULD BE WILLING TO CONSIDER .
THAT S RIGHT .
BUT BUT A DOLLAR IS NT IT YOU KNOW IT S .
OH .
UH AND I ALSO SORT OF WORRY THAT YOU KNOW THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE GIVEAWAY PERSONAL INFORMATION .
UH WHEN WHEN THE CALL COMES AND AND THEY UH YOU KNOW SORT OF SEDUCTIVE TO YOU KNOW SOMEBODY IS ASKING ME MY OPINION ON ALL OF THESE THINGS AND SO I START ANSWERING AND THEN YOU YOU KNOW YOU GO DOWN A PATH .
RIGHT .
UH AND YOU DO NT KNOW WHERE IT S GOING TO END .
YEAH .
UH .
WELL WE .
IN FACT YOU DO NT EVEN KNOW WHAT .
YOU VE EVENTUALLY YOU KNOW THE TOTALITY OF WHAT .
YOU VE REVEALED AND YOU KNOW .
THAT S TRUE .
THIS IS NT YOU KNOW PROB MOST LIKELY NOT TO GOING TO BE USED AGAINST YOU BUT IT COULD AND .
YEAH YOU JUST NEVER KNOW I GUESS .
AND THAT SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING .
THAT SHOULD SHOULD REALLY BE OUTLAWED .
THAT YEAH I I .
BECAUSE IT S SUBJECT TO ABUSE AND IT .
ASKING FOR INFORMATION IS IS I CA NT REALLY SEE THAT I THINK THEY OUGHT TO IF IF NOTHING ELSE THEY OUGHT TO SPEND MONEY FOR A POSTAGE STAMP AND YOU KNOW WHEN IT ARRIVES AT YOUR HOUSE OH I .
DOES YOUR FAMILY NORMALLY HAVE A REUNION .

YEAH I THINK IT KIND OF UH IT DID NT REALLY TAKE OVER THE FIRST PAGE QUITE AS MUCH AS IT DID I THINK DURING THE WAR .
UHHUH .
BUT UM WE DEFINITELY NEED SOMETHING THERE WITH ALL THE HOSTAGES AND .
YEAH YEAH WHA .
WHAT ALL .
THAT S I THINK UH I DO NT KNOW IN THE SHORT RUN IT WOULD BE REALLY NICE TO GET THE HOSTAGES ALL BACK .
UHHUH .
I THINK THAT S REALLY UH REALLY IMPORTANT I I .
I I GUESS WE GREW UP IN SUCH A DIFFERENT WORLD I COULD NEVER EVEN IMAGINE TAKING HOSTAGES .
YEAH .
BUT I THINK THEY JUST HAVE A WHOLE DIFFERENT WORLD THAN WE DO SO I DO NT KNOW BUT I DO NT KNOW WHAT DO YOU THINK SOME OF THE LONG TERM REPERCUSSIONS MIGHT BE .
OH WELL YOU KNOW I JUST SEE THIS MIDDLE EAST SITUATION WITH WITH RUSSIA AND EVERYTHING THERE THAT S HAPPENED I THINK THAT THAT CRISIS HAS KIND OF SLOWED DOWN AND I SEE THE MIDDLE EAST AS BEING YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
THE REAL HOT SPOT OF THE FUTURE SO TO SPEAK .
YEAH .
SO I GUESS I VIEW IT AS BEING THE PRIME IMPORTANCE AS FAR AS .
UHHUH .
TRYING TO NEGOTIATE TRYING TO WIND DOWN SOME OF THE TENSIONS AND EVERYTHING THAT ARE THERE .
YEAH I THINK UM I DO NT KNOW I HAVE UH I JUST HAVE THIS THIS CIVIL RIGHTS MENTALITY I I GUESS YOU KNOW SHOULD WE OR OR YOU KNOW SHO SHOULD WE UH THOSE I WISH THOSE COUNTRIES COULD HAVE THE SAME TYPE OF FREEDOMS OR WHATEVER THAT WE DO .
UHHUH .
I GUESS THAT S WHAT I I HOPE FOR THEM BUT SOME OF THEM DO NT WANT THOSE FREEDOMS I THINK THEIR THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS MAY UM MAY NOT YOU KNOW THEY MAY NOT WANT IT AS A WHOLE SO I THINK THAT S SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE CONSIDERED TOO .
YEAH .
BUT I THINK THAT S A THAT S REALLY A LONG TERM TYPE THING I KNOW THAT THE THE IT SAID THINK ABOUT LONG TERM REPERCUSSIONS AND I WAS JUST THINKING WELL PEACE IS PEACE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND THAT REALLY IS THE NICEST THING .
I GUESS THE QUESTION IN MY MIND SOMEWHAT AND AND IT DEPENDS ON THE COUNTRY YOU KNOW I THINK SOME ARE MORE PEACEFUL THAN OTHERS .
UHHUH YEAH .
IF YOU LOOK AT UM IRAQ FOR EXAMPLE .
YEAH .
AND YOU KNOW THE RECENT THING WITH THE U N GOING IN THERE .
UHHUH .
AND THE THE BOMB DEVELOPMENT AND ALL THIS KIND OF STUFF YOU KNOW GOSH I THINK YOU KNOW WE SHOULD HAVE GOT HIM WHILE WE COULD .
YEAH YEAH .
OR WHATEVER .
I I THINK SO I THINK UM .
AND I THINK THERE S A CERTAIN MENTALITY .
AND .
TO THAT THAT S IN THE MIDDLE EAST YOU KNOW THE THE CONSTANT FIGHTING YOU KNOW AND .
RIGHT I THINK I THINK THEY REALIZED WE WOULD PROBABLY NEVER PUSH HIM OUT AND UH I THINK THE OTHER PROBABLY ALL OF THE OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES SAID THAT WE WERE SORT OF WIMPY FOR NOT FORCING HIM OUT .
YEAH I THINK THEY THEY LOOK AT FORCE AS A WAY OF .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THEIR THEIR MEANS TO THEIR ENDS .
YEAH YEP .
AND UH SO I YOU KNOW I DO NT KNOW SO MUCH IF THESE PEACE TALKS ARE GOING TO I DO NT KNOW HOW MUCH THEY LL STAY TO THEM .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW IF IF WE EVEN IF WE SAY THAT WE RE GOING TO DO STUFF I DO NT KNOW HOW THEY LL STICK TO THAT .
YEAH I I THINK THE THE THING IS THOUGH I I GUESS THE THE ARAB COUNTRIES THAT USED TO ARGUE WITH US OR NOT SUPPORT ANY I IDEAS THAT THAT COINCIDE WITH THE THE U S IDEAS OR WHATEVER USED TO PROBABLY RECEIVE MONEY FROM THE SOVIET UNION .
UHHUH .
AND I GUESS THAT S ALL GONE I THINK THAT S REALLY UH PROBABLY WHAT STARTED THE WHOLE PROCESS .
UHHUH .
I .
WELL THAT S PROBABLY A BONUS ON OUR PART .
YEAH .
YES IT IS .
I THINK I THINK THAT THEY RE S THEY RE SO MUCH MORE VULNERABLE NOW BECAUSE THEY DO NT RECEIVE SUPPORT .
UHHUH .
FROM THE SOVIET UNION SO I GUESS THEY RE SAYING WELL YOU KNOW WE CAN EAT TWO WAYS OR WE CAN GET THIS AID FREE FROM THESE COUNTRIES TWO WAYS WE CAN EITHER ACT LIKE WE RE GOING TO BE PROCOMMUNIST OR ACT LIKE WE RE GOING TO BE PRO UH PRODEMOCRACY AND WHATEVER GETS US THE MOST HONOR THAT S WHAT WE LL ACT LIKE WE RE GOING TO DO BUT WE REALLY WO NT CHANGE IN THE LONG RUN .
YEAH .
I THINK THAT S THE WAY I SORT OF SEE THEM ALL WORKING YOU KNOW .
I TEND TO AGREE WITH YOU .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW I THINK THEY HAVE IN MIND WHAT THEY WANT TO DO AND I THINK A LOT OF TIMES THEIR MUMBLEX MIGHT MAKE RIGHT .
UHHUH .
AND YOU KNOW IT KIND OF THE FORCEFUL YOU KNOW I DO NT KNOW BUT I JUST DO NT THINK PEACE IS UPPERMOST IN THEIR MINDS .
YEAH IT S IT S REALLY FUNNY AS AN AMERICAN AND ALWAYS BEING AN ALLY WITH THE ISRAELIS I ALWAYS FIND IT VERY HARD IN MY HEART TO A TO ALIGN WITH THE ISRAELIS BECAUSE THEY SEEM TO BE JUST AS BAD AS THE ARABS YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
BUT THEN AGAIN THEY HAVE TO LIVE IN THAT ENVIRONMENT THEY HAVE TO BE SUBJECTED TO ALL OF THE ARAB BOMBINGS .
AND TERRORIST ATTACKS AND WHATEVER .
YEAH .
THEN THEY HAVE TO NEGOTIATE ALMOST EVERYTHING AND THEN YOU THINK TO YOURSELF WELL YOU KNOW IN YOUR HEART YOU DO NT WANT TO BE ALIGNED WITH SOMEBODY THAT S MEAN AND CRUEL TO SOMEONE ELSE BUT IF THAT S THE ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY HAVE TO LIVE IN AND SURVIVE IN THEN YOU HAVE TO SORT OF LIKE I DO NT KNOW LOGICALLY .
AFTERNOON DOUG IT CERTAINLY IS UH GOING TO BE A PLEASURE TO CHAT WITH YOU .
UHHUH .
AND I M UH CERTAINLY WAS SURPRISED TO UH TO HEAR FROM YOU NORMALLY I TALK TO PEOPLE IN PLANO TEXAS .
YEAH ME TOO .
HOW DID YOU GET ON THIS LIST .
UH THROUGH NANCY DAHLGREN SHE UM SHE HAD SOMEHOW GOTTEN THE INFORMATION FROM T I .
WELL OKAY .
AND WAS DISTRIBUTING IT AROUND .
ALL RIGHT WELL NOW WHAT WOULD YOU SAY ABOUT THESE EVERYDAY INVASIONS OF OUR PRIVACY WHAT IDEAS DO YOU HAVE ON THAT DOUG .
UM SEE I M NOT SURE THAT I DO NT THINK THEY RE NECESSARILY WIDESPREAD IN THIS COUNTRY BUT I THINK THAT THE OPPORTUNITY IS DEFINITELY THERE FOR UM PEOPLE TO INVADE YOUR PRIVACY WHEN THEY WANT TO I THINK IT S UM .
IN WHAT MANNER .
WELL IT S CERTAINLY NOT THAT DIFFICULT TO TAP A PHONE IT S COMPLETELY TRIVIAL TO FOR INSTANCE LISTEN IN ON SOMEONE S CAR PHONE OR WALK AROUND PHONE SINCE THEY RE JUST RADIO SIGNALS .
UHHUH .
IT S UM AND LET S SEE WELL WHAT S THE FIRST THING THAT COMES TO YOUR MIND .
WELL THE THING THAT I THOUGHT THEY WERE UH CONCERNED ABOUT WAS WAS PEOPLE CALLING ON THE PHONE FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY TO SELL YOU SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
AND IN REALITY IN MANY CASES THEY KNEW OR THEY HAD INFORMATION ABOUT YOU THAT WAS PURCHASED FROM SOME OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AND I THOUGHT WAS UH BEGINNING TO INVADE THE PRIVACY OF PEOPLE BECAUSE THE THINGS ABOUT WHERE YOU LIVE AND AND MAYBE WHAT YOU PURCHASED IN PAST MONTHS IS THEN PUT DOWN AND SENT TO SOMEONE ELSE IN THE SAME BUSINESS AND THEY IN RETURN COME BACK AND TRY TO SELL YOU SOMETHING WITH THIS ADDITIONAL KNOWLEDGE TO ME THAT S AN INVASION OF PRIVACY .
YEAH I AGREE WITH YOU THERE FOR SURE UM AND I THINK THAT ALL THAT INFORMATION IS QUITE EASY FOR ANYONE TO GET IT S POSSIBLE FOR ALMOST ANYONE TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR CREDIT HISTORY FOR INSTANCE IF THEY JUST UM TWIST THE RIGHT ARM OR CLAIM TO BE FROM THE RIGHT ORGANIZATION WHEN THEY RE CALLING THE CREDIT COMPANY .
UHHUH .
IT S YOU KNOW POSSIBLE FOR A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD HACKER WITH A MODEM TO FIND OUT ALMOST ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL HISTORY NOT TO MENTION CHANGE IT IF HE WANTS TO .
YOU MEAN YOUR HISTORY IN REGARDS TO UH .
WELL UM .
THE CHARGE CARD COMPANY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
WELL YES WELL FOR INSTANCE YES UM AND THEY LL PROBABLY GOES INTO OTHER THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW YOUR RECORDS WITH THE GOVERNMENT OR UTILITY COMPANIES OR ANYTHING .
DO YOU CONSIDER THESE SERIOUS UH PROBLEMS .
UM UH NOT NOT YET ANYWAYS BECAUSE I DO NT THINK THEY RE WIDESPREAD ENOUGH BUT I THINK THEY HAVE THE POTENTIAL OF BECOMING SERIOUS PROBLEMS .
UHHUH WELL WHAT SHOULD WE DO ABOUT IT OR WHAT COULD BE DONE ABOUT IT DO YOU THINK .

TO CORRECT IT .
I M NOT REALLY SURE BECAUSE THE I MEAN SOCIETY IS GOING MORE AND MORE ELECTRONIC AND THERE ARE CERTAINLY BENEFITS TO ITS DOING SO AND IT S HARD TO HARD TO SAY WHETHER THE UM RISKS HAVE POTENTIAL OF OUTWEIGHING THE BENEFITS OR NOT AND I M NOT SURE WHAT CAN BE DONE TO ENSURE THAT THEY DO NT MUMBLEX WHY DO YOU SEE ANY OUT FOR US .
WELL I WOULD THINK THAT UH INFORMATION HELD ON RECORDS UH BY ANY COMPANY OR CHARGE CARD DEALER OR PERSON SHOULD BE ABSOLUTELY PRIVATE AND AND NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE UH TO GIVEN OUT BY THOSE COMPANIES .
UHHUH .
I MEAN IT SHOULD BE MADE A A UH NATIONAL OR A STATE LAW TO PROTECT PEOPLE SO THAT UH YOU WOULD THEN FEEL MORE FREE TO DEAL DIRECT WITH THESE COMPANIES .
UHHUH .
IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU CALL THE COMPANY YOURSELF DIRECTLY UH AND THEN KNOW THAT WHAT YOU TELL THEM WILL BE ON THEIR RECORDS BUT WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE ELSE UH YOU KNOW FROM THE OUTSIDE SO TO SPEAK .
UHHUH .
THEN YOU WOULD YOU WOULD FEEL MORE FREE TO UH TO GO INTO DETAIL WITH THEM .
YEAH I .
BUT BUT WE HAVE NO CONTROL OF THAT NOW .
UHHUH .

YEAH .
AND .
PREPARING IT RIGHT .
AND IT MAKES AN AWFUL LOT OF DIFFERENCE DOES NT IT .
OH IT SURE DOES .
WELL .
WELL WHEN I WAS BROUGHT UP YOU KNOW WE DID NT .
OKAY WELL CAROLYN THE UH ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS I D LIKE LIKE TO KNOW IS UH HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE KNOWING ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT OF A NURSING HOME BEFORE YOU WOULD SEND SOMEONE THERE TO LIVE AND SO FORTH .
WELL .
WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD BE REQUIRED AND SO FORTH .
UH I LL TELL YOU I I WATCHED WHAT WENT ON UM WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY SHOW I DO NT KNOW IF YOU SAW THAT A FEW DAYS AGO THAT THAT TALKED ABOUT NURSING HOMES AND ACTUALLY THEY SPECIFICALLY TALKED ABOUT SOME IN THE AREA WHERE I AM HERE IN TEXAS AND .
OH YOU KNEW OF THE HOMES THEN .
PARDON .
YOU KNEW OF THE HOMES THEMSELVES .
WELL I NO I M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THOSE HOMES PER SE .
UHHUH .
BUT UM THEY WERE IN THE AREA WHERE I LIVE .
OH OKAY .
UH AND IT WAS REALLY REVEALING TO SEE SOME OF THE YOU KNOW THE THINGS THAT GO ON I GUESS IN SOME OF THESE HOMES SO I WOULD DEFINITELY YOU KNOW WANT TO REALLY CHECK THINGS OUT AND UH GO I GUESS THAT THE BIG THING WOULD BE ONCE YOU GOT SOMEONE IN A HOME LIKE THAT TO TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU WENT DAILY YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
AND MADE SURE THAT THEY WERE CARED FOR AND .
WELL FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT ACTUALLY SENDING SOMEONE THAT THAT S YOU KNOW MEANS SOMETHING TO YOU TO ONE OF THOSE HOMES I REALIZE THAT YOU INDICATED YOU WANTED TO CHECK OUT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN ABOUT IT .
UHHUH .
AND OF COURSE THAT MAKES SENSE BUT HOW DO YOU THINK THEY WOULD FEEL I SHOULD SAY ABOUT MOVING FROM WHERE THEY HAVE LIVED MOST OF THEIR LIFE INTO A WHOLE NEW NEW HOME SITUATION .
WELL ACTUALLY I HAVE THAT KIND OF SITUATION BECAUSE MY MOTHER LIVES WITH ME AND SHE S .
UHHUH .
EIGHTYSEVEN .
OH OKAY .
AND UH FROM THE TIME THAT WE WERE TINY SHE SAID YOU KNOW I WANT YOU TO PROMISE THAT YOU LL NEVER PUT ME IN A REST HOME .
UHHUH .
SO I KNOW HOW SHE FEELS ABOUT IT YOU KNOW IF I UH .
YES .
IF I EVER HAD TO PUT HER THERE I THINK UH IT WOULD BE PROBABLY WHEN I JUST COULD NOT HANDLE IT ANY MORE YOU KNOW IF I .
UHHUH .
SHE GOT TO THE POINT WHERE SHE WAS TOTALLY BEDRIDDEN AND AND I MEAN I JUST DID NT HAVE THE SKILLS OR THE STRENGTH TO LIFT HER OR WHATEVER IT NEEDED I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE .
WELL HOW DO YOU FIND THAT YOUR YOUR PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP IS WITH HER KNOW THAT YOU RE BOTH TOGETHER ALL THE TIME AND YOU ARE HAVING TO DO A LOT MORE FOR HER THAN NORMAL DOES THAT DOES THAT CAUSE ANY PROBLEMS BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU .
UH I WOULD NT SAY ANY MORE THAN USUAL .
UHHUH IS SHE .
I THINK IT S VERY HARD FOR HER UM TO BE WAITED UPON SO TO SPEAK I MEAN I THINK IT S HARD FOR HER TO HAVE THAT ROLE OF NOT BEING ABLE TO DO AS MUCH AS SHE USED TO .
IT S HARD TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT YOU RE UNABLE TO PURSUE LIFE AT THE LEVEL THAT YOU DID BEFORE IS NT IT .
YEAH I THINK THAT S VERY TRUE .
YEAH .
UM ON THE OTHER HAND IT TAKES ON ALMOST A A SWITCH OF A MOTHER CHILD RELATIONSHIP .
IT IS DIFFERENT .
UH .
I HAD THAT ALMOST SIMILAR SITUATION MY MOTHER LIVES IN AN APARTMENT WITH MY SISTER .
OH .
AND UH SO I EXCEPT FOR THE THREE OR FOUR MONTHS THIS SUMMER THAT S THE ONLY TIME I EVER SPENT WITH MY MOTHER AND OF COURSE SINCE I SEE HER ONLY ONCE OR TWICE A YEAR I WAS JUST THRILLED .
UHHUH .
TO HAVE HER HERE WITH ME AND I SPENT EVERY MINUTE I COULD TO BE WITH HER AND UH COOKING FOODS FOR HER YOU KNOW JUST TO MAKE HER HER LIFE AS THOUGH SHE WERE ON VACATION .
UHHUH .
BUT SOMEHOW ANOTHER IT THAT DOES NT WORK BETWEEN MY MOM AND MY SISTER AND THEY THEY FIND THEY THEY ARE IN SPEAKING THEY I DO NT KNOW MY MOTHER FEELS UNCOMFORTABLE AROUND MY SISTER AND MY SISTER S UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE HER MOTHER S THERE .
UHHUH .
AND I GUESS IT S JUST BECAUSE THEY RE THERE ALL THE TIME .
YEAH .
SO IT S IT PUTS HAS PUT PRESSURE ON BOTH OF THEM FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW SO THAT S THAT S KIND OF BAD NEWS AND BY THE SAME TOKEN MY WIFE S MOTHER IS NOW MOVED INTO A NURSING HOME AND AFTER ALL SHE HAS BEEN A FARMER S WIFE FOR SIXTY YEARS .
UM .
AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE S HAD TO MOVE OFF OF HER FARM INTO ANOTHER HOME WHERE THE ENVIRONMENT IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT .
UHHUH .
SHE S RELATIVELY HAPPY BUT SHE DOES NT LIKE THE FOOD .
AND WHEN SHE COMPLAINS ABOUT THE FOOD .
HUH .
THEN THEY KIND OF GET ANGRY WITH HER .
UHHUH .
SO THAT S ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE THINGS YOU HAVE TO SOLVE .
YEAH .
WELL THAT S GOT TO BE A BIG ADJUSTMENT FOR SOMEONE THAT S AS YOU SAY LIVED ON A FARM FOR SIXTY YEARS AND THEN GO TO SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
YEAH AFTER ALL THEIR THEIR LIFE IS SO TOTALLY DIFFERENT BECAUSE IN THOSE EARLY DAYS THE FOOD THEY HAD TO MAKE IT FROM SCRATCH SO TO SPEAK .
UHHUH .
I MEAN YOU RAISED YOUR OWN CHICKENS AND YOU KILLED YOUR OWN HOGS I SUPPOSE AND THEN THEY .
YEAH .
THEY HAD TO STORE THE MEAT IN UH I DO NT WANT TO SAY BARNS BUT THEY HAD REGULAR LITTLE PLACES THEY THEY WOULD HANG IT YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
TO CURE IT AND SO FORTH AND AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN IT UH COMES IN DIFFERENTLY IT TASTES DIFFERENTLY .
THAT S RIGHT .
YEAH .
OKAY SCOTT LET S UH TALK ABOUT ADVICE THAT WE CAN OFFER A PARENT WHERE THE CHILD IS GOING TO GO TO A UNIVERSITY .
UHHUH DO YOU HAVE ANY .
AND .
DO YOU HAVE ANY KIDS OR .
I HAVE SOME YES SOME CHILDREN I HAVE THREE BOYS .
UHHUH .
AND THEY RE ALL QUITE YOUNG .
UHHUH .
AND SO WE WANT TO PLAN FOR THEIR EDUCATION OR WE RE SAVING RIGHT NOW AND WE RE GETTING BONDS AND AND UH AND HOPEFULLY FINANCES SET ASIDE SO THAT THEY CAN CHOOSE A COLLEGE THAT THEY WANT TO HOW ABOUT YOURSELF DO YOU HAVE ANY KIDS .
NO I M IN I M IN GRADUATE SCHOOL RIGHT NOW .
SO I IMAGINE YOU VE GONE THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE YOURSELF OF SELECTING YOUR COLLEGE .
YEAH .
YOUR OWN COLLEGE .
YEAH DEFINITELY IN FACT I M EVEN GOING UH SELECTING AGAIN FOR FOR MY P H D IT S IT S A CLOSE SUBJECT RIGHT NOW .
VERY GOOD .
UH .
WHAT UH WHAT DO YOU USE AS A BASIS TO DETERMINE WHICH COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY YOU GO TO .
WELL I USE UH UH UH I HAVE USED UH SEVERAL TECHNIQUES DEPENDING ON WHAT FOR UNDERGRADUATE I I YOU KNOW MY CRITERIA WERE MUCH DIFFERENT THAN .
UHHUH .
THAN LIKE FOR GRADUATE SCHOOL UH WHEN I WHEN I WANTED TO GO TO AN UNDERGRADUATE INSTITUTION I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT WAS YOU KNOW RATHER SMALL AND EASY TO GET AROUND YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
AND WHAT I WOULD WHAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE EASY TO GET THROUGH .
YEAH WHAT YOU THOUGHT HUH .
YEAH AND AND UH MY CHOICE OF GRADUATE SCHOOLS WAS UH YOU KNOW IT CHANGED A WHOLE LOT I I GOT TO WHERE I I WANTED TO UH GRADUATE WITH A LITTLE YOU KNOW WITH A NAME BEHIND ME RATHER THAN UH .
JUST THE DEGREE ITSELF .
YEAH YEAH .
WELL THAT S A THAT S THAT S GOOD BECAUSE I DID QUITE A BIT THE SAME THING IN MY UNDERGRADUATE WORK .
UHHUH .
I WANTED TO GET A SCHOOL THAT WAS SMALL ENOUGH THAT WAS PERSONABLE .
UHHUH .
THAT YOU DID NT HAVE A LECTURE UH HALL WITH ABOUT FIFTEEN OTHER STUDENTS COMPETING FOR THE PROFESSOR S ATTENTION .
YEAH .
AND UH BUT YOU I FELT THAT I GOT A PRETTY GOOD UH UNDERGRADUATE UH .
WHERE WHERE DID YOU GO .
I WENT TO UTAH STATE UNIVERSITY .
OKAY .
WHICH IS IN LOGAN UTAH .
UHHUH .
AND THE NICE THING ABOUT IT TOO IS I KNEW THAT I WANTED TO GET INTO BUSINESS AND THAT THEIR BUSINESS COLLEGE OF BUSINESS WAS ACCREDITED AND WELL KNOWN .
UHHUH .
AT LEAST THERE IN THE STATE OF UTAH .
UHHUH .
AND AROUND THE SURROUNDING STATES AND SO FORTH AND SO I I FEEL LIKE NUMBER ONE YOU NE YOU ALSO NEED TO SEE WHAT KIND OF NAME THE LIKE YOU MENTIONED BEFORE THE NAME THE COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY CAN CAN GIVE YOU .
YEAH .
AND ANOTHER THING THAT UH ANOTHER REASON WHY I CHOSE THAT WAS THE THE FINANCES I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT THAT I WOULD NT GET THROUGH FOUR THREE YEARS OF THE UNDERGRADUATE WORK AND AND HAVE TO LEAVE .
UHHUH .
AND UH SO I DID A LOT OF TALKING WITH FRIENDS WITH FAMILY .
UHHUH .
WITH UH COUNSELORS AT HIGH SCHOOL AND ALSO READ SOME SOME BOOKS ON ON THE SUBJECT AT THE AT THE LIBRARY .
UHHUH .
AND UH IT WAS KIND OF UNUSUAL BECAUSE MY MY TWO OLDER BROTHERS AND I ALL WENT TO THR THREE DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES DEPENDING ON WHAT OUR CHOICE WAS SO .
RIGHT .
HOPEFULLY WE WE CHOSE THE ONE THAT WAS BEST FOR US AND I I FELT VERY COMFORTABLE AND GOOD ABOUT THAT SO .
UHHUH DO YOU DO YOU WORRY DO YOU WORRY ANY ABOUT UH UH BEING ABLE I MEAN OBVIOUSLY YOU VE TAKEN PRECAUTIONS YOU KNOW OR MEASURES TO UH TRY AND PAY FOR YOUR CHILDREN S EDUCATION BUT DO YOU THINK THAT THAT S GOING TO BE ENOUGH .
I DO NT THINK SO .
NO .
I DO NT KNOW THE THE WAY THAT TUITION IS INCREASING UM EXPONENTIALLY .
YEAH .
IT S IT S IT S KIND OF HARD TO SET ASIDE MONEY AND HAVE THAT MONEY GROW .
YEAH .
AT THE SAME PACE THAT THE COLLEGE TUITION IS INCREASING .
YEAH .
I UH .
I ALL I ALL I CAN HOPE FOR IS THAT I LAND A PROFESSORSHIP AT A NICE HEAVY UNIVERSITY .
AND THAT THAT YOUR CHILDREN CAN USE THE BENEFITS OF .
YEAH .
THAT UNIVERSITY WELL THAT S AN EXCELLENT IDEA THAT S AN EXCELLENT IDEA ONE THING THAT UH THAT WE DID UH AND MY PARENTS AND OUR FAMILY IS THAT WE WERE NT ABLE TO AFFORD UM THE KIND OF EDUCATION THAT WE ALL DESIRED SO MY PARENTS STRESSED THAT WE GET EXCELLENT GRADES SO THAT WE APPLY AND TRY FOR SCHOLARSHIPS .
UHHUH .
AND UH SCHOLARSHIPS WERE VERY BENEFICIAL IN MY CASE TO HELP PAY FOR MY EDUCATION BECAUSE MY PARENTS COULD NT .
UHHUH .
AND WHAT THE SCHOLARSHIP COULD NOT SUPPLY I WAS ABLE TO TO WORK FOR AND .
YEAH .
AND SAVE AND AND AND GET .
UHHUH .
ALSO MY MY BROTHER UM HE S A HE S A MEDICAL DOCTOR RIGHT NOW HE HAD TO YOU KNOW ONCE HE GOT PAST HIS UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE DEGREE HE HAD TO TAKE OUT SOME LOANS AND HE S HE S WORKING TO PAY THOSE OFF .
YEAH .
SO I I THINK THAT THE UH YOU KNOW ONCE YOU GET PAST UH THE INITIAL STAGES OF IT THAT THERE S DIFFERENT OPTIONS YOU CAN USE AND AND UH .
YEAH .
THE STUDENT LOANS ARE ARE GOOD OPTIONS .
YEAH THAT S WHAT THAT S MY BIGGEST OPTION RIGHT NOW .
YEAH YES AND AND AS YOU RE WELL AWARE THAT TUITION S NOT .
SURPRISED THEY GET ANYBODY THIS TIME OF DAY BUT .
I VE BEEN TRYING ALL DIFFERENT TIMES .
UHHUH .
BUT I DO NT GET ANYBODY AT FIVE THIRTY DO NT GET ANYBODY AT NINE AT NIGHT SO THOUGHT .
OH WELL I M AT .

I THINK IT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR THEM .
UHHUH .
BUT AS A MOTHER OF TWO DAUGHTERS I MIGHT BE AFRAID OF WHERE THEY WERE SENT .

UHHUH .
BECAUSE IF THEY DO GOOD WORK IN AMERICA THEY LL PROBABLY BE SENT TO A GHETTO .

AND IF THEY WERE SENT TO A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY .
I COULD NT HELP BUT WAIT WORRIED YOU KNOW .
YEAH YEAH .
THAT THAT WOULD BE MY MAIN OBJECTION .
UH .
UHHUH .
I DO NT KNOW I THINK MAYBE IT S IT SHOULD STAY ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS .
I DO NT THINK IT WILL PROBABLY NEVER HAPPEN BUT .
YEAH .
YEAH I I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR UH EVERYONE TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT I I GUESS I DO NT FEEL LIKE IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING FORCED UPON YOU .
YEAH WELL IT IT PROBABLY WO NT .
UHHUH .
I DO NT I DO NT EVEN KNOW HOW WE D PAY FOR IT ANYWAY .

SO I AM THINKING I AM GOING TO CHANGE IT TO UH SOMETHING YOU KNOW THE BRICK IS MULTI COLOR .
UHHUH .
MOSTLY EARTH TONES I THINK I AM GOING TO PUT SOMETHING LIKE A BROWN ON IT ON THE OUTSIDE .
OH THAT WILL BE NICE .
AND MAYBE A LITTLE DEEPER BROWN IN THE ENTRY WAY OR SOMETHING SO IT WILL STAND OUT A LITTLE .
HUH .
WHAT COLOR DID YOU PAINT .
OR TWO TONE OR TWO TONE .

UHHUH .

WELL YOU HAVE GOT TO GET ONE OF THOSE LADDERS .

OH YEAH .
A FRIEND OF MINE THAT LIVES OUT IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD HE HAS DONE HIS HOUSE AND THAT IS WHAT HE I WAS OUT THERE LAST WEEK AND HE HAS FINISHED EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE CHIMNEY .
WELL WE DID TOO WE DID IT IN THE FALL AND IT IT S JUST TOO HIGH IT IS REALLY SCARY BUT .
YEAH .
AND THE ONLY THING I WOULD CONSIDER DOING A PROFESSIONAL MAYBE DOING THAT BUT IT OTHER THAN DOING OUR OWN WORK I PREFER IT TO A PROFESSIONAL .
WELL OUR HOUSE IN NEW MEXICO IT WAS STUCCO BUT WE HAD ALL THIS TRIM TO PAINT AND LOTS OF IT .
YEAH .
AND WE DID BASICALLY SEVENTYFIVE PERCENT OF THE HOUSE AND THEN I WAS AFRAID TO DO THE EAVES WAY UP HIGH AND STUFF .
UHHUH .
SO I HIRED THIS MAN TO COME IN AND DO IT A YOUNG KID .
UHHUH .

THE BLOWERS .
NO THOSE WHERE YOU BUILT LIKE A RAFTER THING .
OH OH OH OH I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT UH .
YEAH SCAFFOLD .
SCAFFOLD THAT S IT .
HE CAME AND DID IT THAT WAY AND I THINK HE CHARGED ME A HUNDRED DOLLARS TO FINISH UP .
HUH .
AND LITERALLY I WOULD NT HAVE DONE IT WITH THE SCAFFOLDS BECAUSE .
ITS .
ALL THE PLACES THAT I HAD LEFT FOR HIM WERE ABOVE HUGE HUMONGOUS CACTUS .
YEAH .
AND IF HE FELL HE WAS DEAD AND HE KNEW THAT SO .
OH MY SO THAT WAS WORTH IT GETTING A PROFESSIONAL .
YEAH .
FOR THAT .
PLUS HE CLEANED UP MY MESS .
OH I THINK THAT IS WHAT WE MIGHT HAVE TO DO WITH THIS CHIMNEY BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT WAS PRETTY EASY DOING IT OURSELF AND CAULKING IT AND EVERYTHING OURSELF .
UHHUH .
IT WAS NT TOO BAD I MEAN YOU THINK .
HOW MUCH DID IT COST YOU FOR THE PAINT FOR THE OUTSIDE .
SHOOT MAYBE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY .
YEAH .
SINCE IT IS A ONE STORY BUT WE DID UH LIKE TWO HEAVY COATS OVER IT BUT THEN THAT WAY .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW YOU ARE ASSURED YOU DID A GOOD JOB THAN YOU ARE YOU KNOW IF YOU HIRE SOMEONE TO DO IT .
BUT THAT FRIEND OF MINE THAT PAINTED HIS HOUSE OUT THERE IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD .
UHHUH UHHUH .
HE WENT TO UH MUMBLEX I GUESS TO BUY HIS PAINT .
UHHUH .
AND YET HE BOUGHT LIKE SEVENTEEN GALLONS .
MY WORD .
AND ANYWAY HE WHEN HE CHECKED OUT .
UHHUH .

UHHUH .
THEY ONLY CHARGED HIM FOR ONE GALLON OF PAINT LIKE THIRTEEN BUCKS OR SOMETHING .
OH MY WORD .
AND HE HAD HE HAD THE UH HE HAD ALREADY CARRIED A LADDER OUTSIDE .
UHHUH .
AND TOLD HER THAT AND SHE WRUNG ALL THAT STUFF UP AND MADE A MISTAKE ON THE PRICE OF THE PAINT .
UHHUH .
SO SHE HAD TO START ALL OVER AGAIN .
UHHUH .
AND WHEN HE GOT OUTSIDE HE NOTICED HIS RECEIPT WAS LIKE THIRTEEN NINETYNINE OR SOMETHING .
OH MY WORD .
AND HE SAW MUMBLEX .
SO THAT WAS REALLY WORTH IT PAINTING HIS OWN HOUSE .
YEAH IT WAS LIKE OVER TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS WORTH OF FREE STUFF .
OH MY WORD .
OH MY WORD WELL HE REALLY SAVED IN THAT WAY .
YEAH .
BUT YEAH I THINK WE ARE GOING TO DO UH ANOTHER BATHROOM BUT I THINK I WILL PROBABLY JUST DO IT IN A ROLLER I WANT TO DO IT ABOUT THE SAME COLOR AND JUST BE A LITTLE .
UH ROLLERS ARE SO MESSY WE NEVER MUMBLEX ANY MORE .
OH I KNOW BUT IT S THAT IT S THE TEXTURED WALL .
WELL A LITTLE PAINTBRUSH .
WELL I SUPPOSE WE .
BOTH HAVE CREDIT CARDS .
UHHUH YEAH THEY SEEM TO BE A PART OF LIFE .
YEAH .
YEAH HOW DO YOU USE THEM .
WELL I DO USE THEM .
UHHUH .
UH I HAVE A FEW FAVORITES THAT I USE MORE THAN OTHERS AND UH I TRY TO KEEP MY BALANCES FAIRLY REASONABLE .
I I COULD PROBABLY PAY THEM OFF ANY MONTH IF I WANTED TO .
UHHUH .
UH BUT OCCASIONALLY THEY CAN GET OUT OF HAND AND GET HIGHER WHEN WHEN YOU START USING MORE THAN A FEW .
UHHUH .
AND UH THEY .
ALL CAN BUILD UP .
UHHUH .
UH I THINK THEY RE HANDY .
I JUST GET UH I DO NT CARRY A LOT OF CASH WITH ME .

UHHUH .
OUT OF HAND .
IT S REALLY EASY JUST TO FORGET YOU KNOW THAT YOU YOU CHARGED THAT OR CHARGED THAT .
I TRY TO KEEP ALL MY RECEIPTS AND KEEP THEM IN SOMEPLACE WHERE I KNOW THAT THE BILL S GOING TO COME BUT SOMETIMES I FORGET AND SO YOU KNOW S A BILL WILL COME IN AND I LL THINK OH NO .

BUT SO FAR I VE BEEN ABLE TO WE VE BEEN ABLE TO PAY IT OFF EVERY TIME SO .
WELL THAT S GOOD .
I M LOOKING RIGHT NOW I M K KIND OF LOOKING FOR A VISA .

IT SEEMS THAT SOME OF THEM HAVE GOTTEN HIGHER .
UHHUH .
AND UH I SAW ON T V THEY HAD A PROGRAM ON UH CREDIT CARDS AND THEY RE SUPPOSED TO I DO NT KNOW IF IT WAS TENNESSEE OR ARKANSAS OR SOME SOME OTHER STATE HAD A VISA CARD .
THAT WAS THE LOWEST ONE IN THE COUNTRY .

YEAH .
RATE .
HAVE YOU EVER USED DISCOVER CARD .

UH I THINK SEARS ORIGINALLY .
OKAY .
PUT IT OUT BUT IT S UH IT S PRETTY WELL TAKEN ALL OVER THE U S NOW .
I MEAN UH I VE HAVE NT FOUND MANY PLACES .
THAT DO NT TAKE DISCOVER .
AND THERE S NO ANNUAL SERVICE FEE WHICH IS GOOD .
OKAY .
YOU KNOW AND THEN UH THEY ALSO GIVE YOU THEY SAY CASH BACK UH LIKE AT THE END OF THE YEAR .
FOR THE AMOUNT THAT I CHARGE I GET TWO DOLLARS BACK OR SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
BUT IF YOU USE CREDIT CARDS .
A LOT .
YOU PROBABLY GET MORE BACK .
OH THEY GIVE YOU .
MONEY BACK FOR USING YOUR CREDIT CARD .
YEAH BASICALLY .
OH .
THAT S IT .
I DID NT KNOW THAT .
AND I THINK THE SERVICE CHARGE IS PRETTY LOW TOO BUT I M NOT SURE .
UM .
WELL YOU KNOW SEARS WAS ONE OF THE FEW DEPARTMENT STORES .
THAT NEVER WOULD TAKE ANY OTHER CREDIT CARDS .
UHHUH .
I WORKED W AT SEARS FOR OVER TEN YEARS AND UH IT WAS ONLY A SEARS CARD THAT THEY WOULD TAKE .
UHHUH .
UNTIL I GUESS THEY DECIDED TO JOIN THE CLUB AND COME UP WITH THEIR OWN CREDIT CARD ANOTHER CREDIT CARD .
THAT WAS .
UHHUH .
ACCEPTED SO YOU KNOW NOW THEY LL TAKE THE DISCOVER BUT I STILL DO NT KNOW IF SEARS WILL TAKE VISA OR MASTERCARD .
UHHUH .
BUT UH .
YEAH .
I NEVER DID APPLY FOR A DISCOVER CARD .
I JUST FIGURE WITH THE VISA AND .
UHHUH .
AMERICAN EXPRESS I PROBABLY HAVE AN I CAN DO ENOUGH DAMAGE WITH THOSE TWO .
YEAH I THINK IT S BEST TO KEEP THE NUMBER DOWN .
UHHUH .
THAT YOU HAVE .
YEAH .
SO .
I VE GOT SOME THAT I YOU KNOW I HAVE NT EVEN USED AT ALL UH PAST FEW YEARS I PROBABLY WOULD NT BE ABLE TO USE THEM .
UHHUH .
BUT UH I I DO LIKE MY DILLARD S I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT S ONE OF MY FAVORITE PLACES TO SHOP .
UHHUH .
AND I DO USE DILLARD S PROBABLY AS MORE THAN ANY OF THE OTHER DEPARTMENT STORES .
UHHUH .
BUT .
YEAH .
WELL .
WELL .
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY .
NO NOT TOO MUCH MORE ABOUT CREDIT CARDS .
OKAY .
I DO NT THINK I DO EITHER SO .
OKAY WELL .
WELL IT WAS GOOD TALKING TO YOU .
GOOD TALKING TO YOU .
BETH .
OKAY .
GOOD LUCK .
HAVE A GOOD EVENING .
YOU TOO .
BYEBYE .
BYE .
OKAY WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDING HEALTH INSURANCE FOR EVERYBODY I THINK THEY SHOULD I KNOW I HAD A JOB UNTIL LET S SEE A YEAR AGO THIS PAST DECEMBER I WAS WORKING FOR P I E AND THEY CLOSED AND NATURALLY WHILE I WAS WORKING FOR THEM I HAD HEALTH INSURANCE BUT UM FOR ME TO TRY TO GET IT NOW IT WOULD COST ME LIKE OVER THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH WITH THE SAME COMPANY THAT WAS PROVIDING HEALTH INSURANCE AT AT P I E .
GOOD GRIEF THAT S JUST ALMOST UNAFFORDABLE IS NT IT .
RIGHT IT REALLY IS AND I THINK YOU KNOW I THINK UH GOD THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD COME UP WITH SOME KIND OF A HEALTH PLAN OR STOP THESE DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS FROM HAVING THEIR PRICES SO HIGH .
WELL I WONDER IF THEY COULD NT JUST PROVIDE UH INTERIM HEALTH INSURANCE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE BETWEEN JOBS LIKE THAT THAT MIGHT BE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I DO NT KNOW .
WELL THE THING IS YOU KNOW JOBS ARE SO HARD TO FIND .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND THEN .
WHAT YOU CAN GET OUT HERE IN ANYHOW IN THE VALLEY WHERE I LIVE AT NOW THEY DO NT WANT TO PAY ANYTHING FOR HEALTH INSURANCE AT ALL NO BENEFITS YOU KNOW UM .
YOU MEAN THE UH THE EMPLOYERS .
YES .
UHHUH .
I MEAN YOU GET A JOB NOW AND THE WAGES ARE REALLY LOW AND UH .
BECAUSE EVERYBODY S COMPETING FOR JOBS .
YEAH AND THEY DO NT WANT UH .
TO PAY ANY BENEFITS SO YOU JUST YOU KNOW PRAY TO GOD THAT YOU DO NT GET SICK .
WELL I USED TO THINK THAT UNIVERSAL HEALTH INSURANCE WAS PROBABLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO I I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT SOME MORE NOW BECAUSE MY DOCTOR IS UH ACTUALLY HE S CANADIAN .
UHHUH .
AND UH HE TOLD ME THAT THERE RE A LOT OF UH LOT OF COUNTS AGAINST THE CANADIAN SYSTEM WHICH IS BASICALLY THE ONE PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT FOR HERE .
UHHUH .
I DO NT UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENTS EXACTLY HE SAYS IT RESTRICTS YOUR CHOICE OF DOCTORS AND AND SO FORTH I M NOT QUITE SURE I UNDERSTAND WHY GOVERNMENT HEALTH INSURANCE WOULD RESTRICT YOUR CHOICE ANY MORE THAN PRIVATE INSURANCE DOES .
NO I DO NT UNDERSTAND .
I MEAN .
THAT EITHER .
WE RE ON A PRIVATE INSURANCE PLAN RIGHT NOW UH .
UHHUH .
ACTUALLY I HAVE MY OWN BUSINESS AND .
UHHUH .
AND WE OUR HEALTH INSURANCE IS THROUGH MY WIFE S EMPLOYER AND UH AND EVERY YEAR WE GET ANOTHER LIST OF WHAT DOCTOR S WE CAN GO TO AND WHERE WE CAN BUY OUR MEDICINE AND UH IT CHANGES EVERY YEAR .
YEAH .
IT S ALWAYS SO CONFUSING SO .
WELL I KNOW THE PLAN THAT I HAD WITH P I E I COULD GO TO ANY DOCTOR AND I COULD GO TO ANY DRUG STORE AND GET MY PRESCRIPTIONS FILLED YOU KNOW THEN I JUST SENT CARDS IN .
UHHUH .
AND THEN THEY WOULD HAVE LIKE A TEN DOLLAR DEDUCTIBLE PER YEAR FOR MY MEDICINE AND .
WELL YEAH .
THEN THEY WOULD JUST SEND ME A CHECK FOR WHAT WAS EVER OVER THAT YOU KNOW .
OF COURSE THE RESTRICTED CHOICE IN THIS CASE IS BECAUSE ONLY CERTAIN DOCTORS AGREE TO ACCEPT THE UH THE LIMITS .
UHHUH .
OF UH COMPENSATION BUT OF COURSE THAT IS RESTRICTED CHOICE SO .
UHHUH UHHUH .
I DO NT THINK THAT THE RESTRICTED CHOICE REALLY UH HAS TO DO WITH THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH THE THE THE UH ATTEMPT TO LIMIT COST DOES NT IT .
UM .
AND EVERYBODY AGREES THAT WE NEED TO LIMIT COST SOME WAY SO .
YEAH THAT S TRUE THAT S TRUE THERE .
WELL UM .
WELL .
I GUESS THE MOST SENSIBLE THING I VE HEARD ABOUT THIS IS THEY SAY PEOPLE ARE TRYING YOU YOU HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT IF YOU RE GOING TO HAVE THE VERY BEST HEALTH CARE POSSIBLE AND UH AVAILABLE ON DEMAND WHENEVER AND WHEREVER YOU WANT IT THEN IT S GOING TO BE EXPENSIVE .
YEAH RIGHT .
AND IF YOU WANT TO PAY LESS THEN YOU RE GOING TO HAVE TO SETTLE FOR A HEALTH SYSTEM THAT IS NOT QUITE THAT UH LAVISH .
UHHUH .
AND UH .
BUT THERE S JUST SO MANY PEOPLE THAT CA NT AFFORD TO PAY ANYTHING YOU KNOW THAT PEOPLE THAT S ON UNEMPLOYMENT .
YEAH WHAT HAPPENED TO REAGAN S SAFETY NET ANYWAY .
I DO NT .
DID HE TAKE THAT BACK TO CALIFORNIA WITH HIM .
USING IT FOR A TRAMPOLINE NOW .
YEAH PROBABLY SO I DO NT KNOW BUT IT IS IT DOES SEEM TO BE A BIG PROBLEM YOU KNOW I DO NT KNOW WHAT THEY RE GOING TO COME UP WITH BUT UM I SURE WISH THEY WOULD COME UP WITH WITH SOMETHING AND UH LIKE I SAY AND AND I M AT THE AGE TOO WHERE THE I LL BE FIFTYSEVEN IN JUNE AND THE PEOPLE DO NT WANT TO HIRE PEOPLE THIS AGE ANY MORE AND I WORKED FOR MY PREVIOUS COMPANY FOR TWENTYSIX YEARS YOU KNOW SO IT S KIND OF HARD YOU KNOW SO .
YEAH THEY LL BE NEEDING YOU IN A COUPLE OF YEARS BECAUSE THEY RE RUNNING OUT OF KIDS DOWN THAT THE OTHER END .
AND .
YEAH THEY LL BE CALLING AT MY DOOR HUH BUT ANYHOW .
WELL IF THEY RE SMART .
YEAH NOW I I DO THINK THE GOVERNMENT THOUGH IS GOING TO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING UH WITH THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE IT YOU KNOW EVEN TO GO TO A LITTLE DOCTOR OUT HERE JUST TO ASK HIM ANYTHING COSTS YOU FORTY BUCKS .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW JUST FOR THE VISIT AND THEN HE THEN THAT S NOT COUNTING WHAT MEDICINE YOU RE GOING TO BUY AND EVERYTHING ELSE YOU KNOW AND HE MIGHT TELL YOU WELL YOU KNOW NOW YOU RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME BACK IN A WEEK AND .
RIGHT .
THEN THAT S ANOTHER FORTY BUCKS PLUS WHATEVER ELSE HE DECIDES TO DO TO YOU .

YOU KNOW .
THEY VE DONE A GOOD JOB .
I MEAN OF COURSE DRAFTING A FRANCHISE LIKE HIM CERTAINLY .
YEAH .
YEAH THAT ALWAYS MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE .
YEAH I MEAN THAT S .
SO .
I THINK THE WAY .
IT UH I THINK THAT S THE WAY .
IT WORKS NOW IN BASKETBALL .
YOU YOU KNOW MAGIC WAS A FRANCHISE FOR THE LAKERS .
YEAH .
AND YOU KNOW UH BIRD FOR THE FOR THE UH CELTICS AND .
AND YOU KNOW UH YOU KNOW I USED TO THINK THAT THAT ONE ONE .
PLAYER REALLY DOES NT MAKE A CLUB BUT IT REALLY DOES YOU KNOW .
WELL IT .
MUMBLEX .
YOU GET SOMEBODY LIKE MAGIC AND YOU CAN SEE THE DECLINE IN THAT TEAM .
WELL YEAH .
ONCE HE LEFT YOU KNOW IT S IT S JUST NOT THE SAME UH IT S NOT THE SAME TEAM .
THERE S NOT THE LEADERSHIP THERE THAT THEY USED TO RELY ON HIM FOR .
WELL I THINK YOU RE RIGHT AND I THINK ISAIAH THOMAS WOULD FIT IN DETROIT AND I THINK THOSE THINGS DO MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND THERE ARE MARQUEE PLAYERS .
AND I THINK .
OH YEAH .
I THINK JORDAN AND THE AND THE BULLS HAVE TO BE UH CONSIDERED THE LIKELY FAVORITES .
I DO NT KNOW WHO WOULD MEET THEM IN THE WEST .
UH I DO NT KNOW HOW GOOD PORTLAND WILL TURN OUT TO BE BY THE END OF THE YEAR .
THEY WERE SO DISAP .
WHO WON THAT PORTLAND GAME .
YOU KNOW I WAS NT I I D I WATCHED ONLY A FEW MINUTES OF IT AND I WAS NT PAYING ATTENTION .
UH AND SO I DO NT KNOW UH .
UH .
BUT PHOENIX YOU KNOW PHOENIX AND PORTLAND HAVE BOTH BEEN VERY GOOD CLUBS AND .
WELL WE UH TAXES EVERYONE THINKS TAXES ARE TOO HIGH I M SURE .
BUT UH I THINK WE DO GET QUITE A GOOD VALUE FOR THE TAX DOLLARS WE SPEND IN MOST CASES .
WHAT DO YOU THINK .
UH YEAH I I THINK SO .
I I M UH I THINK I M I THINK I M UH A LITTLE OUT OF THE ORDINARY IN THAT THAT I I UH I THINK I M MORE WORRIED ABOUT THE DEFICIT THE NATIONAL DEFICIT THAN THAN UH A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE ARE AND THINK THAT WE NEED TO WE NEED TO EITHER RAISE OUR TAXES OR OR CUTBACK ON SOMETHING AND I DO NT KNOW WHAT TO CUTBACK ON TO .
AT THIS STAGE .
IT S HARD TO TELL .
TO GET TO GET THAT TO GET THAT SETTLED .
AND AND UH .
AND UH I KNOW I M A REAL A REAL UH OUT OF IT IN TERMS OF TAXES SO I M NO I M UH THINK THAT THE WE REALLY OUGHT TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER WHAT .
AN INCOME TAX MIGHT DO THAT UH FOR TEXAS AND AND .
WELL AT THIS STAGE .
I THINK WE VE TAXED PROPERTY ALMOST TO THE LIMIT BECAUSE .
YEAH .
I THINK SO .
LIKE THE THE PROPERTY TAXES ON THE HOMES HAVE REACHED THE POINT THAT IT S PRECLUDING PEOPLE FROM BEING ABLE TO OWN A HOME BECAUSE OF THE COST OF THE TAXES ON THEM .
YEAH .
I KNOW I LIVE IN RICHARDSON .
YEAH .
AND IT S UP OVER TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS .
A YEAR FOR TAXES ON MY HOUSE .
YEAH YEAH .
BUT NOW WE RE GETTING PUBLIC SERVICES THE SCHOOLS THE HOSPITALS AND IF IT WERE NT FOR THE TAXES WE RE PUTTING IN THERE UH LOOK WHAT .
THE SCHOOLS COULD COST YOU .
YEAH YEAH .
YEAH NOW I M UH UH OH I WE D WHEN WE MOVED TO R RICHARDSON ONE OF THE REASONS WE CHOSE IT WAS FOR THE UH FOR THE SCHOOLS .
AND AND REALIZING THAT THAT THAT THAT QUALITY OF SCHOOLS MIGHT WELL HAVE HIGHER TAXES THAN OTHER PLACES BUT THAT WE WERE WILLING TO UH TO GO FOR THAT .
YEAH .
BECAUSE WE SUPPORTED THE .
THEN AGAIN THE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM HERE IS EXCELLENT FOR THE DOLLAR SPENT AND THE PUBLIC .
YEAH .
COLLEGES ALSO THE TUITION HAS GOT TO BE AMONG THE LOWEST IN THE COUNTRY .
UH .
YEAH .
ONE OF THE UH I BELIEVE I DO NT KNOW WHICH .
ONE .
IT IS UH DOWN THERE WHETHER IT S HOBBY OR UH THE OTHER EXGOVERNOR DOWN THERE .
THAT ARE PROPOSING DOUBLING THE TUITION .
WELL IF YOU DOUBLE THE TUITION IT WOULD STILL BE CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL TUITION IN MOST OTHER STATES .
YEAH I THINK THAT S RIGHT .
YEAH .
THAT WOULD PROVIDE UH POSSIBLY SOME RELIEF THERE TO UTILIZE SOME OF THE PROPERTY TAXES FOR OTHER THINGS SEE .
YEAH .
THE SOCALLED SIN TAXES ON LIQUOR AND THE CIGARETTES AND SUCH AS THAT GENERATE A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT BUT I P EVENTUALLY I THINK YOU MAY TAX PEOPLE OUT OF SMOKING EVEN .
I I DO NT I DO NT KNOW ABOUT THAT I I .
YEAH .
WELL I QUIT TEN YEARS AGO SO I .
I SEE .
OKAY .
NO UH .
I COULD NT AFFORD TO START AGAIN .
YEAH WELL THAT THAT THAT WOULD BE TRUE .
THAT WOULD BE TRUE .
BUT .
I KNOW UH MY CHILDREN WOULD GIVE UP EATING BEFORE THEY GAVE UP THEIR CIGARETTES I THINK .
HUH .
BUT ALL THE VARIOUS TAXING AUTHORITIES .
THAT COME THROUGH I THINK THE ONE TAX .
I RESENT THE MOST THOUGH IS THE ADDITIONAL SALES TAX FOR DART .
WHICH IS PROBABLY NEVER GOING TO BE IN EXISTENCE IN MY LIFETIME .
YEAH AND AND EVEN IF IT IS IS NT GOING TO UH UH PROVIDE YOU WITH ANY ANY SERVICES IN THAT IT S NOT DOING TO PROVIDE A ROUTE FROM YOUR YOUR HOME TO A BUSINESS FOR INSTANCE YOU KNOW .
WELL THIS THIS IS A THING .
I THINK IT S LIKE UH BACK EAST .
YOU HAD TO START YOUR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION WHEN YOU STARTED YOUR CITIES .
YOU CA NT COME IN AFTERWARD AND REALLY BE SUCCESSFUL OR ECONOMICAL AT IT .
IF WE HAD BEEN LIKE A CHICAGO OR A NEW YORK CITY OR PHILADELPHIA OR SOMEONE LIKE THAT .
YEAH .
AND HAD A PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM STARTING IN THE HORSE AND BUGGY DAYS .
YEAH .
AND WHEN LAND WAS CHEAP AND UH CONSTRUCTION COSTS WERE CHEAP YOU COULD AFFORD IT .
BUT NOW .
AND .
DIGGING TUNNELS UNDER CENTRAL EXPRESSWAY AND THINGS LIKE THAT BECOMES COST PROHIBITIVE .
YEAH AND THE OTHER THING IS THAT WHEN IT WHEN IT S THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IS ESTABLISHED THAT EARLY ON THEN THEN THE BUSINESS UH BUSINESS AND RESIDENTIAL PATTERNS DEVELOP TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT .
ABSOLUTELY .
WHEREAS IN IN UH IN DALLAS HERE WE VE WE VE GOT UH THOSE PATTERNS WERE WELL ESTABLISHED BEFORE BEFORE WE REALLY TRIED TO TRIED TO DO THE DART .
AND UH FOR INSTANCE .
ALL THE ALL THE THE UH OFFICE BUILDINGS AND STUFF .
THAT ARE OUT HERE IN IN UH NORTH DALLAS AS OPPOSED TO DOWNTOWN UH TO TRY TO TO TRY TO PROVIDE EFFICIENT TRANSPORTATION FROM EVERYWHERE AROUND THE THE METROPLEX TO TO UH BOTH .
THOSE CENTERS OF OF BUSINESS PLUS EVERYTHING ELSE THAT S SCATTERED AROUND HERE AND THERE AS OPPOSED TO HAVING A CONCENTRATED BUSINESS AREA .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW LIKE NEW YORK DOES YEAH .
YEAH JUST TAKE LIKE IN CHICAGO WHERE THE PEOPLE DEPEND ON THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM TO GET THEM EVERYWHERE .
YEAH .
NEW YORK AND SOME .
YEAH .
PEOPLE DO NT EVEN OWN A CAR AND KNOW HOW TO DRIVE A CAR .
RIGHT RIGHT .
SOMEONE MADE THE ANALOGY UH WITH TEXANS AS BEING LIKE THE OLD COWBOYS AND THEIR HORSE .
AN OLD COWBOY WOULD JUMP ON HIS HORSE TO GO ACROSS THE STREET .
WELL MOST TEXANS WILL JUMP IN THEIR CAR TO DRIVE ACROSS THE STREET .
YEAH .
AND I M JUST AS GUILTY AS ANYONE ELSE .
OH YEAH .
YEAH .
I DRIVE TO WORK EVERY DAY BY MYSELF UH WITHOUT EVEN EVEN ANY THOUGHT OF CAR POOLING .
YEAH RIGHT .
AND UH MOST PEOPLE ARE THAT WAY .
YEP .
BECAUSE THEY RE USED TO NOT HAVING PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION .
YEAH .
SO BUT I .
YEAH .
HERE AGAIN I THINK MUMBLEX I RESENTED WHERE THEY WERE COLLECTING THE SALES TAX FOR FIVE YEARS BEFORE THEY TURNED A SPADE OF DIRT .
YEAH .
SO AND DOING ALL THESE STUDIES AND THE THINGS WE SAW ABOUT THEM TRAVELING TO .
SAN FRANCISCO TO SEE WHETHER THEY WANTED TEN FOOT WIDE OR TWELVE FOOT WIDE CARS OR SOMETHING .
I FELT THAT WAS A LITTLE UH WASTEFUL USE OF THE TAX DOLLARS THAT WE WERE PAYING YOU KNOW .
A LITTLE BIT MUCH .
OH YEAH .
YEP .
YEP .
OH THE C .
WELL THAT S ABOUT ALL .
I CAN SAY AT THIS TIME .
YEAH I TH I THINK SO I THINK THAT WILL PROBABLY DO IT SO .
OKAY IT S BEEN REAL NICE TALKING WITH YOU .
GOOD ENOUGH .
BYE .
BYE .
OKAY WELL THE TOPIC IS SELECTING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY .
UHHUH .
AND I DO NT HAVE ELDERLY PARENTS YET BUT NOT THAT FAR IN THE DISTANT FUTURE .
WHAT ABOUT YOURSELF .
WELL MY PARENTS ARE BOTH IN THEIR SEVENTIES .
MY MY MOTHER AND STEPFATHER AND MY FATHER AND STEPMOTHER ARE ALL IN THEIR SEVENTIES .
AND MY UH UH FATHER AND STEPMOTHER ARE NOT IN VERY GOOD HEALTH .
SO THIS IS SOMETHING .
THAT IS .
A CONCERN OF YOURS RIGHT NOW .
YES IT IS .
ARE ARE THEY LIVING INDEPENDENTLY RIGHT NOW .
YES THEY ARE .
OH .
THEY ARE .
HAVE YOU LOOKED AT ANY HOMES FOR THEM OR TALKED TO THEM ABOUT THAT .
NOT FOR THEM MY MY MOTHER AND STEPFATHER HAVE HAVE UH SET UP AN ARRANGEMENT WHERE THEY HAVE A LARGE HOME AND UH TWO OF MY SISTERS AND AND THEIR FAMILIES ONE OF THEM .
S HUSBAND AND THEN ALL THE CHILDREN ARE LIVING IN THIS HOME .
ITS GOT A LOT OF BEDROOMS AND BATHROOMS AND AND UH THEY .
ALL SHARE THE SAME KITCHEN AND DINING ROOM AND DEN AND KITCHEN .
AND AND UH MY FATHER BOUGHT THIS UH MY STEPFATHER BOUGHT THIS THINKING OF A TIME WHEN ONE OR THE OTHER OF THEM MIGHT NEED CARE AND THEY FELT LIKE THAT WOULD BE THEIR ALTERNATIVE TO A NURSING HOME .
OH THAT SOUNDS THE ULTIMATE .
UNLESS UNLESS THEY WERE SO ILL THAT THEY NEEDED NURSING CARE .
THAT COULD NOT BE GIVEN IN THE HOME .
WELL EVEN AT THAT POINT MOST CARE CAN BE GIVEN AT IN THE HOME .
THAT SOUND LIKE JUST AN EXCELLENT SOLUTION .
YOU MUST FEEL REAL GOOD ABOUT THAT .
WELL I I FELT GOOD ABOUT IT BECAUSE THAT S MY PERSONAL FEELING ALSO .
I UH I READ A LOT AND THEN I KNOW PEOPLE TH THEN HAVE VISITED NURSING HOMES AND UH HAVE HAD GREAT GRANDPARENTS IN THE NURSING HOMES AND IT WAS NOT A HAPPY SITUATION FOR FOR ANY OF THEM .
AND AND UH WE HAVE A VERY ACTIVE NURSING HOME HERE IN PLANO THAT THAT HAS UH ACTIVITIES GOING ALL THE TIME AND THEY HAVE UH EVEN THE PEOPLE .
THAT ARE WHEELCHAIR BOUND AND AND REALLY ARE ARE TI TI INCAPACITATED .
UHHUH .
GO AND UH PARTICIPATE IN OLYMPICS AND THEY MAKE THEIR CRAFTS AND SELL THEM AT A BIG FAIR .
THAT S HELD ANNUALLY AT A BIG MALL HERE .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW TH SO THERE ARE A LOT OF A LOT OF ACTIVITIES GOING ON ALL THE TIME AND THIS IS A NURSING HOME IT S NOT A SENIOR CITIZENS HOME .
SO THAT THE PEOPLE ARE REALLY UH .
REALLY IN NEED OF A NURSING HOME .
RIGHT .
THEY NEED .
RIGHT UHHUH .
THE NURSING CARE AND AND BUT IT S A VERY EXPENSIVE SOLUTION .
WELL IT S YOU KNOW I THINK WE JUST YOU KNOW LISTEN TO IS THE FACT THAT THERE ARE GOOD SOLUTIONS .
BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF NURSING HOMES .
IT S JUST A MATTER OF FINDING .
RIGHT .
A GOOD HOME .
RIGHT .
AND AND THEN OF COURSE THERE IS ALWAYS THE PROBLEM OF BEING ABLE ABLE TO AFFORD EITHER OF THOSE SOLUTIONS .
RIGHT .
UHHUH .
AND THAT I THINK IS WHAT IS SCARY AND I ALSO FEEL THAT THAT S WHERE SOME OF THE BAD IMAGES OF NURSING HOMES COME FROM .
IS WHEN PEOPLE HAVE TO PUT PEOPLE IN A NURSING HOMES AND THEY REALLY CAN NOT AFFORD THE BEST .
RIGHT .
AND THAT S RIGHT I WELL I TOOK MY HUSBAND ONE NIGHT TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM WHEN HE WAS IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION AND UH THEY BROUGHT IN A VERY ELDERLY MAN FROM A NURSING HOME .
WHO HAD HAD UH APPARENTLY INHALED SOME CHICKEN .
HE WAS EATING .
OH .
AND UH HE HAD APPARENTLY HAD NOT BEEN IN THE HOME TOO LONG JUST A WEEK OR SO BUT WHEN THEY THE FAMILY CAME IN TO SEE HIM THEY HAD NOT BEEN MADE AWARE I WAS IN THE ROOM WHEN THE EMERGENCY TECHNICIANS BROUGHT HIM IN FROM THE AMBULANCE AND I OVERHEARD THEIR CONVERSATION .
AND WHEN THE FAMILY WALKED IN HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER AND SONINLAW THEY WERE NOT EVEN AWARE OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED .
OH GOODNESS .
SO I TOLD THEM .
HE STRANGLED ON SOME CHICKEN AND UH THEY SAID THE THE WOMAN THE WIFE SAID HE WAS NOT EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE EATING ANY FOOD LIKE THAT THAT WOULD REQUIRE CHEWING OR .
OH .
SO YOU KNOW AND I THOUGHT .
WHAT .
A SHAME THEY PUT HIM IN THE HOME SO THAT HE COULD BE CARED FOR .
RIGHT .
RIGHT .
AND THEN THEY COULD HAVE DONE THAT WELL AT HOME .
AND THEN SHE WAS UPSET HE HAD ON TWO DIFFERENT SHOES ONE OF WHICH WAS NOT EVEN HIS .
HE HAD ON A PAIR .
OH .
OF SLACKS AND THE WIFE SAID THESE ARE NOT HIS SLACKS AND SHE SAID I JUST TOOK TWO PAIR OVER YESTERDAY FOR HIM .
THAT WERE CLEAN .
AND .
YOU HEAR THESE STORIES .
RIGHT .
ALL THE TIME .
RIGHT .
WELL I THIS WAS JUST SOMETHING THAT I WAS .
YOU HAPPENED .
I WITNESSED TO .
RIGHT .
AND AND UH AT NO POINT DID ANYBODY FROM THE NURSING HOME COME IN .
AND WE WERE THERE IN THE SAME ROOM WITH THE MAN FOR A HALF HOUR .
OH .
AND WITH JUST A CURTAIN OF COURSE BETWEEN US AND AND UH .
RIGHT .
TH THEY .
RE REVIVED THE MAN AND CLEARED OUT HIS AIRWAY AND SO FORTH AND HE WAS DEFINITELY JUST BY LOOKING AT HIM AND THE WAY .
HE ACTED YOU COULD TELL HE WAS IN NEED OF OF NURSING HOME CARE BUT THE FAMILY WERE ALL TALKING ABOUT UH PUTTING HIM IN ANOTHER HOME .
THEY SAID HE WILL NOT GO BACK .
WELL GOOD .
TO THAT ONE .
GOOD I M GLAD THEY HAVE A SOLUTION .
I M GLAD THEY .
THE OPTION .
TO DO THAT YES .
I KNOW .
I I WOULD HATE TO BE IN A POSITION WHERE THAT WAS ALL .
I COULD AFFORD AND THERE WERE NOT THERE WAS NO CHOICE .
EXACTLY .
MY UH MY EXHUSBAND S GRANDMOTHER HAD BEEN IN A NURSING HOME NOW FOR OH IT MUST BE SEVEN EIGHT YEARS AND UH AND UH .
OH MY .
IT S JUST HER HER CONDITION DETERIORATED DETERIORATED INSTANTLY UPON GETTING INTO THAT HOME .
UM .
AS THE SITUATION IS SO SAD BECAUSE IT JUST TAKES ALL THE DIGNITY AWAY FROM .
UHHUH .
UHHUH .
FROM PEOPLE .
WHO HAVE BEEN INDEPENDENT ALL THEIR LIVES .
LIKE THIS WAS A REALLY NEAT VITAL WOMAN AND YOU GET IN A NURSING HOME AND THE FIRST THING .
THAT HAPPENS YOU HAVE TO SHARE YOUR YOUR WHOLE LIVING SPACE .
RIGHT .
WITH SOMEONE THAT YOU HAVE NEVER KNOWN BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE .
RIGHT .
AND OH I I DO NOT KNOW WHAT .
THE ANSWER IS BUT I DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME WONDERFUL PLACES OUT THERE AND IT I THINK IT DOES A LOT OF IT GOES DOWN TO JUST MONEY .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND FAMILY SUPPORT UH IF YOU YOU KNOW HAVE FAMILY THAT UH YOU CAN LIVE WITH .
VISITS EVERYDAY .
RIGHT .
RIGHT .
RIGHT .
I I REALLY I THINK THE WAY OF SELECTING A NURSING HOME WOULD BE SIMILAR TO THE WAY .
YOU WOULD SELECT CHILD CARE YOU KNOW .
YOU WOULD DO YOUR RESEARCH AND YOU WOULD GO VISIT .
VISIT RIGHT .
AND UH HOPEFULLY THEY WOULD HAVE THEY WOULD HAVE IT SO THAT YOU COULD GO THERE ANYTIME .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE IF YOU COULD NOT GO THERE ANYTIME THEN THAT WOULD MAKE YOU .
SUSPICIOUS .
A LITTLE BIT SU RIGHT .
YOU KNOW I I MY I REMEMBER MY MY GRANDMOTHER MANY YEARS AGO WHEN SHE WAS IN A NURSING HOME BEFORE SHE DIED AND I GUESS THERE WAS NOT A NAME FOR WHAT .
SHE HAD AT THAT TIME BUT I GUESS ALZHEIMER S WOULD COME AS CLOSE AS ANYTHING SHE REALLY WAS NOT AWARE OF WHAT .
SHE WAS DOING .
UHHUH .
AND UH I CA I CAN REMEMBER SHE HAD SEVERAL STROKES AND THE NURSING HOME WAS RIGHT NEXT TO A HOSPITAL AND THEY WOULD RUSH HER TO THE HOSPITAL AND REVIVE HER AND JUST BRING HER BACK TO THE NURSING HOME IN A COUPLE OF DAYS .
AND IT WAS SHE WAS IT WAS JUST LIKE KEEPING SOMETHING .
DO YOU USE CREDIT CARDS A GOOD BIT .
I DO AND I WISH I DID NT .
UH .
BEFORE I GOT MARRIED UH ABOUT THE ONLY CREDIT CARDS I USED WERE GAS CARDS BECAUSE I DID NT LIKE CARRYING YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
THE CASH WITH ME ALL THE TIME BUT I JUST NEVER WANTED TO GET INTO THE HANGUP OF USING CREDIT CARDS AND .
UHHUH .
HAVING ALL THOSE BILLS HANGING OVER MY HEAD .
UHHUH .
IN FACT I REMEMBER GETTING MY FIRST MASTERCARD AND THE ONLY REASON I GOT IT WAS YOU KNOW THERE WAS A WHILE .
OKAY .
YEARS AGO WHEN YOU COULD NT CASH A CHECK .
ABSOLUTELY .
WITHOUT LIKE A MASTERCARD OR VISA .
RIGHT .
AND SO THAT S WHY I WENT AHEAD AND GOT ONE .
UHHUH .
IT WAS A MISTAKE .
YEAH WELL ACTUALLY I I HAVE A WHOLE WALLET FULL OF CREDIT CARDS .
YEAH .
I DO NT USE THEM VERY OFTEN UM OH I MAY USE I TRY TO USE AT LEAST ONE GASOLINE CREDIT CARD A WEEK AND TRY TO USE A DIFFERENT ONE SO THAT YOU KNOW I HAVE KEEP THOSE ACTIVE .
YEAH .
I HAVE A HALF A DOZEN DEPARTMENT STORE CREDIT CARDS AND I I LL USE THOSE IF I NEED TO RUN IN AND BUY A DOZEN PAIR HOSE RIGHT QUICK .
YEAH .
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT JUST ENOUGH TO KEEP THEM ACTIVE MY BIGGIES ARE THE VISA MASTERCARD AND DISCOVER .
YEAH .
AND FOR THE MOST PART I HAD USED THOSE FOR LIKE UH CHARGING AIRLINE TICKETS WHERE I CAN PAY FOR THOSE YOU KNOW YOU COULD .
YEAH .
MAKE THE TRANSACTION OVER THE TELEPHONE OR I FLY SOUTHWEST A GOOD LITTLE BIT WHICH MEANS I CAN JUST RUN THAT CARD THROUGH THE MACHINE .
THAT S RIGHT .
UH AND IT SAVES A LOT TIME AND THAT S WHAT I WAS USING IT FOR HOWEVER WE HAD A HAD A A VERY PRESSING FINANCIAL FAMILY CRISIS WHICH SAID YOU HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE YOU MUST HAVE THE MONEY TO DO THIS WITH AND YOU DO NOT HAVE ANY OTHER OPTIONS .
UHHUH .
SO I CHARGED ALL THREE OF THOSE CARDS UP AND RIGHT NOW I AM PAYING AND PRAYING .
I KNOW HOW THAT GOES .
BUT UH .
AND THAT S EXACTLY WHAT WE VE I MEAN .
UHHUH .
I HAVE TO SAY I HAVE BEEN THANKFUL FOR THEM BECAUSE THERE WERE TIMES WHEN .
UHHUH .
IT WAS JUST LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
WHEN WE HAD TO HAVE THE MONEY .
UHHUH .
WE HAD NO WAY AROUND IT .
UHHUH .
AND THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT IS GO GET YOU KNOW AN ADVANCE .
UHHUH .
ON A CARD .
UHHUH .
AND SO LIKE YOU WERE PAYING FOR IT BUT .
WELL I NEVER DID .
IT S ONE OF THOSE I M GLAD IT WAS THERE .
RIGHT I NEVER DID USE IT FOR AN ADVANCE MOST OF MY CHARGES WERE UH MEDICATIONS .
OH I SEE .
DID NT HAVE CASH FOR THE MEDICATIONS OR IT WAS UH THE DOCTOR WOULD ACCEPT MASTERCARD OR VISA .
OH .
AND UH .
A LOT OF TIMES YOU CAN GET BY USING THOSE FOR UH UH DIFFERENT LABS WILL .
WHAT .
USE THOSE CHARGE ACCOUNTS FOR .
DO YOU FIND NOW THOUGH THAT EVEN SOME DOCTORS WO NT I VE FOUND SOME DOCTORS THAT SAY YOU KNOW I WAS SO USED TO DOCTORS OR MEDICAL CARE PLACES TAKING CREDIT CARDS AND SO MANY OF THEM DO NT ANYMORE .
UHHUH .
SO .
WELL I HAVE NOT LIKE I SAID THAT WAS JUST ONE PERIOD IN MY LIFE WHERE THAT WAS CRITICAL .
YEAH .
I DO NT GENERALLY CHARGE I SAY WELL I NEED A CHECKUP IN SIX MONTHS AND I KIND OF SET THAT ASIDE .
RIGHT .
AND JUST PAY FOR IT I M REIMBURSED ON INSURANCE ANYWAY AND I CAN HANDLE YOU KNOW PAYING FOR IT AND WAITING TWO OR THREE WEEKS .
RIGHT .
GETTING INTO A CREDIT CARD FIASCO IS EASY .
OH IT IS .
IT IS EASY AND IT S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET OUT I JUST CRINGE EVERY MONTH WHEN I SEE THOSE INTEREST CHARGES .
I KNOW .
I SAY WOW I I OUGHT TO GO TO THE CREDIT UNION AND BORROW THE MONEY AND PAY THIS OFF BIG DEAL I M SAVING TWO PERCENT .
RIGHT BUT YOU KNOW THE INTEREST EVEN THOUGH IT BOTHERED ME IT DID NT USED TO BOTHER ME SO MUCH BECAUSE OF COURSE YOU COULD LIST IT ON A SCHEDULE A AND YOU GOT ALL YOUR INTEREST YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
TOWARDS YOUR TAX .
UHHUH .
DEDUCTIONS AND NOW THEY VE MESSED THAT UP TO WHERE IT REALLY IS A FINANCIAL BURDEN TO HAVE TO PAY IT .
RIGHT .
AND BUT IT BUT IT IS EASY TO GET INTO A CREDIT CARD PROBLEM AND I I THINK ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE THAT THINK YOU KNOW THERE S KIND OF THAT FEELING OF HEY IT S SO NEAT I HAVE MY FIRST CREDIT CARD .
UHHUH .
AND AND THEY JUST DO NT UNDERSTAND THAT YOU STILL HAVE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE PAYMENTS .
OH YEAH AND .
YOU KNOW .
IT S NOT JUST PAYING BACK WHAT YOU VE CHARGED IT S .
THAT S RIGHT .
PAYING THAT AND HALF AGAIN .
THAT S RIGHT .
UH YOU SEND IN UH UH FIFTY DOLLARS YOU RE GOING TO PAY TWENTY TWENTYFIVE IN INTEREST CHARGES .
THAT S RIGHT .
YOU ONLY GET HALF OF THAT PAID FOR THE PRINCIPAL SO I M LOOKING AT THREE OR FOUR YEARS BEFORE MY BALANCES ARE CLEARED ON THOSE CHARGE ACCOUNTS .
RIGHT .
NOW AS THE MONTHLY PAYMENT UH I MEAN AS THE MONTHLY PAYMENT AMOUNT GOES DOWN THAT WILL FREE UP MORE CASH WHERE I CAN CONTINUE TO MAKE THE LARGER PAYMENTS .
RIGHT .
UH AS LONG AS I DO NT HAVE A MAJOR DISASTER WHERE I HAVE TO USE IT AGAIN I CAN I CAN DO THAT .
RIGHT .
MEANTIME THOUGH I M NOT BUILDING ANY RESERVES .
NO AND THAT S FRIGHTENING TO ME .
ANYTHING THAT I COULD BE PUT ASIDE INTO SAVINGS IS GOING FOR INTEREST ON THOSE CARDS .
THAT S RIGHT THAT S FRIGHTENING TOO .
UHHUH .
UH I I JUST I MY HUSBAND IS IN BUSINESS FOR HIMSELF .
UHHUH .
I WORK FOR T I BUT HE DOES NT .
UHHUH .
AND UH WE RE UH I I VE KIND OF GOT MY FINGERS CR CROSSED I VE LEARNED WHEN YOU RE IN BUSINESS FOR YOURSELF THAT THAT YOU DO NT COUNT ON SOMETHING UNTIL IT S HAPPENED .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW BUT HE S GOT SOME YOU KNOW IT S THOSE ONCE IN A LIFETIME CASES AND AFTER TEN YEARS HE S GOT TWO OF THEM .
UHHUH .
AND THEY SHOULD PAY THROUGH NEXT MONTH AND AND WE RE BOTH JUST LOOKING AT EACH OTHER EVERY NIGHT GOING MAN THAT WILL PAY OFF LIKE BOTH OF OUR MASTERCARDS YOU KNOW .
OH RIGHT RIGHT .
AND YOU KNOW JUST IN ONE LUMP BECAUSE THAT S THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN DO IT IS TO HAVE A BIG CHUNK OF MONEY .
UHHUH UHHUH .
OR IT S LIKE YOU SAY YOU PAY FOREVER .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND SO I M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT .
WELL YOU EITHER NEED A BIG CHUNK OF MONEY OR YOU NEED A LARGE RESERVE .
THAT S RIGHT .
SO THAT IF YOU DO CHARGE ON THAT ACCOUNT YOU CAN MAKE A SINGLE LUMP SUM PAYMENT NOW THOSE ARE VERY HANDY .
RIGHT .
IF YOU HAVE THE RESERVES AND YOU CAN MAKE LUMP SUM PAYMENTS SHARP GOOD .
SURE YEAH .
NO PROBLEM .
I AGREE .
BECAUSE YOU RE LIVING ON THE OTHER GUY S MONEY FOR A WHILE .
THAT S RIGHT .
BUT I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT THOSE CREDIT CARD COMPANIES ARE GOING TO RIDE HIGH ON MY MONEY .
I KNOW AND .
AND IT JUST IRKS ME I SAY MY GOSH I HAD TO WORK THREE HOURS JUST TO PAY THE INTEREST ON THIS AND I VE GOT THREE CARDS I VE LOST A WHOLE DAY OF MY LIFE .
I KNOW YOU RE LIKE .
TO INTEREST .
WHAT AM I WORKING FOR TODAY .
YEAH YEAH AND THAT JUST BLOWS MY MIND I MY HOUSE IS PAID FOR MY CAR IS PAID FOR I VE GOT SOME HOME IMPROVEMENTS BUT EVEN THE PAYMENT ON THAT DOES NT EQUAL THE PAYMENT ON ONE OF THOSE CREDIT CARDS .
IT S INCREDIBLE .
UHHUH .
BOY I WISH I COULD SAY THAT MY HOUSE AND WELL MY CAR IS PAID FOR NOW IT WAS WRECKED THREE WEEKS AGO BUT BUT YOU SEE AGAIN .
UHHUH .
THE CREDIT CARDS CAME IN HANDY I HAD TO HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY RENTAL CAR PAY THIS PAY THAT TILL THE INSURANCE COMPANY PAYS BACK .
THAT S RIGHT I THINK .
AND UH .
THAT IS A GOOD HEALTHY SAFE USE .
YEAH .
OF CREDIT CARDS .
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT S COMING BACK TO PAY IT OFF .
UHHUH UHHUH UH I WENT TO A SEMINAR THEY SAID DO NT EVER USE YOUR CREDIT CARD FOR CONSUMABLE ITEMS YOU ONLY USE CREDIT CARDS FOR INVESTMENTS .
RIGHT .
I SAID FOR CRYING OUT LOUD IF I HAD THE MONEY TO IN YOU KNOW .
IT S .
IF I COULD DO SOME INVESTING YOU D HAVE TO INVEST AT BETTER THAN TWENTY PERCENT EARNINGS IN ORDER .
SURE .
TO PAY FOR THE PAYMENTS ON THE CREDIT CARD .
THAT S RIGHT .
THAT DOES NT MAKE A BIT OF SENSE TO ME I THOUGHT .
THAT S RIGHT .
GOD DANG WHERE IS HIS PENCIL .
WELL THE SMART HALF WAS DO NT PAY IT FOR CONSUMABLES DO NT YOU KNOW IF YOU CA NT AFFORD TO GO TO A RESTAURANT AND EAT OUT AND PAY CASH DO NT PUT IT ON A CREDIT CARD .
THAT S RIGHT .
YOU KNOW AND AND SO THAT THAT IS THE SMART HALF .
UHHUH .
BUT UH AND I CAN REMEMBER BEFORE WE HAD KIDS WE DID THAT A LOT BUT IT WAS NO BIGGIE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE COULD PAY IT OFF WHILE AFTER KIDS AND YOU RE PAYING CHILD CARE AND OTHER THINGS ALL OF A SUDDEN IT S NOT SO EASY TO PAY OFF SO WE CUT THAT OUT REAL QUICK .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND UH BUT I I DO LIKE HAVING THEM THERE THERE IS A BIT OF SECURITY IN HAVING THE CREDIT CARDS AND KNOWING THAT IN TIMES OF CRISIS THEY ARE THERE TO USE .
UHHUH .
BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A VERY GOOD SENSE OF SAVING AND OR .
UHHUH .
COMMON SENSE NOT NOT TO .
UHHUH .
GET YOURSELF IN TROUBLE .
YOU ALSO HAVE TO HAVE THAT WILLINGNESS TO COMMIT TO THAT .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE YOU RE COMMITTING A GOOD PORTION OF YOUR LIFE AND INCOME WHEN YOU DO IT .
DO YOU HAVE ANY HOBBIES .
YES I DO .
WHAT ARE YOURS .
CHINA PAINTING AND CERAMICS .
OOH HOW GREAT .
I ENJOY IT .

YEAH .
RIGHT NOW .
I FOUND MY KIDS WERE VERY FRUSTRATING WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE .

SO I AM .
UHHUH .
ASSISTING THEM WITH THEIR CHILDREN .
OH GREAT .
IN THEIR SELECTIONS SO .
GREAT WELL MY CHILDREN ARE GROWN BUT THEY RE TEENAGERS .
UHHUH .
SO I HAVE THREE CHILDREN UM FIFTEEN AGES FIFTEEN SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY .
UHHUH .
AND UM ABOUT I GUESS ABOUT WHEN THE FIRST WHEN THE YOUNGEST ONE WAS IN KINDERGARTEN .
I STARTED WORKING AT A PRESCHOOL .
UHHUH .
AND UH YOU KNOW DOING SOME WORK AND THEN I I TOOK A COUPLE OF YEARS OFF AND THEN WENT BACK AS A MUSIC TEACHER IN A PRESCHOOL SO .
UHHUH .
SO I AM AROUND NOT A DAY CARE SITUATION BUT IN THE YOU KNOW IN THE CHILD CARE ENVIRONMENT .
UHHUH .
SO UM .
WELL I MYSELF REALLY FEEL LIKE THE STRUCTURED DAY CARE PROGRAM IS MORE SUCCESSFUL IN TODAY S ENVIRONMENT .
UHHUH .
THAN THE ONE ON ONE CARE IS .
UH WHEN MY CHILDREN WERE GROWING UP I ACTUALLY HAD THEM UP AND UNTIL THEY WERE IN THE PRESCHOOL SITUATION I HAD THEM IN A IN A HOME WITH A LADY .
WHO KEPT TWO OR THREE KIDS AND I FELT LIKE THAT HOME ENVIRONMENT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM .
YEAH .
IT WAS IMPORTANT TO ME .
YES .
AND UH .
UHHUH .
I FEEL LIKE THAT THEY THEY HAD THAT ONE ON ONE .
THAT S SO NECESSARY AT THAT AGE .
OH IT IS .
HOWEVER .
YEAH .
IN TODAY S ENVIRONMENT .
UHHUH .
IT MAY BE MORE CRITICAL TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO INTERACT IN LARGE GROUPS SIMPLY BECAUSE THAT S THE WAY OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE ARE DEALT WITH .
YEAH IN OTHER WORDS .
THEY RE DEALT WITH .
THERE RE MORE PEOPLE .
IN PACKAGES .
YES YES .
THAT S THAT S AN INTERESTING POINT OF VIEW .
I UH YOU KNOW SEEING THE CHILDREN IN THE SCHOOL .
THE WAY .
I DO I I MEAN I SEE THE ONES .
THAT WE CAN ALWAYS TELL THE ONES .
THAT HAVE NOT BEEN AROUND CHILDREN AT ALL .
UHHUH .
WHEN THEY COME IN AS THREE YEAR OLDS .
UHHUH .
AS OPPOSED TO THE ONES .
THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE PROGRAM THAT STARTED AT TWELVE MONTHS MAYBE AND WERE .
SURE .
WERE EVEN IN THERE ONE DAY .
A WEEK .
UHHUH .
WHICH IS ALL OUR SCHOOL PROVIDES FOR THE YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
FOR THE UNDER THREE YEAR OLDS .
UHHUH .
BUT STILL THEY HAVE AN OP AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE WITH OTHER CHILDREN .
ABSOLUTELY .
AND IT IS TRUE AND UH I BUT I THINK THAT WOULD BUT AS FAR AS LOOKING FOR A PLACE YOU KNOW I THE CRITERIA I MEAN I THINK IT S VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE VERY CARING PEOPLE YOU KNOW .
OH ABSOLUTELY .
TO TAKE CARE OF .
WITHOUT A DOUBT .
THE IN A SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
IF YOU RE GOING TO HAVE THE STRUCTURE AND YOU RE GOING TO HAVE THE LARGE NUMBERS YOU RE GOING TO NEED REALLY .
I RECENTLY STOPPED BY MCDONALDS AND I WAS SITTING OUT IN THEIR LITTLE PLAYGROUND WHILE MY GRANDDAUGHTER WAS PLAYING ON THE THINGS AND WAS VISITING WITH ANOTHER MOTHER .
WHO WAS THERE WITH HER CHILDREN AND SHE WAS TELLING ME THAT SHE WAS GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO MANAGE A DAY CARE CENTER AND OF COURSE SHE WAS SHE HAD JUST GOTTEN HER DEGREE AND SHE WAS SO ENTHUSIASTIC AND SHE WAS EXCITED ABOUT IT AND SHE WAS GOING TO ACCOMPLISH ALL OF THESE THINGS .
YES YES .
HOWEVER UH WHEN IT CAME TO HIRING AND STAFFING PEOPLE .
WHO CARED AND WHO WERE WILLING TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE CHILDREN AND SPEND THAT KIND OF TIME THE PAY IS MINIMAL .
YES IT IS .
AND IT TAKES PEOPLE WITH TOTAL AND COMPLETE DEDICATION .
WHO REALLY DO NT WANT TO MAKE A LIVING FOR THEMSELVES .
YES THAT S RIGHT THAT MAYBE .
IN ORDER TO BE IN THAT ENVIRONMENT .
YEAH THAT MAYBE HAVE ANOTHER SALARY IN THEIR FAMILY .
ABSOLUTELY .
THAT WHERE THEY CAN DO THAT AND THAT S WHAT .
I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF YOU KNOW DOING .
UHHUH .
AND AND I COULD CONCENTRATE ON THE CREATIVITY AND AND YOU KNOW REALLY HAVING A LOT OF FUN WITH THE CHILDREN AND .
UHHUH .
AND PROVIDING .
WELL THEY ASK .
THEM WITH A GREAT ATMOSPHERE .
SO MUCH OF THOSE CARETAKERS FOR THE AMOUNT THAT THAT THEY PAY .
YEAH .
THEY ARE TO BE THERE AHEAD OF TIME YOU KNOW THEY RE THERE EARLY TO RECEIVE THE KIDS .
AND THEY HAVE TO BE THERE AT SOMETIMES SIX OCLOCK IN THE MORNING .
THAT S RIGHT .
WHICH IS YEAH .
AND THEN THEN THEY HAVE TO WORK UNTIL THE SHOP UNTIL THE PLACE CLOSES AT SIX P M AND THEN IT .
S THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO CLEAN UP AND BE PREPARED FOR THE NEXT DAY .
YEAH .
BECAUSE THEY DO NT HAVE CLEANING CREWS IN MOST OF THOSE .
YES THAT S TRUE THAT S TRUE .
AND UH SHE JUST HAD A TERRIBLE TIME KEEPING SINCERELY DEDICATED PEOPLE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT LIVE WITH A KIND OF HOURS AND THE SALARY .
YEAH YEAH .
UH AND SHE .
BECAUSE PEOPLE CA NT PAY .
UHHUH .
TO PROVIDE .
UHHUH .
AND WELL OURS IS NOT YOU KNOW OURS IS JUST IS A CHURCH AND SO WE WE DO NT HAVE THE THE EXPENSES OF A BUILDING YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
WE SHARE THE EXPENSE WITH THE CHURCH BUT WE DO NT HAVE ENOUGH .
SURE .
YOU KNOW TAKING CARE OF A WHOLE BUILDING .
UHHUH .
AND THAT RESPONSIBILITY .
SO UH IT IS IT IS A LOT DIFFERENT .
WELL I KNOW THAT WHEN MY YOUNGSTERS WERE SMALL NOW MY OLDER SON WAS ADOPTED SO HE WENT INTO CHILD CARE AT TWO WEEKS .
OH MY GOODNESS .
AND UH MY YOUNGER SON WENT INTO CHILD CARE AT SIX WEEKS .
YEAH YEAH .
SO THEY WERE IN THAT ENVIRONMENT ACTUALLY UP UNTIL THEY BECAME UH SEVEN AND NINE .
UHHUH .
AND AT THAT POINT .
I SAID LOOK THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE CUSTODIAL CARE THAT THEY NEED AND THE AFTER HOURS CARE HAS BEEN AS GOOD A QUALITY AS I CAN PROVIDE FOR THEM .
HOWEVER THEY RE GOING OUT INTO THE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT NOW THEY RE UNDER A LOT OF OTHER INFLUENCES .
I NEED TO BE HERE FOR THEM .
I NEED TO BE INVOLVED IN THEIR SCHOOL BECAUSE I WANT TO BE THE ONE .
YES .
WHO INFLUENCES THE WAY .
THEY DEVELOP .
SO I QUIT WORKING .
OH YOU DID .
AFTER MY KIDS STARTED TO SCHOOL .
UM .
AND GOT INVOLVED IN VOLUNTEER WORK IN THEIR PRIVATE SCHOOL SO THAT I COULD HELP DIRECT THEIR THEIR LEARNING EXPERIENCES AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT .
YEAH YEAH .
I I FELT LIKE THAT ANYBODY .
WHO CARED AND LOVED THE KIDS COULD CHANGE THEIR DIAPERS AND FEED THEM AND BATHE THEM .
UHHUH .
AND HOLD THEM .
YES YES .
BUT WHEN TIME CAME TO DIRECT THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE CHOICES .
UHHUH UHHUH .
TO DEVELOP THE KINDS OF THINGS .
THAT THAT THEY RE GOING TO NEED TO INTERACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE I FELT LIKE I NEEDED SOME STRONG INFLUENCE THERE .
YEAH .
SO I DI .
WELL THAT S DIFFERENT THAN MOST PEOPLE DO IT .
I MEAN .
I KNOW .
A LOT OF PEOPLE DO IT REALLY THE REVERSE .
THAT S RIGHT ONCE THEY GET UP IN SCH .
AND GO TO WORK AFTER THE CHILDREN .
UHHUH .
ARE IN SCHOOL YOU KNOW .
UHHUH UHHUH .
BUT UH .
WELL I JUST FELT VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THAT AND I I DID NOT WORK AS A MATTER OF FACT MY SON WAS IN THE SECOND GRADE AND WHEN HE STARTED UH AT SKYLINE HIGH SCHOOL I ASKED HIM SON WHEN UH YOU KNOW WHERE DO I GO TO SIGN UP FOR THE P T .
A .
AND HE SAID MOM DO NT DO THAT TO ME .
PLEASE DO NT DO THAT TO ME .
SO I KNEW IT WAS TIME TO GO BACK TO WORK .
BUT I FEEL VERY .
YEAH .
GOOD ABOUT SPENDING THOSE YEARS WITH MY BOYS .
YES THAT S TRUE .
UH AND I WAS JUST REALLY GRATEFUL I ONLY HAD ONE BAD CHILD CARE EXPERIENCE .
IT WAS IN A HOME .
UH THE CARE TAKER THAT THEY HAD HAD SINCE THEY WERE INFANTS JUST COULD NOT DO IT .
SHE WAS FROM UM UH UH ARGENTINA .
UHHUH .
AND SHE WAS GOING BACK HOME AND I COULD NT JUST YOU KNOW WAIT FOR EIGHT THREE OR FOUR MONTHS AND THEN BRING THEM BACK TO HER .
YEAH .
SO I HAD TO FIND A NEW PLACE .
YEAH .
AND I PUT THEM IN THIS HOME THE KIDS CRIED WHEN I TOOK THEM THE KIDS CRIED WH I COULD HEAR THE KIDS CRYING WHEN I WENT TO PICK THEM UP .
OH DEAR .
THEY WERE ALWAYS CRANKY AND IRRITABLE .
OH DEAR .
SO I JUST TOOK OFF AND WENT THERE ONE DAY AND UH THE CHILDREN WERE LEFT UNATTENDED IN A ROOM YOU KNOW THEY THEY WERE NOT WELL CARED FOR .
OH HOW AWFUL .
AND UH .
YEAH .
SO IT DID NT TAKE ME LONG TO TAKE THEM OUT OF THAT PLACE .
YEAH .
BUT THAT S THE ONLY BAD EXPERIENCE .
I HAD THE REST OF THE TIME .
THEY STAYED IN LA PETITE ACADEMY .
UHHUH .
AND I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THEIR DEVELOPMENT AND THEIR PROGRESS .
UHHUH .
THEY LEARNED A LOT OF THINGS IN THOSE PUBLIC ENVIRONMENTS THAT YOU JUST AS SOON THEY DID NT LEARN BUT THEY RE GOING TO LEARN IT SOMETIME SO .
YEAH YEAH .
BUT FOR THE MOST PART THEY DID HAVE GOOD CARE AND IT DID APPEAR TO ME THAT THE PEOPLE .
WHO CARED FOR THEM HAD A GOOD CONCERN FOR THEM AND IN ONE PARTICULAR CASE .
THEY HAD A SUMMER PROGRAM WHERE THEY WERE TO BE TAKEN TO THE Y AND TAUGHT TO SWIM .
UHHUH .
WHICH JUST PLEASED ME TO DEATH .
OH YES .
BECAUSE I VE ALWAYS BEEN HA YOU KNOW BEEN AFRAID OF THE WATER .
OH .
HOWEVER MY OLDER SON CAME HOME AND HE SAID MOM I DO NT LIKE THAT MAN SAID HE TOOK ME BY THE HEAD AND DUNKED MY HEAD UNDER THE WATER .
OH GOSH .
AND TOLD ME .
I HAD TO GET MY FACE WET OR I D NEVER SWIM .
OH DEAR .

UH AND HE GOES OUT AND AND COMMITS ANOTHER CRIME OR KILLS SOMEBODY I YOU KNOW I I FEEL THE SAME WAY I DO NT THINK I THINK THAT PERSON IS IS BEYOND UH REHABILITATION AND AND HE SHOULD BE TAKEN OUT .
WELL I I ALSO FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT NO ONE IS BEYOND RECLAMATION .
UHHUH .
BUT I DO KNOW THAT SOME PEOPLE ALMOST ALL PEOPLE USUALLY DIE BEFORE THAT POINT .
UHHUH .
THEY JUST GET TOO OLD .
UHHUH .
UH AS FAR AS CAPITAL PUNISHMENT ON ON IT .
S OWN MERITS I HAVE THE TROUBLE WITH THE WAY .
IT S APPLIED .
I THINK IT SHOULD BE APPLIED D ON A LITTLE BIT .
MORE FAIR MANNER .
UH AND I VE I VE SAID THIS VERY OFTEN AND I BELIEVE IT TO BE THE A VERY TRUE AXIOM SO I WOULD BE RATHER BE WHITE RICH AND GUILTY THAN BLACK AND INNOCENT .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE IF YOU RE IF YOU RE BLACK AND YOU KILL A WHITE GUY YOU RE GOING TO FRY .
RIGHT .
KILL YOU .
YEAH .
THEY WILL KILL YOU .
AND IF YOU RE BLACK AND YOU KILL A BLACK GUY YOU KNOW IT S YOU KNOW TWO HUNDRED HOURS OF COMMUNITY SERVICE .
YEAH YOU DO NT HEAR YOU DO NT HEAR TOO MUCH ABOUT OF THOSE CASES .
WELL IT S A SOCIAL .
YEAH .
DISEASE THAT WE HAVE CALLED ONE UPSMANSHIP YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
WE RE THE MAJORITY SO WE CAN DO WHATEVER .
THE HELL .
WE WANT TO DO .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND YOU RE THE MINORITY AND YOU RE STUCK WITH IT .
HUH .
BUT UH YOU KNOW WE HAD THIS IN THE VIETNAM WAR YOU KNOW WE HAD YOU KNOW POPULATION OF BLACKS AMONG MILITARY PEOPLE IN VIETNAM WAS ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT .
RIGHT .
BUT THE POPULATION OF BLACKS IN THE MILITARY WAS ABOUT TWENTYTWO PERCENT .
HUH .
THE HANDWRITING S ON THE WALL THERE IS NT IT .
YEP IT SURE IS .
YOU KNOW BUT THAT S ANOTHER ISSUE ALTOGETHER .
YEAH IT S .
AS FAR AS CAPITAL PUNISHMENT I THINK THAT UH TEN YEARS ON DEATH ROW IS CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT .
I THINK THE GUY SHOULD HAVE NINETY DAYS AND IF HE CA NT PRODUCE EVIDENCE .
UHHUH .
NOT ARGUMENT BUT EVIDENCE .
SEE THE ONLY THING .
I DO NT YOU KNOW I DO NT UNDERSTAND I GUESS I I DO NT UNDERSTAND OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM UH AS IT IS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I YOU KNOW IF SOMEBODY HAS BEEN CONVICTED AND HAS BEEN SENTENCED TO BE PUT TO DEATH HOW IS IT THAT THEY CAN APPEAL AND APPEAL AND APPEAL AND GET STAYS OF EX EXECUTION .
I MEAN HOW YOU KNOW IS .
WELL .
THERE .
TH THAT GOES BACK TO WHEN UH AMERICA WAS A A COLONY OF ENGLAND .
UHHUH .
IN ENGLAND YOU WENT TO COURT YOU WERE ASSUMED GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT AND ONCE THEY FOUND YOU GUILTY YOU KNOW JUDGE SAID HE S GUILTY KILL HIM .
WELL TH THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE .
THAT UH THAT HAD A PROBLEM WITH THAT .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE THEY FOUND OUT LATER ON THAT JEEZ YOU KNOW A GUY WILL LIE RATHER THAN GET KILLED .
RIGHT .
AND HE LL SAY YOU KNOW HEY THAT GUY DID IT YOU KNOW NOT ME .
YEAH .
AND UH OR HE LL HAVE SOMEBODY LIE FOR HIM .
YOU KNOW PEOPLE LIE IT S A .
YEAH .
STRANGE THING BUT THEY DO THAT AND TO PREVENT THAT KIND OF MISUSE OF POWER THEY WROTE INTO THE CONSTITUTION .
A PROTECTION .
UHHUH .
AGAINST JUDICIAL MISHAP .
HUH .
AND THE JUDICIAL MISHAP IN THIS EVENT WOULD BE HEY YOU GOT THE WRONG GUY .
LOOK AT THAT GUY UH AT E SYSTEMS .
YEP .
THEY WERE G THEY CONVICTED HIM OF A ROBBERY THAT HE COULD NOT PHYSICALLY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COMMIT .
YEAH .
HE WAS TOO FAR AWAY WHEN IT HAPPENED .
HE HAD WITNESSES .
THAT WERE YOU KNOW THEY WERE NT DOPE DEALERS THEY WERE NT DRUG FIENDS THEY WERE EMPLOYEES OF A AN ESTABLISHMENT .
THAT HAD A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF SECURITY SENSE TOO .
AND THESE WERE REALLY RESPONSIBLE PEOPLE .
HUH .
YOU KNOW AND THEY CONVICTED THIS GUY BECAUSE SOMEBODY SAYS WELL HE LOOKS LIKE THE RIGHT GUY .
THEY .
ALL LOOK THE SAME TO ME YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
BIG LIPS FLAT NOSE YEP THAT WAS HIM .
YEP .
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT UH UH CONVICTED UH .
HELLO .

MY NAME IS LOWELL AND I LIVE IN RALEIGH NORTH CAROLINA .
OH OKAY .
UM DO YOU WANT TO START OR SHOULD I START .

IT .
S .
IT CERTAINLY IS .
SOMETIMES I THINK UM IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A TOWN HOME WITH NOT HAVING ALL THAT RESPONSIBILITY .
WELL IF YOU EVER GET ONE BE SURE THE WALLS ARE GOOD AND THICK BECAUSE IF THEY RE NOT YOU CAN HEAR .
I THAT S THE MAIN THING WHEN I WAS SHOPPING FOR ONE I WANTED TO MAKE SURE I COULD I COULD NT HEAR MY NEIGHBORS AND THAT WAS .
RIGHT .
SO I BOUGHT ONE .
THAT S MORE LIKE LIVING IN A ONCE YOU RE INSIDE YOU DO NT KNOW YOU RE IN A TOWN HOME .
OH THAT SOUNDS LOVELY .
IT IS .
THEY RE KIND OF BUILT ON A CATTYCORNERED INSTEAD OF LIKE SIDE BY SIDE .
UHHUH .

UHHUH .
SOMETIMES .
THAT S RIGHT .

AND THEN THEY GO TO THE DOLLAR MOVIES .

THAT SEEMS TO HAPPEN .
I NOTICED THAT DANCES WITH WOLVES WAS PLAYING AT THE UH GRANADA THEATER .
UHHUH .
AND UH SOMEONE SAID THAT WAS A LOT OF FUN TO GO DO .
YOU CAN HAVE DINNER AND EVERYTHING WHILE YOU WATCH THE MOVIE .
I THOUGHT THAT MIGHT BE KIND OF FUN TO DO .

I I KNOW WE GET DISCOUNT TICKETS .
UHHUH .
WHERE MY HUSBAND WORKS BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IT S SO EXPENSIVE .
AND THEN THE POPCORN AND EVERYTHING ELSE YOU ALMOST CA NT AFFORD TO DO IT .
THAT S RIGHT .
NO MATTER .
WHAT .
ALTHOUGH WE DID ACTUALLY GET WE WENT ON VACATION COUPLE MONTHS AGO AND WE GOT TO GO SEE WHAT ABOUT BOB .
UHHUH .

UHHUH .
THAT WAS FUN .

S UH .
OH THAT S THE THAT S THE ONE WHERE THEY BURN DOWN THE HOUSE OR SOMETHING .
UHHUH UHHUH .
THE HOUSE EXPLODES .
UHHUH .
OH OKAY .
YEAH THAT S THE ONE .
OKAY YEAH .
ANOTHER MOVIE THAT I WANT TO SEE IF IT EVER COMES OUT ON VIDEO SO I CAN SEE IT WITHOUT MY DAUGHTER AROUND IS UH OH I JUST FORGOT THE TITLE OF IT .
UH .
OH IT S SUPPOSED TO BE A REAL SCARY ONE .
UH DARN WELL HERE HERE S ANOTHER .
ONE THAT I VE SEEN .
I SAW UH I CA NT REMEMBER THE TITLE OF IT EITHER .
MUST HAVE LEFT AN IMPRESSION .
OKAY YOU READY TO DISCUSS THE THE TOPIC .
WHAT S THE TOPIC .
OKAY THE TOPIC IS SOCIAL CHANGES AND DISCUSS SOCIAL CHANGES IN AMERICA AND HOW THEY RELATE OR HOW THEY DIFFER TODAY THAN THEY WERE TEN FIFTEEN OR THIRTY YEARS AGO .
OKAY .
YOU READY FOR THAT .
YOU BET .
OKAY .
I LL LET YOU LEAD OUT .
PARDON ME .
I LL LET YOU LEAD OUT .
OKAY WELL THERE S UH IT S KIND OF AN INTERESTING TOPIC AND ONE THAT I THINK IS QUITE FASCINATING BECAUSE UH COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I GUESS UH NOT VERY NOT VERY LONG AGO SEEMED LIKE THE WHOLE WORLD NOT JUST THE UNITED STATES BUT THE WHOLE WORLD WAS KIND OF IN A STANDSTILL WHERE EVERYONE WAS BASICALLY IN UH YOU KNOW A VERY COMFORTABLE POSITION SO TO SAY EVEN THOUGH THE THE COLD WAR WAS WAS IN FULL SWING YOU KNOW YOU HAD THE THE RUSSIANS AGAINST THE AMERICANS THE COMMUNISTS AGAINST THE FREE WORLD AND IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS THINGS HAVE CHANGED DRAMATICALLY NOT ONLY ON THE POLITICAL FRONT BUT ALSO ON THE ECONOMIC FRONT WHERE UH COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WE HAD UH AMERICA WAS ONE OF THE LEADING POWERS AND ONE OF THE STRONGEST NATIONS IN THE WORLD AS FAR AS ECONOMICS WERE CONCERNED AND NOW WE RE HAVING A VERY TOUGH TIME IN A RECESSIONARY PERIOD WE RE ALSO HAVE A VERY HUMONGOUS TRADE DEFICIT AND UH AND THAT S KIND OF FRIGHTENING ALSO YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO TEN FIF FIFTEEN TEN FIFTEEN YEARS AGO AN INDIVIDUAL GOING INTO A CAREER COULD EXPECT TO HAVE THAT CAREER BASICALLY THROUGHOUT THEIR WHOLE LIFE AND THIRTY YEARS AGO THAT WAS THAT WAS BASICALLY IT WHEREAS NOW WE RE EXPECTED TO HAVE A CAREER CHANGE EVERY YOU KNOW EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS AND POSSIBLY FI FOUR TO FIVE CAREER CHANGES THROUGHOUT OUR LIFETIME AND SO I THINK UH YOU KNOW THINGS THERE S BEEN AN AWFUL LOT OF SOCIAL CHANGE LATELY AND WE AND UH .
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT S INTERESTING TO ME IS IF YOU LOOK PARTICULARLY AT THE POLITICAL CHANGES .
UHHUH .
IS THAT THE THEY SEEM TO BE SOCIAL THEY SEEM TO BE ECONOMICALLY DRIVEN ALSO .
UHHUH .
SO IF YOU LOOK AT RUSSIA AND WHAT S HAPPENED OVER THERE I THINK THE CHANGE IN COMMUNISM WAS AS A RESULT OF THE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS THAT THEY WERE EXPERIENCING AND OF COURSE I LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS IN THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW ONE OF THE THINGS YOU WONDER IS WHAT THAT S GOING TO DO TO US .
TRUE .
I THINK THE OTHER KIND OF CHANGES LIKE JOB CHANGES AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS I MEAN I THINK IT S GREAT TO EVEN HAVE THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT CAREERS .
UHHUH .
IN YOUR LIFE I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN TERRIBLY BORING TO GO THROUGH .
YOUR LIFE DOING JUST ONE THING FOR FIFTY YEARS OR FORTY YEARS .
YES YES .
SOME OF THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR JOB CHANGE IN THE FACT THAT THAT ASPECTS CHANGING .
TRUE TRUE .
AND THE UNCERTAINTY OF WHETHER YOU RE GOING TO HAVE A JOB IS NOT AS GOOD BUT THE FACT THAT YOU REALLY CAN MAKE MAJOR CHANGES IN YOUR LIFE .
UHHUH .
AND JOBS .
WELL DO DO YOU THINK THAT S GOOD OR BAD .
I THINK IT S GREAT .
YOU THINK THAT S GREAT .
OH YEAH .
THAT S SOME YEAH BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE SEEM TO STAGNATE ONCE THEY GET INTO POSITION THEY THEY RE VERY COMFORTABLE THEY LOSE THE ABILITY TO LEARN AND THEY IN A SENSE BECOME UNTEACHABLE THEY THINK THEY KNOW ALL THERE IS TO KNOW IN THE AREA SET PATH AND YOU KNOW COME IN AND PUT MY TIME IN FROM NINE TO FIVE AND WHEN THAT S OVER WITH THAT S THAT S IT WITHOUT EVEN GIVING A SECOND THOUGHT TO MUMBLEX ADVANCING THEIR EDUCATION OR GETTING EXTRACURRICULAR UM EDUCATION AND AND I THINK THAT S AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO EXPAND OURSELVES ALSO .
I THINK ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH WITH EDUCATION AS IT RELATES TO THIS THOUGH IS THAT I DO NT KNOW THAT EDUCATION IS PREPARED TO HELP PEOPLE MAKE THOSE CHANGES .
IT JUST SEEMS A LOT OF THE TRAINING AND EDUCATION THAT GOES ON IS GEARING PEOPLE TOWARDS A PROFESSION .
UHHUH .
AND NOT GIVING THEM THE SKILLS AND WHATEVER THOSE SKILLS ARE NECESSARY TO MAKE THOSE JOB CHANGES WHICH I THINK IS GOING TO BE A HARD THING FOR FOR PEOPLE TO FACE .
RIGHT I AGREE WITH THAT I AGREE WITH THAT BUT I BELIEVE THAT UH AN INDIVIDUAL SHOULD REALLY LEARN HOW TO TO LEARN .
YEAH .
LEARN HOW TO ADAPT LEARN HOW TO GROW IN THE IN THEIR COLLEGE OR WHATEVER EDUCATION THEY MIGHT TAKE WELL THAT THAT S GOOD THAT S GOOD .
THERE PROBABLY NEEDS TO BE SOME TRAINING ON HOW TO TO TO ADJUST TO THESE CHANGES AS THEY COME ABOUT .
I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT THE THE HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT RATE RIGHT NOW AND YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THOSE SITUATIONS I DO NT KNOW THAT THEY HAVE GOOD COPING SKILLS OR A LOT OF THEM EVEN IDEAS OF HOW TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES NOW .
UHHUH .
SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WHILE THOSE CHANGES ARE TAKING PLACE MAYBE WE RE NOT WELL PREPARING PEOPLE TO MAKE THE CHANGES WITH THEM .
YEAH I I READ A FEW ARTICLES OFF IN THE NEWSPAPER AND SOME PUBLICATIONS WHERE STRESS UH FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE LAID OFF AND ALSO FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT LAID OFF BUT WERE THREATENED WITH A LAYOFF AND THREATENED WITH A REDUCTION IN THEIR COMPANY IS EXTREMELY HIGH RIGHT NOW .
UHHUH .
THAT STRESS IS A VERY PROMINENT FACTOR IN THE WORK PLACE AND IT AFFECTS .
HI .
HI I M CAROL AND I M CALLING FROM GARLAND TEXAS .
YEAH THIS IS MUMBLEX I M IN DALLAS .
OH OKAY BECAUSE YESTERDAY I TALKED TO SOMEONE UPSTATE I M NOT EVEN SURE WHERE AND MY HUSBAND TALKED TO THE PEOPLE IN UTAH SO UM ANYWAY LET ME PRESS ONE .
OKAY .
OKAY UM LET ME SEE I THINK WE VE ONLY PLANNED ONE FAMILY REUNION IN OUR LIFE SO .
I .
WE DO NT DO THIS TOO OFTEN UM MOST OF MY FAMILY S IN CALIFORNIA BUT MY HUSBAND S IS IN SAN ANTONIO AND SO WE DID THIS IN SAN ANTONIO AND UM IT WAS AN EXPERIENCE THAT I I WO NT DO AGAIN .
HOW BIG A FAMILY DO YOU HAVE .
UM WELL IT WAS NT THAT BIG OF A FAMILY BUT UM IT JUST GOT OUT OF HAND AND UM SO MANY PEOPLE WERE COMING THAT WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH FOOD WE WERE GOING TO NEED AND AND UM HOW MUCH UM BEVERAGES WE WERE GOING TO NEED AND THIS AND THAT AND OH IT JUST GREW AND GREW AND GREW AND UM WHEN THE TIME CAME ONLY ABOUT HALF THAT AMOUNT OF PEOPLE CAME SO IT WAS NT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO REALLY JUST GET AN ACCURATE AMOUNT AND BUT OVERALL WE ALL HAD A GOOD TIME WE SAW PEOPLE WE HAD NT SEE IN A WHILE SO .
DID YOU HAVE PEOPLE COMING FROM FAR AWAY .
NO IT WAS ALL IN THE SAN ANTONIO AREA .
WELL SOMETIMES .
BUT IT IT JUST KEPT GROWING AND GROWING AND GROWING AND GROWING AND WE RE GOING OH MY GOSH SO .
WELL YOU HAVE YOU HAVE THE FAMILY LIVES TOO CLOSE TOGETHER THEY SEE EACH OTHER TOO OFTEN .
UHHUH BASICALLY .
THEY DO NT TAKE THAT KIND OF THING SERIOUSLY .
YEAH .
AND IF UH .
YEAH .
UH THEY COME FROM FAR AWAY IT S UH IT IT THEY TAKE IT MORE SERIOUSLY AND .
UHHUH I THINK YOU RE RIGHT .
YEAH .
YEAH .
MY FAMILY S NOT VERY BIG BUT UH WE RE KIND OF .
YOUR FAMILY S FROM WHERE .
WELL I HAVE A A A BROTHER LIVES IN INDIANAPOLIS A SISTER LIVES IN CHICAGO AND MY FOLKS LIVE BACK IN BUFFALO NEW YORK .
OH NO .
UH I GUESS WE HAVE REUNIONS ABOUT ONCE A YEAR OR SO .
UHHUH .
WE GOT TOGETHER OVER CHRISTMAS MY WIFE S FAMILY THEY RE THEY RE ALL IN MOST OF THEM ARE IN UPSTATE NEW YORK THEY HAVE REGULAR UH REGULAR FAMILY REUNIONS EVERY SUMMER .
OH THOSE ARE NICE .
YEAH IT IS .
AND I M I M SURE THEY RE A LOT MORE ORGANIZED TOO BECAUSE THEY VE DONE IT BEFORE .
YEAH AND IT S IT S JUST SOMETHING THAT THEY THEY PLAN ON DOING EVERY SUMMER THEY JUST HAVE .
THAT S GREAT .
A WEEKEND PICNIC AND EVERY YEAR EVERYONE ASKS .
OH .
WHEN IS IT HAPPENING AND WHERE IS IT HAPPENING .
YEAH .
AND THEY JUST PLAN ON BEING HERE .
THAT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE TOO I KNOW EVERYBODY S REAL EAGER TO PARTICIPATE YEAH WELL THAT S GREAT .
YEAH THEY THEY HAD A FAMILY REUNION FOR UH WELL FOR MY MOTHERINLAW AT HER SEVENTYFIFTH BIRTHDAY AND THEY MANAGED TO GET JUST ABOUT EVERYBODY EVERYBODY INTO TOWN UH LAST NOVEMBER .
UHHUH .
INCLUDING A NUMBER OF PEOPLE FROM OUT IN CALIFORNIA .
OH .
SO IT WAS A IT WAS GOOD IT UH .
UHHUH .
IT WORKED OUT VERY WELL ONE IN INTERESTING THING THAT THEY DID AT THE TIME IS THEY UM THEY VIDEOTAPED THE THE WHOLE SHEBANG .
UHHUH .
WHICH IT MADE A NICE REMEMBRANCE OF OF THE ENTIRE PARTY .
YEAH MORE PEOPLE WANT TO COME BACK AGAIN .
YEAH THEY WANT TO COME BACK .
YEAH THAT S GOOD .
SO SO THAT THAT WORKS PRETTY WELL THAT WAY .
MY UH MY GRANDMOTHER IN CALIFORNIA IS UM THIS IS MY DAD S PART SIDE OF THE FAMILY IS PLANNING A REUNION UM THIS SPRING BUT WE WO NT BE GOING BECAUSE UM I DO NT KNOW HOW THEY THOUGHT OF THIS IT S GOING TO BE ON A CRUISE AND UM IT SEEMS LIKE MOST OF THE FAMILY IS UH GOING YOU KNOW ALL THE NIECES AND ALL THE GRANDCHILDREN AND ALL THAT ARE MOST OF THEM ARE GOING BUT IT S TOO COSTLY FOR US BUT ANYWAY THEY RE GOING TO GO ON A CRUISE AND UM IT SOUNDS REALLY NEAT IT REALLY DOES .
YEAH I I CAN GO FOR THAT .
WHAT WHAT DO I GUESS INTERESTING IF YOU HAD A A A VERY EXTENDED FAMILY THAT THAT KIND OF INVOLVED A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT .
UHHUH .
COUSINS AND THINGS THAT YOU DO NT REALLY KNOW THAT YOU VE NEVER MET IT D BE INTERESTING TO MEET A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE .
YEAH .
UH I DO NT KNOW HOW YOU WOULD GO ABOUT UH GETTING THEM TOGETHER BUT THAT THAT WOULD BE UH .
AND A FRIEND OF MINE UM SHE PLANS HER FAMILY REUNION UM EVERY YEAR AND THEY GO CAMPING AND SHE SAYS THEY HAVE THE GREATEST TIME AND SHE SAYS USUALLY EVERYBODY SHOWS UP IN EXCEPTION TO MAYBE ONE PERSON BUT SHE SAID THEY ALL GO CAMPING AND THEY HAVE A REALLY GOOD MUMBLEX FOR THE WHOLE WEEKEND SO THAT S .
YEAH I KIND OF WONDER WHAT WHAT KIND OF TRADITION WE RE GOING TO ESTABLISH FOR OUR FAMILY I HAD HOPED THAT OUR OUR KIDS GET TOGETHER AT LEAST REGULARLY .
YEAH YEAH RIGHT NOW WE ONLY HAVE TWO CHILDREN SO I .
HI YOU WANT TO START FIRST .
OF COURSE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE ELDERLY AND .
RIGHT .
UH WHETHER OR NOT WE WO WE LIKE NURSING HOMES AND .
UHHUH .
AS A MATTER OF FACT I CAN TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THAT .
YOU APPARENTLY HAVE SOMEBODY THERE IN ONE .
NO ACTUALLY MY GRANDMOTHER OWNED AND OPERATED A NURSING HOME FOR YEARS AND HER MOTHER .
OH YOU ARE KIDDING .
NO SHE DID .
OH .
AND THEN MY MOTHER ALSO OWNED AND OPERATED A NURSING HOME .
UHHUH .
FOR YEARS .
I WILL BE DARNED .
AND THEN UH WENT ON BACK TO SCHOOL AND BECAME THE DIRECTOR OF NURSES AT A NURSING HOME .
UHHUH .
AND UH MY MOTHER AND MY OLDER SISTER BOTH ARE GERIATRIC NURSES .
OH FOR HEAVEN S SAKE .
SO I DO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THAT .
YOU ARE VERY VERY MUCH AWARE OF WHAT GOES ON .
ABSOLUTELY .
THAT IS GREAT .
ACTUALLY THE MOTIVATION FOR GRANDMOTHER ENTERING THE BUSINESS .
UHHUH .
WAS THAT HER MOTHER WAS VERY OLD .
UHHUH .
AND COULD NT SEEM TO FIND COMPANIONS .
UHHUH UHHUH .
SHE WAS LONELY .
RIGHT .
AND SHE NEEDED COMPANY .
RIGHT .
FOR HER MOTHER AND SO SHE OPENED A NURSING HOME AND INITIALLY STARTED WITH EIGHT LADIES .
I WILL BE DARNED .
AND THEN UH IT IT GREW INTO A .
UHHUH UHHUH UHHUH .
VERY PROSPEROUS BUSINESS FROM THAT POINT UH THEN THEY .
NOW SEE THAT IS A NICE ATTITUDE TO GO INTO .
UHHUH .
UH IT SEEMS LIKE THEY MUST BE WAITING UNTIL IT IS A NECESSITY .
UHHUH .
AND THERE IS NO CHANCE OF UH GOOD COMPANIONSHIP OR DOING ANYTHING .
WELL THAT IS NOT REALLY TRUE EITHER UH I THINK THAT IS A STIGMA AND AN I .
UHHUH .
AND AN IMPRESSION THAT HAS COME FROM SOME FEW BAD EXPERIENCES YOU SEE THOSE WHO HAD BAD EXPERIENCES TALK ABOUT THEM .
UH RIGHT RIGHT .
AND THOSE WHO DO NOT MAY WRITE .
UHHUH .
A LETTER TO THE NURSING HOME AND SAY YOU DID GOOD .
UHHUH .
BUT THEY DO NOT TALK A WHOLE LOT ABOUT THAT .
THAT IS TRUE BUT WHAT I MEAN IS INSTEAD OF MAYBE ENTERING A NURSING HOME .
UHHUH .
WHEN YOU ARE STILL ABLE TO HAVE GOOD .
UHHUH .
RELATIONSHIPS WITH .
UHHUH .
MAYBE OTHER FRIENDS .
SURE WELL NOW .
THEY WAIT UNTIL THEY ARE YOU KNOW UNABLE .
THAT IS RIGHT WELL THAT IS BECAUSE THEY WAIT UNTIL THE CHILDREN MAKE THOSE CHOICES .
RIGHT .
THEY CHOOSE TO NOT MAKE THOSE .
RIGHT RIGHT .
CHOICES THEMSELVES HOWEVER MY DAUGHTERINLAW ALSO IS A NURSE IN A NURSING HOME .
UHHUH .
AND UH SHE WORKS FOR ONE HERE IN DALLAS WHICH IS MORE A RETIREMENT VILLAGE THAN IT IS A NURSING HOME AND THESE THESE .
UH UHHUH .
I LOVE WATCHING THESE ELDERLY PEOPLE COME THEY WILL COME AND TELL HER WELL I AM GOING FOR MY .
UHHUH .
TENNIS LESSONS .
AND UH WOULD YO WOULD YOU YOU KNOW CALL DOWN AND HAVE THE VAN COME AROUND AND TAKE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
US FOR OUR TENNIS LESSONS AND THEY ARE VERY ACTIVE AND VERY ENTHUSIASTIC AND THEY HAVE .
UHHUH .
SOME EXCELLENT PROGRAMS RIGHT THERE ON SITE .
YEAH .
THEIR DINING ROOM LOOKS LIKE YOU KNOW LUBY S CAFETERIA .
YEAH THAT IS GREAT .
OR OR ONE OF THE LOVELY CAFETERIAS AND THEY HAVE YOU KNOW PINK LINEN NAPKINS FOR THEIR DINNERS .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND A WELL EQUIPPED LIBRARY .
YEAH THAT SOUNDS GREAT .
OH I AM CERTAINLY VERY MUCH FOR A NURSING HOME AND I THINK WHEN THE THE PARENT GETS OLD ENOUGH .
YEAH .
TO THE EXTENT WHERE THEY JUST DO NOT WANT TO BE BOTHERED WITH KEEPING HOUSE .
UHHUH .
AND WITH TAKING CARE OF THEMSELVES .
UHHUH .
ANYMORE THAT IS A WONDERFUL ALTERNATIVE .
UHHUH .
IT IS EXPENSIVE IT IS COSTLY .
SEE IF THEY COULD COULD GET THIS IDEA ACROSS THOUGH BETTER THAN WHAT IT IS .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW .
WELL NOW MY DADDY S MOTHER UH LIVED IN A A RETIREMENT VILLAGE AND SHE AND HER SISTER HAD SIDE BY SIDE DUPLEXES .
UHHUH .
ONE BEDROOM DUPLEX SHE STILL HAD HER INDIVIDUALITY .
UHHUH .
BUT THEY WERE THERE CLOSE AND THEY DID HAVE UH YOU KNOW THE BUTTON THAT YOU COULD PUSH THE CENTRAL OFFICE IF YOU GOT INTO PROBLEMS AND .
UHHUH .
THERE WERE LIGHTS THAT YOU COULD FLIP ON AND SO FORTH AND THEY MUMBLEX HAVE SECURITY .
UHHUH .
NO I AM VERY MUCH IN FAVOR I HAVE HEARD HORROR STORIES .
OH WELL YOU HAVE THAT WITH ANYTHING .
I KNOW THAT THE ELDERLY CAN EASILY BE ABUSED .
OH YEAH .
BUT I WOULD BE WILLING TO BET THEY ARE FAR LESS ABUSED IN A NURSING HOME THAN ARE THEY ARE IN .
IN THE HOMES YEAH .
HOMES OF THEIR OWN CHILDREN .
WELL .
UHHUH .
WE USED OUR NURSING HOME AS UH LIKE WHEN MY SISTER WAS REAL BAD BEFORE SHE DIED .
UHHUH .
UH WE TOOK HER THE LAST MONTH AND A HALF .
UHHUH .
INTO A NURSING HOME .
UHHUH .
AND THEY WERE SUPER WITH HER .
ABSOLUTELY .
THEY WERE UH .
WELL NOW MY GRANDMOTHER OF COURSE ALL OF MY FOLKS LIVED TO BE VERY OLD .
UHHUH .
AND MY GRANDMOTHER DEVELOPED HODGKIN S DISEASE .
UHHUH .
WHEN SHE WAS IN HER LATE EIGHTIES .
UHHUH .
UH LATE SEVENTIES I MEAN .
UHHUH .
SHE WENT TO THE DOCTOR SHE HAD SURGERY SHE GOT THE TREATMENTS AND DURING .
UHHUH UHHUH .
THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT SHE WAS UNDERGOING THOSE TREATMENTS SHE WAS IN A NURSING HOME .
UHHUH .
SHE GOT BETTER SHE GOT WELL SHE GOT OUT AND WENT DANCING AGAIN .
WELL A LOT OF PEOPLE DO THAT THEY .
UHHUH .
LEFT THEM TEMPORALLY MAYBE THEY HAD A .
THAT IS RIGHT .
BROKEN HIP OR SOMETHING OR .
UHHUH UHHUH I THINK IT IS A WONDERFUL INTERIM PLACE .
UHHUH .
IT IS A PLACE THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO STRUGGLE WITH HOSPITAL .
UHHUH UHHUH .
PROBLEMS AND YET IT IS NOT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE .
AND IT CAN BECOME HOME TO THEM .
UHHUH UHHUH .
IT .
IT CERTAINLY IS .
IT DEPENDS UPON THE INDIVIDUAL .
IT CERTAINLY DOES BUT YOU SEE WE HAVE HAD EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE WITH THAT AND UH I I DID NOT PUT MY HUSBAND IN A NURSING HOME WHEN HE BECAME ILL BUT .
UHHUH UHHUH .
I WOULD NOT OBJECT TO GOING TO ONE I MIGHT .
UHHUH .
I MIGHT LIKE TO BE UH COHERENT ENOUGH TO MAKE MY OWN CHOICE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
UH I WOULD NOT PARTICULARLY THINK I WOULD WANT MY KIDS TO SAY WELL I THINK THIS IS WHAT I NEED FOR MOM AND .
THIS IS MUMBLEX AND .
THEN DUMP ME THERE .
BUT I WOULD LIKE .
THERE HAS TO BE CONSIDERATION TAKEN ON EVERYTHING .
THAT IS RIGHT UHHUH UHHUH AND I THINK YOU WOULD SHOP FOR A NURSING HOME JUST LIKE YOU WOULD SHOP FOR A CHURCH .
YEAH .
OR A DOCTOR OR ANYTHING ELSE .
THAT IS RIGHT YOU WOULD LOOK INTO IT THOROUGHLY AND .
UHHUH SURE .
DO DO THE BEST JOB YOU COULD IN CHOOSING ONE .
UHHUH WHEN YOU GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU ARE IN TROUBLE .
UHHUH .
AND YOU HAVE GOT TO HAVE THAT HELP YOU ARE IN NO POSITION TO MAKE THOSE CHOICES .
NO AND YOU DO NOT HAVE THE TIME TO LOOK THAT IS WHAT .
THAT IS RIGHT .
I AM SAYING .
UHHUH .
MOST PEOPLE WILL NOT EVEN LOOK AT THAT UNTIL IT BECOMES A NECESSITY .
ABSOLUTELY I THINK THAT ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO DO THAT IS FOR FAMILIES TO REALIZE THEY ARE GOING TO BE NEEDING THOSE FACILITIES ONE DAY .
UHHUH .
AND TO ACTUALLY GET INVOLVED AND PARTICIPATE ON A COMMUNITY LEVEL WITH COMMUNITY SERVICE GO OUT TO THE NURSING HOME HELP GUIDE SOME CRAFT PROGRAMS PERHAPS WORK ON SOME MUSIC PROGRAMS WHATEVER THEIR TALENTS ARE .
WHATEVER THEIR TALENTS YEAH .
AND WORK WITH .
UHHUH .
THOSE SENIOR CITIZENS .
YEAH I HAVE A COUSIN WHO IS UH SHE HAD A SON THAT WAS EPILEPTIC FROM BIRTH AND HE DID FINE .
UHHUH .
AT HOME THEY LIVED ON A FARM .
UHHUH .
BUT SHE MADE ARRANGEMENTS SO THAT WHEN SHE WAS GONE .
UHHUH .
SHE DID NOT WANT HER HER CHILDREN .
UHHUH .
HER OTHER CHILDREN BURDENED WITH HIS CARE .
THAT IS RIGHT .
SO HE THEY SHE HAS MADE ARRANGEMENTS THAT WHEN SHE SHE WAS GONE THAT HE WOULD GO INTO THE NURSING HOME .
UHHUH .
AND HE HAS I WOULD SAY HE ADJUSTED VERY WELL AND UH HE HE HE HAS BEEN THERE QUITE A LONG TIME .
UHHUH .
AND UH HE DO NT KNOW ME USUALLY .
YEAH .
SO HE GOES WHEELING DOWN UH THE HALL TO BINGO SOMEBODY ELSE IS HELPING HIM OUT .
THAT IS RIGHT .
YOU KNOW .
UH .
AND UH HE HAS ADJUSTED VERY WELL .
WELL ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK THAT IS MOST DESIRABLE FOR THE ELDERLY AND THAT IS ROUTINE .
UHHUH OH YES YES .
ROUTINE AND .
UHHUH .
UH CONSTANCY .
UHHUH UHHUH MUMBLEX .
UH THE ONLY REAL PROBLEM WITH THAT IN A NURSING HOME IS THAT THE STAFF TURNS OVER I DO NOT THINK THEY PAY .
THE NURSING HOME STAFF SUFFICIENTLY .
UHHUH .
TO TO GET THE DEDICATION .
TO KEEP THEM THERE UHHUH .
THAT THEY HAVE IN SOME OTHER PROFESSION .
TRUE .
AND THAT IS SAD BECAUSE I THINK THE HEALTH PROFESSION IS ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL .
YES BUT MUMBLEX .
AND UH .
FOR SOME REASON PEOPLE RESIST UH THE FACT THAT THEY SHOULD BE PAID AS WELL AS BUSINESSES AND THAT TYPE OF THING YOU KNOW .
THAT IS RIGHT .
IT SEEMS TO BE A RESISTANCE .
CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND CARE FOR THE CHILDREN .
UHHUH .
I CAN NOT IMAGINE A MORE COSTLY AND A MORE .
UHHUH .
A MORE UH BETTER AREA TO INVEST .
RIGHT RIGHT .
YOUR MONEY .
BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE A RESISTANCE .
YOU ARE PRESERVING YOUR HERITAGE AND YOUR FUTURE THERE .
YEAH YEAH .
SO UH .
AND AS A MATTER OF FACT I DO NOT SEE WHY THEY DO NOT HAVE CHILDREN S PROGRAMS IN NURSING HOMES .
WELL AROUND HERE WE HAVE SOME YOU KNOW THE CHURCHES .
UHHUH .
TAKE YOUR THE CHILDREN AND .
UHHUH .
I KNOW OUR KIDS THOROUGHLY THE CHILDREN THOROUGHLY ENJOY .
THAT S IT .
YES .
WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE POSSIBLE CHANGES IN THE UH WAY TRIALS ARE CONDUCTED THESE DAYS DO YOU LIKE THE WAY SOME PEOPLE IN THERE FOR INSTANCE REALLY TAKE OVER AND UH WE HAVE NO WAY UH OF KNOWING WHETHER THEY ARE LEGITIMATELY RIGHT OR WRONG AND SO FORTH .
YEAH .
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS .
WELL AS I LOOK AT OUR TRIAL SYSTEMS I THINK THEY VE GOTTEN TO BE QUITE A JOKE THE WAY THE PEOPLE CAN APPEAL AND FILE FOR MISTRIALS AND THEY VE TAKEN A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT WERE SET UP TO MAKE IT BE A FAIR SYSTEM AND USED IT TO THEIR ADVANTAGE I THINK THAT A JURY SHOULD LISTEN TO THE COURTS UH TO TO THE HEARINGS AND TO EVERYTHING BUT I THINK THEY SHOULD ONLY WEIGH FIFTY PERCENT OF THE DECISION I THINK THE JUDGE SHOULD HOLD THE OR MAYBE EVEN FORTYNINE AND THE JUDGE SHOULD BE ABLE TO RULE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER .
Y SO YOU RE SAYING YO YOU THINK THE JUDGE SHOULD ACTUALLY HAVE THE FINAL SAY .
I THINK HE SHOULD .
AND I THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE MORE THAN ONE JUDGE THERE SHOULD BE MAYBE TWO AT LEAST .
HUH .
THAT SIT IN AND LISTEN SO THAT THERE S NO WAY THAT YOU COULD HAVE LIKE A CROOKED JUDGE DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN .
YES I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN .
UM AND I THINK THAT THERE IT S IMPORTANT TO HAVE A JURY BUT I THINK THE WAY THAT THEY GO THROUGH SO MUCH TIME TO GET IT A FAIR ONE THAT S OKAY TOO AS LONG AS IT S NOT USED TO DELAY THE TRIAL SO MUCH THEY NEED TO HAVE A FAIR JURY BUT THEY ONLY W YOU KNOW WOULD COVER FIF FORTYNINE PERCENT OF THE DECISION OR FIFTY PERCENT AND THEN THE TWO JUDGES WOULD GO AHEAD AND MAKE THE FINAL DECISION .
WELL .
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT .
I HAD NT UH THOUGHT OF IT FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW BEFORE I HAVE BEEN IN A FAIRLY IMPORTANT TRIAL AND UH WHAT BOTHERS ME IS I WAS CONCERNED OF THE ABILITY OF SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN THE JURY TO ADEQUATELY UNDERSTAND .
RIGHT .
WHAT WAS BEING PRESENTED SO THAT THEY THEMSELVES COULD MAKE A PROPER AND UH ACCURATE DECISION THAT S THE PART THAT BOTHERED ME ABOUT IT UM I REALLY THINK THAT THE THE THE JURY OUGHT TO HAVE MORE SAY SO IN THE SELECTION OR IN THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THEY ARE GUILTY OR NOT BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THE JURY SHOULD BE UH VERY VERY UH CAREFULLY MORE CAREFULLY SELECTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ENTIRELY INTEL INTELLIGENT PEOPLE AND THAT THEY UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE DETAILS THAT ARE INVOLVED SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE ACCU ACCURATE DECISIONS .
RIGHT .
I HATE TO SEE PEOPLE BROUGHT IN WHO BASICALLY HAVE LIVED OUT IN THE COUNTRY AND DO NT KNOW MUCH ABOUT ANY OF THIS STUFF AND AND THEY JUST MAKE A DECISION BASED ON WHETHER THEY LIKE THE DRESS SHE WORE THAT DAY OR WHETHER THAT GUY SMILED OR GROWLED ALL THE TIME .
RIGHT .
THAT S NO WAY TO MAKE A DECISION ON SOME TERRIBLE PROBLEM .
RIGHT WELL WHAT IF THEY USED YOU KNOW I JUST HAD A THOUGHT COME AS YOU WERE TALKING WHAT IF THEY USED LAW STUDENTS AND HAD THAT BE CREDIT HOURS TO SIT IN TRIALS .
THAT WOULD BE CERTAINLY NICE SH LET S SAY WE WE WOULD HAVE FIFTY PERCENT OF THEM LAW STUDENTS .
YEAH AT LEAST .
ANYWAY .
AT LEAST .
YEAH .
ON THE JURY .
YEAH .
AND THAT WOULD GIVE THEM .
UHHUH .
EXPERIENCE IN THE COURTROOM AND IT COULD COUNT AS SOME ASPECT OR HOURS GOING INTO THEIR MAJOR .
THAT S A VERY NEAT IDEA AND THEY WOULD LEARN A LOT ABOUT BEING LAWYERS LATER IN LIFE .
RIGHT .
WHEN THEY SEE WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE IN THE JURY SIDE OF A TRIAL .
THAT S RIGHT THAT WOULD BE A REALLY GOOD THING TO DO .
THAT WOULD BE A A REALLY GOOD THING TO DO .
SO IT S .
I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND THAT JUST WENT THROUGH A THREE YEAR TRIAL .
HUH .
AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS HER HUSBAND WAS UH INVOLVED IN A MOTORCYCLE ACCIDENT WHERE A DRUNK DRIVER RAN THE STOPLIGHT AND HE RAN INTO THE MOTORCYCLE .
HUH .
BUT THE REASON THE ACTUAL REASON THAT THE MOTORCYCLE PERSON HER HUSBAND WAS KILLED WAS BECAUSE HIS BRAKES WENT OUT ON HIS MOTORCYCLE HE WAS JUST TAKING IT HOME FROM THE PLACE IT WAS BRAND NEW AND HIS BRAKES DID NOT WORK .
FOR GOODNESS SAKES .
AND THIS EXPENSIVE BIG COMPANY THAT OWNED THESE MOTORCYCLES UM RAILROADED THIS INTO THREE YEARS WORTH OF TRIALS FOR THIS LADY AND SHE HAD A SON THAT WAS JUST ONLY TWO YEARS OLD WHEN IT HAPPENED .
UHHUH .
AND THEY WERE FOLLOWING HIM HOME IN THE CAR SAW THE WHOLE THING HAPPEN .
OH THEY SAW THE HUSBAND .
THAT S RIGHT .
GET .
THEY WERE FOLLOWING HIM HOME FROM THE MOTORCYCLE SHOP .
YEAH .
AND THEY RAILROADED THIS WHOLE TRIAL INTO MISTRIALS UM THIS AND THAT AND THE OTHER EVERY TIME SHE D GET A VERDICT THAT WOULD BE IN HER FAVOR OF HER .
UHHUH .
OF A SETTLEMENT .
THEY WOULD FIND SOMETHING WRONG WITH IT .
UNTIL FINALLY THEY WON AND .
DID THEY REALLY .
SAID THAT IT WAS THE DRUNK DRIVER S FAULT AND SHE WOULD HAVE TO SUE HIM .
UHHUH .
WHICH I WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE SOME HIS FAULT BUT I JUST FELT LIKE JUSTICE WAS NT SERVED BECAUSE THEY HAD THE MONEY THE BIG LAWYERS AND SHE DID NT .
THAT IS A SHAME YOU D THINK THERE WOULD BE ENOUGH UH PEOPLE WHO SAW THE ACCIDENT OTHER THAN HIS WIFE .
RIGHT .
TO TO ALSO UH MAKE STATEMENTS AND THEY HAVE NOTHING TO GAIN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER SO IF THEY SAY A CERTAIN WAY THEN WHY NOT BELIEVE THEM .
RIGHT AND I DO NT KNOW ALL THE DETAILS ON THAT BUT I CERTAINLY THINK THAT WE VE COME UP WITH A GOOD IDEA WITH THE THE STU THE STUDENTS COMING INTO THE JURY .
YEAH .
AND I DO NT THINK THAT IT WOULD BE SUCH A BAD IDEA EVEN IF THE JUDGE DID NT HAVE THE FINAL SAY .
UHHUH .
SO WHAT KIND OF A HOUSE DO YOU LIVE IN .
I M IN A UH IN A RANCH A UH IT WAS ABOUT UH SIXTEEN HUNDRED SQUARE FEET WHEN I BOUGHT IT AND UH IT S ABOUT TWO THOUSAND SQUARE FEET NOW BUT IT S ONE OF THOSE TYPICAL UH RANCHES THAT YOU FIND AROUND HERE OH IT S UH BUILT IN THE PROBABLY BUILT IN THE LATE FIFTIES SO IT S NOT UM WHAT YOU WOULD FIND UH WHERE YOU LIVE BUT UH FOR THE OLDER UH RANCH HOMES IT S PRETTY TYPICAL I GUESS .
UHHUH WELL OUR HOME IS UH PROBABLY FOR OUR AREA IT S PROBABLY ONE OF THE LOWER INCOME HOMES OUT HERE UH MOST OF THE THE HOMES THAT THEY RE BUILDING WELL I SHOULD NT SAY ALL OF THEM BUT MOST OF THEM NOW ARE UP IN THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS .
REALLY .
OH YEAH THERE S .
HOW MANY SQUARE FEET DO YOU HAVE .
WE HAVE GOT ABOUT UH TWENTY I D SAY ABOUT TWENTYFOUR HUNDRED .

WELL THIS THIS HOUSE IS VERY COMFORTABLE WE VE GOT TWO LIVING AREAS AND THAT THAT S THE THING I PROBABLY LIKE THE MOST ABOUT IT .
HOW MANY STORIES JUST ONE .

SO YOU .
HAS REPLACED IT TO SOME EXTENT BUT CERTAINLY NOT .
CAN YOU STAND UP IN IT .
UH IN PARTS I MEAN YOU COULD NT YOU REALLY COULD NT USE IT FOR A ROOM .
SO YOU HAVE A PROBABLY A MORE PITCHED ROOF THAN IS TYPICAL AROUND HERE .
YES .
TH OURS IS PITCHED SO SHALLOW THAT YOU UH DO NT GET MUCH ROOM IN THE ATTIC .
YEAH YEAH WE UH WE VE GOT YOU KNOW I LL STORE ALL OUR CHRISTMAS STUFF AND WHATEVER ELSE JUNK UP THERE .

UHHUH .
AT THE REAR OF THE HOUSE WHICH HAS BEEN REALLY NICE IN FACT I REALLY ENJOY THE PLAYROOM THAT Y YOU WOULD THINK THAT WOULD NOT BE A REAL BONUS YOU KNOW TO A HOUSE BUT OF ALL THE ROOMS IN THE HOUSE I D SAY THAT WAS THAT WAS THE ONE THAT S BEEN REALLY NICE TO HAVE .
IS NT IT FUNNY HOW FAMILIES END UP LIVING IN ONE ROOM IN THE HOUSE MOST OF THE TIME .
I THINK THAT S TRUE .
YOU C .
YEAH PROBABLY OUR FAMILY ROOM IS THE THE BIGGEST UH .
RIGHT SOME PEOPLE I MEAN FAMILIES SEEM TO MIGRATE TOWARDS ONE ONE ROOM AND CARRY ON MOST OF THEIR ACTIVITIES THERE AND UH UH SOME ROOMS WE HAVE ONE ROOM THAT WE NEVER USE .
YEAH .
I MEAN MIGHT AS WELL NOT EVEN HEAT AND COOL IT .
YEAH .
STRANGE .
WELL THAT S KIND OF THE WAY OUR LIVING ROOM AND DINING ROOM IS .
UHHUH .
BUT IT IS NICE TO HAVE IT BECAUSE THERE S UH WITH OUR SIZE OF FAMILY IT S NICE TO KNOW THAT THERE S ONE THAT S ALWAYS STRAIGHT AND CLEAN IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE COME .
RIGHT RIGHT .
JUST ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT .
UHHUH .
SO .
SO YOU VE BEEN FAIRLY HAPPY WITH IT HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN IN IT .
SEVENTEEN YEARS .
WOW BOY IT DOES NT SEEM THAT LONG BUT IT IS BECAUSE WE UH CAME TO THIS AREA ABOUT THE SAME TIME .
UHHUH .
WE VE BEEN FIFTEEN FIFTEEN YEARS IN THE IN THE HOUSE THAT WE RE LIVING IN .
OH WOW .
AND WE THE THE PRINCIPAL FEATURE I LIKE ABOUT OURS IS THAT IT S PIER AND BEAM .
OH UHHUH .
YOURS IS A SLAB I ASSUME .
YES IT IS .
YEAH OURS IS A PIER AND BEAM WHICH HAS ALLOWED ME TO GO UNDER IT AND DO A WHOLE LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT I COULD NOT HAVE DONE IF IT WAS SLAB .
UHHUH .
I VE DONE A LOT OF ELECTRICAL AND PLUMBING AND OTHER WORK THAT BY MYSELF AND SAVED A LOT OF MONEY THAT I COULD NT HAVE DONE IF THE HOUSE WAS ON A SLAB .
WELL THAT S INTERESTING .
BUT THAT S BECAUSE IT S SO OLD .
YEAH .
IT S THIRTYFIVE THIRTYSIX YEARS OLD WHEN THEY USED TO BUILD LIKE THAT AND UH .
UHHUH WELL MY HUSBAND WOULD NT DO THAT ANYWAY THAT S HIS THAT S HIS .
I KNOW HE S NOT A HANDY RIGHT .
WORST THING IN LIFE IS TO HAVE TO REPAIR SOMETHING .
I ON THE OTHER HAND SE .
SO .
UH DO A LOT TOO MUCH OF IT AND UH I VE GOTTEN GOOD AT IT WHICH IN A IN A WAY IS BAD BECAUSE THEN YOU UH YOU START TO TAKE PLEASURE IN IT .
WELL UH THAT S GREAT WE JUST KIND OF SAVE EVERYTHING FOR WHEN AL UH FOR FOR WHEN HIS DAD COMES TO VISIT AND THEN HE DOES ALL THE REPAIRING YOU KNOW HE DOES .
RIGHT MY DAD IS ACTUALLY UH .
OKAY UH SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE SCHOOL SYSTEM .
WELL I THINK THEY RE THEY RE HAVING A LOT OF TROUBLE RIGHT NOW .
I KNOW MY SON GOES TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL BUT UH I THINK THEY RE BIG CITY PUBLIC SCHOOLS BY DEFINITION ARE HAVING A A TOUGH TIME RIGHT NOW JUST FROM UH PROBABLY FROM BUDGET CUTS AND AND EVERYTHING ELSE GOING ON .
UH WHY DID YOU CHOOSE A PRIVATE SCHOOL .
WELL I HAD ONE .
THAT WAS NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO BE MOVED ALONG AT A AT A PACE .
A LITTLE FASTER THAN HE WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE MOVED IN PUBLIC SCHOOL SO .
PUBLIC SCHOOL .
HE S HE HAS BEEN GOING TO PRIVATE SINCE KINDERGARTEN .
OH HAS HE .
SO .
THEN HOW DOES HE LIKE IT .
OH HE S LOVED IT .
HE IS A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL .
THIS YEAR SO .
SO .
HE S .
HE S BEEN THERE ALL THE TIME .
YEAH HE S DONE IT .
THE WHOLE TWELVE AND UH SO MANY YEARS AND IT S BEEN UH IT S BEEN REALLY GOOD FOR HIM .
HOW BIG OF A SCHOOL IS IT .
UH OVERALL ON CAMPUS ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED BUT IN THE UPPER SCHOOL UPPER FOUR GRADES UH ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND SOMETHING SO IT S MAYBE A HUNDRED PER GRADE .
A HUNDRED PER GRADE THAT S A GOOD SIZE .
YEAH IT REALLY IS .
KIND OF GIVES THEM .
THE YOU KNOW I GET A LITTLE LEERY OF THE REAL SMALL ONES THAT THEY DO NT GET MUCH INTERACTION WITH KIDS BUT UH .
YEAH THAT WAS WE WERE KIND OF LOOKING FOR ONE .
THAT WOULD BE A MIXTURE AND .
SO THEY DO NT .
HE S DONE HE S DONE .
THAT S GOOD .
REALLY WELL AND JUST HE WAS JUST AHEAD AT AN EARLY AGE AND I DID NT FEEL LIKE UH IN WHAT WAS AVAILABLE PARTICULARLY IN THE FIRST THREE GRADES .
UHHUH .
AND EVEN IN THE FOURTH GRADE WHERE THEY STARTED WHAT .
THEY CALLED REACH WAS STILL A PULL OUT ONE DAY PROGRAM .
HUH .
AND I JUST DID NT THINK THAT WAS GOING GET IT .
I THOUGHT HE NEEDED TO BE EXPOSED TO A SITUATION WHERE HE COULD PUSH AHEAD UH EVERY DAY .
RIGHT .
BUT YET STILL BE WITH HIS PEERS .
STILL ENJOY THE .
AGE WISE .
RIGHT .
UH ONE THING .
I THINK I VE NOTICED IS UH MY OLDEST IS IN KINDERGARTEN SO I M IN A LITTLE DIFFERENT .
YOU RE JUST .
BALLGAME .
GETTING STARTED .
I M JUST .
STARTING HER BUT UH SEEMS TO ME THAT UH KIDS THESE DAYS UH CAN REALLY GET AWAY WITH MURDER AND THE TEACHERS DO NT HAVE AS MUCH ARE NT RESPECTED AS MUCH AND UH THEY HAVE TO BE SO CAREFUL OF THE THINGS THEY DO AND SAY .
YEAH I KNOW .
THAT S .
AND UH MAKES ME .
A BIG PROBLEM .
A LITTLE NERVOUS THAT UH STUDENTS DO NT SEEM TO SHOW THAT RESPECT AND .
WE WOULD NT HAVE THOUGHT OF CROSSING A TEACHER WHEN WE .
NO .
WERE IN SCHOOL .
HEAVENS NO .
WOULD NT HAVE THOUGHT OF IT AND .
NO YOU WOULD NT .
AND THEY LL STAND THERE NOW WITH THEM .
TOE TO TOE AND .
AND UH THE THINGS THEY CAN SAY AND DO TO A TEACHER AND THEY DO FROM WHAT .
I UNDERSTAND UH I THINK THAT S WRONG .
I THINK WE NEED TO GET BACK TO THE SHOW SOME RESPECT AND COURSE I GUESS THE TEACHER USED TO WARRANT THAT BUT .
YEAH BUT A LOT OF TIMES .
IT S NOT BEING TAUGHT IN THE HOME .
RIGHT .
ANYMORE LIKE IT USED TO BE BASIC RESPECT FOR .
FOR OTHER PEOPLE .
FOR ELDERS .
AND .
AND ADULTS AND PARTICULARLY IN IN RESPONSIBLE POSITIONS HAVE NOT UH I DO NT THINK HAVE HAD THAT BASIC UPBRINGING IN A LOT OF CASES AND SO THEN YOU WIND UP WITH LITTLE BRATS ON YOUR HANDS .
WELL HOW DO YOU THINK THAT THAT S HAPPENED .
YOU THINK OUR SOCIETY S JUST UH STOPPED TALKING OUT OR THIS UH .
I GUESS I .
GENERATION S JUST KIND OF CHANGED A LITTLE BIT UH .
WELL THE WORLD CHANGES SO I MEAN OBVIOUSLY KIDS ARE NOT THE SAME NOW AS THEY USED TO BE .
RIGHT .
I MEAN THEY RE EXPOSED TO A WHOLE LOT MORE THINGS .
THEY HAVE A WHOLE LOT MORE UH VARIETY OF THINGS THEY .
THEY RE THAT THEY SEE AND DO AT AN EARLIER AGE SO LIFE IS NOT MAYBE AS SIMPLE AS IT WAS AT ONE TIME BUT BUT STILL I THINK IT GOES BACK TO A COMMITMENT BY THE PARENTS TO TO TEACH UH BASIC VALUES AND BASIC UH RESPECTFUL OF UH NESS OF AUTHORITY .
RIGHT .
AND I JUST DO NT THINK THAT THIS .
THAT JUST IS NT COMING THROUGH .
DOES NT ALWAYS GET EMPHASIZED .
IS IT .
ANYMORE UH .
NO .
I MEAN I REMEMBER UH WELL IT WAS A BIG THING WHEN THEY LET GIRLS WEAR LEVI S .
WE USED TO HAVE TO WEAR .
YEAH HAD TO WEAR .
DRESSES .
DRESSES DID NT YOU .
AND THEN YOU HAD TO A GO TO DRESSES THEY HAD TO BE A PANTSUIT AND IT WAS POLYESTER AND IT HAD TO BE MATCHING AND .
AND WHEN IT WAS SKIRTS IT WAS LIKE GET DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND WE HOLD THE RULER UP HERE .
YES .
AND IT S NO .
EXACTLY .
MORE THAN SO MANY INCHES ABOVE THE KNEE .
YES .
BECAUSE IT WAS MINI SKIRT TIME BACK THERE AT ONE TIME .
YES SO IT S REALLY CHANGED .
IT .
S UH REALLY KIND OF GONE THE ROUNDS SO I THINK THAT MAYBE THAT S EFFECTED IT TO SOME DEGREE .
THEY SAY YOU .
KIND OF ACT HOW YOU RE DRESSED A LITTLE BIT SO I .
YEAH I THINK THAT PROBABLY DOES HAVE HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT AND IT S ALSO .
DO UH DOES THIS SCHOOL YOUR SON GOES TO DO THEY UH RE REQUIRE TO WEAR A UNIFORM OR .
NO THEY DO NOT DO UNIFORMS ALTHOUGH ONE WHERE HE WAS BETWEEN LIKE SECOND AND EIGHTH GRADE .

WELL HOW DID YOU LIKE THAT TOPIC .
UH I DO NT KNOW I VE GOT MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT THE TOPIC .
DO YOU .
I DO NT .
NO .
OKAY .
NO I M PRETTY OPINIONATED ABOUT THAT AND MANY OTHER THINGS AS YOU WELL KNOW .
I AGREE WITH IT .
I THINK UH I THINK A COMPANY SHOULD BE ABLE TO TEST AT ANY ANY EMPLOYEE .
ANY TIME .
THEY SEE FIT .
WELL .
I JUST I JUST DO NT THINK THERE S A PLACE IN OUR ENVIRONMENT YOU KNOW IN THE WORK FORCE FOR DRUGS OR ALCOHOL EITHER .
WELL I DO NT BELIEVE IN DRUGS OR ALCOHOL BUT IF YOU LL REMEMBER WHEN THE TEACHERS HAD TO TAKE THE T CAT .
RIGHT .
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT DRUG TESTING US .
UHHUH .
AND WE WERE LAUGHING THAT WE D HAVE TO GO TO THAT EXAMINATION TO PROVE WE COULD READ AND WRITE WITH A SPECIMEN OF URINE .
UHHUH .
AND WE FOUND IT BELITTLING .
YOU DID .
YEAH .
UHHUH .
WELL I CAN SORT OF UNDERSTAND THAT UH BUT NOT BEING A TEACHER AS YOU ARE YOU KNOW I I WAS NOT QUITE AS SYMPATHETIC AS YOU KNOW AS I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN IF IF KAY WERE A TEACHER OR SOMETHING .
THAT S TRUE .
BUT UH .
BUT THEN YOU KNOW AT THE SAME TOKEN I M NOT AGAINST BECAUSE I LOOK AT AIRLINE PILOTS .
UHHUH .
BUS DRIVERS .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW PEOPLE .
THAT REALLY HAVE OTHER PEOPLES LIVES IN THEIR HANDS .
THAT S RIGHT .
TRUCK DRIVERS .
THAT S RIGHT .
IT S SUPPOSED TO BE A HUGE PROBLEM WITH TRUCK DRIVERS USING DRUGS .
UH THAT S RIGHT .
AND ALCOHOL .
AND I THINK IT IS A BIG PROBLEM WITH THEM USING DRUGS .
AND .
FROM WHAT .
YOU READ YOU KNOW BUT UH .
YOU KNOW IN THOSE AREAS I REALLY YOU KNOW DO BELIEVE THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD CLEAN UP OUR YOU KNOW .
YEAH I THINK SO .
HOUSE .
TOO I I AGREE WITH IT .
UH I KNOW KAY S COMPANY YOU KNOW THEY STARTED IT .
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND SO MANY OF THE PEOPLE EVEN THE PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE WERE BOY THEY WERE SO AGAINST THEM DOING THAT YOU KNOW AND I THOUGHT JEEZ TO ME .
IT S QUITE SIMPLE UH YOU EITHER NEED A JOB OR YOU DO NT .
THE THE JOB IS WHAT PROVIDES ALL OF YOUR NEEDS AND UH IF THEY SAY HEY YOU CA NT DO THIS WORK I D SAY HEY I AGREE I DO NT I WO NT DO THAT .
AND I THINK MOST OF THEM HAVE AGREED TO THAT NOW ALTHOUGH THEY DID NT LIKE IT AT FIRST .
YEAH I THINK IT S JUST LIKE ANYTHING ELSE A NEW CONCEPT YOU KNOW AS I SAID IF I HAVE TO GO TO A TESTING AREA WITH MY URINE SPECIMEN .
I WAS INSULTED .
YEAH IT IS I CAN SEE WHERE YOU WOULD THINK YEAH THAT IS BELITTLING YOU KNOW I D PROBABLY FEEL THE SAME WAY IF I HAD TO DO THAT .
BUT AT THE SAME TOKEN IN EDUCATION .
WE CA NT DO DRUG RANDOM DRUG TESTING ON KIDS .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
YOU KNOW I MEAN THEIR RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED .
YOU BET .
OH GOSH THEY THEY WOULD REALLY RAISE A STINK IF THAT WAS TO .
WHAT .
HAPPEN .
WELL BUT WHY IF YOU RE GOING TO DO TEACHERS OR PROFESSIONALS WHY NOT DO THE KIDS .
WHEN WE SEE THEM AND THEY RE YOU KNOW UNDER THE INFLUENCE .
RIGHT YES I AGREE WITH THAT .
I I I WOULD NT BE OPPOSED TO IT AT ALL IT S JUST OUR BLEEDING HEART LIBERALS .
THAT WOULD FIGHT IT .
TO TOOTH AND NAIL YOU KNOW .
THAT S TRUE .
BUT UH WELL LYNN I VE ENJOYED TALKING WITH YOU .

THAT HAVE EVEN THOUGH TEACHERS HAVE OTHER KIDS LIVES IN THEIR HANDS AND IF THEY COME IN STONED OR THEY COME IN DRUNK .
YEAH .
AND THERE WAS AN INCIDENT IN MY CHILDREN S HIGH SCHOOL WHERE A TEACHER STAYED DRUNK .
IS THAT RIGHT .
UHHUH .
YOU JUST DO NT THINK OF THAT HAPPENING WITH TEACHERS .
AND HE .
I REALLY DO NT WHEN I THINK OF DRUG TESTING I M THINKING OF THE YOU KNOW OUTSIDE OF EDUCATION .
UH WELL NO YOU KNOW WE ARE AS SUSCEPTIBLE A SOCIETY .

AND QUITE HONESTLY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF BEING INVOLVED IN A PART OWNERSHIP OF A LITTLE BASS BOAT I HAVE NEVER REALLY GOT INTO SAILING OR BOATING .
I DO UH QUITE A BIT OF SAILING I OWN A SAILBOAT THAT I .
OH DO YOU WELL GREAT .
KEEP IT PARKED UP ON THE SCOUT LOT OF MY SCOUT TROOP .
AND WE TAKE IT OUT AND WE DO SOME TEACHING OF SAILING WITH THE SCOUTS BUT .
WELL THAT S NEAT .
I HAVE NT REALLY BEEN TAKING IT OUT .
RECREATIONALLY TOO MUCH LATELY IT S JUST .
RIGHT .
I DO NT HAVE A TRAILER HITCH ON MY CAR ANYMORE SO IT S HARD FOR ME TO GET IT SOMEWHERE BUT .
I VE SEEN SOME NICE NICE SAILBOATS THE GUY THAT USED TO LIVE NEXT TO US IN RICHARDSON BEFORE WE MOVED TWELVE YEARS AGO OR WHATEVER HE HAD A SAILBOAT USED TO PARK IT RIGHT IN THE UH DRIVEWAY AND IT SEEMED UH I THINK IT HELD PROBABLY UH IT MUST HAVE SLEPT FOUR PEOPLE ANYWAY .
YEAH THIS ONE IS NOT THAT BIG IT S A DAY SAILER IT DOES HAVE A LITTLE KIND OF CABIN THING THAT YOU CAN STORE THINGS IN .
RIGHT .
BUT YOU COULD NT REALLY SLEEP IN THERE UNLESS YOU SORT OF STUCK YOUR BODY OUT THE HOLE .
BACK INTO THE MAIN PART OF THE SAILBOAT .
I .
BUT .
I UNDERSTAND .
BUT IT S THEY RE THEY CAN BE BLACK HOLES TO THROW MONEY INTO .
I TELL YOU .
BOATS ARE KIND OF EXPENSIVE TO MAINTAIN .
OH THEY ARE AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE A SWIMMING POOL AT OUR HOUSE AND I THINK OF ALL THE TIME NOW THAT MY KIDS ARE GONE AND AWAY AND MARRIED AND GOING TO COLLEGE OR WHATEVER THAT I PUT IN THERE I JUST COULD NOT IMAGINE A BOAT BECAUSE I KNOW IT S A LOT OF MAINTENANCE .
ESPECIALLY A BIGGER ONE .
OH GOSH .
THE BIGGER .
YEAH .
THEY ARE IF YOU GET A BIG CABIN CRUISER OR .
YOU BET .
OR A BIG SKI BOAT .
POWER BOAT THEN THERE S ALWAYS UH STUFF TO GO WRONG WITH IT A SAILBOAT AT LEAST DOES NT HAVE AN ENGINE TO MESS UP BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO .
SURE .
WORRY WITH THE HULL AND THE CONDITION OF THE SAILS AND SPARS AND RIGGING UH EVERYTHING THAT S IN IT IT TAKES A A PRETTY GOOD AMOUNT OF MAINTENANCE TO KEEP ONE UP BUT .
YOU BET I KNOW MY WIFE AND I WERE FIRST MARRIED HERE AUNT AND UNCLE UN AUNT AND UNCLE UP IN NEW YORK THEY KEPT A BOAT ON JAMAICA BAY AND WE USED TO GO OUT WITH THEM AND BACK THEN THEY HAD BOUGHT AN OLDER CHRIS CRAFT AND WE WERE INVOLVED EVERY WEEKEND IN JUST UH AS WE VISITED WE WERE INVOLVED EVERY WEEKEND IN JUST HELPING THEM REDO THIS AND REFINISH THAT WE JUST WORKED ALL THE TIME BUT THEIR BOAT SLEPT ABOUT FOUR PEOPLE PLUS HAD A LITTLE KITCHEN IT WAS SORT OF NEAT WE BUT I THINK THAT WAS THE LAST TIME WE WERE REALLY INVOLVED AND THAT WAS TWENTY YEARS AGO OR TWENTYFIVE .
WELL .
YEARS AGO .
IT S A LOT OF FUN I THINK .
IT IS A LOT OF FUN .
UH JUST FROM THE STANDPOINT OF GETTING AWAY FROM THE DODGE HERE AND WHEN YOU WORK HARD AND YOU RE UNDER PRESSURE AND EVERYTHING ALL WEEK LONG A BOAT CAN BE A LOT OF RELAXATION UH TO ESPECIALLY WITH A GROUP OF FRIENDS AND .
YOU BET .
COOK OUT OR CAMP OUT OR WHATEVER UH OR A CABIN OR SOMETHING DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH YOU LIKE TO ROUGH IT BUT BUT IT S UH .
I VISITED MY COUSIN A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO MY WIFE AND I AND OUR DAUGHTER AND HE HAD A PLACE ON LAKE OF THE OZARKS AND HE HAD A BOAT AND UH I NEVER SEEN SO MANY BOATS IN ALL MY LIFE PEOPLE ACTUALLY PARK THEIR CAR WHEN THEY GET TO THEIR PLACE THEY RE STAYING TOWNHOUSE OR CONDOMINIUM WHATEVER THEY OWN AND .
USE THE BOAT .
THEY THEY GO BOAT .
FOR TRANSPORTATION .
I MEAN THEY GO IF THEY WANT TO GO TO THE LOUNGE TO HAVE A COCKTAIL THEY USE THE BOAT .
THEY JUST GO ACROSS THE BOAT AND GET A AND TIE IT UP AND GO IN HUH .
AND THAT WAS SORT OF NEAT THAT THAT THAT S TRUE THAT S EXACTLY HOW THEY DO IT THEY GO TO DINNER THAT WAY GO TO ALL THE RESTAURANTS AND THAT WAS SORT OF A NEAT SETUP I ENJOYED THAT WE SPENT A WEEK WITH THEM I ENJOYED THAT I M ENVIOUS .
THAT WOULD BE FUN .
I M ENVIOUS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE BIG BOATS AND UH .
I VE JUST NEVER I VE NEVER MOVED UP TO A REALLY BIG CLASS OF SAILBOAT UH ONCE I GET MY SON INTO AND THROUGH WITH COLLEGE HE S GOING TO BE STARTING UH RICE NEXT YEAR SO HE S GOING OFF BUT UH ONCE I GET TO THAT STAGE WHERE I M NOT PAYING FOR SOMETHING ELSE .
YOU BET .
AND UH I DO NT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT A LOT OF OTHER SCHEDULING THINGS WHERE I VE ACTUALLY GOT THE TIME TO GO OUT AND ENJOY IT UH I MIGHT DO SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY I MIGHT JUST DONATE MY LITTLE ONE TO THE SCOUT TROOP AND LET THEM .
KEEP IT AND MAYBE CONSIDER GETTING A A BETTER ONE FOR ME UH .
THINK YOU THINK YOU D REALLY ENJOY IT .
YEAH I THINK I WOULD UH THE SAILING PART OF IT I LIKE BECAUSE IT S SO QUIET .
YEAH .
AND IF YOU GET A BIG ENOUGH ONE THEN YOU VE GOT A LITTLE MOTOR ON IT ALSO WHERE IF IT S LIGHT WIND YOU CAN STILL PUTT AROUND A LITTLE BIT AND HAVE FUN .

UHHUH .
I MEAN I WAS RAISED BY A MAN MY STEPFATHER .
WHO WITH A TWO HANDICAP I MEAN HE HE HE HE COULD GET DOWN ON HIS KNEES AND HIT THE BALL I MEAN FURTHER THAN MOST PEOPLE COULD HIT IT .

SO .
OH YEAH IF YOU PLAY REGULAR I THINK IT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE .
YOU BET SO IT THAT MAKES A LOT OF DIFFERENCE TO ME .
YEAH YEAH I WELL I VE ALSO FOUND TOO I I TRY TO WORK OUT REGULARLY AND WHEN I AM DOING THAT UH AND FEELING LOOSE AND THAT I SWING BETTER I I I GET THROUGH THE BALL BETTER .
UH AND I ALSO IF I I FOUND AS I VE GOTTEN A LITTLE OLDER HERE I WORRY LESS ABOUT MY DISTANCE .
YOU BET .
AND I MY CONTROL IS A LITTLE BIT BETTER THERE .
YEAH .
UH SO .
THAT S SUPER .
I HAVE NT LEARNED TO HIT THE BALL EASY AND I JUST SORT OF .
I M ALWAYS WANTING TO HIT IT HARD AND THAT S SOMETHING .
MY STEPFATHER NEVER COULD TEACH ME YOU KNOW JUST TO RELAX AND HIT THE BALL AND YOU KNOW SO SUBSEQUENTLY WHEN I DO TIRE OUT FROM PLAYING LIKE TWELVE FOURTEEN HOLES MY YOU KNOW A LOT OF MY ENERGY S GONE WHEN I DO SWING IT S AN EASIER SWING .
UHHUH .

MAKES GOOD MAKES GOOD SENSE .
SO BUT I I THE ONE IRON IS SOMETHING .
I VE BEEN THINKING BECAUSE MY DRIVER S GONE SO BADLY LATELY THAT I I SHOULD PICK ONE UP AND TRY TO START .
APPARENTLY THEY RE VERY DIFFICULT TO PLAY WITH BUT WITH PRACTICE I WOULD IMAGINE YOU COULD GROOVE THAT SWING TOO .
AND I PLAY WITH A FELLOW .
THAT CAN KNOCK A ONE IRON IT S INCREDIBLE .
OH YEAH .
AND BUT AND HIS ACCURACY IS WHAT S SO STARTLING WITH IT .

I GREW UP IN NEW YORK AND SO I KNOW WHAT WARM IS LIKE FIVE PAIRS OF SOCKS AND .
YEAH .
YEAH .
YEAH SLEEPING IN SWEATS OR LONG UNDERWEAR MY PARENTS KEEP THE HOUSE COLD .
OKAY I GUESS WE RE SUPPOSED TO DISCUSS THE UH SCHOOL SYSTEM .
THAT SHOULD NT BE TOO MUCH TROUBLE FOR THE TWO OF US .
RIGHT .
NO .
AS MANY YEARS AS WE VE BEEN INVOLVED IN ONE .
I REALLY FEEL FORTUNATE IN THAT THERE EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE PROBLEMS THEY RE NOT A LOT OF PROBLEMS WHERE I TEACH .
RIGHT .
BUT FROM TALKING TO PEOPLE IN OTHER DISTRICTS .
THERE ARE SOME MAJOR PROBLEMS UH WITH DROPOUTS .
UH WHEN I WAS IN MINNESOTA LAST SUMMER .
UHHUH .
THERE WAS A TEACHER .
WHO SAID THAT UH ON A GIVEN DAY .
SHE DID NT KNOW HOW MANY OF HER STUDENTS WOULD SHOW UP AND SOMETIMES THEY DID NT EVEN SHOW UP FOR CLASS AND SHE TAUGHT IN HIGH SCHOOL IN INNER CITY UH MINNEAPOLIS .
UHHUH .
AND UH THEY JUST DID NT COME TO SCHOOL .
THAT S REALLY SAD IS NT IT .
AND I CAN NOT IMAGINE BEING ABLE TO DO MUCH OF ANYTHING WHEN THEY DO NT EVEN COME TO SCHOOL .
RIGHT .
WELL JUST RECENTLY IN THE PAPER HERE WERE ARTICLES ABOUT STUDENTS UH WORKING .
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS .
UHHUH .
THAT WORK AND THE PERCENTAGE OF HOURS THAT THEY WORK AND HOW THAT AFFECTS THEIR GRADES .
BUT THEN THE FOLLOWUP .
THE NEXT DAY WAS I WAS KIND OF GLAD TO SEE BECAUSE IT IT SAID THAT YOU KNOW YES BUT FOR THOSE STUDENTS .
WHO ARE DETERMINED TO DO WELL ANYWAY THAT YOU KNOW HANDLING A JOB WAS VERY POSSIBLE .
YOU KNOW AND THAT IT SEEMED TO HAVE MORE TO DO WITH OTHER FACTORS .
I THINK SO TOO .
YOU KNOW LIKE WHAT ARE THEIR PLANS AFTER HIGH SCHOOL YOU KNOW .
AND WHAT .
S THEIR HOME SITUATION .
YOU KNOW THAT .
THE HOME IS THE KEY .
RIGHT .
I THINK REALLY IS BECAUSE IF THE HOME .
DOES NOT PLACE A HIGH PRIORITY ON EDUCATION .
RIGHT .
AND UH THE THE MAIN GOAL IS MAKING MONEY NOW AND IT MAY BE A SURVIVAL THING .
RIGHT .
FOR THE FAMILY WHICH .
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND .
SURE .
SO UH .
BUT THERE CAN STILL BE AN ATTITUDE OF .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW THIS IS A STOPGAP MEASURE BECAUSE WE NEED IT RIGHT NOW BUT BUT THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS STILL YOU KNOW .
YOUR EDUCATION .
GETTING YOUR EDUCATION .
WELL WHEN THEY MEANT SAID THE THE TOPIC YOU KNOW OF WHAT S WRONG WITH THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS MY MY FIRST IM IMPULSE WAS IT IS NT REALLY WHAT S WRONG WITH THE PUBLIC PUBLIC SCHOOLS .
IT .
S .
WHAT S WRONG WITH FAMILIES .
THAT S RIGHT .
IT .
S .
WHAT S WRONG WITH FAMILIES AND IF IF CHILDREN COME TO SCHOOL .
AND SOCIETY IN GENERAL .
YES INSECURE AND THEIR MO BIGGEST CONCERN IS SURVIVAL .
RIGHT .
BOTH AT HOME THEY DO NT KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT AT HOME .
THEY DO NT FEEL SECURE THERE THEY DO NT KNOW WHAT S GOING TO HAPPEN JUST OUT FRONT OF THEIR APARTMENT COMPLEX .
RIGHT .
FOR EXAMPLE .
THAT CHILD .
THAT WAS SHOT .
RIGHT .
UH HOW CAN THEY CONCENTRATE ON SCHOOLING .
I AGREE .
RIGHT .
WITH YOU I THINK THAT S THE MAIN PROBLEM .
YEAH .
AND SCHOOL S NOW ARE SUPPOSED TO SOLVE SOCIAL PROBLEMS UH MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS .
HUH .
AS WELL AS EDUCATE THE KIDS AND TRY TO PROVIDE THEM WITH SOME SECURITY .
YEAH .
AND THAT S OVERWHELMING .
WELL WE VE GOT UH YOU KNOW AT OUR SCHOOL .
WE HAVE OVER A THOUSAND ELEMENTARY KIDS AND LAST YEAR WAS THE FIRST YEAR THAT WE EVER HAD MORE THAN ONE COUNSELOR .
AND THAT S JUST REALLY NOT ENOUGH .
NO .
IT IS NT .
AND I WAS TALKING TO SOMEBODY .
THAT TEACHES IN A MIDDLE SCHOOL AND THEY SAID OH BUT WE NEED MORE IN THE MIDDLE SCHOOL BECAUSE THAT S WHEN KIDS ARE YOU KNOW AT A TOUGHER AND ROUGHER AGE AND ALL THAT .
BUT YOU KNOW PART OF MY FEELING IS THAT IF YOU SOLVE HELP THEM TO WORK THROUGH THEIR PROBLEMS WHILE THEY RE LITTLER THEN THEY WO NT HAVE AS MANY PROBLEMS UP THERE .
TRUE .
I THINK THEY THERE HAS TO BE AT LEAST A COUNSELOR AND WE JUST RECENTLY HAD A COUNSELOR AT ELEMENTARY .
WE DID NT EVEN HAVE COUNSELORS IN ELEMENTARY .
REALLY .
WE HAVE ALWAYS THOUGH HAD THREE AT MIDDLE SCHOOLS BECAUSE WE HAD ABOUT A THOUSAND KIDS AND THEY DIVIDED THEM UP BETWEEN THREE COUNSELORS BUT FOR A GOOD WHILE EVERY YEAR .
THEY D HAVE A DIFFERENT COUNSELOR AND THEY DECIDED THAT DID NT WORK .
YEAH .
SO THEY STARTED UH DIVIDING THE KIDS UP SO THAT A COUNSELOR STAYS WITH HER GROUP OF COUNSELEES .
UHHUH .
THEY .
THROUGH .
THEY DO THAT HERE .
YOU KNOW THROUGH ALL THREE YEARS OF MIDDLE SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK THAT WOULD GIVE THEM MORE SECURITY IN GOING TO THE COUNSELOR .
UHHUH .
IF THEY HAVE A RAPPORT WITH THEIR COUNSELOR .
NOW IF THEY DO NT .
I HOPE THEY HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE .
TO CHANGE YEAH .
A CHILD .
THAT REALLY IS IN NEED OF COUNSELING HELP IF THEY ABSOLUTELY REFUSE TO WORK WITH THEM .
AND OCCASIONALLY THAT HAPPENS .
RIGHT .
BUT IT IS FRIGHTENING B .
YES IT CERTAINLY IS .
BECAUSE UH EDUCATION IS THE KEY TO OUR FUTURE AND UH IF WE HAVE CHILDREN .
WHO ARE NOT GETTING THEIR EDUCATION FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER THEN WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH THEM .
YEAH .
THAT S RIGHT .
WHAT S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THEM .
ARE THEY GOING TO BE ABLE TO UH WORK AT OTHER KIND OF MENIAL JOBS OR ARE THEY GOING TO BE THE THIEVES AND THE PEOPLE .
YEAH .
IN PRISON .
AND OUR PRISONS ARE FILLING UP FASTER THEN WE CAN BUILD THEM .
RIGHT .
THAT S NO GOOD .
I M ON THAT UM CAMPUS STRATEGIC PLANNING COMMITTEE FOR MY SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
AND UH ONE OF THE UH YOU KNOW OH THEY HAVE ALL THESE DIFFERENT NAMES FOR THINGS STRATEGIES AND ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS .
BUT ANYWAY ONE OF THE KEY THINGS WAS THAT THAT WE BELIEVED THAT THE PUBLIC EDUCATION IS THE BEST ECONOMIC VALUE .
THEN I THINK THEY DECIDED TO STRIKE ECONOMIC .
UHHUH .
ANYWAY YOU KNOW THE POINT WAS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PUBLIC EDUCATION FAILS .
YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
WILL THEN PEOPLE GO TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS .
YOU KNOW WELL WHAT KIND OF A SITUATION DO THEY GET THERE AND WHAT ARE YOU KNOW AND WHAT KIND OF STATE ARE WE IN IF IF MOST PEOPLE ARE GOING TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS .
WELL I THINK UH ONE THING THAT WE LL SEE IS THAT WE WO NT BE EDUCATING EVERYBODY .
RIGHT .
THERE WILL BE A LOT OF PEOPLE .
WHO WILL NOT GET EVEN A MENIAL EDUCATION LIKE IN OTHER COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD .
RIGHT .
WHERE THEY DO NT TRY TO EDUCATE EVERYONE .
UHHUH .
THAT S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO .
WE TRY TO EDUCATE EVERYONE .
THAT S RIGHT .
THAT S RIGHT .
WE RE THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD .
THAT DOES .
UHHUH .
UHHUH .
AND LET EVERYONE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REACH HIGHER EDUCATION .
UHHUH .
IF THEY RE WILLING YOU KNOW TO WORK .
YEAH .
AND HAVE UH SOME ABILITY .
THEY CAN DO THAT .
AND ONE OF THE PLANO SCHOOL DISTRICT S YOU KNOW GOALS IS THAT THEY WILL GRADUATE EVERY CHILD THAT UH THAT IS HERE IN THE NINTH GRADE I BELIEVE .
UHHUH .
IT .
S .
SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT S WORDED .
AND UH I DO NT KNOW .
WELL YOU KNOW IF WE CAN KEEP THEM IN SCHOOL .
RIGHT .
UHHUH .
THAT S .
THEN THAT THAT HELPS A LOT .
SO IMPORTANT .
I THINK THE GANG VIOLENCE IS SCARING EVERYONE TO DEATH TOO .
OH GOSH .
WELL THAT NEW MOVIE .
IT S SCARY TO ME .
THAT NEW MOVIE OUT I UM REALLY .
I .
REALLY A FRIGHTENING SITUATION .
I GUESS WE RE BOTH LUCKY .
WE ARE .
TO BE IN SITUATIONS AND SCHOOLS WHERE WE DO NT SEE THAT .
MY FOLKS TALK ABOUT IT .
A LOT IN ILLINOIS .
MY MOTHER WAS IS WAS TEACHER FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND UH THEY LIVE IN PEORIA ILLINOIS AND THEIR TALKING A LOT ABOUT THE YOU KNOW THE SCHOOL SITUATION THERE TOO .
SO WELL SHALL WE WRAP IT UP .
UH I WOULD IMAGINE THAT WE VE TALKED THE AMOUNT OF TIME NECESSARY .
I THINK WE HAVE TO .
OKAY .
SO I LL SEE YOU WHEN WE SEE YOU .
ALRIGHT .
WE WERE IN UH AUSTIN YESTERDAY .
UHHUH .
THE REASON THAT I WAS NT AT CHURCH AND WE WENT TO HEAR UH JAMES WIND ENSEMBLE CONCERT .
OH .
THEY LEFT THIS MORNING FOR UH ENGLAND .
OH HOW EXCITING .
IS NT THAT WONDERFUL .
OH THAT IS WONDERFUL .
UHHUH .
WHAT .
AN EXPERIENCE .
AND UH THE UNIVERSITY .
OKAY HOWARD WHAT DO YOU THINK OF OUR SPACE BUDGET AND SHOULD WE GO AHEAD AND AND KEEP EXPLORING OR SHOULD WE CALL A HALT TO IT IS IT DOING ANY GOOD .
I THINK THAT THE SPACE PROGRAM HAS DONE A LOT OF GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY NOW I THINK WHAT WE MADE A MAJOR WRONG TURN WHEN WE WENT INTO THE UH TO THE CURRENT GENERATION OF SPACE CRAFT THE REUSABLE ONES LIKE THEY ARE NOW .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT PROVEN AS RELIABLE AS THEY SHOULD HAVE AND I THINK SOME OF THE EARLIER APPROACHES WERE MUCH MORE UH MUCH BETTER IN MANY WAYS HOWEVER UH YOU KNOW WE VE GAINED AN AWFUL LOT FROM THE SPACE PROGRAM ALL THE WAY FROM REMOTE MONITORING TO TEFLON TO UH SOME NEW SPACE AGE MATERIALS PLASTICS AND ALL THAT SO I THINK IT S BEEN A GOOD INVESTMENT UH SOMEBODY WAS TELLING ME THE RETURN WAS ABOUT TWENTYFIVE OR THIRTY DOLLARS FOR EVERY DOLLAR SPENT .
OH REALLY .
WHICH IS AMAZING FOR ANY GOVERNMENTAL FINANCED .
OH YES .
PROGRAM .
WISH OUR POST OFFICE COULD DO THAT .
I WISH THE POST OFFICE WOULD JUST STOP RAISING OUR RATES .
THAT S RIGHT I WISH THEY D JUST DELIVER STUFF .
I THINK THOUGH THAT NOW THAT WE RE FINALLY STARTING TO GET OVER THE FEARS AND THE UH OH I DO NT KNOW THE GUILT THAT WE HAD OUT OF UH CHALLENGER I THINK MAYBE WE CAN .
UHHUH .
PICK UP AND GO ON NOW BUT I I DO NT KNOW I DO NT THINK WE REALLY HAVE ALL OF OUR ACT TOGETHER YET AS FAR AS CLEAR OBJECTIVES .
I AGREE .
THE SPACE STATION S WHERE WE SHOULD GO .
I AGREE .
AT THIS POINT .
SEEMS LIKE THAT WE VE KIND OF GOTTEN SIDE TRACKED WITH PUTTING ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS UP THERE TO MONITOR AND YOU KNOW YOU KNOW AND I M IN FAVOR OF YOU KNOW GETTING CLOSER TO SEEING CERTAIN THINGS BUT I D LIKE TO SEE THEM ALSO GO YOU KNOW GO BACK UP THERE SEE YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CAN DO SEE ABOUT SETTING A SPACE STATION UP I M ALL IN FAVOR OF THE SPACE PROGRAM AND I DO NT THINK WE SHOULD STOP AND I DO NT THINK WE SHOULD CUT THE MONEY .
WELL WHERE DO YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO GO WITH IT .
UH .
YOU TALKING ABOUT UH UH A FULLY MANNED SPACE STATION THAT WE LL KEEP UP THERE .
YEAH I WOULD LIKE I D LIKE TO SEE THAT I D LIKE FOR US TO REALLY FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE ACTUAL UNIVERSE AND GET UP THERE AND SEE WHAT S GOING ON EVEN IF YOU KNOW THERE S NO LIFE UP THERE OR ANYTHING YOU KNOW BUT WHO KNOWS AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
WELL .
I I HATE TO SEE THEM JUST YOU KNOW KEEP GETTING DIVERTED OFF TO SPYING ON OTHER NATIONS AND PUTTING UP DEFENSE THINGS AND I THINK THEY I THINK THEY LOSE SIGHT OF OF PROBABLY WHAT THEY RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING .
WELL I THINK ABOUT HALF THE NATIONS NOW ARE ARE MILITARY RELATED ARE THEY NOT .
YES YES .
AND UH .
I BELIEVE THEY ARE .
IT SEEMS LIKE IT S THAT HIGH A PERCENTAGE .
YOU KNOW LET S GO BACK TO OUR ORIGINAL THING WITH YOU KNOW OUR EXPERIMENTS AND ALL THE YOU KNOW OUR ACTUAL EXPLORING OF SPACE AND AND ALL THAT AND YOU KNOW WITH WITH RUSSIA UH SEEMINGLY NOT GOING TO BE AS BIG A THREAT .

UHHUH .
YOU KNOW TOO EASY EITHER IT WAS LIKE .
WELL YOU LEARN A LOT OF UM SKILLS TOO AND I THINK YOU RE MORE RECEPTIVE WHEN YOU RE YOUNGER THAN WHEN YOU RE OLDER TO LEARN NEW SKILLS .
THAT S TRUE .
AND I THINK THEY REALLY IT REALLY PEN PENETRATES IN YOUR MEMORY YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO BECAUSE YOU REALLY HAVE A GREAT INTEREST IN IT .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE IT S SOMETHING YOU WERE NT FORCED TO DO .

WELL THAT S GOOD WELL WE UM LET S SEE THE ONLY OTHER PLACE I VE EVER VACATIONED WE D YOU KNOW GO ON CAMPING TRIPS UP TO TEXOMA AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
AND THEN I WENT TO ENGLAND .
OH THAT S EXCITING .
A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS A .
UHHUH .
STUDENT THERE AND SPENT UM A SEMESTER STUDYING ABROAD IN LONDON .
UHHUH .
AND THAT WAS A GREAT TIME BECAUSE IT S SO THAT S SUCH A NEAT PLACE AND IT S THERE S NOT A LANGUAGE BARRIER SO YOU DO NT I MEAN THERE THERE S A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE THERE S SOME OF THOSE ENGLISH WORDS THAT YOU JUST DO NT EXACTLY KNOW WHAT THEY MEAN AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE TROUBLE WRESTLING WITH THEIR ACCENTS BUT IT S IT WAS REALLY FUN I I I REALLY ENJOYED THAT I M PROBABLY GOING BACK THERE TO WORK .
UHHUH .

IT IT S REALLY NICE I WOULD I WOULD SPEND ALL MY TIME IN LONDON .
UHHUH .
OR MOST OF MY TIME AND THAT S IT WAS REALLY DIFFERENT BEING IN A BIG CITY BECAUSE I DO NT GET MUCH INTO URBAN YOU KNOW REALLY URBAN AREAS A LOT .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND IT WAS IT S REALLY IT S SORT OF A WEIRD LITTLE ANONYMOUS FEELING WHERE NO ONE KNOWS WHO YOU ARE AND YOU CAN SPEND A WHOLE DAY WITHOUT TALKING TO ANYONE WHICH I THOUGHT I WOULD JUST HATE BUT IT ENDED UP BEING KIND OF NICE BECAUSE YOU RE NOT ACCOUNTABLE TO ANYONE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
YOU COULD JUST KIND OF .
DO YOUR OWN THING .
KIND OF WALK AROUND AND OBSERVE .
YEAH .
I DID A LOT OF JUST GOING OUT BY MYSELF AND RIDING ON THE SUBWAY AND WATCHING PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
AND I HAD A GREAT TIME DOING THAT IT WAS REALLY INTERESTING .
THAT S WONDERFUL THERE S A LOT OUT THERE TO SEE .
YEAH I KNOW .
I LL SAY .
I KEEP WANTING TO GET UP TO I HAVE NT I HAVE NT BEEN ANYWHERE ELSE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES I HAVE NT BEEN TO MEXICO OR CANADA OR .
WELL I LIVED ACROSS THE STREET ALMOST FROM CANADA .
OH .

UHHUH .
THEN I I D LOVE TO GO SOMEWHERE IN ASIA BUT I D HAVE TO HAVE A TOUR GUIDE WITH ME TO .
OH YES ABSOLUTELY .
HELP WITH ALL THE LANGUAGE AND ALL THAT .
SURE SOMEBODY THAT KNOWS THEIR WAY AROUND .
SO YEAH THAT S WHY THAT S WHY ENGLAND WAS NICE EVEN WE TRAVELED IN EUROPE FOR ABOUT A WEEK AND THAT WAS EVEN NICE BECAUSE THERE WAS NT UH THE MOST THE PLACES WE WENT WE WENT TO GERMANY AND SWITZERLAND AND .
WELL YOU VE BEEN QUITE A FEW PLACES THERE .
YEAH WE HAVE WE MUMBLEX .
ONCE YOU THINK ABOUT IT HUH .
WE DID WE WHIRLWINDED THROUGH .
UHHUH .
EUROPE IT WAS JUST INSANE TWELVE DAYS WHERE WE D JUST STOP LIKE A CITY A DAY AND YOU SLEPT ON THE TRAIN AT NIGHT .
OH THAT S GREAT .
BUT THERE WAS NT A IT WAS STRANGE IT WAS KIND OF SAD THERE WAS NT EVER A LANGUAGE PROBLEM THERE BECAUSE EVERYONE IN GERMANY KNEW ENGLISH AND EVERYONE IN SWITZERLAND .
UHHUH .
KNEW ENGLISH .
THAT S GREAT .
SO WE WERE KIND OF PITIFUL WE FOUND ONE RESTAURANT WE WERE IN AND GOT SEATED AND THEN NO ONE KNEW ENGLISH IN THERE AND WE WERE JUST .
UHHUH .
FINALLY HAD TO BREAK OUT THE PHRASE BOOK AND START LOOKING UP THINGS BUT IT WAS .
WHAT DID YOU WIND UP WITH .
OH I HAD FONDUE THAT WAS EASY TO SAY .
OH OKAY .
TRIED TO GET FONDUE AND WHITE WINE AND THAT WAS .
UH UHHUH .
WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE THAT PRETTY PRETTY EFFORTLESSLY THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE AT THE NEXT TABLE WHO SPOKE ENGLISH SO WE .
THEY KIND OF GUIDED YOU .
ELICITED THEIR AID FOR A WHILE AND .
UHHUH .
THEY WERE VERY HELPFUL SO .
WELL GOOD .
IT WAS IT WAS A PLEASANT TIME I D I D LOVE TO GO BACK THERE THERE S JUST NOT TIME THERE S NOT ENOUGH TIME TO GO SEE EVERYTHING AND THEN TO AFFORD TO SEE EVERYTHING .
I GUESS THAT S WHY WE NEED TO PLAN FOR RETIREMENT SO WHEN WE DO HAVE THE FREE TIME WE LL HAVE THE THE MEANS TO UH PURSUE OUR DREAMS .

THANK YOU .
GOODBYE .
BYEBYE .
JAY UM MY KIDS ARE ARE BOTH IN COLLEGE UM AND I D I PLAYED A FAIRLY ACTIVE PART IN HELPING THEM DECIDE WHERE TO GO ON THE OTHER HAND THEY REALLY DECIDED THEMSELVES .
UHHUH .
UM WHAT WHAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE DID YOU HAVE .
WELL I UH ONE GIRL WENT IN IN STATE AND HAS GRADUATED AND THEN UH THAT WAS UH YOU KNOW THAT WAS HER CHOICE PRETTY MUCH WHERE SHE WANTED TO GO .
UHHUH .
AND I HAVE UH ONE OUT OF TWO OUT OF STATE BOTH IN MISSOURI AND UM I TEACH UH IN A COLLEGE AND SO I THEY HAD HEARD ME TALK ABOUT IT AND FOR YEARS THAT I DID NT THINK IT REALLY MADE TOO MUCH DIFFERENCE WHERE THEY WENT FOR THEIR UNDERGRADUATE UH SO THAT WAS .
UM .
PRETTY MUCH UH .
I SEE WELL I MAY MAYBE I M WRONG BUT I THINK IT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF FINDING A SCHOOL THAT IS SORT OF RIGHT FOR THE CHILD IN TERMS OF HIS OR HER HAPPINESS AND .
OH OH IF THEY IF THEY RE CONTENT THERE .
AND AND THE APPROPRIATE SUPPORT ENVIRONMENT AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
I MEAN AS FAR AS THE EDUCATION AS FAR AS LOOKING AT THE DEGREE AT THE END THAT UH IT S VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE IS PAID .
UHHUH .
TO IT WHERE YOU GET THAT BACHELOR S UH IF IT S A HALFWAY DECENT SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
THEY SHOULD BE HAPPY NATURALLY AND IF THEY CAN GET UH UM TWO OUT OF LET S SEE MY SON GOT A FULL TOTAL SCHOLARSHIPS .
UHHUH .
AND SO THERE S UH THERE S PLENTY OF SCHOLARSHIPS OUT THERE AND SO PEOPLE SHOULD BE ADVISED TO LOOK FOR THOSE AND UM .
DID DID YOU PLAY A A STRONG ROLE IN HELPING THEM PICK SCHOOLS OR .
UH .
DID YOU JUST SORT OF SAY LISTEN TO YOUR GUIDANCE COUNSELORS AND .
WELL THEY UH I WENT WE WENT AROUND MY SON WAS A GRADUATED FROM A JESUIT HIGH SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
AND SO HE HE WAS PRETTY MUCH LOOKING FOR A JESUIT UNIVERSITY AND SO THERE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THAT WAS LIMITED TO FIVE OR SIX DIFFERENT PLACES AND UM SO HE S IN SAINT LOUIS U AND I GUESS I PLAYED A ROLE IN THAT I I JUST SORT OF UH LET THEM UM YOU KNOW THEY D ALL BEEN UH .
YEAH .
PRETTY EFFICIENT AS FAR AS STUDIES AND UH SO I DID NT HAVE THAT MUCH TO DO THEY JUST UH .
YEAH .
THEY JUST KNEW THEY WANTED TO GO TO COLLEGE AND I YOU KNOW HELPED THEM GET THERE AS FAR AS .
YEAH .
TRAVELING WITH THEM TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT .
YEAH .
PLACES WE DID DO THAT AND I WOULD SUGGEST A PERSON ALWAYS GOES AND LOOKS AT THE SCHOOL BEFORE THEY SIGN UP .
YEAH I THINK THAT S A GREAT IDEA I MEAN THAT .
SOME PEOPLE DO NT DO IT AND THEN THEY GET THERE AND HATE IT OR WHATEVER SO .
RIGHT .
IF IT S POSSIBLE .
IT S IT SEEMED EXPENSIVE AT THE TIME YOU RE DOING IT BUT BUT THE .
RIGHT .
COMPARED TO THE THE TOTAL DECISION IT S NOTHING .
I THINK IN THE SHORT RUN IT IS EXPENSIVE IN THE LONG RUN IT S VERY UH REASONABLE .
YEAH .
IF THE PERSON MY DAUGHTER HAS BEEN IN IN MISSOURI FOR A SECOND YEAR NOW SHE S COMING HOME AT THE END OF THE SEMESTER .
UHHUH .
SO UH YOU KNOW SHE S ALREADY TWENTYONE SHE STARTED LATE SO THAT S YOU KNOW STRICTLY UP TO HER AND UH SHE LL FINISH DOWN HERE UH UH FINISH THIS YEAR DOWN HERE AND THEN DECIDE WHAT SHE S GOING TO DO NEXT YEAR .
YEAH .
IT LL SAVE ME A LOT OF MONEY BECAUSE I M NOT GOING TO HAVE TO PAY OUT OF STATE TUITION .
YEAH .
BUT AGAIN THAT S HER DECISION .
RIGHT .
SO UH BUT I HAVE SO MANY STUDENTS IN MY CLASSES THAT HAVE DROPPED OUT AND COME BACK AND THEY RE MUCH BETTER STUDENTS AT TWENTYFIVE TWENTYSIX MAY TWENTYEIGHT SO YOU KNOW I DO NT I NEVER HAVE PUSHED THEM I JUST SAY THAT EDUCATION IS IMPORTANT YOU SHOULD DO IT UH BUT UH THEY HAVE TO DO THE WORK .
YEAH .
SO UH .
YEAH WELL BACK BACK TO THIS VISITING THING I MEAN I FOUND THAT MY KIDS HAD NO CONCEPTION WHAT COLLEGE WAS REALLY LIKE .
RIGHT .
AND AND THAT THE PROCESS OF GOING AROUND TO A FEW SCHOOLS WITH THEM REALLY HELPED THEM UNDERSTAND .
YEAH .
AND BEING ABLE TO GO WITH THEM TO SO AT LEAST SOME OF THEM .
OH I THINK SO .
GAVE ME A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN THINGS TO THEM AND TO UH IN REFERENCE TO WHAT WE HAD SEEN .
AND ALSO I M OPPOSED TO THE TO THE SIZE THEY VE JUST GOTTEN SO HUGE AND SO MY DAUGHTER FIRST LOOKED AT A PLACE THAT WAS FORTY THOUSAND SEE THAT S JUST TOO MANY .
GOOD GRIEF .
ENDED UP GOING TO WHERE I USED TO GO AND THAT WAS TWENTYFIVE HUNDRED WHEN I WENT THERE IT S TWENTYONE THOUSAND NOW IT S TOO BIG .
GOOD GRIEF .
SO .
WHAT IS TWENTYONE THOUSAND .
PARDON .
WHAT SCHOOL IS THAT .
IT S SOUTHWEST MISSOURI STATE UNIVERSITY .
UHHUH .
AND UH IT WAS TWENTYFIVE HUNDRED WHEN I WENT THERE FORTY YEARS AGO AND UH MY SON S IN A SCHOOL ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND AND THAT S THAT S NOT BAD .
UHHUH .
I TEACH IN A SCHOOL ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND AND THAT S THAT S EVEN A LITTLE LARGE .
YES .
BUT IT S MUCH BETTER THAN TWENTYONE THOUSAND BUT THEY DO HAVE TO VISIT AND IF IF THE PARENT CAN POINT OUT ALL THE DIFFERENT PLACES TO LOOK FOR .
UHHUH .
FOR SCHOLARSHIPS AND THEN OH THOSE RATING UH THE MAGAZINES AND ALL THOSE THINGS ARE DOING THE RATINGS NOW AND EVERYTHING I DO NT THINK IT HURTS TO LOOK AT THEM .
YES .
I DO NT PUT THAT MUCH STOCK IN THEM BUT .
UHHUH .
PROBABLY FINE JUST TO COMPARE .
HELPS TO AT LEAST SET UP .
RIGHT .
RANGE OF THINGS TO LOOK AT .
IF THEY YOU KNOW UH THEY NEED TO .
OKAY LEE TELL ME ABOUT YOUR IDEAS ON THIS UH THE U S GOVERNMENT SUPPORTING HEALTH INSURANCE AND SO FORTH .
WELL I THINK IT S INEVITABLE THAT WE ARE GOING TO SEE NATIONAL HEALTH CARE AND THE REASON IS BECAUSE THE MARKET PLACE DOES NT SEEM TO HAVE PERFORMED ADEQUATELY UH THE INVISIBLE HAND THAT WHICH ADAM SMITH WROTE HAS UH PROVIDED SOME VERY GOOD HEALTH CARE AND UH MUCH I THINK INADEQUATE HEALTH CARE UH AND IN SOME CASES THE ABSENCE OF HEALTH CARE HAS RESULTED FROM MARKET PLACE FORCES AND I THINK UH IT S INEVITABLE IT IS JUST A MATTER OF UH TIME AND MISTAKES AND THEY RE BOTH INEVITABLE .
WELL WHAT IS THIS GOING TO DO THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WHO ARE SUPPORTING THIS WORK NOW AND HOPEFULLY ARE DOING UH A GOOD JOB .
WELL IT S GOING TO MAKE IT TOUGH FOR THEM AND IT S GOING TO BE A DIFFICULT TRANSITION I DO NT KNOW UH HOW IT S GOING TO UH PLAY OUT IN TERMS OF THE PARTICULARS BUT I DO NT THINK THAT SOCIETY WILL BE WILLING TO TOLERATE THE CURRENT HEALTH CARE CRISIS FOR TOO LONG OUR UH PHYSICAL AND MENTAL AND SPIRITUAL HEALTH UH IT S REALLY UH VERY COSTLY .
YES .
AND UH AS A SOCIETY WE ARE PAYING A STAGGERING PRICE FOR THIS .
WELL .
MY .
THIS IS WHAT S BOTHERING ME LEE ANOTHER QUESTION DO YOU THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOME CONTROL UH INNOVATED SUCH THAT THE DOCTORS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO CHARGE RIDICULOUSLY OVER PRICED THINGS WE REALIZE THAT FOR THE INDIVIDUAL PERSON SOME THINGS ARE VERY IMPORTANT UH MATTER OF FACT IN SOME RESPECTS THEIR LIFE MIGHT DEPEND ON IT .
RIGHT .
BUT BY THE SAME TOKEN SOME OF THESE CHARGES THEY MAKE FOR WELL MINOR ENDEAVORS SHALL WE SAY .
UHHUH YEAH .
ON THE PARTS THE DOCTORS ARE REALLY OUT OF LINE .
YEAH THERE ARE ABUS .
THERE SHOULD BE SOME CONTROL OF THAT .
THEY RE ABUSIVE OF PRIVILEGES .
YES AND THAT IS WHAT IS GIVING THE LOCAL UH INSURANCE COMPANIES HARD TIMES THAT IS THE ONE THING WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER ARE THESE CHARGES THAT HAPPEN WHEN YOU GO TO HOSPITALS AND YOU GET SOMETHING DONE AND THEY WANT TO CHARGE TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR IT .
RIGHT WELL THIS I THINK IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT NATIONAL HEALTH CARE OF SOME SORT OF EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS OVER THE NEXT TEN OR TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS WILL ADDRESS BECAUSE I KNOW THIS IS ADDRESSED BY UH IN CANADA I I HAVE A GOOD FRIEND WHO IS UH A PHYSICIAN PRACTICING IN CANADA AND THEY MADE THE TRANSITION UH AND I THINK THAT THE UH FOR EXAMPLE THE DUPLICATION OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGERIES .
YES .
UH .
WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL OF THEM MY WIFE AND I BOTH HAVE HAD THAT RECENTLY .
I VE I VE HAD ONE MYSELF AND UH THEY RE WONDERFUL TECHNOLOGY BUT CITIES HAVE THREE OR FOUR MORE THAN THEY NEED OR THREE OR FOUR TIMES THE NUMBER THEY NEED SO I THINK THAT WHAT THE MARKET PLACE DOES NT DO BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE SYSTEM HAS WORKED AND IT DOES NT ALLOCATE RESOURCES OFTENLY BECAUSE THERE IS A TENDENCY UH AT LEAST THERE HAS BEEN A TENDENCY TO DRIVE UP THE PRICE OF MEDICAL CARE PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES COULD PASS ON THE BILLS BUT IT S BEGUN TO CHANGE ALL OF THAT THE PEOPLE PAYING THE BILLS UH EMPLOYERS ULTIMATELY HAVE BEGUN TO SQUAWK BECAUSE THEY HAVE SEEN THEIR HEALTH CARE COST RISE TWO HUNDRED PERCENT IN THE PAST TEN YEARS .
YEAH .
SO I THINK THE EVOLUTION WILL BE INTERESTING UH HAWAII HAS A SYSTEM THAT IS APPARENTLY WORKING AND UH IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW HOW UH MUCH MORE ATTENTION WE PAY TO THAT I DO THINK THOUGH THAT IT IS INEVITABLE PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE PAIN UH THAT PEOPLE ARE FEELING UH UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES UH I BELIEVE THAT IT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD AT THIS POINT CALL NATIONAL HEALTH CARE WHETHER IT S SUBSIDIZED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND AND OPERATED BY PRIVATE INSURERS UH I DO NT KNOW I LIKE THAT IDEA I TEND TO BE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVES THE MARKET PLACE CAN UNDER VARIED CIRCUMSTANCES WITH THE PROFIT INCENTIVE WORK VERY VERY WELL UH I WE WOULD BE A LOT BETTER OFF IF WE IF WE CONTRACTED OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE TO A GROUP WHO RATHER THAT OPERATED AS A GOVERNMENT ENTITY BECAUSE WE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE MUCH LESS WASTE .
SEE THAT THAT BOTHERS ME ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT SEE UH MY .
WELL THAT S THAT S THE PROBLEM WITH GOVERNMENT UH ADMINISTRATION OF THESE PROGRAMS AND THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE AS SOCIETY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE IN THIS REGARD .
DO YOU THINK THAT THAT THESE INSURANCE THINGS SHOULD BE COVERED ON A STATE BASIS OR U S GOVERNMENT BASIS .
YOU KNOW THAT IS REALLY A TOUGH ONE FOR ME TO ANSWER I DO NT UH I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE GREATEST IMPROVEMENT IN MANAGEMENT MY MY MY FIELD IS THE COGNITIVE SCIENCES AND I RECOGNIZE THAT A LOT OF THESE THINGS THAT ARE DONE ARE DONE UH AS A FUNCTION OF THE OPERATING SYSTEMS IN PLACE AND THOSE OPERATING SYSTEMS HAVE TO CHANGE AND AND AS WE BECOME MORE EFFICIENT IN DEVELOPING MACHINE OPERATING SYSTEMS WE RE GOING TO DEVELOP MORE EFFICIENT HUMAN OPERATING SYSTEMS AND SO A STATE OR FEDERAL APPLICATION UH COULD WORK UH IT ALL DEPENDS UPON THE WAY YOU STRUCTURE THE ENVIRONMENT WE MAY HAVE TO DEAL WITH .
DO YOU OR YOUR HUSBAND WORK FOR T I OR .
I M A CONTRACT PERSON AT T I .
OH ARE YOU .
IN FACT INVOLVED WITH UH DATA SWITCHBOARD .
OH I SEE WELL THAT S NEAT .
AND UH DO YOU WORK FOR T I .

OKAY DID YOU WANT ME TO GO AHEAD .
I LL LET YOU GO AHEAD AND START YEAH .
OKAY WELL ONE THING I I GUESS BOTH OF US ARE VERY MUCH AWARE OF THE EQUALITY UH IT SEEMS LIKE WOMEN ARE UH JUST STARTING TO REALLY GET SOME KIND OF EQUALITY NOT ONLY IN UH JOBS BUT IN THE HOME WHERE HUSBANDS ARE STARTING TO HELP OUT A LOT MORE THAN THEY EVER DID UH IT S NOT UNCOMMON TO SEE MEN DOING DISHES MAKING SUPPER OR TAKING CARE OF THE KIDS OR SOM UH THE GENERATION OF MY PARENTS AND MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER WHICH UH THEY DID EVERYTHING THEY WENT TO WORK AND THEY TOOK CARE OF THE FAMILY SO .
YOU KNOW I THINK THAT S CHANGED JUST IN THE LAST GENERATION .
EXACTLY .
JUST IN THE LAST LITTLE WHILE BECAUSE I KNOW MY FATHERINLAW DOES NT DO THAT MUCH .
EXACTLY YEAH .
OF THAT KIND OF STUFF BUT MY HUSBAND IS WONDERFUL .
YEAH THAT S THE WAY MY HUSBAND IS TOO I MEAN IT IT DOES NT UH DOES NT BOTHER HIM AT ALL TO DO THE DISHES .
YEAH .
IT DOES NT BOTHER H HIM AT ALL TO DO THE LAUNDRY VERSES UH MEN FROM WAY BACK THERE IS THAT WELL IF YOU DID THAT YOU WERE HENPECKED OR WHATEVER BUT .
YEAH YEAH .
MEN ARE STARTING .
THERE ARE STILL SOME THAT ARE NT COOPERATING BUT .
YEAH THOSE ARE VERY FEW I THINK THOSE MEN DO NT LAST VERY LONG IN RELATIONSHIPS BECAUSE I THINK WOMEN KNOW WHAT THEY WANT .
THEY RE NOT ACCEPTING THAT ANYMORE .
RIGHT EXACTLY .
YEAH .
AND IT S IT S HARD ENOUGH TO BE A WOMAN OUT THERE TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING UH YOU KNOW AND THEN KIND OF REAL LIGHT PAY THERE S JUST NO WAY THAT WE CAN BE HAPPY TRYING TO DO IT ALL SO IT S IT S KIND OF A UH NEAT THING TO SEE AS FAR AS EQUALITY IN THE HOUSEHOLDS AND I THINK THAT S EVEN GOING TO GET BETTER EVEN YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
EVEN MORE SO I THINK IT S JUST GOING TO BE WHERE MEN WILL DO AS MUCH CLEANING AS WOMEN DO AND THAT IT WO NT BE YOUR JOB DESCRIPTION INSTEAD OF YOUR ROLE DEFINITION IS THIS IT WILL BE UH HOPEFULLY FOR MY DAUGHTER WHO I INSTILL INTO IT DOES NT MATTER IF YOU WANT TO DRIVE A TRUCK HONEY OR IT DOES NT MATTER IF YOU WANT TO BE A NURSE IT DOES NT MATTER IF YOU WANT TO BE UH THE PRESIDENT OR IT DOES NT MATTER IF YOU WANT TO BE A LAWYER OR A DOCTOR IT DOES NT MATTER IT S WHAT YOU WANT TO BE SO I HAVE ALWAYS INSTILLED INTO HER AND I THINK MOTHERS UM ARE DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB IN RAISING THEIR DAUGHTERS TO SAY HEY YOU DO NT HAVE TO STAY WITH NURSING YOU DO NT HAVE TO BE A SECRETARY YOU DO NT HAVE TO BE YOU CAN BE WHATEVER YOU WANT TO BE WHETHER IT BE A WELDER OR TRUCKER OR WHATEVER .
YEAH .
AS LONG AS YOU UH GO TO SCHOOL FOR IT AND GET THE EDUCATION SO .
YEAH WELL I FEEL LIKE UM TO AN EXTENT THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THAT THAT UM IT IS IMPORTANT FOR WOMEN WHO NEED TO WORK .
UHHUH .
UH OR ARE IN A POSITION THAT THEY WANT TO .
IF THEY WANT TO RIGHT .
THAT THEY CAN DO THAT .
UHHUH .
UM BUT I ALSO THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO BE WITH THE CHILDREN .
I DO TOO .
I .
YOU KNOW THERE S A CERTAIN PART OF ME .
I THINK THERE THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WOMEN JUST ARE DESIGNED TO DO BETTER THAN MEN .
UHHUH .
AND THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT MEN ARE DESIGNED TO DO BETTER THAN WOMEN .
YEAH .
I DO NT THINK IT SHOULD EVER BE TOTALLY EQUAL .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW THAT S NOT UH WE RE NOT MADE LIKE THAT .
WELL EMOTIONALLY I THINK UH .
THAT S RIGHT .
WOMEN DO A LITTLE BIT UH I I THINK THAT S THE GAP IS COMING CLOSER A AS UM WHAT I VE LEARNED IN UH JUST JUST BEING OUT THERE IT SEEMS THAT MEN ARE NOW STARTING TO GET INTO GROUPS CALLED MEN S GATHERINGS AND THEY GET TOGETHER AND THEY TALK ABOUT ISSUES OF MARRIAGE TALK ABOUT MANHOOD TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY DID NT HAVE WITH THEIR FATHERS .
HUH .
ARE EXPRESSING MORE EMOTIONS LEARNING WHAT EMOTIONS ARE IT MAY BE IN THE FUTURE THAT MEN YOU KNOW SOME MEN MAY BE BETTER PARENT OR MOTHERS THAN MOTHERS THEMSELVES UM .
YEAH .
I I KNOW OF SOME MOTHERS THAT I I GUESS I D RATHER BE WITH THE FATHER BECAUSE THE FATHER IS MAYBE MORE UNDERSTANDING MORE UM LOW KEY MORE APT TO BE A BETTER FATHER THAN SOME MOTHERS THAT I HAVE SEEN THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED YOU KNOW TO DEVELOP WHATEVER SKILLS THAT THEY HAVE AND SOME OF THE MEN ARE DEVELOPING UH VERY GOOD TOO SO .
YEAH .
IT MAY COME DOWN TO WHERE IT S IT S INDIVIDUAL BASIS WHERE EVERYBODY IS TREATED AN AS INDIVIDUAL .
YEAH .
AND NOT BY SEX IF YOU WANT TO STAY HOME AND TAKE CARE OF THE KIDS HONEY THAT S FINE I WILL GO OUT AND MAKE THE UH TAKE CARE OF THE UH MONEY MAKING AND IT IT WOULD NT MATTER IF IT S A WOMAN OR A MAN SAYING THAT .
ONE OF THE FRUSTRATIONS THAT I HAVE WITH THE WAY THINGS HAVE DEVELOPED IS THAT AND FOR SOME IT S NOT A PROBLEM BUT THERE S MORE AND MORE IT S DIFFICULT FOR A FAMILY TO MAKE A LIVING ON ONE .
ON ONE INCOME UHHUH .
INCOME IT CAN BE DONE .
YEAH .
BUT YOU MAKE SACRIFICES .
YEAH THAT .
YOU KNOW AND AND IT S UM .
KIND OF LIKE WHAT UH MY HUSBAND AND MYSELF ARE DOING RIGHT NOW MY DAUGHTER S THREE EVEN THOUGH AT THIS CURRENT TIME SHE S READY TO GET INVOLVED WITH SHE S AN ONLY CHILD I DO NT KNOW .
YEAH .
IF YOU VE ONLY GOT ONE .
WELL THIS IS AN UNUSUAL TOPIC .
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT .
YEAH I AT FIRST .
I IT TOOK EIGHT TIMES TO FIND YOU SO I TOLD MY HUSBAND UH YOU KNOW WHAT SHOULD I SAY AND THEN HE REMINDED ME BUT UH UH HI IN HIS FAMILY UH WHAT .
THEY USUALLY DO ON HIS DAD S SIDE HIS MOM OR UH THE AUNTS WILL SEND OUT LITTLE POSTCARDS LIKE TWO OR THREE WEEKS BEFORE REMINDING EVERYONE WHERE THE THE WHERE TO MEET AND YOU KNOW JUST TO BRING ANYTHING AND SO THEY JUST NOTIFY EVERYONE BY MAIL AND THEN THEY JUST MEET AT LIKE A PARK OR SOMETHING TO HAVE LIKE A A SHORT UH OR A SMALL UH DINNER TYPE THING .
WELL THAT SOUNDS GREAT ELLEN .
HOW FAR AWAY DO THEY COME FROM .
UH THEY COME FROM WELL THEY .
ALL MEET IN PORTLAND AND THEY COME AS FAR AS OH SEATTLE AND AND SOMETIMES WE VE GONE AND WE WERE F WE WERE LIVING IN UTAH AT THE TIME .
OH OKAY .
AND UH THE HIS HIS DAD S FAMILY IS ALL AROUND THE AREA AND HIS MOM S SIDE OF THE FAMILY THEY .
ALL UH HAVE THEIR FAMILY REUNIONS IN SOUTHERN UTAH AND PEOPLE WOULD COME FROM SEATTLE TO THERE AND UH LET S SEE NEVADA AND IN THAT AREA WASHINGTON AND NEVADA TO SOUTHERN UTAH AND THEY WOULD UH ASSIGN A DIFFERENT PERSON EACH TIME .
THEY HAD A REUNION .
THEY D ASSIGN A DIFFERENT PERSON TO BE IN CHARGE OF NOTIFYING EVERYBODY .
OH OKAY THAT MAKES SENSE .
NOBODY S OUT OF A LOT OF TROUBLE MORE THAN ONCE .
YEAH YEAH AND THE PEOPLE .
WHO ARE DOWN THERE LIKE THEY LL ASSIGN ONE PERSON IN THE UTAH AREA ONE PERSON IN THE WASHINGTON AREA AND THAT PERSON CAN CALL YOU KNOW BEFOREHAND AND JUST MAKE SURE EVERYONE KNOWS TOO .
UHHUH .
AND THEN THEY JUST SORT OF DO LIKE A LITTLE PROGRAM OR YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO .
YEAH .
THAT EVERYONE .
S SORT OF INVOLVED .
THAT S INTERESTING .
YOU SOUND LIKE YOU VE HAD A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH THIS THEN .
OH WELL THAT S MY HUSBAND S SIDE AND MY MOM MY MOM S OR MY FAMILY UH WE .
ALL LIVE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO WE JUST HAVE TO EITHER OR .
GIVE A FORMAL INVITE AND WE RE ALL THERE SO .
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA S STILL PRETTY LARGE .
YEAH WELL I MEAN L .
A ORANGE COUNTY AREA .
I MEAN .
I SEE .
EVERYONE S YOU KNOW .
MUMBLEX .
MOSTLY NOT FARTHER THAN AN HOUR AWAY .
YEAH WELL MY EXPERIENCE UH HAS BEEN LIMITED PRETTY MUCH LATELY TO MY MOTHER S SIDE OF THE FAMILY .
UHHUH .
UH YEARS AGO THERE WAS A BIG DISPUTE ON MY DAD S SIDE AND UH THEY HAVE NT HAD A REUNION SINCE THEN .
THEY JUST SHOW UP AT FUNERALS AND WEDDINGS .

WE HAD OUR OUR FIRST REAL REUNION THAT I VE EVER GONE TO LAST SUMMER AND THEY HAD PEOPLE COME IN FROM OUT OF TOWN AND THEY TOOK SOME ROOMS DOWN AT A HOLIDAY INN AND UH THEY HAD SOME ACTIVITY THEY HAD A NICE DINNER PLANNED AND ALL OF THAT STUFF AND PEOPLE GOT UP AND TALKED ABOUT VARIOUS PARTS OF THE FAMILY TREE AND YOU KNOW A LOT OF THAT SORT OF THING .
SINCE IT WAS THE FIRST ONE THAT WE D HAD THAT YOU COULD DO THAT ONCE .
NOW NEXT TIME .
WE HAVE ONE WE LL HAVE TO THINK OF SOMETHING MORE CREATIVE TO DO .
WELL YOU KNOW THAT S INTERESTING BECAUSE ONE THING .
THAT ALWAYS BRINGS TO MY UH HUSBAND S MOTHER S SIDE TOGETHER IS UH THEY TALK ABOUT THE GENEALOGY OF THE FAMILY TREE .

TYING IT IN WITH MY HUSBAND S BUSINESS TRIP AND I JUST SAVE VACATION FOR THINGS LIKE THAT .
OH THAT S .
AND UH JUST TRAVEL WHENEVER WE CAN .
WELL I REALLY I THINK TRAVEL WHEN I HEARD MY TOPIC TODAY I THOUGHT OKAY .

RIGHT .
AND REALLY AT OUR POINT OF LIFE OUR CHILDREN ARE GROWN AND UH IT HAS JUST WORKED OUT REALLY WELL WITH THIS UH POSITION .
HE S IN .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE I CAN GO AT A SPUR OF THE MOMENT OR WHAT HAVE YOU AND IT DEPENDS WHERE HE S GOING WHETHER OR NOT I DECIDE TO GO ALONG .
SURE .
BUT I DO DO LIKE TO TRAVEL AND IT S UH I DO NT MIND THE POOL LIFE AT ALL .
UHHUH .
DURING THE DAY .
AND I LIKE TO SIGHT SEE AND I LOVE TO SHOP .
UHHUH .
SO IT S .
SO THAT S PERFECT .
WHAT MORE COULD YOU ASK FOR .
THAT S RIGHT BUT IT .
AND THEN GOT TO PICK AND CHOOSE THE PLACES .
WELL AND ONE OF MY VERY FAVORITE IS LAS VEGAS .
OH .
UH THAT I WOULD HAVE TO SAY WE .
BOTH END UP GOING TO LAS VEGAS UH PROBABLY ONCE EVERY MAYBE YEAR AND A HALF .
UHHUH .
AND PRESENTLY WE HAVE QUITE A FEW FREQUENT FLYER MILES .
UHHUH .
AND SO I VE JUST REQUESTED THAT THEY SEND US .
TWO OF OUR COACH TICKETS BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF FLYING WITH CONTINENTAL .
UHHUH .
AND THEY RE RECOMMENDING THAT YOU USE THOSE BECAUSE THEY DO NT KNOW THE FUTURE OF CONTINENTAL .
RIGHT IT S KIND OF SHAKY .
AND I SAID NOW THAT WE HAVE ALL THE MILES WE BETTER START USING THEM .
THAT S TRUE .
UH .
IT REALLY IS .
SO WE ARE THINKING THAT WE MIGHT GO TO LAS VEGAS DURING THE WINTER .
THIS YEAR SOMETIME FOR JUST KIND OF A QUICK TRIP .
UH WHEN WE NORMALLY GO THAT WAY WE LIKE TO GO TO CALIFORNIA AT THE SAME TIME BECAUSE WE REALLY DO NT GET OUT THERE AS OFTEN AS YOU COULD PROBABLY .
UHHUH .
FROM TEXAS .
OUR LAST BIG TRIP WE DROVE THROUGH NEW MEXICO AND COLORADO AND WENT TO THE GRAND CANYON AND AND UH BACK THROUGH SILVERTON AND DURANGO AND OH IT WAS FUN .
IT WAS SO RELAXING AND A REALLY NEAT PART OF THE COUNTRY AND THE KIDS WERE OLD ENOUGH TO REALLY ENJOY IT .
OUR .
I THINK THAT S A GOOD TRIP .
UHHUH .
AND REALLY FOR THE CHILDREN TO LEARN AS WELL FOR A FAMILY VACATION .
THAT WOULD BE EXCELLENT .
RIGHT .
NOW WE DID WHAT .
WE SOMETIMES DO SINCE WE ARE IN OHIO AND IT TAKES A WHILE JUST TO EVEN GET TO THE WHAT .
I WOULD CALL THE MORE PICTURESQUE PART OF THE COUNTRY WE WILL FLY TO SOMETHING LIKE ONCE WE FLEW TO COLORADO TO DENVER AND THEN WE RENTED A CAR FOR TWO WEEKS AND WE WENT THROUGH THE NORTHERN ROUTE AND THROUGH UTAH .
UHHUH .
AND AS FAR WEST AS LAS VEGAS AND THEN WE RETURNED THROUGH UH NEW MEXICO THAT YOU JUST MENTIONED .
UHHUH .
AND IT WAS .
OH THERE S .
OH IT WAS JUST GREAT .
TOO MUCH TO SEE REALLY .
OH I I THINK THAT S THAT S THE WAY TO .
OKAY .
WHEN THEY FIRST SAID THE SUBJECT MY MIND WENT KIND OF BLANK .
I THOUGHT GEE I HAVE NT TAKEN ANYTHING BACK FOR A LONG TIME .
WELL I HAVE NT EITHER UH I I HATE RETURNING THINGS .
YEAH .
I MEAN I I HAVE A FRIEND .
WHO IF SHE LIKES SOMETHING IS NT SURE WHAT SIZE .
SOMEBODY MIGHT NEED WILL BUY IT IN EVERY COLOR AND SIZE AND YOU KNOW TAKE EVERYTHING BACK AGAIN .
YEAH .
IT S YOU KNOW IT S A GAME TO HER BUT I I DO NOT LIKE TO DO THAT .
I CONSIDER IT .
KIND OF A A WASTE OF MY TIME .
AND SO I M USUALLY UH PRETTY CAREFUL WHEN I SHOP .
UHHUH .
AND I ALSO YOU KNOW USUALLY HAVE HAVE CHECKED OVER THINGS YOU KNOW IF IT S LIKE AN APPLIANCE OR SOMETHING TO MAKE SURE UH IT HAS THE FEATURES IN IT THAT I WANT .
RIGHT .
NOW WE VE HAD ONE LATELY UM OH A UH A DUSTBUSTER PLUS .
UHHUH .
THAT WE BOUGHT AND WE VE HAD IT FOR A WHILE BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN .
IT JUST WAS NT WORKING AND IT LOOKS LIKE THERE S A PART MISSING FROM IT .
MY HUSBAND OPENED IT UP AND WHATEVER AND OF COURSE .
WE DO NT HAVE THE RECEIPT .
ANY MORE SO WE CA NT TAKE IT BACK .
OF COURSE UHHUH .
UH BUT I THINK A LOT OF GOODS ARE MADE NOT TO LAST REAL LONG .
RIGHT .
UH .
RIGHT JUST TO GET YOU BY FIVE YEARS AND THEN YOU LL THROW IT AWAY RATHER THAN HAVE IT FIXED .
YEAH .
WE RE WE RE A WASTEFUL SOCIETY FOR SURE .
WELL THAT S TRUE AND LOT OF TIMES THOUGH IT IS IT COSTS SO MUCH TO GET SOMETHING FIXED .
RIGHT .
THAT YOU ALMOST ARE JUST AS WELL OFF BUYING ANOTHER .
ONE .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW IF IT S .
AND YOU USUALLY GET WHAT .
YOU PAY FOR .
WE BOUGHT SOME WALKIETALKIES .
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO FOR CHRISTMAS AND THEY WERE LIKE TEN DOLLARS AND WE EXPECTED THEM TO WORK NICE FOR THE LITTLE KIDS AND THEY DID NT WORK .
UHHUH .
WORTH .
ANYTHING .
SO WE TOOK THOSE BACK AND THAT S ABOUT THAT ALL .
THAT WERE TAKEN BACK IN AGES .
WELL YEAH I THINK A LOT OF TIMES IF YOU GET A BRAND NAME .
YEAH .
UH YOU KNOW IF IT S A A GOOD BRAND I YOU I THINK THERE S THERE CAN BE A LEMON IN ANYTHING .
RIGHT .
BUT UH I THINK MORE OFTEN THAN NOT YOU YOU PRETTY WELL KNOW WHAT .
YOU RE GETTING AHEAD OF TIME AND UH .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW IF YOU BUY A GOOD ONE YOU SHOULD NT HAVE ANY YOU KNOW TOO MUCH OF A PROBLEM WITH IT I MEAN WE WE HAD A CAR ONCE THAT WE TRIED TO HAVE DECLARED A LEMON UNDER THE LEMON LAW .
OH REALLY .
WHICH IS .
IT S HARD .
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO DO .
WE NEVER COULD GET IT DECLARED A LEMON AND THE CAR WOULD GO AND WITHOUT ANY WARNING WHATSOEVER YOU COULD BE GOING DOWN THE FREEWAY AT SIXTY AND IT WOULD STOP .
OH WOW .
AND I THERE WAS JUST YOU KNOW AND OH WE WENT ROUND AND ROUND WITH THE MANUFACTURER AND AND EVERYTHING AND THEY GOT IT FINALLY SEMIFIXED BUT IT WAS SUCH A HASSLE .
UHHUH AND IT JUST PERTAINED TO THAT .
YEAH YEAH IT IT REALLY IS UH BUT GEE THIS IS OF ALL THE TOPICS I HAVE HAD I M DOING THIS THING THIS IS KIND OF THE STRANGEST ONE .
I AT FIRST .
I THOUGHT OF FOOD YOU KNOW BECAUSE THAT S WHAT MAINLY WHAT .
I BUY IT SEEMS LIKE AND UH YOU KNOW I STILL DO NT HAVE ANY ANYTHING TO DO THERE BUT .
UHHUH .
BUT I I THINK TOO A LOT OF PEOPLE DO NT BUY THEIR WARRANTIES EITHER BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT WHEN IT S THAT OLD THEY RE GOING TO BUY A NEW ONE SO .
WELL I THINK THAT S TRUE AND I UH NOW WE GENERALLY DO NT BUY A WARRANTY BECAUSE YOU THINK YOU KNOW AT LEAST FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS NOTHING SHOULD GO WRONG WITH IT .
YEAH MY HUSBAND IS REALLY GOOD AT FIXING THINGS TOO SO HE USUALLY BE ABLE TO FIX ANYTHING .
THAT S MINOR AND .
UHHUH .
AND THAT HAS SAVED US THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS YOU KNOW FROM MUMBLEX TO MECHANIC TO .
UHHUH .
ANYTHING LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
BUT BUT IT WAS INTERESTING TO I DO NT KNOW IF THEY RE MAKING THEM BETTER OR NOT I IT S HARD TO SAY .
SOME I THINK THEY MORE OF THEIR PARTS PLASTIC WHICH YOU KNOW MAKES THINGS BREAK EASIER BUT I THINK THE TECHNOLOGY IS BETTER .
YE I THINK TECHNOLOGY IS BETTER I M I M NOT SURE .
I THINK .
ABOUT QUALITY .
YOU VE GOT A GOOD POINT WITH THE PLASTIC AND THAT .
I DO NT THINK NECESSARILY THAT THINGS ARE BEING MADE BETTER .
RIGHT .
UH YOU KNOW I I EVERYTHING IS SO AUTOMATED UH AND THINGS CAN BE MADE WITHOUT I THINK .
YEAH .
A HUMAN HAND EVER TOUCHING IT YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
AN AWFUL LOT OF THINGS AND I THINK THAT CERTAINLY MAKES A DIFFERENCE FROM BACK FROM THE TIME WHEN SOMEBODY HANDCRAFTED SOMETHING AND YOU KNOW HAD SOME PRIDE IN IT .
RIGHT .
WELL PEOPLE ARE NT WILLING TO PAY THOSE PRICES VERY OFTEN SO YOU KNOW FOR A HANDCRAFTED SOMETHING SO .
WELL YEAH THAT S .
SO .
THAT S TRUE .
SO IF WE GET WHAT .
WE .
WHAT .
WE DESERVE .
YEAH WELL I I DO UH YOU KNOW CRAFT WORK AND SELL STUFF AT SHOWS AND THAT AND UH UH YOU KNOW IT S IT S IT S A REAL EYEOPENER AS FAR AS YOU KNOW WHY PEOPLE CHARGE WHAT .
THEY DO TO YOU KNOW .
OKAY .
WELL DO YOU EXERCISE REGULARLY .
THERE IS WELL I AM A SCHOOL TEACHER .
UHHUH .
AND US THERE IS UH UH GIRL .
THAT WENT THROUGH OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT I TEACH IN HIGHLAND PARK .

AND UH WE DO UH AEROBICS FOR OUR CARDIOVASCULAR FITNESS FOR THIRTY MINUTES AND THEN WE DO STRETCHING .
UHHUH .

SO IT IS AN HOUR .
AND THEN MY HUSBAND AND I TAKE UH TEN MILE WALKS UH AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE .
UHHUH .
AND UH NOT ON THE NIGHTS THAT I DO AEROBICS BUT IF IF HE WANTS TO HE JOGS BUT I UH I WE TAKE THE FAST WALKS AND WE WALK A COUPLE OF MILES AND THEN COME BACK TO THE HOUSE .
UHHUH .
AND SO WE WE TAKE IT SERIOUSLY .
WE ENJOY DOING IT .
MUMBLEX .
I ENJOY MY GROUP AT SCHOOL .
IT IS A LOT MORE FUN TO EXERCISE WITH SOMEBODY .
YEAH .
THAN IS IS TO DO IT BY YOURSELF .
UHHUH .
UH WELL I USE TO EXERCISE REGULARLY AND I HAVE NT LATELY .
OH OH .
I HAVE GOOFED OFF I GUESS .
UH I USE TO ALSO TAKE AN AEROBICS CLASS ABOUT THREE DAYS .
A WEEK BEFORE WORK .
UHHUH .
BUT UH I GUESS MY JOB CHANGE MY HUSBAND S JOB CHANGE AND IT IS JUST NOT EASY TO GET UP EARLY IN THE MORNING ANY MORE .
OH I UNDERSTAND THAT .
SO UH .
I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO DO IT BEFORE .
WELL THE PROBLEM IS THAT I AM SO TIRED AT THE END OF THE DAY I JUST WANT TO GO HOME AND NOT DO ANYTHING .
WELL I AND TOO .
I JUST MAKE MYSELF .
YEAH .
I GET UP AT FIVE THIRTY AND I AM AT SCHOOL AT SEVEN THIRTY .
OH .
SCHOOL IS NOT OVER UNTIL UH FOUR .
UHHUH .
AND OUR CLASS BUT IT IS IN THE BUILDING .
OH .
THAT IS THE BIG DIFFERENCE BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE AROUND THAT UH YOU HAD BETTER HURRY .
GO GET DRESSED .
YOU KNOW THERE IS MOTIVATION AROUND THERE AND THEN UH WE WE CAN CHANGE RIGHT THERE IN THE BUILDING .
I DO NT HAVE TO DRIVE AND FIGHT TRAFFIC AND GET ANYWHERE .
UHHUH .

UHHUH .
WHERE THEY OFFER AEROBICS AND I HAVE DONE THAT BEFORE BUT IT HAS ALWAYS HAD TO BE LATE AT NIGHT .

AFTER I HAVE GOT HOME AND AFTER DINNER AND YOU ARE JUST KIND OF GOING UGH .
AND I HAVE TRIED IT IMMEDIATELY AFTER SCHOOL LIKE TRY TO GET SOME PLACE AND EXERCISE FROM FIVE TO SIX BUT THEN BY THE TIME .
YOU GET HOME AND YOU GET DINNER .
YOU ARE EATING SO LATE .
THAT IS RIGHT .
THAT IS RIGHT .
THAT IS A MUMBLEX .

IT IS REALLY HARD WITH OUR LIFE STYLE WHEN YOU WORK TO .
UHHUH .
WELL I KNOW SOME PEOPLE GO DURING LUNCH BUT YOU KNOW BY THE TIME .
I GET OVER THE GYM AND AND GO FOR MY CLASS AND SHOWER AND GET BACK TO WORK IT IS PROBABLY TWO HOURS OR MORE .
UHHUH .
AND THAT IS JUST TOO LONG .
I HAVE TWENTYFIVE MINUTES FOR LUNCH .
YEAH .
THAT IS OUT FOR ME .
THAT DOES NT REALLY DO IT DOES IT .
NO I DO NT THINK SO .
YEAH .
BUT UH AND THEY ARE NICE BECAUSE IF WE ARE RUNNING LATE IT USUALLY UH IF THINGS ARE KIND OF HECTIC AT SCHOOL AND PEOPLE ARE RUNNING LATE THEY .
KIND OF WAIT ON US .
YOU KNOW CAUSE THEY KNOW WE ARE IN THE BUILDING AND COMING .
YEAH .
WHERE AS AT UH ANOTHER PLACE YOU ARE PAYING A LOT MORE MONEY AND UH IT DOES GOING TO START WHETHER YOU ARE THERE OR NOT .
THAT IS RIGHT .
THAT IS RIGHT .
SO THIS HAS WORKED OUT REAL NICELY .
IN FACT SHE CHARGES US .
TWO DOLLARS .
A SESSION .
WELL THAT IS NOT MUCH .
HUHUH .
SO IT S IT S WE LIKE PAY HER FOR SIX WEEKS AT A TIME .
UHHUH .
CAUSE THAT IS LIKE A UNIT IN UH UH SCHOOL .

EVERY SIX WEEKS .
OH .
THAT IS NOT BAD .
HUHUH .
IT BEATS MEMBERSHIPS AT SOME OF THESE CLUBS .
THAT IS FOR SURE .
YOU ARE NOT KIDDING .
THEY ARE REAL EXPENSIVE .
I KNOW .
WE BELONGED UH FOR A PERIOD OF TIME TO THE SIGNATURE CLUB FOR ABOUT A YEAR .
UHHUH .
I MEAN WE WERE PAYING A HUNDRED DOLLARS PLUS MONTH FOR OUR FAMILY MEMBERSHIP .
OH .
AND AT FIRST .
WE USED IT AND THEN IT GOT WHERE WE WERE NT BEGINNING TO GET OUT MONEY S WORTH .
YEAH .
AND THEY OFFERED LOTS OF THINGS BUT WE WERE NT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THEM BECAUSE WE DID NT HAVE THE TIME TO .
YEAH .
SO WE DECIDED TO FORGET THAT .
UHHUH .
THAT WAS JUST A WASTE OF OUR OUR MONEY .
YEAH .
YEAH .
WELL WE HAVE ONE THROUGH WORK AND ITS ITS PROBABLY ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS .
A YEAR .
WHICH IS BAD .
OH NO .
BUT I UH I DO NT KNOW I STILL JUST DO NT DO NT END UP GOING CAUSE .
IT IS NT AT A CONVENIENT TIME OR I DO NT KNOW SOMETHING BUT I NEED TO DO SOMETHING .
IF IF ITS ONLY WALK THE DOG OR SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
I NEED TO START DOING THAT .
IT DOES MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER .
THE HARD THING IS GETTING GOING .
THAT IS RIGHT .
AND IF YOU HAVE SOMEBODY .
WHO WILL DO IT WITH YOU LIKE FOR A LONG TIME MY HUSBAND DID NT WANT TO WALK CAUSE HE WANTS TO UH JOG .
UHHUH .
BUT HE DECIDED THAT UH MAYBE UH YOU KNOW .

I THINK THEY RE DOING THE IS AS MUCH RESEARCH AS THEY CAN POSSIBLY DO YOU KNOW .

UH IF IF WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE MONEY UH I D JUST HAVE TO SAY WHAT .
THEY RE SPENDING IS PROBABLY ENOUGH SIMPLY BECAUSE I DO NT KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT IT .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
I MEAN I I CAN SEE THAT RESEARCH IS NEEDED AND YOU KNOW .
OH YEAH .
DEFINITELY .
I THINK SO I THINK SO .
I MEAN IT S BECOMING A MAJOR PROBLEM .
YEAH .
BUT UH .
YEAH .
I GUESS THE AREA THAT I THINK MORE ABOUT IS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM FOCUS ON UH PREVENTING IT UH .
YEAH .
IN MORE .
WELL THAT S TRUE .
THAT S TRUE .
YOU KNOW .
BECAUSE UH IT S A SUCH AN EASILY PREVENTABLE DISEASE .
RIGHT AND I .
UH .
I FEEL LIKE JUST SAYING UH SAFE SEX IS NOT THE ANSWER .
IT .
S .
NO .
IT S UH .
IT S DEFINITELY NOT .
ABSTINENCE IN CERTAIN CASES AND .
THAT S TRUE THAT S TRUE .
YEAH .
UH .

MYSELF UH UH I M JUST RECENTLY OR ABOUT TO GET A DIVORCE .
UHHUH .
AND UH COURSE I M NOT ALL READY TO JUST RUN OUT THERE AND START DATING EVERYBODY .

YOU GOT TO THINK ABOUT THESE DAYS .
YEAH .
A SINGLE PERSON .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND UH I MEAN IT CERTAINLY CHANGED MY ATTITUDE ABOUT THAT .
YEAH .
IN A HURRY .
YEAH .
AND UH .
I THINK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE .
IT HAS .
CERTAINLY .
SO .
YEAH .
SO .
BUT UH UH I KNOW THAT UH IN SOME OF THESE LARGER CITIES THEY RE PASSING OUT FREE SYRINGES AND ALL OF THAT SORT OF THING .
UHHUH .
TO PREVENT YOU KNOW SO THAT UH THE DRUG ADDICTS .
DRUG ADDICTS .
WO NT BE .
UHHUH .
GETTING DIRTY NEEDLES AND EVERYTHING .
YEAH .
AND UH I DO NT KNOW I DO NT THINK THAT S A BAD IDEA .
UHHUH .
I KNOW IT UH SORT OF DOES NT ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF DRUG ADDICTION .
YEAH .
IT JUST SORT OF KEEPS THAT GOING .
YEAH .
BUT UH I DO NT KNOW AT LEAST DRUG ADDICTION CAN BE TREATED WHEREAS AIDS SO FAR CAN NOT BE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW SO I DO NT KNOW THAT I THINK THAT S I M NOT TOO A MUCH AGAINST THE THE PASSING OUT OF THE FREE SYRINGES .
MYSELF .
UHHUH .
I DO NT KNOW WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT .
WELL YEAH BOY .
IT .
THAT S A HARD ISSUE .
IT REALLY IS .
IT REALLY IS .
IT REALLY IS .
THEY GAVE US .
A HARD TOPIC .

THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BUT AS YOU SAY UH PEOPLE I MEAN IN THE MEANTIME WELL .
UHHUH .
SOMEONE .
WHO S NOT READY TO GIVE UP DRUGS UH .
THAT S TRUE .
YOU KNOW .
THAT S TRUE .
IF THEY RE PERP PERPETRATING THE AIDS PROBLEM PASSING THAT ON TO EACH OTHER THEN .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
YOU KNOW I GUESS IF YOU CONSIDER THE TWO PROBLEMS DRUG ADDICTION AND AIDS .
YEAH .
AIDS WOULD HAVE TO COME FIRST I GUESS AS FAR AS .
YEAH .
SOMETHING TO TO DO ABOUT IT .
UHHUH .
SO SO I DO NT KNOW .
UH COURSE THERE S SO MANY THINGS IN THE WORLD WHERE IF YOU SOLVE ONE PROBLEM YOU MAY BE CREATING ANOTHER YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
AND UH SO I GUESS YOU JUST HAVE TO TAKE THE TWO PROBLEMS AND SEE WHICH IS WORSE .
YEAH .
WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT TO SOLVE AT THE TIME AND .
UHHUH .
I DO NT KNOW .
YEAH .
BUT UH BUT I VE NEVER LOOKED INTO HOW MUCH MONEY .
THEY RE SPENDING .
I HAVE I HAVE NO IDEA .

WELL I DO NT KNOW IF I HAVE ANY OR NOT I I VE ALWAYS ENJOYED IT I SING IN A CHURCH CHOIR ON WEDNESDAY NIGHTS WHEN I M AROUND AND PLAY IN THE BAND ON MONDAY NIGHTS AND KEEPS YOU OUT OF TROUBLE THAT WAY .
WELL I M PROBABLY ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE THAT THE .
JERI .
YES .
WE RE SUPPOSED TO DISCUSS CRIME IN THE UNITED STATES AND WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH IT .
THAT S A RATHER RATHER BROAD TOPIC .
THEY RE USUALLY PRETTY BROAD ANYWAY .
YEAH .
WHERE DO YOU LIVE .
UH WE LIVE IN PLANO .
OKAY SO THAT S A .
UH AND WHERE YOU ARE .
I M IN RICHARDSON SO .
UHHUH .
WHEN I HEARD THE TOPIC .
I WAS THINKING OF THE THING DOWN AT UH MACEO HIGH SCHOOL .
RIGHT .
IN DALLAS .
RIGHT THAT IS SO FRIGHTENING .
IT IS YOU KNOW .
UH DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN IN SCHOOL .
NO MINE ARE ALREADY IN COLLEGE NOW SO .
YEAH .
I DO NT HAVE TO AT LEAST WHEN THEY WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL IT WAS BEGINNING BUT NOT LIKE THE RAMPAGES .
WELL I HAVE MY OLDEST IS HIS FIRST YEAR IN HIGH SCHOOL SO WE HAVE ALL THIS TO TO LOOK FORWARD TO AND IT IS REALLY FRIGHTENING UH TO THINK THAT YOU CA NT EVEN SEND THEM TO SCHOOL IN SAFETY .
I MEAN CERTAINLY YOU KNOW YOU CA NT JUST TURN THEM LOOSE IN THE MIDDLE OF DALLAS BUT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU CA NT EVEN SEND THEM ON THEIR NORMAL ACTIVITIES IN SAFETY IT IT S REALLY FRIGHTENING .
THAT S TRUE .
AND UH I REALLY YOU KNOW THEY RE COMING DOWN ON THE PRINCIPAL BUT I REALLY DO NT KNOW WHAT .
THEY CAN DO .
I MEAN IT S JUST IN SO MUCH OF SOCIETY WITH THE VIOLENCE AND THE KIDS HAVING ACCESS TO WEAPONS AND DRUGS AND I I REALLY DO NT KNOW WHAT WHAT CAN BE DONE .
YEAH WELL I JUST I JUST DO NT UNDERSTAND HOW OF COURSE IN MY LITTLE WORLD HOW GUNS COULD BE SO AVAILABLE .
WELL I DO NT EITHER BUT APPARENTLY THEY JUST REALLY ARE .
UH I MEAN TO ME IN PLANO .
YOU WOULD THINK THAT WOULD BE ABOUT YOU KNOW ABOUT AS INNOCENT AS YOU COULD GET FOR FOR BEING IN A A LARGE AREA .
BUT YOU KNOW MY SON COMES HOME AND TELLS ME THAT YOU KNOW HE HEARS KIDS TALK ABOUT HAVING GUNS AND UH SOMEONE CAME TO HIS FOOTBALL PRACTICE ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO WITH A GUN .
OH MY HEAVENS .
AND I MEAN IT JUST SCARED ME TO DEATH AND YOU KNOW THEY CALLED THE POLICE AND AND NOTHING HAPPENED BUT MY GOODNESS YOU KNOW IT IT COULD HAVE EASILY .
WELL MAYBE THAT S THE ANSWER TO CRIME IS GETTING MORE PROSECUTION .
MAYBE SO .
YOU KNOW BECAUSE I DO NT NOW I SOMEHOW I FEEL WE RE LIVING IN AN IMPARTIAL SOCIETY AS FAR AS PEOPLE SEEING SOMETHING HAPPEN YOU KNOW ACROSS THE STREET OR SEEING SOMEONE GET MUGGED OR UNFORTUNATELY RAPED AND PEOPLE DO NT DO ANYTHING .
YEAH .
A WOMAN WAS RAPED IN RICHARDSON I READ IN THE PAPER OH ABOUT A TWO WEEKS AGO NOW .
AND ALL THE NEIGHBORS SAID THEY HEARD HER YELLING FOR HELP .
OH NO .
BUT NOBODY NOBODY DID ANYTHING .
I JUST CA NT IMAGINE THAT .
YOU KNOW I MEAN THEY HEARD SOMEONE CALLING FOR HELP .
NOBODY EVEN CALLED THE POLICE TO SAY YOU KNOW I HEAR A STRANGE SCREAMING .
RIGHT .
I M AFRAID YOU KNOW IF YOU I DO NT BLAME PEOPLE WITH TODAY S SOCIETY ABOUT GOING OUT TO HELP THEMSELVES .
RIGHT WELL I CAN SEE YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY IF YOU HEARD SCREAMS FROM A HOUSE OR SOMETHING NOT GOING OVER THERE MAYBE BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT COULD BE DANGEROUS BUT CERTAINLY I CA NT UNDERSTAND NOT CALLING THE POLICE .
YEAH .
I .
I JUST YOU KNOW IT S IT S REALLY FRIGHTENING THAT WE RE NOT WE RE TRYING TO LIVE IN OUR OWN LITTLE COCOONS AND PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST THINGS WE COULD DO FOR CRIME IS TO PARTICIPATE OURSELVES IN ITS PREVENTION .
RIGHT .
WELL I I THINK YOU RE RIGHT THERE .
I GUESS PEOPLE JUST KIND OF KEEP THEIR NOSES POINTED IN THEIR OWN BUSINESS BUT I THINK THAT S REAL DANGEROUS AND UH I DO NT KNOW .
I TRY TO TELL MY KIDS JUST JUST KIND OF BE AWARE OF WHAT S AROUND THEM YOU KNOW AND IF YOU SEE A SITUATION .
THAT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE TROUBLE JUST GET OUT OF IT OR CALL FOR HELP WHICHEVER .
YES .
BUT UH .
YEAH WELL YOU KNOW THE CALL FOR HELP IS WHAT SCARES ME NOW BECAUSE IT IT JUST I DO NT KNOW PEOPLE JUST DO NT I DO NT KNOW I CA NT SAY THEY DO NT CARE BECAUSE PEOPLE JUST HAVE TO CARE ABOUT ANOTHER PERSON .
YEAH .
BUT IT .
S THAT NOT GETTING INVOLVED THAT IMPERSONAL SOCIETY I THINK WE LIVE IN TODAY .
WELL MAYBE THIS THING WITH WITH THE CHILD AT SCHOOL MAYBE THAT WILL MAKE PEOPLE THINK A BIT MORE AND YOU KNOW TAKE SOME STEPS TO TO CORRECT IT .
I DO NT KNOW IT S IT REALLY IS IS FRIGHTENING .
YEAH .
I UH .
LET ME ASK YOU GETTING BACK TO YOUR SON S FOOTBALL PRACTICE BECAUSE IT REALLY SORT OF ASTONISHED ME THAT POLICE ARE NT DOING HE DID NT HAVE A LICENSE FOR THE GUN CORRECT .
I DO NT KNOW .
I MEAN I DO NT KNOW THE DETAILS .
THIS WAS NOT A CHILD .
THAT WAS ON THE TEAM .
IT WAS SOMEONE .
THAT UH SHOW YOU KNOW JUST KIND OF SHOWED UP AT THE FIELD .
UHHUH .
UH IT WAS A A STUDENT AGE PERSON BUT I M NOT EVEN .
WHAT DO YOU THINK .
WELL UH THIS IS THIS IS ABOUT DRUG TESTING RIGHT .
RIGHT .
WELL UH I M I M CERTAINLY UNDER THE UH UH THE INFLUENCE OF THE IDEA THAT THAT THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO HAVE LESS CONTROL ON WHAT UH WHAT THE CITIZENS DO ALTHOUGH I DO SEE THIS AS A UH SOMETHING THAT DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF WHETHER THAT WHETHER THAT SHOULD BE PUT IN THE HANDS OF THE CORPORATION OR THE THE HANDS OF THE HANDS OF THE GOVERNMENT IS A YOU KNOW A A DIFFERENT QUESTION I THINK AS FAR AS I M CONCERNED I IN IN OTHER WORDS I AM FA IN FAVOR OF DRUG CONTRO OR OR OR DRUG TESTING UH I WAS DRUG TESTED WHEN I CAME TO MY JOB HERE AT T I YET .
UHHUH .
BUT BUT AT THE SAME TIME I DO NT THINK UH THAT SHOULD BE GOVERNED BY BY THE GOVERNMENT UH PER SE I THINK IT SHOULD BE MORE BY THE PRIVATE INSTITUTION HOW ABOUT YOU .
YEAH I THINK THAT THE CORPORATIONS SHOULD UH DO ALL THAT THEY SHOULD UH HAVE DRUG SCREENING BEFORE THEY HIRE .
UHHUH .
AN EMPLOYEE AND UH ANY TIME THAT AN EMPLOYEE LIKE IF THEY RE COMING TO LATE WORK ALL THE TIME AND UH .
UHHUH .
IF THEY IF THEY RE ESPECIALLY IF THERE S THEY RE ON THE LINE OR ANY KIND OF SENSITIVE JOB WHERE YOU KNOW IF THEY CAN IF THEY MADE A MISTAKE IT WOULD COST A LOT OF MONEY OR .
YEAH .
OR PEOPLE S LIVES .
SURE .
THEN THEY NEED TO BE WATCHED CAREFULLY SO .
UHHUH YEAH I I AGREE WITH YOU I YOU KNOW I WOULD EVEN THINK THAT UH UH I COULD IN THEORY TAKE THAT A L A YOU KNOW A STEP FURTHER AND SAY ANYBODY IN ANY JOB YOU KNOW IF THE CORPORATION FELT LIKE UH B B AND THIS IS WHY I MEAN UH DRUGS ARE THE BIGGEST PROBLEM I THINK TO FACE AMERICA TODAY I MEAN I TH IT S WHAT DRIVES CRIME IT S WHAT DRIVES UH UH ANY SORT OF OF UH UH PAIN AND DISCOMFORT IN THE WORLD OR IN AMERICA I THINK IS SOME IS SOMEWHAT UH UH DRIVEN BY DRUGS AND I THINK THAT UH WERE CORPORATIONS AND UH PRIVATE INDUSTRY TO TAKE UH TAKE COMMAND IN THIS SITUATION THAT MAYBE MAYBE WE MIGHT HAVE SOME SOME CONTROL OVER THAT WE YOU KNOW IF YOU CA NT WORK THEN YOU CA NT BE A LITTLE BIT HARDER TO TAKE TAKE DRUGS OR WHATEVER I DO NT KNOW .
RIGHT .
COURSE THAT MIGHT UP CRIME YOU KNOW WHEN UH PEOPLE GO IN AND STEAL YOUR TELEVISION AND STE AND SELL IT JUST BECAUSE THEY CA NT THEY CA NT WORK ANYMORE YOU KNOW .
YEAH YEAH BUT YOU GOT TO HAVE A A SAFE WORK PLACE THAT S ALL THERE IS TO IT .
DEFINITELY YOU YOU RE DEFINITELY RIGHT THAT UH YOU CA NT YOU CA NT HAVE IT ANY OTHER WAY .
UHHUH .
UH YOU KNOW WHETHER WHETHER IN IN THE CASE THAT YOU BROUGHT UP YOU KNOW WHETHER UH YOU KNOW W IF IT S A POLICEMAN AND HE S WORKING WITH UH THE PUBLIC AND HE HAS A AND HAS A GUN IN HIS HOLSTER OR OR EVEN YOU KNOW IF IT S A GUY AT MCDONALD S COOKING A BURGER I THINK THEY RE DANGEROUS IN EITHER SITUATION .
UHHUH .
UH I WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK UH WHAT PERCENTAGE OF OF CORPORATIONS AND UH PRIVATE INDUSTRY DO YOU THINK USE UH DRUG TESTING .
I THINK IT S IT S MORE FREQUENT NOW IT S PROBABLY LIKE FORTY FIFTY PERCENT .
OH REALLY .
YEAH .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE UH ALL THE JOBS THAT I VE APPLIED FOR HAVE UH MENTIONED SOME TYPE OF DRUG SCREENING .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW .
WHAT KIND OF WORK ARE YOU IN .
UH I WORK AT SEARS .
UHHUH .
AND I JUST DO WAREHOUSE WORK .
UHHUH AND DID THEY GIVE YOU DRUG TESTING .
UH NOT THEY HIRED ME IN NINETEEN EIGHTYFOUR SO .
OH .
YEAH .
OKAY .
BUT NOW THEY THEY UH THEY ISSUED A STATEMENT .
UHHUH .
ABOUT THAT ABOUT THREE MONTHS AGO .
OH SO ARE THEY GOING TO UH BEGIN SPONTANEOUS UH DRUG TESTING .
UH NOT THAT I KNOW OF IT WAS MORE ABOUT UH ALL THE PEOPLE S PROBLEMS LIKE .
UHHUH .
THEY VE BEEN LAYING OFF A LOT OF PEOPLE .
OH YEAH .
AND UH AND UH THEY SENT OUT THE EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE CARDS FOR ANYONE THAT HAD ANY SORT OF DRUG PROBLEM OR WORK RELATED PROBLEM .
SURE .
FAMILY PROBLEMS YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
THEY KIND OF COVERED EVERYTHING .
UHHUH .
BUT I KNOW THEY HAVE A LOT OF DRUG PROBLEMS SO .
YEAH WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT UH YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT KIND OF CONCERNS ME IS UH Y YOU KNOW YOU AND I ARE TESTED FOR FOR WHATEVER WORK WE HAPPEN TO DO DO YOU THINK THERE SHOULD BE DRUG TESTING FOR POLITICAL OFFICIALS .
YES I DO .
YEAH I DO TOO .
BECAUSE BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM ARE YOU KNOW THEY RE HYPOCRITICAL THEY THEY TALK AGAINST DRUGS .
YEAH .
AND THEN THEY GET CAUGHT YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
IN STINGS IN WASHINGTON .
YEAH .
WHETHER IT S DRUGS OR ANY OTHER KIND OF UH LIKE THE THE MONEY LAUNDERING SCAMS ALL THAT WAS DRUG RELATED .
OH YEAH .
SO AND THAT COST US THE COUNTRY YOU KNOW BILLIONS OF DOLLARS .
SURE SURE YEAH .
SO .
I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU I I CA NT SEE I CA NT SEE HOW WE CAN EXPECT THE YOU KNOW UH UH PEOPLE WORKING IN THE IN IN AMERICA TO UH TO PUT ANY TRUST INTO OUR POLITICAL OFFICIALS IF THEY DO NT YOU KNOW UH JUST DOES NT MAKE SENSE TO HAVE THEM I TO TO WORRY ABOUT LEGISLATION UNLESS THEY RE DOING THAT THEMSELVES .
WHAT .
DO YOU WANT TO START .
UH YOU HIT YOU HIT UH IT DOES NT MATTER .
UM WE RE DISCUSSING THE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT I BELIEVE .
RIGHT .
YOU ARE RIGHT .
YEAH .
I I SUPPOSE I SHOULD HAVE .
UH WHICH .
I AM AM PRO CAPITAL PUNISHMENT EXCEPT THAT I DO NT LIKE THE WAY .
IT S DONE .
UHHUH .
UH YEAH UH I UH I GUESS I I HATE TO SEE ANYONE DIE UH .
UHHUH .
BUT UH I GUESS THESE PEOPLE .
THAT GO AROUND AND AND KILL CHILDREN AND WOMEN AND EVERYTHING ELSE WITHOUT ANY REMORSE UH I DO NT THINK THEY DESERVE TO TO LIVE AND BE SUPPORTED BY US .
THE REST OF THEIR LIVES .
I I AGREE .
I I M CAPITAL .
THE THE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS NECESSARY IN IN MANY CASES BUT UH THE IT S NOT A DETERRENT UM OR OUR JAILS WOULD NOT BE SO FULL .
THERE WOULD NT BE SO MANY PEOPLE IN DEATH ROW .
UHHUH .
I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING UH UH A THROWBACK TO WHERE THEY DID A UH PUBLIC EXECUTION WHERE IT S VISIBLE .
YEAH .
UH SOMETHING YOU KNOW NOT GRUESOME BUT BUT SOMETHING MORE WHERE PEOPLE KNOW THAT IT IT WAS A DETERRENT AND IT WAS EQUAL FOR ALL PEOPLE .
IF YOU COMMITTED A CERTAIN CRIME YOU WERE GOING TO RECEIVE A DEATH PENALTY AND IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOU .
YEAH .
NO STAYS OF EXECUTION .
NO NO LOOPHOLES NO .
WELL AND EVEN EVEN THAT I DO NT REALLY KNOW IF THAT WOULD HELP .
I THINK A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE DO IT UH MAINLY BECAUSE OF OF T V AND A .
NOTORIETY .
THE DOUBLE REASON MA THEY THEY SEE IT BEING DONE ON T V AND ALSO THE FACT OF OF NOTORIETY .
I MEAN THEY BECOME WELL KNOWN .
THEY ARE ALMOST LIKE LIKE A BIG STAR .
YE YES BUT BUT THEY THEY KNOW THAT THEIR CHANCES OF ACTUALLY RECEIVING THE DEATH PENALTY ARE MINIMAL .
YEAH .
THEY KNOW THAT THEY WILL PROBABLY BE OUT IN TEN TO TWELVE YEARS .
UHHUH .
THAT THEY ARE GOING TO WRITE A BOOK .
THEY ARE GOING TO GO ON TALK SHOWS THEY RE GOIN THAT THAT THAT S A REWARD .
YEAH .
UH FOR A HEINOUS CRIME RATHER THAN UH HAVING THEM PAY THE PENALTY .
WHICH IS FORFEITURE OF THEIR LIFE .
RIGHT .
IN IN COMPLETE UH MUMBLEX OF ANY NOTORIETY .
YEAH .
WELL I I I THINK IF THEY WENT ACCORDING TO UH THE BIBLE WHERE IT DOES SAY .
UHHUH .
AN EYE FOR AN EYE .
RIGHT .
A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH A LIFE FOR A LIFE UH YOU TAKE A LIFE .
YOU GIVE YOURS .
RIGHT .
UH UH THAT S FOR SURE .
UH THERE .
S EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE .
I MEAN IF IF IT S AN ACCIDENTAL TAKING THEN UH YOU LOOK AT THAT BUT YOU KNOW MOST OF THESE PEOPLE THAT DOWN RIGHT GO RIGHT AND AND DO IT OUT OF PURE PLEASURE .
UHHUH .
UH I DO NT UH LIKE TO SEE THAT .
I GUESS ALSO THE FACT THAT THEY SAY IT S NOT A DETERRENT IT IS A DETERRENT IN THE IN THE SENSE THAT THAT PERSON WILL NEVER DO IT AGAIN .
WELL YES THEY WILL .
NOT .
IT .
NOT NOT IF HE S KILLED HE CA NT .
OH MUMBLEX .
DO IT AGAIN .
WELL THAT S CORRECT YES .
YE IF IF HE INDEED RECEIVES .
THE DEATH PENALTY .
THE DEATH PENALTY AND IT IS IT IS EXECUTED .
UHHUH .
YEAH .
BUT BUT THE THE THE CHANCES ARE NOT GREAT THAT THAT WILL HAPPEN .
RIGHT .
BUT THERE S A GREATER CHANCE THAT HE LL BE BACK OUT ON THE STREETS IN TWELVE YEARS .
UHHUH YEAH .
WELL I I GUESS I M ALSO LOOKING AT BEYOND EVEN THAT .
I I I GUESS I BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT AND I DO NT HAVE A DEFINITE OPINION BUT UH REPEAT UH CRIMES .
UHHUH .
UH MAYBE NOT THE THE MORE MILD ONES BUT YOU KNOW A MORE SEVERE ONES ESPECIALLY ON ON ARMED ROBBERY AND STUFF WHERE THEY BEEN TAKING FROM ELDERLY PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
AND NOT JUST TAKING THE MONEY BUT BEATING THEM .
HALF TO DEATH .
THAT S RIGHT .
JUST FOR PLEASURE TOO AND .
YES .
I GUESS YOU VE GOT TO LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
DO THEY DESERVE TO UH REMAIN ON THIS EARTH TOO .
WHY YOU KNOW Y Y YOU COULD CARRY IT TO THAT IF UH IF THEY ARE A REPEAT OFFENDER AND AND YOU KNOW THAT AS SOON AS YOU LET THEM OUT ON THE STREETS THEY ARE GOING TO DO THIS .
UNFORTUNATELY THE WAY OUR SYSTEM OF JURISPRUDENCE IS SET UP UM YOU ONLY RECEIVE THE DEATH PENALTY FOR CAPITAL CRIMES .
RIGHT .
AND OF COURSE UH OF BATTERY OR ASSAULT OR THAT IS NOT A CAPITAL CRIME SEE .
YOU YOU WOULD NT BE ABLE TO UNDER OUR SYSTEM .
RIGHT .
NOW CHINA AND A FEW OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE A LITTLE DIFFERENT VIEW OF THAT .
UM YOU GET CAUGHT WITH DOPE THERE AND YOU DIE PERIOD .
YEAH .
UHHUH .
THERE IS THERE IS NO NO APPEALS .
THERE IS NO .
HELLO MY NAME IS DONNA AND I M CALLING FROM PLANO TEXAS .
HI THIS IS LAURIE AND I M IN GARLAND .
OH OKAY .
UM WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO GO FIRST .
SURE .
OKAY UM I HAVE THREE CHILDREN UM TWO TWO .
WHO ARE IN REGULAR SCHOOL UH ELEVEN YEAR OLD AN EIGHT YEAR OLD AND THEN MY LITTLE ONE THREE YEAR OLD IS IN UM A UNIVERSITY OF GYMNASTICS IT S A A PRESCHOOL .
UHHUH .
AND UM I THINK IT WAS REALLY HARD TO UM TO PICK THE RIGHT UH DAY CARE OR PRESCHOOL OR MOTHER S DAY OUT .
I GUESS YOU CAN CLASSIFY THEM ALL TOGETHER .
UHHUH .
UM SOME OF THE QUALIFICATIONS THAT I LOOK FOR WAS THAT UH YOU KNOW THE COST AND UM EXACTLY WHAT .
THEY DID IF IT WAS STRUCTURED OR NONSTRUCTURED IF THEY HAD A LITTLE ACADEMIC UM UH IN THERE AND UM YOU KNOW UM YOU KNOW WHAT .
THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE TEACHERS WERE AND IF THE PLACE WAS CLEAN AND .
UHHUH .
UM THE HOURS AND UM JUST JUST KIND OF GOING BY WORD OF MOUTH AND FINDING OUT IF ANYBODY ELSE HAS BEEN PLEASED WITH THEIR PROGRAM .
RIGHT .
THAT KIND OF STUFF .
WELL WE DO NT HAVE ANY CHILDREN BUT WE RE GOING TO HAVE ONE .
NEXT YEAR .
OH CONGRATULATIONS .
THANKS .
SO UM THAT S SOMETHING THAT I M PROBABLY GOING TO BE LOOKING AT .
RIGHT .
MAYBE IN THE FUTURE .
WE HAVE NT QUITE DECIDED IF I M GOING TO I M WORKING PART TIME NOW AND I DO NT KNOW IF I LL BE DOING THAT OR WHAT .
WE RE GOING TO DO .
OR STAYING HOME .
BUT IF WE DO THEN I M GOING TO NEED TO FIND SOMEBODY AND OUR CHURCH HAS A MOTHER S DAY OUT PROGRAM .
UHHUH .
WHICH .
THEY STARTED LAST YEAR AND WE KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE AT THE CHURCH SO I WOULD FEEL VERY CONFIDENT WITH LEAVING .
THAT S A VERY GOOD PLACE TO START I THINK .
MY CHILD THERE .
UHHUH .
YEAH THE MOTHER S DAY OUT PROGRAMS AND THAT S WHERE SHANNON HAD STARTED IN A MOTHER S DAY OUT PROGRAM .
UHHUH .
AND UH THE CHURCHES ALWAYS HAVE I THINK A A PRETTY GOOD PROGRAM AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU UM THAT YOU APPLY PRETTY EARLY BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE A LOT OF PLACES HAVE VERY LONG WAITING LISTS .
UHHUH .
AND UM AND ANOTHER QUESTION TO ASK IS IF THEY RE UM STATE CERTIFIED .
OKAY .
UM YOU KNOW IF THE TEACHERS HAVE UM THEIR MASTER S DEGREE IN IN CHILD EDUCATION AND .
UHHUH .
UM CHILD DEVELOPMENT .
UM YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT KIND OF A STRUCTURE IS IT GOING TO BE .
UM WHEN YOUR CHILD S A LITTLE BIT OLDER LIKE A THREE YEAR OLD .
UHHUH .
YOU D BE MORE CONCERNED WITH IF THERE S A TYPE OF CARE THAT IT S TORTURE FOR THEM TO LAY DOWN AND TAKE A NAP .
IS THERE LIKE A MANDATORY NAP TIME .
TIME UHHUH .
WHAT .
THEY DO AT SHANNON S SCHOOL IS HAVE A VIDEO TAPE GOING AND IF AND THEY LAY ON THESE LITTLE MATS AND IF THEY FALL ASLEEP THEY .
KIND OF LET THEM SLEEP AND THE TEACHER STAYS WITH THE SLEEPING ONES AND THE OTHER ONES GET UP AND GO DO SOMETHING ELSE .
UHHUH .
SO SHE DOES NT HAVE TO NECESSARY TAKE A NAP THERE .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW WHICH IS WHICH IS NICE .
UM .
UHHUH .
UM YOU KNOW IT S KIND OF SCARY I GUESS BECAUSE YOU HEAR SO MANY BAD THINGS ABOUT DAY CARES .
THAT S TRUE .
LATELY AND SO IT S I GUESS IT S SUCH A GROWING CONCERN BUT THEN THERE S A LOT OF GOOD THINGS YOU DO NT HEAR .
RIGHT .
AND SOMETIMES WHEN THE CHILD S A LOT YOUNGER BEFORE THEY RE REALLY UM BEFORE THREE YEARS OLD YOU KNOW LIKE THE CHURCH IS A GOOD PROGRAM AND SOMETIMES YOU EVEN CONSIDER UM YOU KNOW HAVING A PRIVATE PERSON COME TO YOUR OWN HOME WHEN THEY RE REAL LITTLE OR .
RIGHT .
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND ANOTHER CONSIDERATION IS HOW MANY INFANTS OR CHILDREN ARE THEY WHAT S THE RATIO OF OF TEACHERS TO .
TO CHILDREN .
TO CHILDREN .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE THAT MAKES A A A DIFFERENCE AND IF YOUR CHILD WOULD BE MAYBE SLEEPING IN THAT CRIB .
ALL DAY JUST YOUR CHILD AND OR DO THEY JUST PUT ANY CHILD IN ANY CRIB .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW YOU WOULD WANT MAYBE YOUR CHILD TO HAVE THEIR OWN SHEETS ALL THE TIME AND NOT HAVE ANOTHER .
RIGHT .
CHILD USE .
THAT BED .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW .
I M SURE THAT UM WHATEVER .
YOU DECIDE YOU LL BE HAPPY WITH .
YEAH .
AND IT S EXCITING TIME TO HAVE A NEW ONE .
YEAH .
WE RE PRETTY EXCITED .
I BET .
THAT S THAT S WONDERFUL .
YEAH BUT THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THAT BUT IT S A LITTLE WAYS OFF IN THE FUTURE .
UHHUH .
BUT UM I FIGURE YOU KNOW I D PROBABLY START ASKING .
ASKING .
AROUND AT CHURCH .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE I KNOW THEY HAVE A LIMIT AS TO HOW OLD THEY CAN BE BEFORE THEY YOU KNOW BEFORE YOU CAN BRING THEM IN .
SOME SOME PLACES UM START THEM AS EARLY AS I THINK WELL SOME SOME PLACES TAKE THEM AS INFANTS I GUESS YOU KNOW LIKE EIGHT WEEKS EVEN .
UHHUH .
UM THERE S A PLACE TO LOOK INTO UM UM A FRIEND OF MINE .
WHO S A NURSE IS WAS TELLING ABOUT A WONDERFUL NEW PLACE .
THAT OPENED SOME PLACE IN ON FIFTEENTH STREET UP IT S IN PLANO SOMEWHERE WHERE UM NURSES .
THAT USED TO WORK IN THE HOSPITAL TAKE CARE OF INFANTS INFANTS AND THEN ONLY UP TO LIKE TWO YEARS OLD .
UM .
AND IT S IT S SUPPOSED TO BE REALLY A A YOU KNOW SOME PLACES JUST SPECIALIZE IN JUST REAL LITTLE ONES .
RIGHT .
AND THEN OTHER ONES UH ARE THE OLDER CHILDREN .
UHHUH .
BUT IT IS A DIFFICULT SITUATION I THINK .
WHEN THEY RE WHEN THEY RE LITTLE IT S ALMOST EASIER TO LEAVE THEM BECAUSE WHEN THEY RE THREE AND THEY RE CRY .
DO YOU HAVE ANY PERSONAL FEELINGS ON ON UH THE SUBJECT .
WELL UH CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS A HARD THING BUT UH THERE S BEEN SEVERAL THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED WHERE I FELT LIKE IF I HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN IT I WOULD HAVE HAD TO TO GO ALONG WITH WITH THAT BEING THE PUNISHMENT GIVEN TO TO THE PEOPLE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME THINGS YOU KNOW THERE S THINGS DONE THAT ARE JUST .
SO OUTRAGEOUS I KNOW I KNOW .
YEAH THAT I DO NOT KNOW HOW I DO NOT REALLY THERE S ANY OTHER WAY TO DEAL WITH IT .
RIGHT .
WELL I I GUESS MY CONCERN IS WHAT WE ARE READING ESPECIALLY IN TEXAS RIGHT NOW WITH THEM LETTING OUT THE PEOPLE OUT OF JAIL AS SOON AS THEY ARE OUT OF PRISON WHEN THEY DO AND HAVING THEM GO RIGHT BACK THE DAY THEY GET OUT BACK IN CRIME .
YEAH I THINK THAT THAT THAT .
AND ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY ARE ASSAULTING .
THAT S A REALLY .
PEOPLE AND THEN KILLING PEOPLE I MEAN THE MAN WHO .
KILLED THOSE THREE SHERIFFS DEPUTIES HE IS OUT FREE WALKING THE STREET I HAVE A REAL PROBLEM .
YEAH IF IT S A .
WITH THAT .
IF IT S A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER I MEAN IT .
I THINK SO .
BUT IT S SOMETHING THAT S REALLY HARD TO DEAL WITH THE WAY THAT OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM IS RIGHT NOW IS BASICALLY SET UP IN LAWYERS AND AND ANYBODY .
RIGHT .
WILL TELL YOU THAT UH IT IS SET UP RIGHT NOW ALL THE LAWS PROTECT THE CRIMINAL .
RIGHT .
THEY ARE THE ONES WITH THE RIGHTS .
WELL .
THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO UH YOU KNOW I THINK I WATCHED SOMETHING LAST WEEK UH MUMBLEX I AM SORRY THE ACCUSED HAS THE RIGHT TO A SPEEDY TRIAL BUT THE VICTIM DOES NOT HAVE THE RIGHT DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME .
DOES NOT HAVE THE RIGHT .
DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME THE SAME EMPHASIS ON THOSE THINGS .
RIGHT .
AS FAR AS THEY ARE CONCERNED SO NOW THE ACCUSED CAN CAN ASK FOR DELAYS AND EXTENSIONS AND .
RIGHT .
WHAT DO THEY CALL .
RIGHT .
WHATEVER THEY CALL THEM YOU KNOW .
AND MEANWHILE THE WITNESSES .
MOVE AND DIE AND .
UHHUH UHHUH EXACTLY .
AND THEY .
CONTINUANCE .
AND THERE S NO ONE TO FACE THEM .
THEY CAN GET CONTINUANCES ON FOR YEARS BEFORE THE THING EVER COMES TO TRIAL AND THAT MAKES THE VICTIM SUFFER .
RIGHT .
MORE .
RIGHT WELL .
THE MUMBLEX .
THEY CAN NOT GET ANY IF THE JUDGE IS GOING TO HAVE ANY AWARD TO THE VICTIM IT JUST PUTS OFF THEIR COLLECTING IT .
YEAH THAT TOO .
IT S .
UM .
IT S REALLY BAD IT I .
I THINK THAT UH YOU KNOW THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A WAY THAT YOU KNOW ONCE SOMEONE HAS GONE THROUGH YOU KNOW A TRIAL I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO FIX IT I MEAN IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THERE THERE SHOULD BE A LIMIT ON HOW MANY APPEALS CAN BE MADE .
UHHUH UHHUH UHHUH .
YOU KNOW WHEN SOMEONE HAS BEEN .
A TIME LIMIT TOO .
HA YEAH .
DO NOT LET IT .
WHEN SOMEONE HA .
DRAG ON FOR FIFTEEN YEARS .
WELL EVEN WHEN SOMEONE HAS BEEN CONVICTED AND I MEAN IT S JUST SO SO ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT THEY DID IT .
RIGHT .
BUT APPEALING YOU KNOW AND CONTINUING TO APPEAL LIKE FOUR OR FIVE OR SIX TIMES TO HAVE CONVICTIONS OVERTURNED AND THEN THEY HAVE TO BE RETRIED AND ALL THAT IT S SUCH A WASTE OF TIME AND ENERGY AND MONEY AND IT IT JUST THAT S WHAT KEEPS THAT S WHAT IS KEEPING ALL THE THE YOU KNOW THE CRIMINALS IN A POSITION OF BEING ABLE TO BE RELEASED ALL THE TIME LIKE THIS .
RIGHT DO YOU FEEL LIKE THERE S ANY CERTAIN TYPE OF CRIME THAT THIS SHOULD BE THE RESULTS THEY SHOULD BE CONSEQUENCES OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT OR OR .
OH .
ARE THERE SOME MURDERS COMMITTED THAT YOU THINK LENIENCY SHOULD BE SHOWN .
WELL I GUESS THERE S EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES TO ANYTHING LIKE THAT UH YOU KNOW LIKE I I COULD SEE UH A FIRST TIME OFFENDER BEING YOU KNOW MAYBE MUMBLEX IN A IN A ROBBERY SITUATION TRYING TO HOLD UP A STORE AND GETTING SCARED AND YOU KNOW FIRING A GUN AND ACCIDENTLY KILLING SOMEONE .
UHHUH .
OKAY I COULD SEE THAT THAT MIGHT BE THE SITUATION WHERE UH THE PERSON COULD BE REHABILITATED BUT I THINK JUST OUT AND OUT MURDER AND I AM TALKING ABOUT UH CUTTING PEOPLE UP .
OKAY .
YOU KNOW WHERE THERE S SHOWN TO BE PATHOLOGICAL TENDENCIES WHERE THIS PERSON HAS DONE IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN A SERIAL FASHION OR WHATEVER THAT THOSE .
RIGHT .
KINDS OF THINGS AND ANY ANY KIND OF VIOLENT ASSAULT RAPE INCLUDED .
UHHUH .
NEEDS TO ADDRESSED IN IN IN THAT CONTEXT .
AND HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT MURDERS OF LAW OFFICERS OR FIRE PEOPLE OR SOMETHING THAT ARE BECAUSE THEY HAVE HAD THEM THEY HAVE HAD THEM KILLED WHEN THEY HAVE .
WELL WHAT BOTHERS ME THAT BOTHERS ME A GREAT DEAL I HAD A FRIEND WHO WAS A POLICE OFFICER WHO WAS KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY .
UM UM UM .
AND THE THING THAT WAS THE WORST ABOUT IT IS THAT THESE THAT UH TWO OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE WELL ALL OF THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED WERE VERY YOUNG ONE WAS TECHNICALLY A MINOR AND SO HE WAS SENT BACK TO MEXICO .
UH .
HE WAS AN ILLEGAL ALIEN THE OTHER TWO HAD LIVED HERE THEY HAD GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL HERE AND THEY HAD TOLD THEIR TEACHERS THAT WH I MEAN REPEATEDLY DURING HIGH SCHOOL THEY HAD TOLD THEIR TEACHERS THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE THAT THEY WERE GOING TO GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND KILL COPS .
THAT WAS THEIR GOAL .
THAT WAS WHAT THEY HAD TOLD THEIR .
OH .
TEACHERS AND SO THAT S WHAT THEY DID AND UH THEY WERE THEY WERE GIVEN I THINK .
THAT WOULD BE PREMEDITATED .
OH ABSOLUTELY .
UH .
HE STOPPED THEM FOR ROUTINE TRAFFIC VIOLATION AND THEY UH .
THEY KILLED HIM .
SEVERAL SEVERAL THINGS HAPPENED THAT NIGHT BUT THEY THEY BEAT HIM UP AND TOOK HIS GUN AND SHOT HIM .
UH UH UH .
WITH IT AND IT WAS IT WAS REALLY TERRIBLE I MEAN UH I HAD SEEN HIM LIKE THREE OR DAYS BEFORE THAT .
UHHUH .
HE WE HAD GONE OUT UH WITH HE AND HIS WIFE AND THAT WAS REALLY REALLY DISTURBING .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THAT THAT HAPPENED AND THESE PEOPLE YOU KNOW IN THE IN THE COURSE OF THE TRIAL YOU KNOW CAME UP WITH WITH ALL THESE YOU KNOW THINGS ABOUT WELL YOU KNOW THEY WERE DISADVANTAGED AND ALL THIS STUFF WELL NOBODY IS THAT DISADVANTAGED .
NO WELL THAT S RIGHT THERE S NO REASON .
AND THERE S JUST NO REA I MEAN .
FOR MURDER .
NO .
I DO NOT CARE IF YOU ARE POOR OR IF YOU ARE RICH OR IF YOU ARE .
UGLY OR PRE WHAT THERE THAT THAT S JUST BEYOND .
YEAH I THINK SO TOO .
THE .
AND THAT S UH SO I I DO FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT .
I THINK THIS GIVING EXCUSES IS PRETTY PREVALENT UH YO I WORK IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THE ALL THESE KIDS THEY HAVE GOT AN EXCUSE FOR EVERYTHING .
YEAH .
AND I CAN SEE IT CONTINUING ON WHEN THEY ARE ADULTS I JUST IT S JUST A BAD HABIT UH UH KIDS HAVE GOT TO LEARN FROM THE TIME THEY ARE REAL LITTLE THERE S NO EXCUSE FOR FOR BEING BAD OR MAKING BAD CHOICES DELIBERATE OR ANYTHING .
YEAH .
IT S IT S UH I I SOMETIMES THINK IF I WERE ON A JURY AND HAD TO MAKE THE DECISION COULD I AND I LIKE TO THINK I COULD LIKE YOU IF IF ESPECIALLY VIOLENT CRIME .
UHHUH .
WHERE SERIAL TYPE KILLER OR MAYBE A CHILD HAS BEEN DELIBERATELY KILLED .
THE THING THAT EVEN THOUGH JURIES SOMETIMES MAKE THE DECISION AND STILL THE PEOPLE NOTHING EVER HAPPENS TO THEM .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW THEY STAY IN JAIL THEY GET OFF TIME FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR AND ALL THAT STUFF AND THEY GET RELEASED .

UHHUH .
ALL .
UHHUH .
SORTS OF HOURS CALLING AND TELLING ME THAT I WANT INVESTMENT ADVISE AND I WANT THIS SERVICE AND THAT SERVICE OR THE OTHER THING .
YES .
I HATE THOSE CANNED MESSAGES THEY PUT ON MY RECORDER .
UM MY SENSE IS THAT SOMETHING MAY JUST HAVE BEEN DONE ABOUT IT BY CONGRESSMEN MUMBLEX JUST WHAT WENT INTO THE MUMBLEX SOMETHING ABOUT THE RANDOM DIALERS .
THAT JUST DIAL PHONE NUMBERS .
UHHUH .
I GUESS IN SOME CASES THEY JUST CONSIDER PICKUP YOUR YOUR PHONE AND AND AND NOT LET YOU USE YOUR PHONE FOR A WHILE WHETHER YOU HANG UP ON THEM OR NOT .
UHHUH .
UM BUT I THOUGHT I SAW SOMETHING ABOUT IT HAVING SOME KIND OF PROVISION THAT PEOPLE COULD SPECIFY THAT THEIR PHONES WERE NOT FOR COMMERCIAL USING AND UH AND UH PEOPLE BUSINESSES WOULD BE PROHIBITED UH FROM CALLING FOR PERS FOR FOR BUSINESS MUMBLEX SELLING YOU THINGS .
I HAVE THROUGH .
I M SURE THAT S TRUE .
THE PHONE COMPANY UH NO NINE HUNDRED NUMBERS CAN BE DIALED FROM MY PHONE OR RECEIVED .
UH SOME OF MUMBLEX DID TOO .
I THINK I THINK GOVERNMENT CAN DO THAT NOW IS THAT RIGHT .
UHHUH .
AND UH ESPECIALLY WITH WITH POSSIBLY CHILDREN AROUND .
UHHUH .
UH THAT COULD COULD BE USEFUL PROTECTION .
RIGHT .
YES AND I DO NT HAVE CHILDREN AROUND BUT I JUST DO NT LIKE THOSE NINE HUNDRED NUMBERS .
SO .
SO UH I USED TO DEAL WITH .
I VE EXCLUDED THOSE .
BUT IS NT IT DOES NOT STOP YOU FROM THE UH DIALING SERVICES .
WHAT ARE DIALING SERVICES .
WHERE THEY UH INTEND TO SELL YOU THINGS .
OH OH WHERE PEOPLE JUST JUST CALL YOU .
UHHUH .
UHHUH .
AND LEAVE AGAIN THAT CANNED MESSAGE ON THE .
AND YOU KNOW AND THEN WHAT THOSE PROBLEMS HAS BEEN ELIMINATED THOSE PROBLEMS USED TO BE WHEN I USED A CREDIT CARD .
UHHUH .
THEY D WANT TO HAVE MY PHONE NUMBER .
UHHUH .
AND I DID NOT LIKE GIVING IT OUT .
I MUMBLEX GAVE OUT MY WORK NUMBER .
RIGHT .
BUT I THINK I M NOT SURE IF IT S BY LAW JUST OTHERWISE I THINK THE PRACTICE HAS BASICALLY BEEN ELIMINATED ASKING FOR A PHONE NUMBER .
WELL THAT S THE THING .
I HATED TOO ABOUT UH RADIO SHACK .
HOW DID RADIO SHACK WORK .
IF YOU GO IN AND BUY ANYTHING .
THEY WANT YOUR PHONE NUMBER .
AND I DO NT THINK THEY RE GOING TO CALL ME AND ASK ME HOW IT S FUNCTIONING AND AND I DO NT GIVE THAT OUT .
I HAVE AN UNLISTED NUMBER SO I DO NT .
YES THAT S THAT S THAT S ONE SOLUTION BUT YOU YOU YOU NONETHELESS OFTEN GET GET PEOPLE CALLING YOU .
SURE .
DESPITE THE FACT THAT YOUR NUMBER IS UNLISTED .
UHHUH .
AND YOU MUMBLEX ACTUALLY HAVE YOUR NUMBER OR ARE THEY JUST CALLING A NUMBER .
THAT HAPPENS TO BE YOURS .
WELL ANYTHING THAT YOU BUY .
UHHUH .

CA YOU MAY GET PUT ON THE A UH PREFERRED LIST .
THAT IS PURCHASED .
UHHUH .
AND AND COMPANIES CAN PURCHASE THIS LIST AND WHAT .
THAT IS IS PEOPLE .
WHO BUY FROM THE MAIL .

UHHUH .
I LL BE THINKING IN MIND .
THE ADDRESS IS UM IS THERE ANYTHING .
YOU CAN DO ABOUT THAT LIKE .
UH NO .
GIVE OUT A PHONY PHONE NUMBER .
NOT REALLY .
UM NO .
UH SOME OF THAT UNFORTUNATELY IS LEGAL .
SO THEY CA NT STOP PEOPLE FROM UH ADVERTISING AND THAT AND THAT S WHAT .
IT FALLS UNDER .
IT FALLS UNDER THE GUISE OF ADVERTISING .
SO I DO NT CARE FOR IT BUT IS IT .
A LEGAL UH SOLUTION FOR SOME COMPANIES .
SO THAT THAT S THE WAY THINGS ARE .
HUH .
YEAH .
I DO NT KNOW .
I THINK IT S GOTTEN MUCH WORSE THE LAST .
UHHUH .
UHHUH .
FEW YEARS .
MAYBE THAT S JUST BECAUSE I VE GOTTEN ON MORE LISTS .
WELL THEY YOU KNOW THAT S THAT S THE TELEPHONE IS NOT THE ONLY INVASION OF PRIVACY .
YOU VE GOT THE HOLY ROLLERS AND YOU VE GOT UH ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE KNOCKING ON YOUR DOOR AND WHO WANT TO UH EITHER DIRECT YOU TO THE RIGHT PATH OR OR WANT TO UH SELL YOU UH PAPER ROUTES UH WHATEVER SO UM .
YEAH .
SELL YOU MAGAZINES .
YOU KNOW IT S NOT JUST THE TELEPHONE .
UHHUH .
I GUESS WHATEVER IS I JUST DO NT GIVE .
OK .
OK I WAS WATCHING THE SOAP OPERA AWARDS .
OH .
AND UH IT IS REALLY MAKING ME WANT TO EXERCISE BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE WOMAN IN THE AUDIENCE IS UH ABOUT TEN POUNDS .
OH .
SO UH I STARTED ANCHORING LAST UH ANCHORING UH .
EXERCISING LAST ABOUT LAST SPRING WHEN I UH JOINED THE PRESIDENT S HEALTH CLUB .
UHHUH .
AND I WAS REALLY MOTIVATED AND GOING AND UH I WENT UH FOR A LITTLE WHILE UH I WENT PRETTY REGULAR BUT IT IS HARD TO GO REGULARLY FOR A LONG TIME .
UHHUH .
AND WHERE I LIVE IN WACO UH THEY DO NOT HAVE ANYWHERE HERE THAT IS AFFILIATED WITH PRESIDENT S SO NOW I DO NOT HAVE A CLUB AND I AM UH I DO NOT HAVE ANY MOTIVATION TO JUST GO OUT AND JOG AIMLESSLY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO I AM NOT EXERCISING AT THE TIME AT THE MOMENT .
UHHUH .
SO I WISH I COULD I WISH I DID HAVE THE MOTIVATION TO GET OUT AND DO THAT BUT I JUST DO NOT LIKE JUST RUNNING WITH NO WHERE TO GO I JUST CAN NOT DO THAT SO .
WELL I UNDERSTAND THAT I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET MYSELF MOTIVATED I HAD GONE GOTTEN UP REGULARLY FOR AWHILE WITH A NEIGHBOR UH SHE HAD INJURED HER BACK AND NEEDED A WALKING PARTNER AND I THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE THE TIME TO GET GOING .
UHHUH .
AND SO WE WALKED PRETTY STEADILY FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS AND UH THEN SHE HAD TO GET BACK TO WORK AND WHICH WAS TRAVELING TO NEW YORK AND SO SHE IS NOT AROUND .
UH .
AND I JUST DO NT LIKE WALKING BY MYSELF AT NIGHT OR IN THE DARK OF THE MORNING .
YEAH .
I DO NT SEEM TO FIND TIME IN THE DAY TIME .
YEAH .
AND OF COURSE IT IS MOTIVATION THAT IS KEEPING ME FROM REALLY LOOKING FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY .
I THINK A LOT OF THE TIMES IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE TO UH WORK OUT WITH OR WALK WITH OR SOMETHING IT DOES GIVE YOU THAT MOTIVATION .
OH YEAH .
AND YOU CAN ALSO I MEAN YOU CAN YOU KNOW PRETTY MUCH DO IT PRIVATELY IF YOU HAD YOUR OWN PRIVATE UH SORT OF CONTEST YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
WHERE YOU WOULD TRY AND SEE IF YOU COULD LOSE MORE WEIGHT THAN YOUR FRIEND OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
YEAH YEAH .
AND THAT WOULD KEEP YOU GOING .
WELL MORE THAN WEIGHT OF COURSE I COULD LOSE UH LOSE CERTAINLY .
UHHUH .
FROM TEN TO TWENTY POUNDS .
UHHUH .
BUT I THINK MORE THAN THAT I ALSO NOTICE I JUST FEEL BETTER WHEN I EXERCISE .
OH YEAH .
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I AM MOTIVATED ABOUT NOW BECAUSE I DO NEED TO GET MYSELF FEELING BETTER .
UHHUH .
JUST IN BETTER SHAPE BUT UH ALL THE SAME IT IS CONNECTED TO MY ATTITUDE BECAUSE I AM NOT FEELING AS PERKY AND GOOD I AM ALSO IT IS HARD TO GET MY ATTITUDE TO UH TO GET MYSELF UP THERE .
THAT IS VERY TRUE IT SEEMS LIKE YOU WALK QUICKER YOU JUST PERKY IS A GOOD WORD FOR IT .
YEAH .
WHEN YOU EXERCISE .
YEAH .
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT WALKING IS SUPPOSE TO BE THE LIKE THE BEST EXERCISE BETTER THAN RUNNING .
YEAH YEAH .
THINGS LIKE THAT CAUSE IT IT WORKS EVERYTHING .
AND YOU HAVE .
AND IT GETS YOUR BREATHING UP .
LESS CHANCE .
AND IT DOES NT .
OF HURTING YOURSELF .
YEAH IT DOES NT HURT YOU LIKE I UNDERSTAND RUNNING HURT YOUR SHINS OR KNEES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
YEAH .
SO .
LAST TIME I TRIED RUNNING WITH MY DAUGHTER CAUSE SHE IS SUPPOSED TO BE JOGGING IN P E AND IT FELT GOOD BUT THEN I HAD PULLED A MUSCLE IN MY KNEE ACTUALLY I HYPER EXTENDED IT OR SOMETHING AND UH .

I GUESS MY MY FAVORITE EXERCISE IN THE UH IN THE GYM IS THE BIKES .
OH IS IT .
TO GO YEAH THERE ARE THESE STATIONERY BIKES THAT YOU JUST RIDE AND IF YOU WATCH TELEVISION THEY USUALLY HAVE TELEVISION IN THERE OR SOMETHING OR IF YOU LISTEN TO A WALKMAN IT IS PRETTY IT IS PRETTY OKAY AGAIN THAT IS SORT OF WEIRD BECAUSE YOU YOU ARE NOT GOING ANYWHERE AND UH I USE TO PLAY RACQUETBALL .
UHHUH .
AND I REALLY LIKED THAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW TO ME IT HAD A POINT .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW UH THERE WERE POINTS YOU COULD YOU WOULD MAKE AND THERE WAS A POINT TO IT BUT RUNNING AND JOGGING AND JUST NOT GOING ANYWHERE IS JUST I DO NT LIKE THAT I JUST CA NT UNDERSTAND THAT SO I DO NT DO .
YEAH WELL I HAVE GOT A DOG NOW AND OF COURSE SHE NEEDS WALKING .
UH YEAH .
AND THAT IS A LITTLE LESS TRAU UH BURDENSOME OR BORING TO BE WALKING AT LEAST WITH HER .
UHHUH .
AND I CAN PUT ON THE EARPHONES TO HAVE SOMETHING TO LISTEN TO AND .
YEAH I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST TO BE SAFE LIKE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT WALKING AT NIGHT AND IN THE MORNING .

UH .
BUT I FIND IT VERY TEDIOUS BECAUSE I AM WATCHING THE CLOCK CONSTANTLY AND IT .

THERE IS JUST NOTHING ELSE TO LOOK AT AND I ACTUALLY GET MORE TIRED DOING THAT THAN I COULD WALK FOR THREE OR FOUR MILES OUT IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD HERE AND FEEL REAL GOOD THERE I COULD BARELY MAKE A COUPLE OF MILES .

SO THAT WAS A CHANGE AND UH EVEN UH I DID NOT UH USE MY MATH UH IN MY WORK I I BECAME A TECHNICAL WRITER .
UHHUH .
BUT UH EVEN SO THERE WERE VERY VERY FEW WOMEN IN TECHNICAL WRITING .
YEAH .
BUT THAT HAS CHANGED A LOT .
OH YEAH .
IN RECENT YEARS IT HAS JUST REALLY REALLY CHANGED A LOT .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND AND I THINK THAT UH YOU KNOW THE ONE THING THAT I HAVE SEEN IS THAT MORE AND MORE WOMEN ARE GETTING INTO MANAGEMENT .
BUT I THINK THEY HAVE GOT A LONG WAY TO GO .
OH DEFINITELY DEFINITELY .
THERE WAS SOMETHING ON T V THE OTHER DAY THAT SAID THAT FEWER THAN ONE OR TWO PERCENT OF THE HEADS OF UH CHAIRMEN OF THE BOARD CHAIR CHAIR PERSONS UH IF YOU SA IF YOU WILL .
UHHUH .
OF THE BOARD ARE WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY .
UHHUH .
AND I THOUGHT THAT YOU KNOW THAT S PRETTY SI A PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY SMALL NUMBER .
YEAH .
SO THERE ARE SOME SOME STRIDES TO BE MADE THERE .
YEAH YEAH .
BUT UH I DO NOT KNOW I I THINK WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY .
UHHUH .
ACTUALLY .
UHHUH .
WHEN I THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW WHEN THINGS WERE LIKE EVEN WHEN I YOU KNOW JUST WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
AND HOW IT IS NOW FOR GIRLS .
YEAH .
AND UH .
YEAH DO YOU .
UH I GUESS MY I UH THE ONE MY ONE BAD THING IS THAT I AM THAT I WISH MY MOTHER HAD HAD SOME OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE I THINK SHE WOULD HAVE REALLY SHE REA WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED IN A LOT OF WAYS .
UHHUH .
THAT MEN THAT WOMEN WERE NOT ABLE TO SUCCEED .
UHHUH .
IN HER .
UHHUH .
GENERATION .
EXACTLY .
SO ANYWAY DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN .
NO HUHUH .
I WAS GOING TO SAY DO YOU HAVE DAUGHTERS THAT S ALWAYS A GOOD QUESTION .
DO YOU .
YES IN FACT I HAVE A DAUGHTER WHO IS IN A A WHO JUST GRADUATED IN CIVIL ENGINEERING FROM COLLEGE .
OH WONDERFUL .
SO SHE IS PRETTY MUCH ALTHOUGH THERE WERE SOME OTHER WOMEN IN HER CLASS .
UHHUH .
SHE WAS YOU KNOW UH ONE OF THE MINORITIES .
UHHUH UHHUH .
UH FEMALES IN THE CLASS .
UHHUH .
SO SHE DEFINITELY ENTERING INTO UH A MALE PROFESSION .
OH YEAH .
BUT UH .
YEAH .
BUT YOU KNOW MUMBLEX FOR INSTANCE THERE ARE THERE IS THE ORGANIZATION WOMEN THE SOCIETY OF WOMEN MUMBLEX ENGINEERS .
UHHUH .
SO THAT IS RECOGNIZED .
UHHUH .
AS UH YOU KNOW A PLACE WHERE WOMEN SHOULD BE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
BUT UH I DO NOT KNOW I YOU SEE IT IN UH ALSO IN UH LIKE IN CHURCH UH WHERE MORE AND MORE WOMEN ARE BECOMING MINISTERS .
OH YEAH .
IN UH YOU KNOW IN PROTESTANT CONGREGATIONS AND UH IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF IF ROMAN CATHOLICISM EVER UH RECOGNIZES WOMEN IN .
IN THE ROLE OF PRIEST I DO I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU ARE ROMAN CATHOLIC OR .
NO HUHUH .
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT .
UHHUH .
I AM NOT EITHER BUT UH THAT IS ONE AREA WHERE IT THAT I CAN SEE MIGHT CHANGE BUT I REALLY DOUBT WILL CHANGE .
YEAH YEAH .
NOT FOR A LONG TIME ANYWAY .
NO PROBABLY NOT HUHUH .
SO UH UH HOW ABOUT WHAT IN PARTICULAR WOULD YOU THINK THAT UH WOMEN STILL OTHER THAN THE WORK PLACE WHERE WOMEN STILL ARE BEING UH OH YOU KNOW MUMBLEX FOUND WANTING YOU KNOW OR NOT RE AS HIGHLY REGARDED AS MEN WOULD BE UH I WAS JUST TRYING TO THINK OH I KNOW SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
MAYBE YOU COULD TE WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT WHAT DO YOU THINK TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THIS .
UHHUH .
THE UH THE UH THE ROLE OF WOMEN IN COMBAT ROLES DURING THE WAR .
OH OH .
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE NOW THERE THEY WANT THE ARMED FORCES TO RECOGNIZE THAT WOMEN CAN SERVE IN COMBAT ROLES .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND THE ONLY UH BRANCH IN THE ARMED FO SERVICES THAT SEEMS WILLING TO DO THAT IS THE AIR FORCE AND .
HUH .
UH I SPOKE BECAUSE WOMEN WERE FILING FLYING MISSIONS INTO YOU KNOW FOR WHATEVER REASON INTO UH IN THE PERSIAN GULF WAR .
YEAH YEAH .
AND SO BUT I KNOW SOME OF THE OTHER SERVICES DO NOT THINK THAT WOMEN ARE CAPABLE OF DOING THE JOB .
IT WAS REAL INTERESTING THEY WERE I WAS LISTENING TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS ON RA TELEVISION THE OTHER DAY .
UHHUH .
UH ABOUT IT AND UH ONE OF ONE OF THE MEN WHO WAS A I DO NOT KNOW IF HE WAS A GENERAL OR YOU KNOW WHAT HIS RANK WAS VERY HIGH .
UHHUH .
HE SAID MUMBLEX IT S JUST A PERSONAL THING WITH ME I MEAN I CAN NOT BE REAL YOU KNOW I CAN NOT TELL YOU WHY I FEEL THIS WAY BUT I JUST WOULD RATHER HAVE UH A MAN DOING SOME OF THESE JOBS THAN A WOMAN I THOUGHT WELL AT LEAST HE WAS HONEST BUT THAT DOES NOT SIT VERY WELL WITH A LOT OF FOLKS I AM SURE .
THERE S SOME MEN OUT THERE THAT ARE MORE FEMININE THAN MOST WOMEN .
YEAH RIGHT YOU KNOW NEIL WELL NEIL AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED AND MUMBLEX I COULD BE WRONG ABOUT THIS BUT THE ONLY ONE AREA WHERE A WOMAN COULD NOT DO IT IS IF SHE JUST PHYSICALLY DID NOT HAVE THE STRENGTH .
YEAH YEAH .
TO DO SOMETHING .
YEAH .
UH BECAUSE I WOULD THINK I THINK YOU KNOW MENTALLY UH AND EMOTIONALLY I THINK WOMEN CAN HANDLE A JOB AND .
OH I DO TOO .
EVERY BIT AS WELL SO .
UHHUH UHHUH .
ANYWAY IT S STILL MUMBLEX .
AND YOU KNOW IF SHE WANTED TO GO TO COMBAT .
SURE .
I DO NOT SEE THAT THEY SHOULD STOP HER I PERSONALLY WOULD NOT WANT TO GO BUT .
NO I WOULD NOT EITHER NO I AGREE BUT I AM SURE THAT THERE ARE WOMEN WHO WOULD WOULD RELISH THAT .
OH YEAH YEAH .
YOU KNOW KIND OF JOB SO .
UHHUH .
UH I GUESS THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION .
UHHUH .
AS WELL .
UHHUH .
SO WELL THIS IS AN INTERESTING TOPIC .
UM I HAVE YOU KNOW I HAVE HAVING A DAUGHTER WHO HAS GONE INTO THIS INTO ENGINEERING .
UHHUH .
I SORT OF WATCHED PROGRESS TO SEE IF SHE DID ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY THAN I DID .

WHAT WHAT HOW DO YOU GET YOUR MAIN SOURCE OF CURRENT EVENTS .
WELL UH UNTIL RECENTLY I WAS TAKING THE WALL STREET JOURNAL AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS A GOOD WAY BUT I HAVE ABOUT FIVE DIFFERENT MAGAZINES THAT I GET THAT KEEPS ME UP ON THINGS .
YOU KNOW IT S A WEEK OR TWO LATE BUT UH THAT S HOW I M STAYING UP .
I EITHER WATCH THE NEWS OR OR OCCASIONALLY I LL READ THE PAPER .
UH DO YOU LIKE HOW IT S PRESENTED ON THE NEWS .
UM NO I THINK THE MEDIA S A LITTLE BIT TOO MANIPULATIVE .
THEY ALLOW YOU UH THEY THEY TRY TO LEAD YOU TOO MUCH I BELIEVE AND SOMETIMES THEY RE NOT VERY OPEN I I DO NT KNOW I THINK THEY RE A LITTLE BIT BIASED SOMETIMES .
LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THE KENNEDY THE KENNEDY RAPE CASE .
THE COVERAGE ON THAT WAS YOU KNOW WHEN IT FIRST HAPPENED IT WAS HE WAS GUILTY HE WAS GUILTY HE WAS GUILTY .
YOU KNOW THEY TRY TO HAVE YOU FORM OPINIONS OR WHATEVER AND THEN I I DID NT LIKE THE THI THE THINGS .
THAT WERE GOING ON WHEN WE HAD DESERT STORM AND STUFF LIKE THAT .
YOU KNOW BASICALLY I I I THINK THEY DO NT PRESENT THE THE WHOLE SIDES OF OF EVERYTHING .
SO IT IT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE THEY RE UH WANTING YOU TO TAKE THEIR OPINION .
RIGHT .
IT S IT S IT S INSTEAD OF REPORTING THE NEWS IT S MORE LIKE AN EDITORIAL I BELIEVE .
YEAH .
ON A LOT OF ISSUES .
I VE NOTICED THAT TOO AND IT S KIND OF DISTRESSING IS NT IT .
YEAH .
AND THEY JUST I VE NOTICED THAT THEY DO IT JUST WITH SUBTLE LITTLE WORDS UH USUALLY UH JUST THAT SWAY THE WHOLE UH REPORT THAT YOU KNOW BY JUST A COUPLE OF WORDS .
WELL WHEN WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL I UM I WAS A COMMUNICATIONS MAJOR SO I I I M WELL AWARE OF THE LITTLE SUBTLE WORDS AND PERSUASIVE SPEAKING AND AND SO FORTH .
SO COMMUNICATIONS HUH .
WERE .
YOU LOOKING INTO BECOMING A REPORTER OR .
I WAS AND UM I WE I VENTURED OFF IN A WHOLE ENTIRE DIFFERENT FIELD FIELD .
I WENT WITH THE STATE .
UHHUH .
AND UH I UM WENT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE TREASURER IN RETIREMENT DISABILITY CALCULATE BENEFITS .
I BET THAT S A INTERESTING JOB .
YEAH .
SO THE SO AND YOU KNOW WORKING YOU KNOW WORKING FOR STATE GOVERNMENT .
YOU HEAR ALL ABOUT CURRENT EVENTS ABOUT THINGS GOING ON WITHIN THE STATE .
ITSELF .
SO THAT THAT S ANOTHER SOURCE THAT I I WHERE I KEEP UP WITH CURRENT EVENTS AND .
YEAH THERE S ONE THAT I M READING RIGHT NOW .
IT .
S INFORMATION WEEK .
IT SAYS A T AND T TO ACCOUNT FOR THE THE BENEFITS THAT THE .
A .
I C P .
A NOW SAYS YOU HAVE TO SHOW AS A LIABILITY .
IT S GOING TO COST THEM .
SEVEN POINT FIVE BILLION AFTER TAX CHARGE IN NINETYTHREE .
TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT .
IT S A LOT OF MONEY .
AND IT LL DROP THEIR EARNINGS BY A HUNDRED MILLION .
A YEAR FOREVER MORE .
IT S A LOT OF MONEY .
YEAH IT IS .
AND YEAH YOU HAVE TO STAY UP ON STUFF AND I BET IN YOUR YOUR JOB THAT YOU HAVE TO DO YOU READ THE WALL STREET JOURNAL .
NO WELL NO I I I PRIMARILY DEAL WITH THE STATE EMPLOYEES BUT I I FIND INTERESTING TIDBITS IN WHAT .
THE NEWS REPORTS AS FAR AS THE LIKE THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA S BUDGET AND STUFF LIKE THAT .
AND I REALLY KNOW WHAT .
THE BUDGET IS AND AND UH UH WHEN THEY WERE SAYING WE WERE SO POOR AND THEY COULD NT PAY TAXES AND PAY PEOPLE THEIR INCOME TAX REFUNDS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND YOU KNOW I M WELL AWARE OF THE BILLIONS OF ASSETS THAT THE STATE HAS AND IT IT S JUST FUNNY .
YOU KNOW SO THAT S THAT S THAT S SO I DO NT HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF FAITH IN IN YOU KNOW THE NEWS .
COURSE .
IT S THEY THEY GET WHAT .
THEY HEAR FROM BUT YOU KNOW IT S NOT ALWAYS I I THINK ONE HUNDRED PERCENT RELIABLE .
CAN YOU THINK OF ANYTHING .
THAT COULD BE DONE TO MAKE OUR NEWS MEDIA MORE ACCURATE AND OBJECTIVE .
I THINK THEY NEED TO DO A LITTLE BIT GO INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE DEPTH UH BEFORE THEY WOULD JUST REPORT LIKE SOMEBODY WANTS TO MAKE A STATEMENT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE I MEAN ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE UH AIDS ISSUE OR WHATEVER .
YOU KNOW SOMEONE SAID OH I FOUND A CURE .
THEY IMMEDIATELY THE HEADLINES ON THE NEWS OR WHATEVER IS SOMEONE SAYS THEY FOUND A CURE FOR AIDS .
AND THEN TWO MONTHS LATER IT S DISCOVERED IT S NOT YOU KNOW BEFORE THEY BEFORE THEY COME OUT WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT THEY NEED TO TO RESEARCH THE MATTER I BELIEVE A LITTLE BIT MORE .
I GUESS THEY DO THAT SO THEY DO NT GET SCOOPED YOU KNOW SO THEY HAVE THE BIG STORY .
WELL THAT WELL YEAH I I IT I THINK THE .
OKAY I DO NT DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION ON THAT ON THE U S R .
WELL THE I THINK I M I M SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE WHOLE THING UH AND A STILL A LITTLE BIT WORRIED ABOUT THEM BECAUSE OF THE HIS THE HISTORY OF RUSSIA .
UHHUH .
AND THEY RE IN A IN A STATE OF FLUX RIGHT NOW CHANGING UH E UH CHANGING A GREAT DEAL .
SURE .
PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC DISTRESS .
UHHUH SURE .
AND EVEN IN THAT SITUATION UH THE IT SEEMS LIKE TO ME FROM WHAT I VE READ IN IN THE HISTORY OF RUSSIA AND AND YOU KNOW DIFFERENT AUTHORS UH THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PARANOIA THEY VE ALWAYS SUSPECTED EVERYBODY AND .
SURE .
AND THAT S WHY THEY PUT YOU KNOW THAT S WHY THEY PUT A LOT OF PEOPLE IN PRISON FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND THAT S WHY THEY PUT A LOT OF PEOPLE TO DEATH .
SURE THAT HAPPENS .
YES BUT STALIN WAS A WAS A CLASSICAL EXAMPLE I GUESS OF THAT PARANOIA BECAUSE HE .
UHHUH .
HE PROBABLY KILLED MORE RUSSIANS THAN UH YOU KNOW THE RUSSIAN ARMY KILLED ANYBODY ELSE .
SURE I GUESS IN PARTICULAR MY VIEWPOINT IS THAT THEY FINANCIALLY CAN NOT GO INTO A WAR UH THEY ARE DESPERATE AT THIS POINT IN TIME TO KEEP THEIR COUNTRY TOGETHER BUT I COULD NOT FORESEE THEM SEVERING WHAT THEY HAVE WITH THE U S UM BECAUSE THEY NEED US AT THIS CURRENT TIME BECAUSE OF THEIR FINANCIAL SITUATION UM FROM WHAT I VE BEEN HEARING IS THE U S UH S R HAS BEEN UH ALMOST BANKRUPT FOR YEARS .
YEAH .
AND IT S PEOPLE ARE DESPERATE AND THERE MIGHT BE A REVOLUTION WITHIN THE PEOPLE BUT I DO NT THINK THE U S WOULD GET INVOLVED WITH IT BECAUSE UH THERE S TOO CLOSE OF TIES TO WHERE I THINK THEY UNDERSTAND THAT GORBACHEV IS TRYING TO MAKE A CHANGE AND THAT WE CAN NOT RUN THEM LIKE WE RUN THE U S .
SURE .
AND THAT THEY HAVE TO MAKE THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT DECISION SO I GUESS I REALLY HAVE NO FEAR AT ALL OF THE U S S R VERSES UH YOU GET THESE SMALL LITTLE UH PLACES LIKE IRAQ AND ALL OF THAT THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT I D BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS VERSES UH A SMALL UH OR AS BIG COUNTRY OF U S S R I I I HAVE NO FEELINGS THAT THEY WOULD EVER START A WAR WITH US BECAUSE TO THEM IT WOULD TOTALLY ELAT YOU KNOW IT WOULD TOTALLY DESTROY THEIR WHOLE COUNTRY BECAUSE OUR TECHNOLOGY IS FAR ADVANCED FROM WHAT THEIRS IS AT THIS CURRENT TIME .
YEAH .
SO I MEAN SURE THEY HAVE WEAPONS TO KILL US OVER AND OVER AND OVER BUT TO THEM THAT WOULD BE A SUICIDE AND THEY AND THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE ARE NOT SUICIDAL TYPE OF PEOPLE BUT IF YOU GET THE IRAQIS AND IRAN WHICH WILL DO IT FOR THE COUNTRY FOR THE PLEASURE OF YOU KNOW DOING WHATEVER UH FOR THEIR COUNTRY THEY LL DO IT UH .
YEAH YOU RE A I THINK YOU RE RIGHT .
THERE S A LITTLE MORE CRAZINESS DOWN THERE UH THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE I THINK ARE NOT THAT MUCH DIFFERENT .
SURE .
FROM US YOU KNOW I THINK THEY RE .
SURE .
THAT IT WOULD BE THE LEADERSHIP THAT I I UH MISTRUST .
UHHUH SURE I HAVE A DAUGHTER THAT S FRUSTRATED SHE S ON A A STOOL THAT SHE CAN GET UP ON .
YEAH .
BUT I IF SHE CA NT GET DOWN ON IT IT S LIKE GET ME DOWN RIGHT NOW .
BUT ANYWAY IT WAS REALLY GOOD TALKING TO YOU AND YOU HAVE A GOOD WEEKEND .
YOU TOO THANK YOU .
UHHUH THANK YOU BYE NOW .
BYEBYE .
I PUSHED IT .
OKAY .
SO HOW DO YOU USE YOUR CREDIT CARDS .
OH WE USE THEM FOR .
PAYING OUR GAS AND FOR PAYING UH JUST ABOUT ANYTHING BECAUSE UM WE DO NT LIKE TO PAY FOR OUR CHECKS SO WE USE IT QUITE A BIT .
UHHUH .
BUT WE WE PAY OFF EVERY MONTH THOUGH SO WE NEVER HAVE TO PAY INTEREST AND WE ALWAYS WE NEVER GET THE THE CREDIT CARDS IF THERE S A MONTHLY OR A YEARLY CHARGE WE ALWAYS GET IT THROUGH OUR BANK OR SOMEWHERE WHERE IT S FREE SO WE NEVER HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING EXTRA .
YEAH THAT S ME I WO NT USE ONE THAT I HAVE TO PAY AN ANNUAL FEE .
YEAH WE JUST DO NT THINK IT S WORTH IT SO .
YOU KNOW AND UM I M UH LIKE YOU I I USE IT WELL TO BUY MY GAS WITH MY SH MY SHELL CREDIT CARD I USE THAT AND THEN LIKE MY EMPORIUM CARD AND UH WEINSTOCKS CARD I USE THAT BUT I M LIKE YOU I USUALLY PAY IT OFF AS SOON AS I GET MY BILL WHY I DO NT JUST WRITE A CHECK I DO NT KNOW .
SEE WELL YOU I DO NT DO IT EITHER .
YOU KNOW IT S JUST REALLY WEIRD BUT I I DO NT CARRY A LOT OF CASH WITH ME BECAUSE I M .
YEAH .
ALWAYS AFRAID THAT SOMEONE S GOING TO STEAL MY PURSE .
YES EXACTLY THAT S HOW I FE I MEAN IT S A RARE DAY WHEN I EVEN HAVE SEVENTYFIVE CENTS IN MY PURSE .
YEAH YOU KNOW ENOUGH FOR A PHONE CALL AND THAT S ABOUT ALL .
YEAH .
BUT UH OTHER THAN THAT THAT S THE THAT S THE WAY I USE THEM I KNOW SOME PEOPLE THAT USES THEM SO BAD THAT EVERY ONE OF THEM THAT THEY VE GOT THEY C THEY CA NT CHARGE ANY MORE .
YOU KNOW AND I THINK THAT S TERRIBLE .
YEAH BECAUSE IT S REALLY IT HELPS YOUR IF YOU HAVE GOOD CREDIT YOU KNOW IT HELPS YOU IN THE LONG RUN WHEN YOU WANT TO GO MAKE A .
OH YEAH .
BIGGER PURCHASE OR SOMETHING .
YEAH BECAUSE IF ANYTHING EVER HAPPENS THAT YOU DO NEED TO YOU KNOW YOU HAVE EXCELLENT CREDIT WHY IT REALLY DOES HELP .
YEAH AND I THINK IT S MORE CONVENIENT TOO IN A LOT OF CASES LIKE WHENEVER WE GO ON TRIPS WE ALWAYS YOU KNOW USE OUR OUR VISA OR OUR MASTERCARD OR WHATEVER .
MUMBLEX YEAH .
AND THEN UM YOU KNOW WE REALLY DO NT HAVE TO PAY FOR IT OUT OF OUR OWN POCKETS UNTIL ABOUT A MONTH LATER .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND SO IT HELPS US GAIN INTEREST IN THE BANK THAT WHEN WE DO IT WE COME OUT A LIT EVEN A LITTLE BIT AHEAD BECAUSE WE VE BEEN ABLE TO USE WHATEVER FIRST OFF AND THEN PAY .
UHHUH UHHUH .
FOR IT LATER .
UHHUH YEAH WELL I THINK IT S BETTER TO USE CREDIT CARDS TOO LIKE I SAY BECAUSE YO THERE S SO MANY PEOPLE AROUND ANY MORE THAT S WATCHING WHAT YOU RE DOING .
OH YEAH .
AND IF YOU PULL A WAD OF MONEY OUT OF YOUR POCKET THEY RE GOING TO HIT YOU OVER THE HEAD .
YEAH EVEN IF IT S FIVE BUCKS EVEN .
I KNOW IT JUST UH YOU KNOW IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THEY RE SOMEBODY S ALWAYS WATCHING SO I JUST DO NT I DO NT CARRY MONEY I D JUST SOON USE MY CREDIT CARDS AND .
YEAH .
JUST PAY THEM OFF YOU KNOW .
AND ALSO IF YOU IF SOMEONE DID HAPPEN TO STEAL YOUR CREDIT CARD MY HUSBAND WAS SAYING THAT IF YOU KNOW YOU NOTICE IT WITHIN I THINK IT S TWENTYFOUR HOURS YOU CAN REPORT IT IN AND I HE SAID THE MOST YOU D EVER HAVE TO PAY IS FIFTY DOLLARS FOR THEM TO CANCEL YOU KNOW WHATEVER PAYMENTS YOU HAD AND IF .
RIGHT .
WHOEVER TRIED TO UH YOU KNOW CREDIT IT TO THE HILT YOU D ONLY HAVE TO PAY FIFTY DOLLARS OF IT AND THEN .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW YOU CAN HAVE YOUR CARD BACK WITH .
YEAH RIGHT .
PRETTY GOOD RATING YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU CAN PAY FIFTY DOLLARS BUT NOT YOU KNOW .
YEAH RIGHT .
MAYBE FIVE THOUSAND OR WHATEVER .
AND YOU KNOW SOME OF THOSE STORES DO NT EVEN SEEM TO CHECK YOUR SIGNATURE OR ANYTHING .
I KNOW .
YOU KNOW I DO NT KNOW WHY THEY DO NT UNLESS YOU HAVE TO SPEND A CERTAIN AMOU I DO NT KNOW BUT I NOTICE THAT SOME OF THEM DO NT EVEN LOOK YOU KNOW THEY JUST SLIDE IT IN THERE AND PASS IT BACK TO YOU .
YEAH EXACTLY .
YOU KNOW SO I DO NT THINK THAT S RIGHT I THINK THEY SHOULD CHECK IT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SIGNATURE AT LEAST MATCHES YOU KNOW .
YEAH SURE I MEAN IT S JUST A PRECAUTION FOR EVERYBODY .
UHHUH UHHUH .
YEAH SO .
WELL LET S SEE WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY ABOUT CREDIT CARDS .
UM .
UM .
OH I ALSO USE LIKE TO USE DISCOVER WHEN I CAN BECAUSE THEY GIVE YOU SOME MONEY BACK EVERY YEAR .
YEAH I DO NT I DO NT UH THAT THAT S THAT SEARS DISCOVERY CARD IS THAT WHAT THAT .
YEAH YEAH .
YEAH NOW I DO NT HAVE THAT ONE YOU KNOW .
WELL WE JUST STARTED DOING THAT AND .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW WHAT IT COMES IN HANDY FOR WHEN YOU RE BUYING THINGS LIKE UM TICKETS FOR THE TRAIN OR UM AIRPLANES .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE THEY LL GIVE YOU SOME MONEY BACK YOU KNOW AND IT S ONLY A LITTLE BIT BUT I MEAN IT S STILL SOMETHING WE GOT TWO FIFTY LAST YEAR .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND SO IT S YOU KNOW IT HELPS OUT HERE AND THERE SO .
OH YOU MEAN UH FOR FOR YOUR USING YOUR CREDIT CARD YOU GET LIKE A REBATE OR SOMETHING .
YEAH THEY GIVE YOU I THINK THEY START GIVING YOU LIKE A HALF A PERCENT BACK WHICH DOES NT SOUND LIKE A THING BUT WHEN YOU YOU KNOW WHEN YOU ADD UP EVERYTHING YOU VE YOU VE CHARGED UP ON THE DISCOVER CARD FOR A YEAR .
UHHUH .
AND THEY GIVE YOU A HALF PERCENT OF THAT AND THAT ADDS UP TO YOU KNOW TWO FIFTY OR SOMETHING .
OH I SEE .
AND SO THAT S WHAT AND I KNOW WE RE GOING TO GET BACK MORE THIS YEAR BECAUSE THEY YOU KNOW WE SPENT A LITTLE BIT MORE .
UHHUH .
PROBABLY AND THEY DO IT FOR HOW LONG YOU VE BEEN A MEMBER I THINK TOO .
UM I SEE .
AND THEY INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE A LITTLE BIT .
YEAH WELL I LL .
OKAY .
OKAY I I DO A FAIR AMOUNT OF COOKING .
UHHUH .
AND AND I LOVE HAVING GUESTS TO DINNER I PROBABLY DO THAT ABOUT ONCE A MONTH AND UH I USUALLY PREPARE SOMETHING DEPENDING UPON THE GUESTS YOU KNOW IT IT I LIKE TO PREPARE CHICKEN THAT SEEMS TO PLEASE EVERYBODY PASTA OR A CASSEROLE .
UHHUH .
HOW ABOUT YOU .
YEAH THOSE ARE THINGS I LIKE THE MOST I LIKE FISH AND CHICKEN THE MOST .
UM .
AND UH MOST OF THE COOKING I DO JUST COMES OUT OF A CAN .
UH .
UNLESS IT IS UNLESS IT IS I CATCH A FISH AND I PREPARE IT AND THEN I JUST UH YOU KNOW I JUST BROIL IT AND PUT LEMON ON IT .
UHHUH WELL THAT S ABOUT THE WAY I PREPARE MOST FISH .
UHHUH .
UH I MADE SCALLOPS THE OTHER NIGHT THAT WAS UNUSUAL AND UH BASICALLY UH I FOUND A RECIPE TO MAKE IT IN THE MICROWAVE AND YOU SPRINKLED UH YOU SWISHED AROUND A LITTLE MELTED BUTTER AND DO UH OH I DO NOT KNOW MICRO MICROWAVED THEM FOR ABOUT NINE MINUTES NO NO FOUR AND A HALF TO FIVE MINUTES AND YOU HAD TO ADD SESAME SEEDS AND BREAD CRUMBS ON TOP VERY SIMPLE BUT VERY NICE SO IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A FRENCH RECIPE THAT WAS GOOD .
SESAME SEEDS AND BREAD CRUMBS .
SESAME SEEDS AND BREAD CRUMBS .
UHHUH .
AND UH MY HUSBAND LIKED IT .
YEAH .
AND UH NO UNFORTUNATELY SCALLOPS ARE ONE OF THE MORE EXPENSIVE UH FISH ITEMS .
RIGHT UHHUH .
BUT YOU KNOW I I LOOK FOR THEM TO GO ON SALE AT THE GROCERY STORE UH ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE TO DO EAT OUT HOW ABOUT YOU .
OH YEAH UHHUH .
DO YOU HAVE ANY PARTICULAR PLACES YOU LIKE GOING .
OH THERE S A RESTAURANT CALLED STRING BEAN ON SPRING VALLEY AND CENTRAL .
UHHUH .
I LIKE THAT IT S JUST IT S JUST HOME COOKING .
YES I HAVE BEEN THERE .
UHHUH .
AND UH IT S KIND OF KIND OF LIKE BLACK EYE PEA BUT I DO NOT THINK IT S A CHAIN .
RIGHT EXACTLY UHHUH AND THAT S THAT S THE OTHER RESTAURANT MUMBLEX BLACK EYE PEA .
OH .
SO I DO NOT REALLY LIKE UH YOU KNOW UH UH CHILI PLACES OR WHAT IS IT JUDGE ROY BEAN S OR .
OH YEAH .
I DO NOT LIKE GREASY PLACES .
YEAH I I DO NOT FEEL LIKE THEY ARE VERY HEALTHY AND I ALWAYS .
YEAH .
FEEL LIKE THE HOME COOKING PLACES ARE ARE THE HEALTHIEST MEALS YOU KNOW I TEND TO HAVE CHICKEN FRIED STEAK WHEN I GO GO TO THEM .
RIGHT AND I AND I GOT UH CHICKEN MARINARA THE LAST TWO TIMES .
OH HOW WAS IT .
IT WAS UH IT WAS GREAT .
UM .
BECAUSE THAT S THAT S WHAT I LIKE I DO NOT LIKE IT YOU KNOW I JUST LIKE A BAKED YOU KNOW A PIECE OF CHICKEN AND THEN I GET LIKE GREEN BEANS AND MASHED POTATOES .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
I I TEND TO UH I GET TEASED BY MY FAMILY A LOT BECAUSE UH I LIKE EXPERIMENTING ON ON FOOD AND SOMETIMES I GO FOR EX FAIRLY EXOTIC THINGS AND MY FATHER TEASES ME ABOUT GOURMET COOKING .
UHHUH .
WHICH IS NOT ALWAYS TRUE BUT AND THE THING ABOUT EXPERIMENTING WITH COOKING OR ANYTHING ELSE IS THAT SOME OF THE EXPERIMENTS FAIL .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
UH THE LAST TIME WE HAD SOME UH FRIENDS OVER FOR DINNER I TRIED A DESSERT THAT SOUNDED WONDER WONDERFUL IN THE RECIPE AND IT WAS JUST A TOTAL BUST I WAS .
YEAH .
SORRY I DID NOT HAVE ICE CREAM TO FALL BACK ON .
YEAH MY UH MY BROTHER TRIED TO MAKE UH A BUNCH OF THINGS UH WAY BACK HE TRIED TO MAKE BAGELS ONE TIME .
OH MY THAT S AMBITIOUS .
YEAH AND UH WE TOOK SOME AND THEN WE HAD UH GERMAN SHEPHERDS AT THE TIME AND WE TOOK SOME AND GAVE IT TO THE DOGS AND THE DOG NEVER YOU KNOW HE TREATED IT LIKE A MILK BONE AND HE NEVER DID FINISH IT .
UM .
HE JUST BARELY MADE A DENT IN IT .
YEAH .
UH AND UH THEN HE TRIED TO MADE GRAPEFRUIT CITRON ONE TIME .
UHHUH .
IT S UH SUPPOSED TO BE CANDY .
YEAH .
AND UH IT IT DID NOT TURN OUT VERY WELL IT WAS YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
IT LIKE MADE CONCENTRATED ALL THE ACID OF THE GRAPEFRUIT INTO UH INTO A KIND OF A CANDY STICK SO UH .
HUH SEE I AM NOT THAT S INTERESTING ONE OF THE THINGS I DO NOT MAKE IS DESSERT .
UHHUH .
AND UH MY HUSBAND ACCUSES ME OF PUTTING HIM THROUGH DESSERT DEPRAVATION BECAUSE UH YOU KNOW WE HAVE ICE CREAM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND THAT S WHY WHEN I TOOK DID THIS EXPERIMENT FOR THE COMPANY WE HAD ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO .
UHHUH .
IT WAS JUST A TOTAL FIASCO .
HUH .
UH EVERYTHING ELSE WAS FINE BUT THAT WAS A FIASCO .
WELL YOU HAVE TO PUT EGGS AND EVERYTHING DO NT YOU OR .
UH YEAH .
YEAH JUST ABOUT .
YEAH AND I I ALSO DO NT HAVE MUCH OF A SWEET TOOTH SO I CAN LIVE WITHOUT LIVE WITHOUT DESSERT FOR THE MOST PART .
UHHUH USE ABOUT HALF THE SUGAR OR MAKE EVERYTHING DIET .

UHHUH YEAH BUT YOU KNOW THERE S HARDLY ANY I GUESS THERE S HARDLY ANY PROTEIN IT S MOSTLY STARCH SO IT FILLS YOU UP AND THEN THE CHEESE HAS TO MAKE UP FOR WHATEVER THE PROTEIN YOU GET .
YEAH I DID I DID NOT SAY IT WAS NOURISHING BUT IT WAS SATISFYING .
OH YEAH IT REALLY IS .
AND .
THEN YOU HAVE TO MAKE A SALAD OR .
YEAH YEAH THA BUT YOU KNOW MUMBLEX I NEVER REALLY ENJOYED COOKING FOR MYSELF SO I ATE VERY SIMPLY .
UHHUH .
AND I WAS THAT S WHY I THINK THAT S ONE REASON I LIKE HAVING PEOPLE OVER BECAUSE I COULD TRY THINGS I MEAN I MUST BE A FRUSTRATED CHEMIST OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
RIGHT .
CAUSE COOKING IS A LITTLE BIT LIKE LIKE BEING IN A CHEMISTRY LAB .
UHHUH .
AND UH .
EXCEPT YOU GET TO TASTE THE PRODUCT INSTEAD MUMBLEX .
YES AND HAVE AN EXPLOSION .
FILL THEM UP OR BLOW UP .
SOMETIMES IT BLOWS UP ANYWAY .

OH YEAH .
AND UH THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS WHEN I OPENED THE CAN IT JUST FLEW ALL OVER THE PLACE IT WAS ON THE CEILING ON THE WALLS AND ME AND AND THE BOY FRIEND THOUGHT .

WELL THAT S TOO BAD A SIXTYSEVEN CHEV UH MUSTANG IS ABOUT THE UH TOP TOP YEAR FOR THE MUSTANG CAR .
YEAH IT WAS FUN THOUGH IT WAS FUN I I REALLY ENJOYED IT AND I WAS SURPRISED AT AT UH THE AVAILABILITY OF PARTS YET .
YES .
YOU KNOW YOU CAN YOU CAN STILL GET FACTORY ORIGINAL PARTS .

BUT UH YOU PAY A PREMIUM BUT YOU JUST DO NT GET THEM I I DID NT I WENT AHEAD AND GOT YOU KNOW JAPANESE MADE DUPLICATES OR WHEREVER THEY WERE MADE CANADA .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW PREFABS AND ALL THAT STUFF BUT .
WELL YOU KNOW THAT S THAT S FINE I I DO NT THINK THAT THERE WOULD BE UH YOU KNOW A A QUALITY DIFFERENCE I DO NT KNOW YOU WOULD NT YOU DID NT NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE DID YOU .
WELL ACTUALLY THERE WAS .
OH .
AND UH I HAD HEARD RUMORS THAT IT WAS BECAUSE THEY COULD NT DUPLICATE CERTAIN PATTERNS UH EXACTLY .
UHHUH .
AND SO LIKE THE THE GLOVE BOX WAS JUST A LITTLE .
LITTLE WIDER .
OH DEAR .
LITTLE HARDER TO FIT IN AND .
UHHUH .
THE CARPETING UH STRETCHED A LITTLE TOO FAR I HAD TO CUT SOME OF THE SIDES DOWN .
OH DEAR .
BUT JUST JUST LITTLE THINGS YOU KNOW ONE OF THE SCREWS ON ON THE DOOR REGULAT UH WINDOW REGULATORS YOU COULD GET THREE OF THE THREE OF THE FOUR TO LINEUP THE FOURTH ONE YOU COULD NT GET TO LINEUP NO MATTER WHAT YOU DID .
OH .
YOU KNOW THIN .
I BET THAT WAS FRUSTRATING WAS NT IT .
OH IT WAS BUT .
THE END RESULT IS AFTER YOU PUT YOUR YOUR PANELS ON NOBODY SEES THAT YOU GOT ONE SCREW MISSING IN YOUR YOUR WINDOW REGULATOR ANYWAY AND .
RIGHT RIGHT .
IT IT RUNS IT WORKS JUST THE SAME SO .
YEAH THAT S THAT S TRUE WELL YOU KNOW THAT THAT IS SOMETHING I REALLY ENJOY DOING UM WORKING ON OUR CAR TOO THE UH I JUST CHANGED MY OIL OIL TONIGHT BUT UH I ENJOY ALSO WORKING ON THINGS LIKE THE BRAKES AND UH IN FACT JUST TWO WEEKS AGO I HELPED MY NEIGHBOR OUT ON HIS BRAKES ON HIS CAR AND UH EITHER IF IT S A DRUM OR OR DISC BRAKES I ENJOY WORKING ON THOSE KIND OF THINGS .
DISC BRAKES DO NT SEEM TO GIVE ME TOO MUCH PROBLEM BUT I I HONESTLY DO NT HAVE THE TOOLS FOR THE DRUM I KNOW YOU GOT UH CERTAIN SPRING LEVER THAT YOU GOT TO HAVE OR SOME UH .
YEAH SPOONS AND .
SOME SPRING PULLEY OR SOMETHING THAT YOU GOT TO PULL THAT SPRING BACK OVER ONTO THAT NOTCH .
YES YOU DO .
UH MY DAD HAS GOT ALL THAT AND AND I I HELPED HIM WHEN I WAS GROWING UP .

YEAH .
BECAUSE OF THE DRUM BRAKES I YOU KNOW DO NT HAVE ANY CHOICE BUT TO TAKE THEM IN .
YEAH THAT S TRUE AND YOU KNOW IT IT DOES NT DOES NT HURT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE TO HAVE THEM DONE PROFESSIONALLY TOO BECAUSE UM I WAS HELPING MY NEIGHBOR OUT AND ONE OF HIS DRUMS NEEDED TO BE RESURFACED AND I DO NT HAVE OF COURSE THE EQUIPMENT TO DO THAT .
SURE .
SO HE TOOK IT INTO A SHOP AND HAD IT RESUR UH RESURFACED AND AND FIXED THAT WAY BUT YEAH IT IS TRUE UH YOU KNOW I DID HAVE A SIXTYFOUR FORD TRUCK THAT I WISH I STILL HAD AND LOVED TO GET INSIDE THAT AND TINKER AROUND WITH IT AND WORK WITH IT .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE YOU DID NT HAVE ALL THE EXTRA EXTRA STUFF .
THAT S IN THERE NOW .
I LL TELL YOU WHAT THE OTHER THE NICEST THING ABOUT THEM IS UH EVERYTHING WAS STANDARD YOU DID NT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT FINDING A METRIC ANYTHING .
OH YEAH .
BOY I TELL YOU .
AND YOU KNOW .
TELL ME .
WHAT .
YOU THINK ABOUT THE VIETNAM WAR .
OKAY .
WELL I M A VIETNAM ERA VETERAN AND UH I WAS UH FORTUNATE NOT TO HAVE TO SERVE IN THE THEATER HOWEVER MY SUPPORT ROLL IN THE SERVICE WAS TO SUPPORT THOSE IN THE THEATER OF OPERATION .
UH I M OF THE OLD SCHOOL .
THAT BELIEVES THAT UH THE UH UH CONTRACTS THAT WE MADE BACK YEARS AGO NEEDED TO BE HONORED .
HOWEVER UH I THINK WE COULD HAVE EXECUTED THE WAR AND GOTTEN IT OVER A WHOLE LOT QUICKER .
UH BUT THOSE ARE MY PERSONAL THOUGHTS AND I THINK THAT IF WE D LET THE GENERALS RUN THE WAR LIKE WE LET THE GENERALS RUN WORLD WAR TWO .
WE D HAD GOT IT OVER A WHOLE LOT QUICKER AND LOST A LOT FEWER PEOPLE .
BUT AS IT WAS THE POLITICIANS RAN THE THE KOREAN CONFLICT AND ULTIMATELY THE VIETNAM THING AND WE MANAGED TO COME OUT UH LOSERS ALL THE WAY AROUND .
AND SO THIS IS WHAT TRIGGER ULTIMATELY TRIGGERED US UH UNITED STATES UH PER SE BEING UH DECIDING TO GET OUT OF THE ROLE OF WORLD POLICEMAN .
YOUR VIEWS .
UH AS I UNDERSTAND IT AND I UH DO NT KNOW A LOT ABOUT IT UH WE GOT IN THERE BECAUSE OF FRANCE .
WELL .
UH FRANCE WAS THERE FIRST .
THEY HAD .
WE GOT INTO IT BECAUSE OF SEATO AGREEMENT BACK JUST RIGHT AFTER WORLD WAR TWO THAT UH WE PLEDGED A MUTUAL UH UH DEFENSE OF OF THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE AND AS IT TURNED OUT THEY WERE IN A CIVIL WAR ONE WITH ANOTHER AND REALLY WE .
I I QUESTION US YOU KNOW NOW OF COURSE HINDSIGHT IS ALL TOO CLEAR .
SURE .
UH SO WE RE WE WE HAVE TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH WITH THE UH SITUATION AS AS WE PLAYED IT .
JERRY WHAT DID YOU THINK OF PEOPLE LIKE UH JANE FONDA ANOTHER WAR AN ANTIWAR ACTIVIST .
I DO NT GET ME STARTED ON THOSE PEOPLE .
YOU KNOW BEFORE SHE BEFORE JANE FONDA DID DID WHAT .
SHE DID I THOUGHT SHE WAS A WONDERFUL PERSON BUT AFTER UH UH WELL I I JUST DO NT HAVE ANYTHING WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH HER .
ANY MORE BECAUSE YOU SUPPORT UH YOU SUPPORT YOUR GOVERNMENT .
RIGHT OR WRONG .
UH OKAY RIGHT OR WRONG I DO NT THINK IS IS WE CAN DETERMINE WHETHER WE WERE RIGHT OR WRONG BECAUSE YOU RE YOU RE HAVING TO DEAL WITH AGAIN UH I THINK WE COULD HAVE MADE A DIFFERENT AGREEMENT .
UHHUH .
BACK IN FOR THE FOR THE LATE FORTIES ERA .
THAT WOULD HAVE KEPT MUMBLEX OF THERE .
UH YOU KNOW I I DID NT REALIZE THAT WE D SIGNED SOME TYPE OF DEAL LIKE THAT .
I THOUGHT WE CAME IN AS FIRST ADVISORS TO THE FRENCH AND THEN THEY DECIDED TO PULL OUT AND .
CAN YOU HOLD JUST A SECOND TERRY .
SURE .
ONE MOMENT PLEASE .
SURE .
WONDER WHAT HAPPENS TO THIS LITTLE BEASTIE ON CALL WAITING OR SOMETHING .
HUH FASCINATING .
WELL THAT S NOT .
SORRY FOR THE DELAY .
THAT S OKAY .
UH YEAH THIS IS THE UH THE THE UH MUTUAL DEFENSE THING WAS UH WE WE IT WAS COMPLICATED AND I DO NT THINK EVERYBODY KNOWS THE WHOLE SITUATION .
I DO NT .
BUT FROM WHAT .
I CAN GATHER IS WE WENT AND SAID YEAH WE WILL HELP THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE UH SHOULD THEY ASK .
WELL THE FRENCH WENT IN AND TRIED THEIR OLD STYLE WARFARE AND UH GOT SOUNDLY THRASHED .
AND WE DID NT DO A WHOLE LOT BETTER .

OH I SEE .
THAT S HOW KIND OF I AM TOO .
ARE YOU MARRIED .
UM YES .
YOU ARE .
YES .
I THINK THE WOMEN FOR THE MOST PART END UP MANAGING THE MONEY .
MY HUSBAND ALWAYS SAYS HE EARNS IT AND I HAVE TO SPEND ONLY WHAT .
HE EARNS .
IT .
I DO NT MIND THE SPENDING IT S JUST THAT TRYING TO TRYING TO GET WHAT .
YOU NEED OUT OF OUT OF WHAT .
YOU HAVE .
THAT SEEMS TO BE OUR CHALLENGE .
WELL I DO NT WORK OUTSIDE OF THE HOME AND HE ALWAYS THREATENS THAT WHEN I SPEND MORE THAN .
WHAT S COMING IN I HAVE TO GO BACK TO WORK .
I SEE .
SO I I MANAGE IT .
WELL I M I M AT HOME ALSO SO IT DOES GET RATHER INTERESTING TRYING TO SURVIVE ON ONE SALARY UH .
NOW DO YOU ACTUALLY FOLLOW A BUDGET .
WELL WE PRETTY WELL DO .
UM SEVERAL YEARS WE DID NT AND WE FOUND THAT WE JUST WERE NT MAKING THE MOST OF WHAT .
WE HAD AND SO WE WE UM SET ASIDE A CERTAIN AMOUNT .
EACH WEEK .
THAT GOES FOR THINGS .
THAT HAVE TO BE PAID FOR YOU KNOW JUST OUR BILLS .
AND THEN WHAT S LEFT WE .
DIVVY UP .
WE TRY TO SAVE A LITTLE BIT ALTHOUGH WE RE NOT ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL AND THEN THE REST OF IT JUST GOES FOR NORMAL WEEKLY NEEDS .
WELL THAT S PRETTY MUCH THE WAY .
WE DO UM OR WE DID IN THE PAST I WOULD SAY .
UH AT THIS POINT OUR CHILDREN ARE GROWN AND SO I REALLY DO NT HAVE THE OBLIGATIONS .
THERE .
ANY MORE .
YEAH .
THAT WE HAVE TO BALANCE TO .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW GET THINGS TOGETHER FOR THEM AND I REALLY JUST KEEP VERY GOOD RECORDS AND MOST OF OUR EXPENSES ARE FAIRLY THE SAME EVERY MONTH WITH THE EXCEPTION OF UTILITIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND .
RIGHT .
I TRY TO KEEP MY MASTERCARDS AND THINGS PAID CURRENTLY .
UHHUH .
UH I DO NT ALWAYS SUCCEED AT THAT .
I USUALLY KEEP ONE WITH A LOW INTEREST RATE AND I PUT THINGS ON THERE THAT I THINK I M NOT GOING TO GET TO .
RIGHT .
AND THEN I HAVE ANOTHER ONE BUT FOR THE MOST PART OUR MORTGAGE AND OUR UTILITIES AT THIS POINT WE RE IN A NEW HOME AND UH THEY TAKE A PRETTY BIG CHUNK COMPARED TO WHAT .
THEY USED TO .
YEAH .
SO I M STILL GETTING USED TO THAT BUT WE MAKE SURE THAT WE JUST DO NOT BUY UNLESS WE REALLY CAN SEE HOW WE RE GOING TO PAY FOR IT AHEAD .
RIGHT .
AND WE DO NOT BUY US NEW CARS .
UH DO YOU GET INTO CAR .
WELL WE HAD NEW CARS UM ALWAYS UNTIL ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO MY HUSBAND UM OWNED HIS OWN COMPANY AND IT WENT UNDER AND SO WE COULD NO LONGER AFFORD THAT MONTHLY PAYMENT AND NOW IT JUST SEEMS JUST SUCH A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY TO SPEND THAT THAT WE DO HAVE A USED CAR WELL HE HAS A COMPANY CAR ALSO BUT FOR OUR PERSONAL CAR .
WE HAVE A USED CAR .
UM DO YOU THINK THAT IT S WISER TO BUY USED .
WE DO FOR US VERY MUCH SO .
IN FACT WE ARE IN A POSITION THAT MOST OF OUR FRIENDS WHY WONDER WHY WE JUST DO NT GO TO A NEW CAR YOU KNOW WHATEVER AND I SAID .
RIGHT .
LOOK YOU .
GUYS ARE ALL INTO CAR PAYMENTS WE HAVE NT HAD CAR PAYMENTS FOR SO MANY YEARS I LOVE IT .
THIS WAY AND RECENTLY WE JUST CREATED THE LAUGH AMONG EVERYONE BECAUSE WE HAD A CAR THAT WE REALLY LIKED AND IT HAS EIGHTYTWO THOUSAND MILES ON IT .
UHHUH .
AND WE WERE KEPT SAYING WOULD NT IT BE GREAT IF WE COULD FIND ANOTHER .
ONE JUST LIKE IT .
BELIEVE IT OR NOT WE DID WE FOUND ONE ONE NEWER .

THE WORST PART IS IT S THE SAME COLOR .
UHHUH .
AND SO EVERYBODY S SAYING YOU RE KIDDING .
YOU HAVE TWO CARS .
THE SAME AND I SAID YOU KNOW HOW WHEN YOU HAVE A BAD ONE YOU SAY NEVER AGAIN .
THAT S RIGHT .
I SAID WELL WE HAD ONE AND WE FOUND ONE WITH JUST SEVENTEEN THOUSAND MILES ON IT .
WOW .
AND IT S AN EIGHTYFIVE AND SO I SAID HEY THIS WAS A CINCH WE PAID FOR THE CAR AND WE STILL KNOW NOW THAT WE HAVE THIS CAR TO PUT ALL THE MILES ON .

THIS IS FOR ALL THE LONG RUNNING BACK AND FORTH ON YOU KNOW INTERSTATE DRIVING AND THINGS AND WE INTEND TO REPLACE OUR OTHER ONE WITH A MUCH NEWER CAR IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS OR NEXT YEAR PROBABLY .
DO YOU UM BUY FROM DEALERS OR FROM INDIVIDUALS .
GENERALLY FROM DEALERS AND UH IT DEPENDS BECAUSE I DO NT LIKE TO SELL WHAT .
WE RE TRADING IN TO AN INDIVIDUAL .
RIGHT .
UH UNLESS WE WE HAVE DONE THAT WHEN WE HAD A REALLY GOOD .

THAT WILL LAST TOO .
NO THIS AREA UP HERE IS UH ALL CUSTOM HOMES AND .
RIGHT .
IT S I DO NT THINK THAT MANY BY THE BUILDER .
THAT BUILT THIS HOUSE .
AND WE WERE NOT THE FIRST PEOPLE THE FIRST OWNERS I THINK WE ARE THE THIRD OWNERS .
UH OKAY .
IT WAS BUILT BY THE ARCHITECT FOR HIMSELF WHO NEVER MOVED INTO IT .
WHO SOLD IT TO A COUPLE .
WHO HAD NO IDEA THAT HOMES EVER NEEDED UPKEEP .
OH NO .
OH YEAH CAULKING WINDOWS WAS A GREAT MYSTERY TO THEM .
OH GEE .
SO THEY JUST WATCHED THE WATER POUR IN ON THE CARPET .
BUT IT S A SHARIF MYNEER HOMES IF THAT MEANS ANYTHING IT DID NOT REALLY MEAN ANYTHING TO ME EXCEPT .
I I .
I LIKED IT .
KEPT THINKING OF OMAR SHARIF .
EVERY TIME .
I SAW THAT NAME SOMEWHERE SO .
HE BUILDS EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR HOUSES NOW .
I THINK HE GOT OUT OF THE LOWER END MARKET .
UH .
AND DECIDED BUT THE HOUSES HERE IN IN THIS CLASS OF HOUSING NEVER DROPPED BELOW TWO HUNDRED .
OH WOW .
YEAH WELL BUT STILL I KNOW THAT THIS ONE WAS BUILT FOR TWO NINETY NINE WHICH IS NOWHERE NEAR WHAT .
WE PAID FOR IT .
RIGHT .
AND I THINK SOMEBODY TOLD ME .
IT S ALSO ON A CREEK SIDE LOT HEAVILY WOODED OFF THE GOLF COURSE .
OH GREAT .
YEAH AND THE GUY AROUND THE CORNER IS BEING TRANSFERRED SO HE SAID UH WELL HE DID COMPARABLES THAT IT S ABOUT EIGHTY DOLLARS LET S SEE WHAT I DO NT REMEMBER IF HE SAID IT WAS SIXTY DOLLARS .
A SQUARE FOOT .
WELL .
OFF THE CREEK AND EIGHTY ON THE CREEK .
YEAH .
OR IF IT WAS EIGHTY AND A HUNDRED .
PROBABLY EIGHTY .
I THINK IT WAS SIXTY EIGHTY .
SIXTY EIGHTY .
I THINK .
WELL BECAUSE I KNOW OUR OUR LITTLE HOUSE OVER HERE STUCK IN THE MIDDLE OF YOU KNOW THE SUBDIVISION IS I THINK FIFTY FIVE SO I THINK THE HIGH END IS DEFINITELY YOU KNOW SOMEWHERE THERE .
WELL TRY AND THINK IF IT WAS A HUNDRED DOLLARS .
A SQUARE FOOT .
NO IT COULD NOT BE BECAUSE THIS HOUSE HAS AROUND THIRTY FOUR HUNDRED SQUARE FEET AND IT WOULD NEVER SELL FOR THREE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS .
YEAH .
JUST NEVER .
WELL .
NOW MAYBE YOU KNOW THAT S PRETTY CLOSE TO WHAT .
IT WOULD HAVE SOLD FOR UH BRAND NEW OR THAT S PRETTY MUCH WHAT .
IT WAS BUILT FOR .
IT .
S GOT AN AWFUL LOT OF NICE THINGS IN IT BUT YOU KNOW I DO NT THINK I THINK IT S GOING TO BE A LONG TIME IF EVER WHEN NICE THINGS AND REALLY QUALITY CONSTRUCTION AND ALL THE OTHER ADDITIONAL AMENITIES ARE REALLY UH DESIRABLE .
IT .
S SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE GO FOR SQUARE FOOTAGE ONLY NOW .
YEAH .
AND UH CAUSE .
HAVE YOU BEEN BACK TO THE PERRY HOMES BACK HERE .
UM THE ONES .
THAT LOOK LIKE BRICK HOUSES .
THE ONE .
THAT LOOKS LIKE MONOPOLY APARTMENTS .
RIGHT .
YEAH I THINK THOSE ARE AWFUL .
I M SORRY I JUST DO NT SEE THE DESIGNER S I JUST SEE HIM AS TRYING TO SQUISH AS MUCH SPACE YOU KNOW AS MUCH HOUSE INTO THE SPACE AS POSSIBLE .
THEY ARE HUGE WHEN YOU ARE INSIDE THEM .
YEAH .
THEY ARE VERY SPACIOUS .
THEY ARE YOU KNOW I WAS MUMBLEX I WAS IN ONE TODAY .
IT WAS FORTY TWO HUNDRED SQUARE FEET .
UH .
YEAH .
UHHUH .
WELL SEE THAT S THE HOUSE THAT WE GOT IS SMALL ENOUGH SO MY HUSBAND AND I BECAUSE THERE S JUST THE TWO OF US AND THE TWO CATS UM CAN YELL AT EACH OTHER FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER AND BE HEARD .
AND WE THOUGHT THAT WAS IMPORTANT INSTEAD OF GETTING SWALLOWED UP IN SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW .
SEE WHEN YOU HAVE KIDS YOU LIKE TO BE ABLE TO .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
SEND THEM .
SOME PLACE WHERE THEY CAN YELL AND YOU WO NT HEAR THEM .
BUT I HAVE BEEN WATCHING THESE HOUSES GO UP AND I I DO NT WELL SOMEBODY WAS TELLING ME I KNOW SOMEBODY .
WHO LIVES BACK THERE I HAVE ALWAYS QUESTIONED THE QUALITY OF CONSTRUCTION AND I I DO NT THINK THEY EXCEED MORE THAN TWELVE NAILS PER HOUSE .
OH .
WHEN YOU WATCH THEM GO UP YOU ARE JUST AMAZED THAT THEY DO NOT FALL OVER .
YEAH .
AND IT TAKES THEM .
SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY DAYS TO COMPLETE A HOUSE .
OH THAT S AMAZING .
RIGHT NOW IN FACT EVEN AS WE SPEAK WE ARE HAVING A DECK PUT ON IN BACK AND THESE GUYS ARE PHENOMENAL .
THEY JUST THEY THEY ARE DOING SUCH A TERRIFIC JOB BACK THERE I MEAN YOU KNOW YOU PAY FOR IT TOO BUT IT S IT S LIKE REALLY WORTH IT .
THEY ARE PUTTING IN A DECK .
UHHUH .
A REDWOOD DECK AND IT S JUST THEY ARE DOING SUCH A FINE FINE JOB .
WE HAVE GOT .
I M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IT .
THREE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF DECKING BECAUSE .
UHHUH .
THIS LOT SLOPES WAY BACK DOWN AND UH THE HOUSE IS BUILT AROUND THE TREES .
GREAT .
AND WITH THESE DECKING THAT A CORPORATION AND A LARGE MUMBLEX AREA FOR THE TREES TO COME UP SO IT S REAL REAL SHADY .
BUT THAT S ONE OF THE FEW THINGS THAT REALLY UH IMMEDIATELY PAYS BACK ON RETURN .

THE .
LOOKS LIKE THE GEORGE TOWN BROWNSTONE .
RIGHT .
YEAH .
AND UH THE IDEA OF EVER OWNING ANYTHING .
THAT HAS FOUR THOUSAND SQUARE FEET IN IT FOR LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS .
MUST BE A DREAM .
WHICH IS PROBABLY ABOUT WHAT .
THEIR EQUITY IS THAT THEY GOT OUT OF SELLING THEIR HOUSE .
YEAH .
BECAUSE THOSE THINGS ARE SELLING LIKE HOT CAKES .
BUT ONE OF THE PEOPLE .
THAT WAS LIVING BACK THERE WAS TELLING ME THAT THERE IS HIS AIR CONDITIONING BILL PER MONTH LAST SUMMER WAS IN EXCESS OF FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS .

UHHUH .
AND IT S DRIVING ME CRAZY BUT UH ONE OF THESE DAYS I WILL GO OVER TO UH LAKE LEWISVILLE OR UH WHAT IS IT UH RAY HUBBARD LAKE RAY HUBBARD AND GET SOME FISHING IN AND GET IT OUT OF MY SYSTEM FOR A WHILE .
UHHUH .
WELL UH YOU LIKE TO EAT THEM AFTER YOU CATCH THEM .
WELL YEAH SURE .
BECAUSE THERE S ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT LIKE TO GO FISHING BUT THEY DO NT LIKE TO EAT THEM .
WELL MO .
YOU KNOW .
YEAH MOST OF THE TIME UH IF WE CATCH SOMETHING WE LL TAKE IT HOME AND EAT IT UH AND YOU RE RIGHT I MEAN I LIKE TO FISH FOR TROUT AND THEY ARE REALLY UH UH GOOD FIGHTERS BUT UH IF I WENT TO A RESTAURANT THAT PROBABLY WOULD NT BE THE FIRST THING I WOULD ORDER IF I HAD A CHOICE OF FISH ON THE MENU .
YEAH I KNOW IF I GO TO A RESTAURANT AND ORDER FISH IT S USUALLY EITHER SALMON OR UH RED SNAPPER .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
WELL UH SO DO YOU JUST UH UH SKIN YOUR CATFISH OR DO YOU FILLET THEM OUT HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU .
WE UH SKIN THEM .
DO YOU .
YEAH .
OKAY .
YEAH YEAH JUST CUT THEIR HEADS OFF AND SKIN THEM AND THEN I JUST UH FLOUR THEM SALT AND PEPPER THEM AND COOK THEM .
YEAH .
I DO NT PUT THAT CORN MEAL ON THEM .
NO .
YOU KNOW UH THAT S THE WAY MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME TO FRY THEM SO .
WELL THAT S HOW WE DO IT TOO UH ALTHOUGH WE UH USE TO SET SOME UH TROUT LINES OUT AND WE VE CAUGHT YOU KNOW FOURTEEN FIFTEEN POUND CATFISH AND SOMETIMES THOSE ARE GOOD TO UH DO ON A BARBECUE GRILL .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND JUST LEAVE THE SKIN ON AND UH DO IT WITH UH BUTTER ON UH ON ON TIN FOIL .
UHHUH .
AND THEN THE SKIN JUST BASICALLY SCRAPES RIGHT OFF AND UH WER AND IT REALLY TASTES PRETTY GOOD .
YEAH WELL YOU KNOW I DO NT THINK I VE EVER TRIED COOKING THOSE UH CATFISH QUITE THAT BIG .
THERE UH .
UH MOST OF THEM ARE JUST THE SMALL YOU KNOW PAN FRYING ONES .
YEAH .
SO UH .
WELL I AM HOPING ONE OF THESE DAYS I LL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CATCH A BIG CATFISH LIKE THAT ON UH A ROD AND REEL BUT UH .
UM .
SO FAR IT S JUST BEEN ON UH ON THE TROUT LINES SO .
WOULD NT THAT BE SOMETHING .
YEAH .
IT S A THRILL WHEN YOU GET A BIG FISH THOUGH IS NT IT .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
AND UH WELL UP IN UH SOUTH DAKOTA ON THE IN THE MISSOURI RIVER THERE WE VE UH TIED INTO A FEW NORTHERN PIKE AND UH THEY REALLY UH IN IN WHEN THE WATER IS COLD THEY ARE VERY SLOW MOVING FISH BUT IN THE SUMMER TIME THEY LL UH GIVE YOU A RUN FOR YOUR MONEY .
UHHUH SO WHEN YOU WERE WHEN YOU DID GO FISHING WHERE DID YOU GO YOU MOVED THERE FROM WHERE NEBRASKA .
UHHUH YEAH .
SO IT WAS JUST LIKE THE RIVERS AND UH THE .
IN .
LAKES I SUPPOSE HUH .
IN NEBRASKA .
YEAH .
UH YEAH MOST OF THE TIME UH WE JUST FISHED UH IN THE RIVER ALTHOUGH THERE WERE A LOT OF SAND PITS AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT WE COULD FISH IN .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND A LOT OF THEM ENDED UP BEING CLOSE TO THE RIVER SO IF THE RIVER EVERY UH FLOODED YOU KNOW THEN OBVIOUSLY THEY WOULD DUMP SOME CATFISH AND BASS AND STUFF INTO THE INTO THE PONDS AND THE SAND PITS .
UHHUH .
AND SO WE WOULD DO A LOT OF FISHING THERE TOO BUT UH SOUTH DAKOTA DID NT REALLY HAVE MUCH FOR .
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT .
WELL I FOUND IT INTERESTING THAT THEY STARTED OFF WITH A PROBLEMS OF IMMIGRATION IN AMERICA AND THEN WENT BACK AND SAID WELL IF THERE IS A PROBLEM .
RIGHT .
WHAT SHOULD WE DO ABOUT IT .
YEAH I GUESS THAT S SO .
DO YOU FEEL THERE S A PROBLEM WITH IMMIGRATION IN AMERICA .
UM UH I THINK THERE S SOME PROBLEMS BUT THEY RE NOT REALLY BIG ONES .
I THINK THAT UM IN GENERAL THE WHOLE IMMIGRATION POLICY IS NT QUITE AS OPEN AS IT SHOULD BE .
THAT IT S REALLY PRETTY HARD FOR PEOPLE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES TO GET IN HERE EVEN IF THEY RE EDUCATED AND WILL BE A GOOD ASSET TO AMERICA .
IT S OFTEN HARD FOR THEM TO GET IN AND GET ON THE TRACK TOWARDS CITIZENSHIP UNLESS THEY MARRY A CITIZEN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
OKAY .
THAT S INTERESTING .
I WAS I WAS WONDERING WHAT .
YOUR RESPONSE WOULD BE .
I M A FIRST GENERATION AMERICAN .
OKAY .
SO I M .
UH WHERE DID YOU COME FROM .
FROM IMMIGRANT PARENTS .
OKAY .
OR AN IMMIGRANT MOTHER ANYWAY .
OKAY SO WHERE DID YOUR PARENTS COME FROM .
UH POLAND .
OKAY .
AND .
AND THAT WAS YOU KNOW PRIOR TO WORLD WAR TWO .
UHHUH .
BUT IT S INTERESTING THAT YOU KNOW WITH THE TOPIC .
I THINK I AGREE WITH YOU .
YEAH .
THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE OF AN OPEN POLICY .
UHHUH .
AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THE CHINESE CAME HERE AND WERE OUR LABOR YOU KNOW FOR THE RAILROAD TRANSATLANTIC RAILROAD AND .
YEP .
OUR IRISH CAME AND YOU KNOW BUILT THE TOWNS AND .
UHHUH .
DID LABOR .
BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE YOU FROM TEXAS OR .
I M FROM PENNSYLVANIA .
PENNSYLVANIA .
OKAY .
YEAH .
WELL THAT WILL BE INTERESTING .
RIGHT AND UH .
BECAUSE WE HAVE JUST .
A LOT OF .
HAD A NATURALIZATION ACT WHERE THE MEXICANS .
THAT WERE RESIDENTS IN TEXAS I M FROM TEXAS .
UHHUH .
AND HAVE BECOME CITIZENS NOW .
YEAH .
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT .
UM I THINK THAT S ALL RIGHT .
I UM AT LEAST ON THE SURFACE .
IT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD THING .
DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION ABOUT IT .
WELL I AGREE WITH IT WHOLEHEARTEDLY .
UHHUH .
THE ONLY THING IS I VE GOT TO SHARE WITH YOU MY BACKGROUND IS FROM NEW JERSEY .
UHHUH .
SO WHEN YOU WERE GIVING YOUR ANSWER .
I WAS THINKING IS THIS A TEXAN I M TALKING TO .
NO OKAY .
BECAUSE TEXAN PHILOSOPHY IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT .
RIGHT .
WELL A LOT OF THE EXPERIENCE THAT I HAVE WITH THIS PROBLEM HAS TO DO WITH MY BROTHERINLAW .
WHO S CHINESE AND IMMIGRATED FROM CHINA .
AND UM YOU KNOW HE UM GOT A GREEN CARD IS AND IS IN GOOD STANDING IN AMERICA AND CHINA BUT ONLY BECAUSE HE WAS ALWAYS MUMBLEX NICE TO THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT .
UHHUH .
AND ALL THAT AND HE WAS ALWAYS ON PRETTY GOOD TERMS WITH THEM .
YEAH WELL WE .
BUT UM THEIR MY SISTER JUST HAD A BABY AND THEY RE TRYING TO GET PERMISSION FOR HIS MOTHER TO COME TO AMERICA TO LIKE HELP CARE FOR THE KID AND THAT SORT OF THING .
AND IT S TURNED OUT TO BE SORT OF A HORRIBLE PROBLEM .
IT S JUST VERY DIFFICULT TO GET A WOMAN .
WHO DOES NT HAVE A LOT OF ASSETS OR WHATEVER OUT OF CHINA EVEN TEMPORARILY TO VISIT HERE .
OH WELL THEN YOU HAVE FIRST IN THE EXPERIENCE ON IMMIGRATION .
YEAH .
WELL THAT IS INTERESTING .
UHHUH .
YEAH .
WELL I WONDER YOU KNOW EVEN WITH THOSE .
THAT WERE INVOLVED WITH TIENAMEN S SQUARE .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW DID WE REALLY PROTECT THEM .
YEAH THAT S AND I THINK THAT S PRETTY CRAZY .
YEAH .
BECAUSE I MEAN THOSE STUDENTS .
WHO WERE IN AMERICA WHEN THAT WAS HAPPENING ARE ALMOST CERTAINLY GOING TO BE IN TROUBLE IF THEY GO BACK AND ASIDE FOR THAT THEY RE THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST OF CHINA SO IT S CERTAINLY IN OUR BEST SELFISH INTEREST TO KEEP THEM HERE IF WE CAN .
THAT IS TRUE .
THAT IS TRUE .
WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT .
YEAH .
WE HAVE IN TEXAS .
A LARGE VIETNAMESE POPULATION .
UHHUH .
THAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN .
YEAH .
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT .
UM .
AND THESE ARE NOT THE BRIGHTEST .
SEE THESE ARE REFUJEES YOU MEAN .

UHHUH .
UM INTERESTING MY WHEN MY DAUGHTER WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL ONE OF THE CUSTODIANS WAS VIETNAMESE .
YEAH .
AND WITH HIS LIMITED ENGLISH THEY FOUND OUT THR YOU KNOW THAT SHE WAS IN STUDENT COUNCIL AND THEY FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS A MEDICAL DOCTOR .
OKAY WELL UH SOME OF THE BOOKS I VE READ LATELY HAVE TO DO WITH CRAFTY TYPE THINGS WHERE I VE WHERE I VE UM LEARNED THINGS THAT I M GOING TO DO FOR MY CHILDREN FOR CHRISTMAS .

YES SIR .
THIS THING WITH ROY TARPLEY JUST UPSET EVERYONE I THINK FANS OWNERS MANAGEMENT EVERYONE .
AND THEY HAVE JUST DONE AS MUCH AS THEY CAN FOR THAT MAN AND HE APPARENTLY CA NT STRAIGHTEN HIS ACT OUT SO WE NEED TO TO BUILD ON SOMETHING MORE POSITIVE THAN THAT .
YOU BET I THINK THEY RE FOOLS IF THEY EVER BRING HIM BACK .

UNLESS YOU DO NT WANT THEM TO DO IT .
NOW DO AT A DO THINGS LIKE PLANT BUSHES AND TREES .
THEY O ONLY IN LIKE IN THE COMMON AREAS AND IN THE ISLAND .

OH REALLY .
OH IT TOOK SO LONG .
OH .
BECAUSE MY HUSBAND WAS YOU KNOW DIGGING THE TRENCHES BECAUSE HE DID NT WANT TO GET A TRENCHER YOU KNOW THERE IS A MACHINE THAT WILL .
OH YEAH .
DO IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE IS SO MANY PEOPLE THAT BROKE EITHER THEIR WATER MAIN OR THEIR GAS MAIN DOING IT AND .

YEAH THAT S A GOOD INVESTMENT THERE .
YEAH WELL WE NEEDED TO BECAUSE WE RE HAVING SOME FOUNDATION TROUBLE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO KEEP THE THE AREA MOIST .
OH .
AROUND THE HOUSE OR IT MAKES IT WORSE SO WE HAD AN INCENTIVE THERE .
OH .
TO DO THAT .
ALL RIGHT I GUESS TONIGHT S SUBJECT IS TO DISCUSS CURRENT EVENTS AND HOW WE KEEP UP ON CURRENT EVENTS AND IF WE RE .
RIGHT .
SATISFIED WITH WITH THE UH .
THAT S .
COVERAGE THAT WE RECEIVE .
RIGHT .
UM THINKING ABOUT IT SOME OF THE WAYS I TRY AND KEEP UP ON CURRENT EVENTS IS UH I ENJOY READING THE NEWSPAPER BUT UH QUITE OFTEN DO NT HAVE TIME TO READ ALL OF THE NEWSPAPER AND SO UH I ENJOY WATCHING SOME OF THE T V HIGHLIGHTS AND ALSO UH SOME OF THE NEWS PERIODICALS UH WEEKLY MAGAZINES AND UH AT WORK I ALSO HAVE UH MANAGEMENT SUMMARY REPORTS THAT UH GIVE BASICALLY A LOT OF THE CURRENT EVENTS UH HOW ABOUT YOURSELF .
WELL I M LIKE YOU I DO NT I DO NT I LIKE TO READ THE PAPER BUT I BASICALLY DO NT DO IT EVERY DAY .
AND I UM I USUALLY WATCH UH EITHER GOOD MORNING AMERICA OR THE TODAY SHOW EVERY MORNING .
UHHUH .
WHILE I M YOU KNOW WHATEVER I M DOING I WATCH THAT I USUALLY WATCH THE NEWS EITHER AT YOU KNOW EARLY EVENING OR AT TEN OCLOCK .
RIGHT RIGHT .
SO I GET IT FROM T V A LOT I GET TIME MA I READ TIME MAGAZINE UM THAT S ONE I READ PRETTY REGULARLY .
OH YEAH OKAY .
AND UH .
YOU THINK THAT THAT S UH PRETTY ADEQUATE COVERAGE AND YOU GET .
THE THING ABOUT IT YOU KNOW NOW THAT I VE FO FOUND IS THAT WE GET SUCH GOOD COVERAGE ON T V OR AT LEAST SUCH I DO NT KNOW ATTEMPTED THOROUGHNESS .
UHHUH .
OF COVERAGE BY THE TIME YOU GET THE TIME MAG MAGAZINE .
THERE S NOTHING IN IT YOU DO NT KNOW .
IT S HISTORIC EVENTS HUH .
RIGHT THEN YOU CAN JUST SORT OF HAVE PICTURES TO GO ALONG WITH IT OR SOMETHING BECAUSE REALLY I VE THOUGHT LATELY THERE S NOTHING NEW IN THE TIME MAGAZINE .
OH OKAY .
YOU KNOW IT S IT S BASICALLY YOU VE HEARD EVERYTHING .
YES .
AND UH YOU MIGHT YOU MIGHT GET A LITTLE MORE THOROUGH UH ACCOUNT OF SOMETHING BUT REALLY UM I DO NT KNOW SO I GET MOST OF MINE FROM TELEVISION .
YEAH .
I WOULD SAY .
UM I FOUND OUT TOO THAT UH QUITE OFTEN IF I SEE SOMETHING ON TELEVISION THAT I WANT MORE INDEPTH UH UNDERSTANDING OR OR GET WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT IT THAT THE THE NEWSPAPER OR UH I READ NEWSWEEK CAN GIVE YOU A BETTER AND MORE THOROUGH COVERAGE OF WHAT I VE HEARD ON T V BUT UH UM I FOUND OUT THAT ALSO ON ON T V THAT YOU CAN SCAN THROUGH A WHOLE LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS ON C N N AND AND LIKE YOU SAID THE THE NEWS SHOWS THAT ARE THAT ARE HAPPENING AND YOU CAN READ SOME MORE ABOUT IT IF YOU WANT TO UM I FOUND OUT THOUGH THAT OR I FEEL THAT A LOT OF THE STUFF ON T V AND THE NEWSPAPERS IS NEGATIVE THERE S AN AWFUL LOT OF NEGATIVE NEWS OR BAD NEWS OR OR BAD NEWS AND IT D BE REFRESHING ONCE IN A WHILE TO HEAR SOME GOOD NEWS .
RIGHT .
AND UH .
AND I I THINK THERE S AN ATTEMPT TO DO THAT YOU KNOW I THINK PEOPLE THERE S A MILD ATTEMPT FOR THAT BUT I THINK BASICALLY WE BASICALLY ASSOCIATE NEWS WITH BAD NEWS .
YES WE DO .
OR OR CATASTROPHES OR PROBLEMS OR CRISES OR UH YOU KNOW I THINK OUR CONCEPT OF NEWS IS NT NECESSARILY EVENTS THAT HAPPEN IT S MORE NEGATIVE LIKE YOU SAID .
TRUE TRUE .
BUT I THINK PEOPLE TRY TO ON ON T V I THINK THEY TRY TO THROW IN GOOD STUFF BUT IT DOES NT UH IT DOES NT SWAY THE VOTE .
UHHUH I VE HEARD AN INTERES INTERESTING COMMENT ALSO THAT UH WITH BUDGET CUTS AND UH EXPENSES THE WAY THEY ARE THAT IT S AFFECTED THE NEWS MEDIA WHEREAS BEFORE THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE A INDEPTH ANALYSIS OR UH INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING ON CERTAIN TOPICS AND ISSUES BUT THAT TAKES TIME THAT TAKES AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY AND COMMITMENT AND AND QUITE OFTEN IT S A LOT EASIER TO LISTEN TO THE POLICE SCANNERS OR WHAT THEY CALL AMBULANCE CHASING .
UHHUH .
AND GO AFTER YOU KNOW IT S LOT EASY TO GO AFTER AND FOLLOW A FIRE DEPARTMENT OR A POLICE OFFICER AND UH FIND OUT NEWS FROM THAT AS OPPOSED TO GOING OUT AND FINDING GOOD THINGS SO I DO NT KNOW I GUESS THE ECONOMY IS IS EFFECTING ALSO THE NEWS MEDIA .
UHHUH .
AND WE HAVE TO PAY THAT PRICE BUT UH I DO NT KNOW I DO NT KNOW IT S INTERESTING AND I THINK THAT NOWADAYS WITH COMMUNICATIONS THE WAY THEY ARE ALSO THAT WE CAN SEE GLOBAL EVENTS HAPPENING AS AS THEY OCCUR .

AND STUFF THEY THEY RE JUST THEY RE MORE THEY RE VERY OPEN .
UHHUH .
I MEAN THE BOYS ARE VERY OPEN .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE THAT S THAT S ALL I HAVE IS BOYS SO THAT S ALL I M AROUND .
UHHUH .
BASICALLY IS BOYS BUT THEY TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT I MY BROTHER DID NT TALK ABOUT UNTIL HE WAS IN COLLEGE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND AND THEY SIT DOWN AND THEY LOOK AT YOU RIGHT IN THE FACE AND THEY EXPECT A TRUTHFUL ANSWER .
THAT S RIGHT .
YOU CA NT GET THEM GIVE THEM THE OH YOU KNOW CABBAGE PATCH ANSWERS .
YEAH .
AND STUFF THEY THEY THAT JUST DOES NOT GO .
RIGHT .
AND THEY CAN TELL ME BASICALLY SOME THINGS THAT I DO NT KNOW .
UHHUH .
BUT IT IT S INTERESTING LISTENING TO THEM I THINK I THINK THE SOCIAL CHANGES IN THEM I THINK I SEE IT MORE WITH THAT GENERATION .
UHHUH .
THAN I DO WITH LIKE OUR GENERATION .
RIGHT RIGHT YEAH I I I IMAGINE YOU RE RIGHT I I TEACH SWIM LESSONS A LOT AND AND TO SEE WHAT SEE WHAT KIDS TALK ABOUT WHEN UH YOU KNOW THEY RE THEY RE OPEN ABOUT WELL YOU KNOW KIDS ARE A LOT MORE EDUCATED NOW THAN I THINK THAT THAT LIKE WE WERE UH AT THAT AGE .
YEAH I DO TOO .
UM ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS YOU KNOW BESIDES WHAT BESIDES WHAT THEY LEARN UH FROM FROM OUR SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT IS UH THEIR EDUCATION IS JUST AMAZING KIDS ARE KIDS ARE LEARNING UH YOU KNOW THEIR MATH IS JUST EVERY YEAR UH ALGEBRA GOES DOWN A GRADE YOU KNOW AND AND UH STUDENTS LEARN IT EARLIER .
I KNOW WELL MY SON THE MY FOURTH GRADER HE IS .
OKAY YOU SAY YOU RE GOING TO BUY A NEW CAR .
WELL NO IT S PROBABLY GOING TO BE A VERY OLD USED ONE MY HUSBAND HAD AN ACCIDENT IN MY CAR A LITTLE OVER A WEEK AGO .
UHHUH .
AND I DROVE A NINETEEN SEVENTYSEVEN UM B M W AND SO I BELIEVE AND I LL KNOW THE ANSWER TODAY .
THAT THEY RE GOING TO TOTAL IT I THINK THAT IT WILL COST MORE TO FIX IT THAN IT S PROBABLY WORTH .
YEAH .
BUT I M NOT INTERESTED IN HAVING ANY CAR PAYMENTS SO I ACTUALLY WENT LAST WEEKEND WITH MY FATHER WAS IN TOWN AND WE WENT AND LOOKED AT USED CARS AROUND TOWN UH AND I YOU KNOW I FOUND LIKE A NINETEEN EIGHTYFOUR REGENCY NINETYEIGHT WITH ONLY FORTYSIX THOUSAND MILES ON IT AND THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD CONDITION UH .
YEAH .
BUT I ALSO FOUND A NINETEEN EIGHTY VOLVO UH STATION WAGON .
RIGHT .
THAT WAS IN JUST SUPER CONDITION I MEAN THERE S NOT A DENT ON THE OUTSIDE BODY THE INSIDE IS CLEAN IT S HAD THE SAME OWNER FOR YEARS .
RIGHT .
IT IT HAS ABOUT EIGHTY THOUSAND MILES ON IT BUT THAT S ALL RIGHT YOU KNOW THE ENGINE S IN EXCELLENT SHAPE .
UHHUH .
AND I THINK IT WOULD LAST ME PROBABLY ANOTHER FIFTY OR SIXTY THOUSAND MILES .
YEAH .
SO I GUESS I M KIND OF IN LIMBO WAITING TO SEE WHAT THE INSURANCE IS YOU KNOW COMPANY IS GOING TO DO TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT I CAN GET ONE OF THESE CARS I DO NT WANT A NEW CAR THOUGH A NEW CAR PAYMENT .
YEAH I I UNDERSTAND THAT WE UH JUST PAID OFF ONE MY WIFE S CAR UH I GUESS LA EARLY LAST YEAR AND SO WE RE YOU KNOW ENJOYING NOT HAVING THAT THAT PAYMENT EVERY EVERY MONTH AND BUT IT S GETTING UP IN AGE UH WE RE TRYING TO HOLD OUT A LITTLE WHILE LONGER UH WE VE GOT A A Y KNO SHO A DAUGHTER WHO S ALMOST TWO NOW SO .
UM .
WE RE GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE WE REALLY KIND OF NEED SOMETHING A LITTLE BIGGER THAN WHAT WE VE GOT BUT UH .
UHHUH .
SO I GUESS IF WE WHEN WE DO BUY ANOTHER CAR IT LL IT LL BE SOMETHING THAT WE CAN UH KIND OF GROW INTO A LITTLE BIT IT S IT S TOUGH ON TRIPS BECAUSE UH .
ANYWHE ANYTIME WE WE RE GETTING READY TO GO ANYWHERE IT S UH YOU KNOW IT S UH TRY LIKE TRYING TO PUT A PUZZLE TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE YOU GET EVERYTHING IN THE CAR YOU KNOW CAUSE IT S .
WELL NOT ONLY THAT NEEDING THE ROOM YOU KNOW WE FINALLY ENDED UP BUYING A DODGE CARAVAN HERE ABOUT TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO .
BECAUSE I TOO HAVE VERY SMALL KIDS I I HAVE ONE THAT S NOW WELL SHE LL BE FOUR IN SEPTEMBER AND THEN A LITTLE BOY THAT S JUST TURNED TWO .
UHHUH .
AND YOU KNOW IT S LIKE YOU GO ON A TRIP AND YOU KNOW YOU PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD THROW THEM ON THE HOOD CHANGE A DIAPER AND KEEP GOING AND I WANTED SOMETHING THAT I COULD MAYBE WALK THROUGH AND GET TO THEM AND .
RIGHT THAT S WHAT I I IDEALLY I WOULD LIKE THAT IN FACT UH YOU KNOW I I VE I VE THOUGHT OF THAT POSSIBLY UH GETTI I DO NT KNOW THAT MY WIFE WOULD GO FOR IT BUT .
WELL .
YOU KNOW I WOULD I D LIKE TO DO THAT .
YEAH .
I I HAVE A TRUCK MYSELF AND I I LL I LL TAKE YOU KNOW A TRUCK S A THING THAT YO YOU YOU NEED WHEN YOU NEED IT BUT YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
THE REST OF THE TIME YOU WONDER YOU KNOW COULD I USE SOMETHING ELSE .
YEAH .
SO I I VE STILL GOT A COUPLE YEARS PAYMENTS ON IT I MAY UH IF WE CAN HOLD OUT TIL THEN YOU KNOW I MAY GET GET TO WHERE I NEED A SOMETHING ELSE MAYBE MAYBE BUY A VAN BECAUSE THEY ARE REALLY REALLY NICE FOR FOR LONG TRIPS ESPECIALLY .
WE HAVE DEFINITELY PUT A LOT OF USE IN ON OURS AND I UNDERSTAND IT IS TOO EXPENSIVE TO HAVE TWO CAR PAYMENTS SEE THAT WAS THE PROBLEM MY B M W WAS PAID FOR .
UHHUH .
AND MY HUSBAND S BEEN IN BUSINESS FOR HIMSELF FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND SO HE CAN DEPRECIATE CARS .
RIGHT .
BUT YOU HAV USED TO BE YOU KEPT THEM THREE YEARS .
RIGHT .
WELL WHEN THEY DID ALL THE TAX LAW CHANGES YOU HAD TO KEEP THEM FIVE .
RIGHT .
SO I WAS TRYING TO KEEP MY B M W IN TACT UH FOR THREE MORE YEARS .
UM .
SO THAT THEN I COULD TAKE THE VAN AND WE D TRADE MY CAR IN ON A NEW CAR FOR HIS BUSINESS .
RIGHT .
AND SO BASICALLY THAT S WHAT I M LOOKING FOR IN A USED CAR SOMETHING THAT S GOING TO LAST ME AT LEAST THREE YEARS WELL IF I CAN PULL A DEAL ON THIS VOLVO YOU KNOW IT WILL LAST ME LONGER THAN THAT IT WILL ACTUALLY LAST ME QUITE A WHILE BUT I DO NT KNOW HOW FAMILIES AFFORD TWO NEW CAR PAYMENTS IT S JUST .
I DO NT EITHER .
IT S OUTRAGEOUS .
WELL MY WIFE S CAR IS PROBABLY AROUND FIVE YEARS OLD NOW .
UHHUH .
AND IT S IT S GOT OH UH I GUESS IT MUST HAVE SEVENTY OR EIGHTY THOUSAND MILES ON IT YOU KNOW AND SO IT IT S GETTING IT S NOT NOT IN BAD SHAPE IT S IT S YOU KNOW SHE S KEPT IT UP REAL WELL BUT UH YOU KNOW IT S IT S GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE WE REALLY NEED TO DO SOMETHING WITH IT YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
IF WE RE GOING TO GET ANYTHING OUT OF SELLING IT .
THAT S RIGHT .
SO I M I M UH I M I M HOPING WE THAT WE CAN WORK SOMETHING OUT HERE WE VE GOT OTHER BILLS THAT KIND OF PRE PRECEDE OR PRECLU PRECLUDE US BUYING .
KNOW HOW THAT GOES .
SOMETHING BUYING SOMETHING ELSE .
IT S THE PITS IS NT IT .
IT REALLY IS AND YOU KNOW AND YOU CA NT UH YOU CA NT AFFORD YOU KNOW A A CAR PAYMENT NOW IT JUST .
THAT S RIGHT .
WILL WIPE YOU OUT EVERY MONTH IT S ALMOST GETTING TO BE LIKE THE HOUSE PAYMENT YOU KNOW .
I KNOW YOU CA NT FIND WHAT YOU USED TO COULD FIND SOMETHING FOR YOU KNOW SEVENTYFIVE A HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH IT MIGHT NOT BE BRAND NEW BUT IT WAS A DECENT CAR .
RIGHT .
AND YOU JUST ALMOST CA NT FIND THAT PAYMENT ANYMORE .
RIGHT .
SO I UNDERSTAND THAT IT S IT S KIND OF HARD TO GO DO WELL IF YOU DO LOOK AT THEM I REALLY RECOMMEND THE DODGE CARAVAN WE VE HAD WONDERFUL IT S THE ONLY UH MINIVAN THEY MAKE THAT S ON A CAR CHASSIS INSTEAD OF A TRUCK CHASSIS SO IT DOES NT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW SHAKE YOU AROUND LIKE A TU A TRUCK DOES .
OH I DID NT KNOW THAT .
AND WE HAVE HAD JUST WONDERFUL LUCK WITH OURS I MEAN IT S WE TAKE IT EVERYWHERE IT IT S BEEN IT IT S SO EASY TO GET THE KIDS IN AND OUT SEE MY CAR WAS ALSO A TWO DOOR .
UHHUH .
AND WHICH DROVE ME NUTS TRYING TO GET CAR SEATS AND KIDS .
OH MAN YEAH .
INTO A BACK SEAT YOU KNOW AND SO IT S WONDERFUL TO HAVE THE ROOM AND THE SPACE AND YOU CAN HAUL THINGS AND THEY CLIMB IN EASILY AND IT S JUST BEEN EVERYTHING THAT WE WERE HOPING IT WOULD DO FOR US .
RIGHT .
AND IT IS NICE ON LONG TRIPS IN FACT CHRISTMAS WE DROVE TO CALIFORNIA WHICH IS MY HOME AND YOU CAN TAKE OUT THE MIDDLE SEAT .
RIGHT .
AND THEY COME OUT FAIRLY EASILY SO WE TOOK OUT THE MIDDLE SEAT PUT THE CAR SEATS IN THE BACK AND JUST HAD A WHOLE AREA IN THE MIDDLE LIKE IF WE WERE OUT ON OPEN ROAD AND IT WAS THEIR NAP TIME WE JUST WENT AHEAD AND LAID THEM DOWN .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW I WOULD NT DO THAT IF WE WERE IN A CITY OR IF THERE WERE A LOT OF CARS AROUND OR ANYTHING .
RIGHT .
BUT IT MADE IT SO MUCH EASIER TO TRAVEL .
RIGHT N UH THAT S THAT S OUR PRO OUR OUR DAUGHTER S PROBLEM YOU KNOW CAUSE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU GET OUT ON THE ROAD LIKE THAT AND IT S JUST LONG STRETCHES YOU KNOW WHERE THEY JUST HAVE TO SIT YOU KNOW IN TOWN SHE DOES OKAY YOU KNOW AND EVEN ON THE ROAD SHE DOES ALL RIGHT FOR A LITTLE WHILE BECAUSE SHE LL SLEEP SOME .

OVER THE UNCOOKED RICE .

NOW I VE DONE IT WITH WHERE YOU PUT YOU COOK THE RI WELL I GUESS YOU PROBABLY COULD DO IT SAME WAY BUT COOK THE RICE AND THEN TAKE A CAN OF LIKE CREAM OF MUSHROOM SOUP OR CREAM OF CHICKEN SOUP AND PUT A LITTLE BIT OF WHITE WINE IN IT .
UHHUH WOW YEAH .
AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I LL PUT IN I LL SLICE WHITE GRAPES AND I LL PUT IN THERE AND THAT S JUST BECAUSE I M NOT A REAL BIG WINE PERSON BUT I LIKE IT IT .

IT .
S THAT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I MADE FOR MY HUSBAND BECAUSE I WAS LIKE UM YEAH .

I COULD ACTUALLY FIND SOMETHING .
I COULD COOK REAL EASY THAT WOULD BE KIND OF SORT OF ELEGANT .
UHHUH .
KIND OF .
YEAH YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH IT .
OH YEAH .
EVEN HAVING A SEMI NICE DINNER OR YOU KNOW SEMI MUMBLEX .
BUT THEN I HAD NT THOUGHT ABOUT DOING IT WITH UNCOOKED RICE .

UM .
LET S SEE WHAT WAS IT THREE QUARTERS OF CUP OF RICE OR .
UM .
IT DEPENDS ON YOU CAN REALLY VARY IT .
UHHUH .
BUT YOU HAVE TO PUT THE WATER IN PROPORTIONALLY .
I CA NT REMEMBER .
I THINK IT WAS THREE QUARTERS CUP RICE TO TWO CUPS WATER TWO CUPS UM BROTH .

A LITTLE EXTRA FLAVOR .
UHHUH .
YEAH .

I THINK IT WAS AN HOUR .
I VE DONE IT IN THE MICROWAVE SO OFTEN LATELY BECAUSE IT S IT S REALLY EASY .
I DO I DO MICROWAVE TOO A LOT .
YEAH .
BUT I THINK IT S ABOUT AN HOUR .
HOW LONG WOULD IT BE .
OR MAYBE IT S ONLY HALF HOUR .
HOW LONG WOULD IT BE IN THE MICROWAVE .
UM YOU JUST UNTIL THE RICE LOOKS FLUFFY AND .
OH OKAY .
AND NOT OVERDONE .
OKAY .
YOU KNOW BEFORE IT GETS OVERDONE .
DO YOU JUST BROWN THE CHICKEN TO GET IT COLORED .
YEAH .
OR DO YOU GO AHEAD AND LET IT COOK THROUGH .
UM I D LET IT COOK JUST A LITTLE BIT .
UM .
JUST SO THAT THE COOKING GOES A LITTLE FASTER .
OOH THIS IS A BENEFICIAL CALL .
I LIKE THIS .
YEAH I LIKED YOUR IDEA TOO THERE .
YEAH BUT THAT ONE S AN EASY ONE .
IT .
S LIKE JUST PUT IN A FRIEND OF MINE MAKES IT WHERE SHE GOES AHEAD AND SEASONS UP THE WITH THE SOUP AND THE WINE .
UHHUH .
PUT IN GARLIC AND ONION POWDER .
YEAH .
OR CHOPPED ONIONS IF YOU WANT TO DO THAT YOU KNOW .
WHAT EVER HOWEVER MUCH EFFORT .
YOU FEEL LIKE PUTTING INTO IT .
UHHUH .
BUT IT IT MAKES A GREAT I MEAN I VE GOT A TWO YEAR OLD AND A FOUR YEAR OLD AND THEY LOVE IT .
UHHUH .
AND BECAUSE MY DAUGHTER CALLS IT HER GRAVY AND I MEAN .
SHE THINKS IT S WONDERFUL MY GOOD YOU RE A PICKY EATER IF I CAN GET YOU TO .
OKAY WHAT KIND OF PET DO YOU HAVE GAIL .
WELL I DO NT I HAVE CHILDREN .
OH YOU HAVE CHILDREN .
I HAVE LITTLE CHILDREN BOTH OF MY KIDS ARE UNDER TWO SO RIGHT NOW WE DO NT HAVE PETS BUT WE VE HAD LOTS OF THEM IN THE PAST .
HAVE YOU .
UHHUH .
UH WHAT HAVE YOU HAD .
WELL WE HAD A DOG BEFORE WE MOVED HERE UH AND WE COULD NT BRING HER WITH US WE CAME FROM COLORADO AND WE VE HAD HAMSTERS AND FISH AND BIRDS .
OH .
OKAY I VE .
WELL YOU RE GOING TO HAVE LOTS OF PETS WITH YOUR CHILDREN GROWING UP .
UHHUH .
WELL WE HAD A A SCHNAUZER THAT WE LOST THIS SUMMER AND HE WAS FOURTEEN YEARS OLD AND UH WE VE HAD TWO SCHNAUZERS AND BEFORE THAT WE HAD ALL DACHSHUNDS AND I THINK MY HUSBAND WANTS ANOTHER DACHSHUND AND WE RE TRYING TO DEBATE BECAUSE OUR CHILDREN ARE GROWN AND AND UH I DO NT KNOW WHETHER WE REALLY WANT TO BE TIED DOWN TO A PE YOU KNOW ANOTHER DOG AND WE DO HAVE A VERY LOVING CAT THAT S YOU KNOW KIND OF OUR BABY .
UHHUH .
AND UH AND WE LIKE PETS WE LIKE THEM AROUND WE HAVE GRANDCHILDREN THAT RUN THROUGH AND THEY THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A DOG AND THAT S BECAUSE THEY HAVE A GREAT DANE .
HUH YES .
THEY RE JUST HUGE .
DEFINITELY WELL WE YOU KNOW IF IT UM IF IT WERE JUST MORE PEACEFUL YOU KNOW WITH THE LITTLE ONES WE WOULD DEFINITELY HAVE A PET I JUST THINK IT S NICE TO HAVE AROUND WE HAD A CAT MUMBLEX THAT HAD KITTENS SO ANY PET THAT I GET FROM NOW ON WILL DEFINITELY BE SPAYED OR NEUTERED .
OH YES YES .
BECAUSE UH I DID THAT EXPERIENCE WAS AWFUL .
YES I HAVE NEVER WANTED TO THAT S WHY WE VE NEVER GOTTEN A FEMALE YOU KNOW IN ANYTHING .
UHHUH .
AND UH UH AND OUR MALE CATS YOU KNOW WE HAD .
WHAT YOU DOING .
UH NEUTERED RIGHT AWAY AND OF COURSE IT HE DOES NT KNOW IT HE S STILL OUT PARTYING .
OH .
BUT UM YOU KNOW I DO THINK THAT MAYBE WE LL GET A FEMALE NEXT TIME AND JUST HAD HER HAVE HER SPAYED YOU KNOW AND UH .
WELL A LOT OF TIMES NOW WHEN YOU BUY THEM FROM LIKE THE S P C A OR .
YES .
FROM THE HUMANE SOCIETIES OR WHATEVER THEIR ADOPTION INCLUDES THEIR SPAYING .
YES YES .
SO .
WHICH I THINK IS A GOOD THING IT JUST BREAKS MY HEART TO SEE THESE POOR LITTLE OLD DOGS WANDERING THE STREETS LOOKING STARVED AND .
YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
IT UH PLUS UH YOU KNOW THE SAFETY FACTOR AND STUFF WELL WE ENJOY HAVING PETS WE UH YOU KNOW I THINK THEY RE A LOT OF COMPANY AND AND WHEN MY MOTHER LIVED WITH US UH THE CAT WAS REALLY HERS AND AND HE WAS KIND OF WILD OUR OUR DAUGHTER FOUND HER AND BROUGHT HER TO US AND UH THAT CAT WALKED IN AND WALKED RIGHT UP TO MY MOTHER AND JUMPED UP AND CURLED UP IN HER LAP .
OH .
AND SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE AT FIRST THAT YOU KNOW COULD REALLY HOLD HIM YOU KNOW BECAUSE HE WAS REALLY SKITTISH BUT IT WAS LIKE HE KNEW .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND HE WOULD SLEEP WITH HER AND SO HE WAS A LOT OF COMPANY TO HER .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW AND .
AND JUST LOVE HER AND HE S CATS ARE USUALLY SO INDEPENDENT BUT THIS ONE YOU KNOW HE COMES UP AND HE CRAWLS UP NEXT TO MY HUSBAND NOW YOU KNOW HE S YOU KNOW BEFORE THE DOG DIED WE HAVE A QUEEN SIZE BED AND THE DOG WOULD SLEEP ON MY SIDE .
AND THE CAT WOULD SLEEP ON MY HUSBAND S SIDE YOU KNOW .
AND WHEN EVERYBODY TURNED WE ALL FOUR OF US TURNED IN A ROW .
MY HUSBAND THAT S ONE THING HE HATED WAS OUR CAT USED TO SLEEP WITH US .
UHHUH .
OUR DOG WAS NT INTERESTED IN EVEN COMING IN OUR ROOM BUT OUR CAT WOULD SLEEP WITH US AND HE HATED THAT .
DID HE .
UHHUH HE JUST THOUGHT THAT THEY BELONG AND WHEN SHE D WALK ON THE COUCH ALONG THE BACK BEHIND HIS HEAD .
UHHUH .
HE HATED THAT .
SO I GUESS IT S PROBABLY PROBABLY IF WE GET ANOTHER ANIMAL IT PROBABLY WOULD NT BE A CAT EVEN THOUGH I LOVE CATS I THINK IT WOULD PROBABLY BE A DOG AND IT WOULD DEFINITELY BE AN OUTDOOR ANIMAL .
UHHUH UHHUH I THINK THAT S ONE OF THE REASONS OUR BECAUSE AS I SAID OUR OUR SCHNAUZER WAS OLD .
AND SO HE WAS BECOMING INCONTINENT AND SO THEN I WOULD JUST HAVE MESSES IN THE HOUSE AND I THINK THAT S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT BOTH OF US ARE NOT WANTING TO START OVER WITH YOU KNOW .
UHHUH OH YEAH .
AND UH AND IT WAS NEW CARPETING AND YOU KNOW IT JUS JUST REALLY YOU KNOW UPSET ME NO END .
UHHUH .
AND UH .
OH THAT WOULD GREG UH MY HUSBAND S GRANDPARENTS HAVE A DOG AND THEY JUST IT NEEDS TO BE PUT TO SLEEP BUT IT S GRANDPA S DOG AND UH HE S REALLY GETTING TOO OLD TO TAKE CARE OF IT BUT THE DOG MESSES ALL OVER THE CARPET AND MY DAUGHTER IS JUST NINE MONTHS OLD .
OH .
AND SO THEN SHE CRAWLS ON THE CARPET AND OH THE SMELL I MEAN .
UHHUH .
IT S JUST REALLY AWFUL AND THAT S THAT S ONE REAL DRAWBACK BUT YOU KNOW I GUESS YOU LL DO JUST ABOUT ANYTHING FOR YOUR PET IF YOU LOVE THEM ENOUGH .
YES YOU WILL YOU WILL YOU KNOW WE WERE TRYING TO DECIDE TO YOU KNOW ABOUT PUTTING HIM TO SLEEP HE WAS JUST YOU KNOW HE WAS GETTING SO OLD AND HAD A OTHER PROBLEMS TOO AND AND FORTUNATELY THE DECISION WAS JUST TAKEN AWAY FROM US WHICH MADE IT A WHOLE LOT EASIER YOU KNOW AND AND AGAIN GOING THROUGH THAT BECAUSE OUR OUR ANIMALS ARE ALMOST LIKE OUR KIDS IN SOME WAYS YOU KNOW AND AND YOU GRIEVE JUST AS MUCH OVER THEM WHEN THEY GO .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AS YOU WOULD A CHILD AND AND YOU KNOW OUR SON AND AND HIS WIFE AND OUR DAUGHTER AND HER HUSBAND AND THE GRANDKIDS ALL SAY GET A DOG GET A DOG YOU KNOW .

HAVE ALL THESE PEOPLE BEING TESTED AND SHE SAID I THINK WE CAN GET HIM REAL FAST .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND SURE ENOUGH THEY TESTED HIM AND YOU KNOW HE QUALIFIED FOR FOR THE HELP AND IT S BEEN GREAT AND I AND I THANK GOD I M HERE BECAUSE I I KNOW I HAVE A SISTER .
WHO HAS THE OTHER EXTREME .
SHE HAS A A CHILD IN CONNECTICUT .
WHO IS EXTREMELY GIFTED AND BECAUSE OF THE CUTBACKS IN THE ECONOMY .
RIGHT .
THEY HAVE NOTHING FOR HER .
OH NO .
AND AND TO ME .
THAT S THE SAME THING .
IT S IT S LIKE HAVING A CHILD .
WHO HAS A LEARNING DISABILITY .
THAT S BEING IGNORED .
UHHUH UHHUH .
THIS POOR GIFTED CHILD IS BEING IGNORED .
RIGHT BUT THAT S SOMETHING THAT PARENTS I THINK ARE ABLE TO HELP THE GIFTED CHILD IN THE HOME MORE THAN THEY COULD HELP THE LEARNING DISABLED CHILD .
THAT S TRUE .
SO BECAUSE .
THAT S TRUE .
THAT S SOMETHING .
YOU CAN DO BY JUST ENRICHMENT TYPES OF THINGS IN THE HOME .
UHHUH .
BUT LEARNING DISABILITY UNLESS YOU ARE SCHOOLED IN THE TYPES OF THINGS AND WAYS TO HELP A CHILD LIKE THAT THEN IT MAKES IT REAL DIFFICULT .
UHHUH .
AND THIS IS THIS TO ME IS THE BENEFIT .
I SEE IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS .
YES .
IS THAT THAT UH YOU DO HAVE GOVERNMENT MONEY TO FUND .
RIGHT .
THE KINDS OF PROGRAMS .
RIGHT .
THAT THESE STUDENTS NEED AND I M NOT SURE THAT THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS OR PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM .
THEY TEST KIDS BEFORE THEY TAKE THEM .
EXACTLY AND .
AND IF THEY RE A BEHAVIOR PROBLEM THEY RE OUT .
THEY DO NT TAKE THEM THAT S RIGHT .
THAT AND AND .
RIGHT .
UH THIS IS KIND OF A REJECTION TYPE OF THING .
UHHUH .
AND AND WE GET IT EVEN AT OUR LEVEL IN IN I WORK A NINE TEN SCHOOL AND WE GET STUDENTS .
THAT COME IN THAT HAVE BEEN KICKED OUT OF THE UH PAROCHIAL AND PUB AND UH PRIVATE SCHOOLS .
UHHUH .
AND UH THEY COME IN AND THEIR ATTITUDE IS I M A BAD BOY AND PROCEED TO PROVE IT .
REALLY REALLY .
SO I I REALLY HATE THAT FOR THEM .
I I .
YEAH .
WOULD RATHER THEY NOT HAVE THAT ATTITUDE BUT THAT S .
WELL WHEN COMPARING TEST SCORES I KNOW RECENTLY I WAS IN A DISCUSSION AND THEY WERE COMPARING TEST SCORES BETWEEN PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC SCHOOLS .
RIGHT .
AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE POINTS THAT I MADE IS THAT YOU RE NOT COMPARING APPLES TO APPLES .
THAT S RIGHT .
YOU KNOW YOU CA NT SAY UM YOU KNOW I KNOW STEVEN PROBABLY WOULD NOT BE ACCEPTED BECAUSE HE HAS A LEARNING DISABILITY AND .
UHHUH .
INTO A PRIVATE SCHOOL .
AND UM WHICH IS WHICH IS TOO BAD .
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I I CA NT NECESSARILY BLAME THEM .
NO .
YOU KNOW THEY THEY ARE A PRIVATE SCHOOL AND THEY .
THAT S RIGHT .
CAN DO WHATEVER .
THEY WANT .
THEY CAN BE SELECTIVE RIGHT .
AND THEY .
CA THEY THAT S RIGHT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE SELECTIVE .
BUT YOU CA NT SAY THEN WELL PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE ARE NOT AS GOOD .
RIGHT .
PERHAPS THEY ARE BECAUSE THEY RE THEY RE .
IF YOU CHOOSE THE SELECT TOP GROUP OUT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND TESTED THEM AND THEN COMPARED THEM TO THE PRI TO THE PRIVATE SCHOOL GROUP THEN I THINK YOU WOULD HAVE A MORE EQUITABLE .
YOU RE RIGHT .
WAY .
AND I HAVE A PROBLEM WHEN THEY COMPARE THE KIDS IN JAPAN OR GERMANY TO THE KIDS HERE .
IN IN IN UH HO HONESTY THE KIDS IN JAPAN ARE THEY HAVE TO TRY OUT TO EVEN GET INTO TO WHICH KINDERGARTEN .
THEY RE GOING TO GET INTO .
OH REALLY .
AND THEN AFTER UH AND IF IF YOU ONLY THE IN FACT THEY VE HAD CASES IN THE PAST WHERE PARENTS HAVE COMMITTED SUICIDE BECAUSE THEIR CHILD HAS NOT GOTTEN INTO THE TOP KINDERGARTEN WHICH MEANS THEY PROBABLY WO NT GET INTO THE TOP ELEMENTARY AND AND HIGH SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
AND IF THEY DO NT THEN AF WHEN THEY REACH A CERTAIN AGE THEY JUST THAT S THE END OF THEIR SCHOOLING .
UHHUH .
AND AND UH THEY DO NT EVER REALLY GO ON .
IT S ONLY THEIR TOP ONES .
THAT GO ON LIKE OURS DO .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND AND UH SO THAT THAT CREATES A PROBLEM .
AND .
YEAH .
AND YOU CA NT COMPARE BECAUSE THEY GO SO MANY MORE HOURS .
THE OTHER THING IS THAT THE PRIORITY IN THE FAMILY IS THAT CHILD S EDUCATION .
RIGHT .
AND IS THAT CHILD .
WELL YOU SEE THAT WITH THE FOREIGNERS .
THAT COME HERE .
THAT S RIGHT .
UM I I WAS TALKING TO SOMEBODY RECENTLY OR READ SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY WHERE THEY SAID THAT YOU KNOW THESE CHILDREN THEY THEY HAD TO BE THE BEST AND THEY PUT OFF ALL SOCIAL LIFE ALL .
EVERYTHING .
THAT S RIGHT THAT S RIGHT .
YOU KNOW .
WELL IS THAT GOOD .
YES THE CHILD IS VERY BRIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I FEEL LIKE MY CHILDREN WHO ARE KIND OF MIDDLE OF THE ROAD HAVE .
BETTER COPING SKILLS .
ARE MORE ROUNDED YOU KNOW .
YES .
SURE SURE I THINK IT S REAL IMPORTANT TO HAVE FRIENDS .
I THINK IT S REAL IMPORTANT TO PLAY SPORTS .
I THINK IT S REAL IMPORTANT TO BE PART OF A TEAM .
RIGHT .
AND SO THAT S WHY I SAID THEIR CHILDHOOD IS EXTREMELY DIFFERENT FROM MINE .
WE DID NT DO ALL THAT .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW .
WE CERTAINLY DID NT CARPOOL AND RUN THE WAY .
I DO .
UM .
WELL AND YOU DO NT YOU DO NT SEE THE PARENTS UH ENCOURAGING THOSE STUDENTS TO GET ON ATHLETIC TEAMS OR .
NO .
DRILL TEAMS OR BAND .

I DID .
I STARTED RIDING MY BIKE ABOUT A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO AND I D RIDE ABOUT TWO OR THREE MILES .
A DAY BUT BUT IT WOULD LAST ABOUT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND IT GOT REAL COLD FOR A LITTLE WHILE SO I GAVE IT UP .
HERE ABOUT THE THE MOST COMMON EXERCISE FOR PEOPLE IS TO GO TO THE MALLS AND WALK UH .
WALK AROUND .
BECAUSE THEY RE ENCLOSED AND NO MATTER .
WHAT .
THE WEATHER IS THEY CAN WALK .
RIGHT .
AT A PRETTY GOOD CLIP AND AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE WEATHER SUMMER OR WINTER .

I LL BE IN TOWN OR SOMETHING AND PEOPLE WILL WALK AROUND THE MALL .
AND IT S SAFE .
IT IT IS FAIRLY SAFE .
THAT S UH YOU KNOW INSIDE THE MALL MAY BE NOT SAFE GOING TO THE PARKING GARAGE .
YEAH CERTAIN PARTS OF IT .
I KNOW A DOCTOR ONCE TOLD ME .
IT IT A FRIEND OF MINE UH SUGGESTED SWIMMING .

WE VE BEEN HAVING TROUBLE WITH IT .
THE PAST FEW YEARS SO WE HAVE NT GOT TO USE IT MUCH BUT I LOVE TO SWIM AND WATER SKI AND STUFF LIKE THAT .
THE UH SWIMMING THEY SAY USES MORE MUSCLES THAN ANY OTHER EXERCISE WITH AND THE WATER TAKES THE RESISTANCE .
RIGHT .
RIGHT AND YOU DO NT GET THE SORENESS .
I VE I VE DONE SOME WATER EXERCISES BUT OUR POOL IS NOT IS NOT HEATED SO IT S .
RIGHT YOU CA NT DO IT .

SOME ODD DEGREES .
GO OUT TO THE SWIMMING POOL .
OH NO IT S TOO COLD .
HOT TUBS ARE NOT UH NOT TOO BAD BUT .
I COULD DEAL WITH A HOT TUB .
THOSE ARE NICE .
SO WHAT PART OF MISSISSIPPI ARE YOU FROM .

RIGHT DOWN THE STREET .
OH CREDIT CARDS MY FAVORITE SUBJECT .
YOU MEAN YOU USE CREDIT CARDS .
OH DO I .
I BET YOU USED THEM ALL UP OVER CHRISTMAS .
YEAH MOSTLY OVER CHRISTMAS UH I GET IN A RUT WITH CREDIT CARDS CAUSE THEY GET ME KIND OF IN A VICIOUS CYCLE WHERE YOU USE THEM A LOT ONE MONTH AND THEN YOU HAVE TO USE WHATEVER MONEY YOU HAVE TO PAY THOSE OFF .
AND THEN YOUR ARE IN DEBT .
AND SO THEN YOU HAVE NO MONEY .
SO YOU USE A CREDIT CARD .
I UNDERSTAND THAT .
YEAH UH I PROBABLY HAVE ONE OF EVERY CREDIT CARD THERE IS .
DO YOU USE THEM A LOT .
WELL UH IT KIND OF COMES AND GOES UH I USE UH CITIBANK THE UH ADVANTAGE ONE .
UHHUH .
PRETTY MUCH CAUSE YOU GET VANTAGE POINTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR YOU SPEND ONCE A YEAR I GET A FREE AIRPLANE RIDE THAT WAY .
OH .
SO AS LONG AS YOU PAY IT OFF EVERY MONTH IT DOES NT COST YOU ANYTHING .
YEAH YEAH WELL THAT IS A GOOD IDEA IS THAT .
THAT IS WHAT I .
THAT THROUGH A VISA .
YEAH .
UHHUH .
YEAH .
HUH .
BUT UH I GOT ALL SORTS OF CREDIT CARDS FOR MY BUSINESS THAT I USE BUT UH .
UHHUH .
IF I CAN GET AWAY WITH PAYING THEM OFF EVERY MONTH IT IS ALRIGHT IF I DO NT THEN IT GETS EXPENSIVE .
YEAH THAT IS MY PROBLEM I DO NT TRY AND PAY THEM OFF I PAY LIKE THE MINIMUM .
WELL YOU SHOULD NT DO THAT .
I KNOW SO I HAVE GOT MYSELF .
YOU NEVER YOU NEVER GET OUT OF THE HOLE THAT WAY .
EXACTLY I HAVE GOT THAT IS WHY I HAVE GOT MYSELF WITH ALL THIS TROUBLE NOW BUT I PAY MOST OF THEM ON TIME AND EVERYTHING IT IS JUST THE I ALWAYS HAVE THEM SO IT IS KIND OF STRANGE .
KIND OF LIKE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RIGHT .
OH YEAH EXACTLY LIKE THE GOVERNMENT .
IN .
CA NT NEVER GET OUT OF DEBT .
IN DEBT .
AND EVERY TIME YOU TRY TO GET OUT OF DEBT THE ECONOMY GOES TO POT BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SPENDING MONEY RIGHT .
YEAH .
HAVE THEY PUT THE CAP ON THE INTEREST RATES .
NO .
I DID NT KNOW IF THEY ACTUALLY DID THAT OR NOT I KNOW THEY WERE CONSIDERING IT .
JUST THE PEOPLE WHO DO NT NEED CREDIT GET THE FOUR AND A HALF PERCENT THE REST OF THE UH AND ME WE HAVE GOT TO PAY FOURTEEN AND EIGHTEEN PERCENT .
UHHUH YEAH .
FUNNY HOW THAT WORKS IS NT IT .
THE THOU WHO DOES NT NEED CREDIT GETS CHEAP CREDIT .
I WOULD BE INTERESTED TO FIND OUT HOW MANY PEOPLE OR HOW MUCH UH PEOPLE USE CREDIT THIS YEAR SAY IN NINETEEN NINETYTWO AS OPPOSED TO NINETEEN NINETYONE EVEN NINETEEN NINETY I THINK I THINK IT WOULD BE AMAZING HOW MUCH HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE USE IT .
WELL I THINK SO BECAUSE THE .
BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMY .

OKAY UH DO YOU WORK OUTSIDE THE HOME .
NO I DO NOT .
OKAY WOW .
DO YOU .
HAVE YOU .
HAVE I .
YES UHHUH .
UH NO NOT ACTUALLY .
OKAY WELL YES I DO .
OKAY .
IN FACT I AM AT WORK RIGHT NOW UH AND SO LET ME TAKE THE LEAD UH ANGELA UH I THINK WHAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT UH OF COURSE SALARY IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT S WHY YOU ARE WORKING FOR YOUR FOR THE MONEY BUT JOB SATISFACTION TO ME IS ALSO UH VERY IMPORTANT IN HAVING A JOB AND UH ONE OF THE THINGS THAT UH SHE ASKED US TO DISCUSS WAS BENEFITS UH I M ASSUMING THAT YOU ARE MARRIED AND HAVE A HUSBAND THAT SUPPORTS YOU .
RIGHT .
OKAY AND SO WE COULD WE COULD TALK ABOUT UH THAT PATH YOU KNOW HOW IMPORTANT YOU THINK HIS BENEFITS ARE AND AND AND UH HOW IMPORTANT YOU THINK THEY ARE AND IF WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE INCREASED .
OKAY .
IN HIS BENEFITS LIKE UH PERHAPS UH HE HAS UH .
THE BENEFIT OF HAVING EYEGLASSES FOR THE FAMILY UH UH AND HOW MUCH COVERAGE UH IT PROVIDES AND ALSO YOUR HOSPITAL COVERAGE AND UH UM PROBABLY DENTAL HOW IMPORTANT YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE .
RIGHT I I THINK THAT JOB WISE BENEFITS ARE IMPORT JUST AS IMPORTANT AS SALARY IS .
BECAUSE THEY OF COURSE IF YOU DID NOT HAVE THEM YOU WOULD BE PULLING FROM YOUR SALARY OF COURSE .
EXACTLY .
RIGHT .
EXACTLY .
RIGHT .
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE A FAMILY WITH CHILDREN AND YOU ARE ALWAYS GOING TO THE DOCTOR FOR .
AND THEY ALWAYS HAVE SURPRISES FOR YOU .
EXACTLY .
WITH CHILDREN .
THEY ALWAYS DO .
YOU KNOW AND SO IT S IT IS UH WE COULD NOT DO WITHOUT THE BENEFIT PACKAGE FROM FROM ANY COMPANY THAT WE WORKED FOR WHETHER THEY BE A CONGLOMERATE OR JUST A SMALL UH UH BUSINESS .
YEAH I THINK ANY ANY EVEN IF YOUR INSURANCE POLICY IS NOT THE GREATEST .
YOU WOULD STILL HAVE SOMETHING .
EXACTLY YOU MUMBLEX YOU WOULD NOT BE PULLING IT OUT OF YOUR ACCOUNT ALL OF THE TIME .
RIGHT .
JUST BY YOURSELF ALSO FOR WORKING WOMEN .
YES .
UH I THINK A LOT OF THE COMPANIES SHOULD START PROVIDING FOR DAYCARE IN THE IN THE .
UHHUH .
IN THE BUILDING .
THEY ARE GETTING A HANDLE ON THAT IN FACT UH MY OLDEST DAUGHTER IS UH IS UH A NURSE AND SHE JUST RECEIVED HER MASTERS DEGREE AND SHE IS NOW INTO CONSULTING AND THAT S ONE OF THE AREAS THAT SHE IS WORKING ON TO HAVE UH UH A DAY CARE CENTER FOR THE INDIV THE CHILDREN OF THE OF THE NURSES THAT ARE STAFFING THE FACILITY .
RIGHT .
AND THAT IS TRUE IN MANY MANY AREAS OF YOU KNOW UH JOB TITLES .
YEAH .
AND PROFESSIONS .
LIKE IN MAY CASE I HAVE THREE CHILDREN .
UHHUH .
FROM AGES NINE TO TWO .
SURE .
AND IT S JUST UNFEASIBLE FOR ME TO TRY TO GET A JOB BECAUSE ALL THE MONEY THAT I WOULD .
WOULD IT WOULD .
BE MAKING WOULD BE GOING TO DAY CARE .
IT WOULD BE JUST FUTILE .
AND IT WOULD BE JUST .
AND THEY WOULD NOT HAVE THE QUALITY .
BASICALLY BE ME WORKING TO PAY FOR THEM TO BE AT A DAY CARE .
AND THEY .
CENTER .
WOULD BE DEPRIVED OF THEIR MOTHER .
EXACTLY .
YEAH NO I UNDERSTAND THAT TOTALLY .
BESIDES WHICH IT WOULD BE EASIER UH THERE S A LOT OF SINGLE MOTHERS OUT THERE NOW FROM DIVORCES AND A LOT OF .
OH I HEAR .
WOMEN ARE STARTING TO HAVE BABIES WITHOUT A PARTNER .
YES THAT S TRUE .
AND TO GO TO WORK YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR CHILD BESIDES WHICH YOU HAVE TO GET UP EARLIER TO TAKE THE CHILD TO DAY CARE .
RIGHT .
AND IF THEY WERE IN THE SAME BUILDING .
UHHUH .
THEN YOU ARE GOING TO THE SAME PLACE AND YOU COULD GO FOR YOUR LUNCH HOUR DOWN AND VISIT WITH YOUR CHILD .
YES DO YOU .
OR YOU KNOW AND TAKE YOUR BREAKS WITH YOUR CHILDREN OR SOMETHING .
DO YOU THINK THAT YOU SHOULD FUND THAT IF THEY HAVE THAT AS A BENEFIT IF YOU WOULD FUND THAT SOMEWHAT FROM YOUR SALARY THAT YOU ARE GETTING .
DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE .
I THINK THA I .
ACCEPTABLE .
THINK IT WOULD BE FAIR .
I DO TOO .
I THINK IF IF THE COMPANY COULD NOT PROVIDE IT ALL ON THEIR OWN .
RIGHT THAT YOU .
FOR THE FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE USING IT YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF THEIR SALARY WOULD GO TO IT .
THAT S RIGHT .
BUT IT WOULD STILL PROBABLY BE CHEAPER .
WITH THE COMPANY THAN .
WITH THE COMPANY HELPING .
THAN HAVING TO GO .
OUR IF EVERYBODY YOU KNOW PULLED THEIR OWN WEIGHT IN IT .
THAT S MUMBLEX THAT S RIGHT YES I .
I THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY .
AGREE WITH THAT .
REALLY GREAT .
THAT WOULD BE FAIR .
YEAH .
YEAH .
I DO .
UH AND HOW HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT UH LET S SEE EYE CARE .
EYE CARE IS GOOD I DO NOT I AM NOT SUR I DO NOT THINK WE HAVE THAT ON OUR POLICY .
OKAY .
BUT UH WE .
VISION I GUESS IT S CALLED .
YEAH .
VISION CARE .
IT WOULD BE GREAT I MEAN UH THE GLASSES THAT THE EXAMS THEMSELVES ARE NOT EXPENSIVE IT S THE GLASSES .
IT DEPENDS ON WHO HA EXAMINES YOUR EYES .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
IF YOU HAVE AN AN MUMBLEX OPTOMETRIST OR AN OPHTHALMOLOGIST .
RIGHT NOW LIKE MY .
THERE S A VAST DIFFERENCE IN THOSE TWO UH .
RIGHT .
PROFESSIONALS .
WELL LIKE MY MOTHER SHE HAS TO GO FOR TESTING CAUSE SHE HAS GOT .
GLAUCOMA .
WELL SHE DOES NOT HAVE IT BUT .
OH .
SHE IS LIKE ON THE VERGE OF IT OR .
OH OKAY SO .
SOMETHING HER EYES ARE CHANGING .
YES .
AND SHE HAS TO BE TESTED PERIODICALLY AND .
UHHUH .
AND THOSE ARE EXPENSIVE TESTS .
YES THEY ARE .
NOW I THINK YOUR INSURANCE COVERS HER .
UHHUH .
ON THAT BUT YOU KNOW FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT THAT S JUST AS BAD AS A MEDICAL YOU KNOW THAT S .
RIGHT THAT S CRITICAL BECAUSE SHE S IN NEED OF IT SO OFTEN .
RIGHT .
YES AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE UH NEEDS IN OUR LIFE THAT ARE UNIQUE TO US AND UH YOU KNOW PEOPLE HAVE NEEDS IN THEIR LIFE THAT UNIQUE TO US TO THEM .
RIGHT .
I MEAN WE ARE ALL DIFFERENT SO .
NOW I WOULD LIKE TO SEE BETL BETTER DENTAL INSURANCE TO ME WAS THAT OUR BEEP .
WELL NO THAT S MY OTHER PHONE .
OH HUH .
SO THAT S IT THAT S OKAY MY THAT PHONE IS RINGING TO AN EMPTY DESK AND SHE S ON VACATION .
OKAY .
SO IT S OKAY .
BUT WITH THE THREE CHILDREN .
UHHUH .
UM ORTHOPEDIC CARE UM NOT ORTHOPEDIC ORTHODONTIC CARE .
THAT S VERY EXPENSIVE .
BECAUSE ON ON A LOT OF THE DENTAL INSURANCE THEY DO NOT COVER THAT WELL FOR THE THE ORTHODONTIA STUFF .
YES THAT S TRUE ORTHODONTIC WORK IS TERRIBLY EXPENSIVE .
YES IT IS .
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THE CHILDREN TEETH .
UHHUH .
AND AND YOU HAVE TO REALLY GET THEM WHEN THEY ARE YOUNG IN ORDER TO HAVE UH NOT UH A DECENT SMILE WHEN THEY ARE FIFTEEN SIXTEEN YEARS OLD .
RIGHT .
I KNOW TWO OF MY DAUGHTERS HAD TO HAVE THAT AND THEY STARTED HAVING EXTRACTIONS AT AGE EIGHT UH BECAUSE THEY JUST HAD TOO MANY TEETH FOR THEIR SIZE MOUTH .
YEAH .
AND WE FOOTED THE BILL BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT ANY SUCH THING AND WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG .
RIGHT MY MIDDLE CHILD NEEDS TO HAVE UH ORTHODONTIC HE S BECAUSE HIS HIS PALLET IS SQUARED NOT ROUNDED .
OH UHHUH .
AND IT AFFECTS HIS SPEECH A LITTLE BIT NOT NOT ANYTHING YOU KNOW .
UHHUH MAJOR .
RIGHT .
UHHUH .
BUT JUST ENOUGH THAT HIS BITE IS OFF A LITTLE BIT AND IT S LIKE FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS AND MY INSURANCE IS ONLY GOING TO COVER LIKE FIFTY OF IT .
WELL I TELL YOU I I JUST READ AN ARTICLE IN THE PAPER ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE DOING I THINK IT WAS AN AD IN IN OUR PUBLICATION AT TEXAS INSTRUMENTS WHERE THEY ARE BREAKING THE JAW AND .
OH .
AND LINING THE JAW UP WITH THE TEETH IT S IT S LESS PAINFUL AND LESS EXPENSIVE .
REALLY .
YEAH .
THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT WOULD HURT MORE .
I I KNOW BUT IT IT S IT S UH EASIER ON THE PATIENT IN THE LONG RUN .
OH GOSH .
WHICH AMAZED ME .
I I WOULD MUCH RATHER THAT DO THAT .
TO MYSELF THAN MAKE MY FIVE YEAR OLD GO IN AND DO IT .
THAT WOULD KILL ME .
HELLO .

BUT UH WHAT I HAVE LEARNED IN THE UH TEN MONTHS WE VE LIVED HERE IS IT THAT WHEN I ENTERTAIN I HAVE TO HAVE MY FOODS ALL PREPARED AND IN THE OVEN WITH ALL THE EVERYTHING THROUGH READY .
RIGHT .
TO SERVE .

OH DO NT YOU HATE THAT I VE GOT A I GOT A FEW POUNDS TO LOSE MYSELF .
THAT S OKAY .
UM .
I VE BEEN FIGHTING MY WEIGHT SINCE I WAS ABOUT TEN YEARS OLD .
YEAH I HAVE TOO I WAS REAL SKINNY TILL I WAS TEN .
YEAH YEAH I WAS LEFT THE FOURTH GRADE WEIGHING ABOUT A HUNDRED POUNDS AND STARTED THE SEVENTH GRADE GRADE AT TWO .
OKAY YOU WANT TO TELL ME FIRST HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT .
WELL .
THE PROPOSAL .
UM I I JUST THINK THE WAY THAT THINGS ARE GOING THAT UM IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO GO AHEAD AND HAVE UM DEDICATE THEMSELVES TO AT LEAST SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
I KNOW LIKE THE MORMON RELIGION YOU KNOW THEY REQUIRE TWO YEARS OF SERVICE UH MISSIONARY SERVICE .
THE BOYS .
RIGHT THE BOYS .
NOT THE GIRLS MUMBLEX THE BOYS .
YEAH AND UM SO BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR ALL YOUNG PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW TO BE ABLE TO TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
UM SO THAT UM YOU KNOW I DO NT KNOW I JUST FEEL IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THEM TO DO THAT .
UHHUH I I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GOOD TOO BUT I DID NOT THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD THAT THEY ALL DO SOMETHING LIKE THE PEACE CORPS .
YEAH .
BECAUSE NOT ALL YOUNG PEOPLE WOULD HAVE UH WHAT IT TAKES TO GO LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE I THINK IT TAKES A CERTAIN PERSON TO TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT THERE S A LOT OF OTHER PUBLIC SERVICE THINGS .
OH SURE .
THAT COULD BE DONE .
OH YEAH AND AND EVEN EVEN IN OUR HOME TOWNS THERE S A LOT OF .
UHHUH .
UM PUBLIC SERVICE THINGS THAT THEY COULD DO .
RIGHT .
UH YOU KNOW DRUG REHABILITATION AND .
RIGHT .
AND ALCOHOL AND AND JUST UH HELPING OLD PEOPLE AND UM UH YOU KNOW HELPING CRIPPLE JUST HELPING SOMEBODY ELSE .
YES YEAH .
AND I THINK THAT ART OF GIVING IS SOMETHING THAT UM WE DO NT HAVE VERY MUCH ANY MORE .
UHHUH YEAH I THINK IT WOULD BE THAT WHEN THEY SAY THIS PROPOSAL IS THIS SOMETHING THAT THEY RE JUST SUGGESTING OR ARE THEY ACTUALLY WHY WHY WHY DID THEY CALL IT A PROPOSAL THAT .
OH I THINK THEY JUST GAVE IT A TITLE .
UHHUH .
BUT IS THIS NOT SOMETHING THAT S UM IN LEGISLATION OR .
UHHUH .
IN WORK SOME .
THAT S WHAT I WONDERED .
YEAH NO NO IT S NOT IT S JUST A JUST A TOPIC .
IT D BE GOOD CHARACTER BUILDER .
I THINK SO TOO I THINK SO TOO UM BECAUSE THERE S SO MANY UM KIDS WHO HAVE UH YOU KNOW SO MUCH MONEY AND SO MUCH FREE TIME AND UH NOTHING TO DO UM AND NOTHING TO GIVE THEIR TIME TO .
UHHUH .
UM THEY DO NT EVEN HAVE A DIRECTION TO GIVE THEIR THEIR TIME TO SO I THINK .
RIGHT .
IT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD FOR PEOPLE TO UM TO BE ABLE TO GIVE THEIR TIME IN IN UH SOME KIND OF PUBLIC SERVICE UH EVEN IN OUR GOVERNMENT YOU KNOW AS UH AIDS TO UH YOU KNOW CONGRESS UH PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
SO UM YEAH IT WOULD BE IT D BE REALLY GOOD .
UHHUH .
I THINK .
WELL PEOPLE THAT ARE UM HAVE RECEIVED SENTENCES IN JAIL THEY HAVE UH SOME OF THEM ARE GOING OUT AND DOING UH THEY HAVE TO GO OUT AND DO PUBLIC SERVICE .
UHHUH .
ACTIVITIES .
RIGHT .
WHICH TO ME IS IS GOOD .
OH YEAH OH YEAH I AGREE WITH YOU THIS IS SOMETHING THAT UM LIKE YOU SAY IS IT S CHARACTER BUILDING .
UHHUH .
UM YOU KNOW LEARNING HOW TO TO GIVE TO OTHERS AND BEING LESS SELFISH AND .
WELL I THINK SOMETIMES IT GIVES YOU A BETTER PICTURE OF WHAT SOME OF THE OTHER PEOPLE LIVE LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT .
UHHUH .
WHAT SOME OF THE OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD ARE LIKE OR .
RIGHT .
EVEN OTHER PARTS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD .
UHHUH UHHUH YEAH .
SOME OF THE PEOPLE HOW THEY LIVE OR .
OH I AGREE WITH YOU I AGREE WITH YOU AND I THINK UH YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SO UM UH FOCUSED JUST ON THEMSELVES AND THEIR ACTIVITIES AND WHOSE GOING OUT WITH WHOM ET CETERA .
UHHUH .
THAT UH YOU KNOW TO GET A TASTE OF WHAT THE REAL WORLD IS ACTUALLY ABOUT .
UHHUH .
DOING THAT PUBLIC SERVICE WOULD BE GREAT .
UHHUH .
YEAH .
YEAH BECAUSE THAT S ONE THING THAT S HARD WITH YOUNG PEOPLE YOU YOU CA NT TELL THEM HOW THINGS ARE .
RIGHT .
THEY HAVE TO SEE FOR THEMSELVES .
UHHUH .
NOW OF COURSE THIS MIGHT BE AFTER THEY VE GONE THROUGH THEIR TEEN YEARS I DO NT KNOW WHAT THEIR THOUGHT IS ON WHAT AGE THAT THIS SHOULD BE DONE .
OH YEAH I WOULD THINK SO LIKE RIGHT AFTER UM HIGH SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW EVEN IF IT WAS THE THE THEIR UM THAT SUMMER RIGHT AFTER HIGH SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THREE MONTHS .
OF COURSE THEY VE ALREADY GONE THROUGH THE PERIOD OF TIME WHERE THEY NEED MORE DIRECTION .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THEY THEIR TEENAGE YEARS AND THAT THEY REALLY SOMETIMES NEED A LITTLE BETTER DIRECTION TO GO .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND SOMETHING COURSE NOW PEACE CORPS THAT COULD NT BE DONE OF COURSE UNTIL THEY WERE DONE WITH SCHOOL .
RIGHT RIGHT .
SO .
YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT OUT THAT WAS OUTSIDE OF UH OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
YEAH BUT YEAH YOU KNOW RIGHT RIGHT AFTER YOU GRADUATE FROM UM HIGH SCHOOL BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE JUST UM UH WELL GEE WHIZ WHAT DO I DO NOW .
UHHUH .
IF THEY RE NOT FOCUSED ON GOING TO COLLEGE AND UH YOU KNOW HAVING THAT THAT UH GUNG HO PLAN .
UHHUH .
UH THAT S YOU KNOW SETTING THEIR LIFE GOALS .
KIND OF AN INBETWEEN .
UHHUH .
TIME .
UHHUH YEAH SO TO ME SEE THAT WOULD BE THE THE UH THE GREATEST TIME FOR UM YOU KNOW TEENAGERS TO TO DO THAT WOULD BE RIGHT AFTER THEY GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
BUT AS FOR ITS BEING REQUIRED .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW WE RE JUST NOT WE RE NOT BASED ON ON THAT UH .
HUHUH .
TYPE OF A SYSTEM UM .
NO AND LIKE I SAID NOT NOW ALL YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING BUT .
UHHUH .
NOT ALL CERTAINLY WOULD BE GEARED TO EVEN THE THE MORMON BOYS THAT GO OUT NOT ALL OF THEM GO I MEAN .
RIGHT .
IT S DISASTER IF THEY DO NT GO BUT .
OH RIGHT .
BUT SOME OF THEM ARE NOT THEY RE JUST NOT MADE TO DO THAT TYPE OF THING .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND THEY JUST ARE NT ABLE TO DO IT .
YEAH YEAH SO UM YEAH IT D BE GOOD BUT LIKE I SAID REQUIRING IT WOULD BE UH .
SO UH WHAT KIND OF HOME REPAIR WORK HAVE YOU DONE .
WELL UM DONE A LITTLE UH REPAIR ON THE UH SHINGLES ON THE ROOF RECENTLY .
WE VE HAD A LOT OF WIND AROUND HERE .
BEEN PULLING THEM UP HUH OR JUST LOOSENING THEM UNTIL THE RAIN CAME IN .
YES .
IT LOOKS LIKE I M GOING TO HAVE TO GET UP THERE AGAIN BECAUSE WE MAY HAVE A LEAK .
ARE YOU IN THE SECTION OF TEXAS .
THAT S BEEN GETTING SO MUCH RAIN .
WE VE BEEN GETTING QUITE A BIT MAYBE NOT QUITE AS BAD AS SOME OF THE FOLKS DOWN AROUND SAN ANTONIO BUT UH WELL I M RIGHT PLANO S JUST NORTH OF DALLAS .
OH OKAY .
AND THERE ARE PARTS OF DOWNTOWN OR NEAR DOWNTOWN DALLAS .
THAT ARE UNDER WATER RIGHT NOW I GUESS I SAW ON THE NEWS .
YEAH .
BUT YOU RE PROBABLY WHAT ABOUT HALFWAY ACROSS THE STATE FROM SAN ANTONIO THOUGH ARE NT YOU .
WELL WE RE UP UH WE RE NORTH .
YEAH .
AND UH OH ABOUT UH I DO NT KNOW UH EIGHTY TO A HUNDRED MILES SOUTH OF THE OKLAHOMA LINE I GUESS .
YEAH OKAY .
BUT YOU RE STILL GETTING A GOOD BIT OF THE RAIN THOUGH .
UH WE DID HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF RAIN YESTERDAY .
SO FAR WE HAVE NT HAD ANY TODAY .
AND UH I SUPPOSE THAT MEANS .
I SHOULD BE UH GETTING UP THERE TO LOOK AT THAT UH SHINGLE BUT UH .
YEAH .
I HAD SOMETHING ELSE PLANNED TODAY SO I GUESS I LL LET IT GO AWHILE .
YEAH .
IS IT ASPHALT SHINGLES OR OR MUMBLEX .
THEY RE UH NO THEY RE UH WOOD SHAKE .
OOH THAT SHOULD BE A LOT OF FUN .
YEAH .
DID YOU PUT THEM UP ORIGINALLY OR JUST GOING UP AND STOPPING LEAKS IN THEM .
NO I UH AS A MATTER OF FACT WE VE NEVER HAD A LEAK ACTUALLY YET .
NOW THIS WE JUST BOUGHT THE HOUSE LAST YEAR AND UH UH JUST BEFORE WE TOOK POSSESSION OF IT .
WE HAD A FELLOW GO UP THERE AND DO WHATEVER NEEDED TO BE DONE ON THE SHINGLES .
SO I VE JUST RECENTLY HAD TO START LOOKING AT IT .
MYSELF .
YEAH .
SO IT S A SMALL PROBLEM SO FAR BUT I GUESS YOU JUST HAVE TO KEEP ON TOP OF IT .
WHAT KIND OF ROOF DO YOU HAVE .
UH WE RE IN UH CAMPUS APARTMENT BUILDINGS WITH FLAT TOP UH .
OH THEN YOU DO NT HAVE TO DO TOO MUCH WITH IT .
NOT TOO MUCH .
THEY RE JUST TAR AND GRAVEL .
UHHUH .
TREATED FLAT TOP ROOFS .
HAVE YOU GOT PRETTY WELL PITCH ON THAT ROOF OR IS IT PRETTY STEEP .
OH IT S PRETTY STEEP .
UH PARTS OF IT ARE STEEPER THAN OTHERS .
WHAT DO YOU USE TO KEEP FROM SLIDING OFF THAT RASCAL .
WELL UH YOU WEAR UH SHOES WITH GOOD TRACTION AND AND AND TRY TO REMEMBER WHERE YOU ARE AT ALL TIMES .
YEAH I IMAGINE I IMAGINE .
AND REMEMBER TO YELL GERONIMO .
IF ALL ELSE FAILS .
YEAH YEAH THAT WOULD BE JUST TOO MUCH OF A FALL FOR ME .
UM HAVE YOU BEEN UH WAS WAS THE HOUSE REASONABLY NEW OR YOU BEEN DOING SOME .
REMODELING WORK ON IT .
IT S ACTUALLY JUST TWELVE YEARS OLD NOW .
THAT S PRETTY NEW HOUSE YET .
YEAH IT UH THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY ACTUALLY THEY SAY THAT WHEN THE HOUSE IS UH FIFTEEN IT S ALREADY OLD BUT JUST TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT .
YEAH .
THING IS WE VE UH THE MAIN THING THAT WE VE HAD WITH THIS HOUSE RECENTLY HAS BEEN SOME UH SQUIRMING I CALL IT OF THE FOUNDATION .
WE RE JUST ON A CONCRETE SLAB YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
BUT UH THE SOIL RIGHT UNDER THIS IS A CLAY AND IT UH .
IT S SETTLING UNEVENLY .
WELL IT UH DEPENDING ON IT .
S MOISTURE CONTENT IT EITHER SWELLS UP OR SHRINKS AND UH .
YEAH .
OF COURSE .
THE SOIL RIGHT UNDER THE SLAB RETAINS IT .
S MOISTURE .
A LOT LONGER .
UHHUH .
AND SO DURING THE DRY SEASON .
YOU HAVE TO WATER THE FOUNDATION TO KEEP YOUR FOUNDATION FROM UH FROM UH DROOPING .
UHHUH .
AND UH BUT ANYTIME THERE S A CHANGE IN THE WEATHER LIKE THE TEMPERATURE DRASTIC CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE OR IN UH MOISTURE UH YOU GET LITTLE SPIDER WEB CRACKS ALL AROUND UH WINDOWS AND DOORS .
WELL THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF FUN .
WELL USUALLY WHAT .
YOU DO IS JUST WAIT UNTIL YOU THINK IT S STOPPED AND THEN YOU PATCH THEM UP .
UM .
WHAT IS IT LIKE UH STUCCO WALLS OR .
UH WELL THIS IS ALL UH IT S ALL DRYWALL .
OH DRYWALL .
UH I THINK WITH UH .
WOOD FRAMING .
YEAH RIGHT .
OKAY .
BUT UH SOMEHOW OR OTHER .
THAT DOES MANAGE TO UH SHOW THESE LITTLE CRACKS .
I DO NT KNOW QUITE HOW THAT WORKS .
MAYBE IT IS NT DRYWALL .
I DO NT REALLY KNOW .
MUMBLEX .
THEY PLASTERED OVER DRYWALL .
YEAH I THINK IT IS .
I REMEMBER MY PARENTS HOME IS DRYWALLED AND THEN THEY UH ALMOST LIKE A SMALL GRADE STUCCO TYPE PLASTERING OVER THE DRYWALL .
I EXPECT THAT S WHAT .
IT IS YEAH .
TO GIVE IT .
A TEXTURED SORT OF A LOOK AND MADE FOR KIND OF A HARD SHELL ON THE ON THE DRYWALL .
YEAH I THINK THAT S THE WAY .
THIS IS DONE .
FORTUNATELY WE HAVE NT HAD ANY REAL BIG HOLES IN IT YET SO I .
YEAH THAT S GOOD .
YEAH .
YEAH THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE IN TERRIBLY TERRIBLY EXASPERATING TO HAVE THE THE SLAB FLOOR LIKE THAT SWELLING AND GIVING LIKE THAT .
YES WELL THE PREVIOUS OWNER HAD A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH IT BECAUSE UH OH PROBABLY A VARIETY OF THINGS .
HIS NEIGHBOR USED .
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT SENDING AN ELDERLY FAMILY MEMBER TO A NURSING HOME .
WELL I DO NT FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT IT BUT I THINK THAT AT SOME TIMES .
IT CAN BE THE RIGHT THING TO DO .
WE SENT MY GRANDFATHER TO A NURSING HOME AT THE POINT WHEN HE WAS REALLY INCAPABLE OF CARING FOR HIMSELF ANYMORE .
UHHUH .
HE ACTUALLY DIED A FEW MONTHS AFTER THAT AND SO AS AT LEAST IN RETROSPECT IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO BECAUSE HE WAS EITHER IN A NURSING HOME OR A HOSPITAL .
RIGHT .
OR SOMETHING ELSE THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SPENDING MOST OF HIS TIME IN THOSE DAYS .
AND WHAT TYPE OF RECOMMENDATIONS DID YOU HAVE WHEN YOU DECIDED WHERE TO PLACE HIM .
UM WELL THE SEE UH WELL WE HE WANTED TO GET INTO A MENNONITE NURSING HOME .
WHICH IS VERY POPULAR AND HARD TO GET INTO AND HAD LIKE A TEN YEAR WAITING LIST .
OH MY .
RIGHT WE WOUND UP JUST CHOOSING A ANOTHER MENNONITE NURSING HOME .
THAT WAS EASIER TO GET INTO .
OR BUT NATURALLY NO IT WAS EVEN MENNONITE RELATED I M SORRY IT WAS ACTUALLY NOT A PARTICULARLY GREAT NURSING HOME .
MOSTLY THE THING WAS THAT IT WAS AVAILABLE WHEN WE NEEDED IT .
YEAH .
BECAUSE HE SUDDENLY GOT SICK .
SO THE CONVENIENCE .
AND NEEDED TO BE PUT IN .
RIGHT .
UH WHAT DO YOU THINK .
MY GRANDMOTHER LIVED WITH US UM UNTIL AUGUST UM AND WE MADE THE DECISION TO PUT HER IN A NURSING HOME .
SHE HAS LEUKEMIA .
UHHUH .
AND HER THE REST OF HER FAMILY AND HER REGULAR DOCTORS AND EVERYBODY .
SHE TRUSTED AND KNEW WAS IN DAYTON AND WERE SEVERAL THOUSAND MILES AWAY .
YEAH .
SO I MADE THE DECISION TO PUT HER IN A NURSING HOME AND MY SISTER BEING ON THE OTHER END FOUND ONE THAT SHE COULD HAVE WHAT WAS CALLED AN INDEPENDENT LIVING FACILITY .
SHE HAD HER OWN LITTLE ROOM AND DID NT HAVE TO SHARE IT WITH ANYONE AND COULD BRING IN HER OWN CHAIR AND T V SET .
YEAH .
SO .
YEAH THAT S IMPORTANT .
YES .
I WOULD SAY .
AND THAT THE OTHER MAJOR FACTOR IS THAT SHE NEEDS BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS .
EVERY WEEK TO TEN DAYS AND WOULD HAVE TO BE HOSPITALIZED A DAY OR TWO SO IN THIS FACILITY .
THEY CAN DO IT RIGHT THERE FROM HER OWN ROOM .
OKAY .
SO SHE DID NT HAVE TO BE TRANSPORTED BACK AND FORTH .
SO SHE S BEEN THERE SINCE AUGUST .
THE THIRTEENTH AND SEEMS TO HAVE ADJUSTED PRETTY WELL .
IT S NOT HER FAVORITE PLACE TO BE IN .
SHE D MUCH RATHER BE HERE WITH ME .
BUT .
YEAH .
WHEN IT GOT TO THE POINT .
I WAS SPENDING MORE TIME AT THE HOSPITAL WITH HER AND I VE GOT LITTLE CHILDREN HERE WHO NEEDED ME HERE .
RIGHT SO THAT .
SHE NEEDED SOMEBODY TO WATCH HER TWENTYFOUR HOURS A DAY .
RIGHT AND .
SO .
THAT BECOMES DIFFICULT THEN .
SHE WAS FALLING DOWN AND HEMORRHAGING AND YOU KNOW ALL KINDS OF PHYSICAL PROBLEMS SO IT JUST BECAME TOO MUCH FOR ME TO HANDLE EVEN THOUGH I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE HAD HER STAY WITH HER HEALTH BEING WHAT .
IT WAS SHE COULD NT .
UHHUH .
ANYMORE .
YEP WE TRIED TO CONVINCE MY GRANDFATHER TO LIVE WITH US AT SEVERAL POINTS DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS OF HIS LIFE BUT HE WAS ESSENTIALLY TOO PROUD AND TOO INDEPENDENT .
YEAH .
SO THAT EVEN THOUGH HIS HEART WAS GETTING INCREDIBLY WEAK AND HIS KNEES WERE GOING BAD .
UHHUH .
HE LIVED IN HIS OWN HOUSE AS LONG AS HE COULD .
YEAH .
BUT HE WAS LIVING ALONE HAD AN UPSTAIRS APARTMENT COULD BARELY MAKE IT UP THE STEPS .
OH .
TO THE TOP WITHOUT A GREAT DEAL OF PAIN AND THIS EVENTUALLY THINGS JUST WENT TOO FAR .
YEAH .
AND HE ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE PUT INTO A NURSING HOME .
YES WELL I THINK SOMETIMES WHEN PEOPLE GET TO BE A CERTAIN AGE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE TO KIND OF HELP THEM MAKE DECISIONS .
IT SURE WOULD NT HAVE BEEN GRANNY S DECISION TO LEAVE US AND GO BACK TO A NURSING HOME BUT SHE S ACCEPTED IT REAL WELL NOW .
RIGHT .
SO .
WELL THAT S YEAH THAT S RIGHT THAT THE CHILDREN HAVE SOME RESPONSIBILITY TOO TO THEIR PARENTS AND SUCH TO HELP DECIDE WHAT S THE RIGHT THING .
WELL WE ENJOYED .
AND .
HAVING HER HERE BUT WE FEEL SHE S MUCH SAFER WHERE SHE IS NOW .
SHE STILL CONTINUES TO FALL BUT WHEN SHE DOES THERE A NURSE IS RIGHT THERE TO HELP HER .
UHHUH .
AND I KNOW SHE S EATING THE RIGHT THINGS AND HER DOCTOR S RIGHT THERE WHERE HE CAN COME IN AND CHECK ON HER SO .
IT BECAME DANGEROUS FOR US TO KEEP TRANSPORTING HER BACK AND FORTH IN THE CAR BECAUSE SHE WAS SO WOBBLY AND NEEDED A WALKER OR A WHEEL CHAIR .
YEP .
SO I THINK SHE LL ADJUST .
OKAY DO WE JUST GO AHEAD .
UHHUH .
OKAY .
DO YOU WANT TO START .
UH WELL WE RE SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT VACATIONS .
RIGHT .
AND UH I M TRYING TO THINK OF THE ONES THAT I VE BEEN ON THAT I LIKED THE MOST AND PROBABLY THE ONE I LIKED MOST WAS HAWAII .
OH DID YOU GET TO GO TO HAWAII .
YES .
YEAH WE WENT THERE FOR OUR TWENTYFIFTH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY IT S LOVELY IS NT IT .
YES WE WENT UH SIX MONTHS AFTER WE WERE MARRIED .
UHHUH .
AND WE JUST WENT TO UH TWO ISLANDS .
WHAT ISLANDS DID YOU GO TO .
WE WENT TO OAHU AND KAUAI .
KAUAI UHHUH WE WENT TO KAUAI AND THEN WE ALSO HIT MAUI AND THEN OF COURSE UH .
THE BIG ONE .
UH THE BIG ONE UHHUH .
OH .
WITH UH THE BIG ONE I THOUGHT WAS VERY COMMERCIALIZED .
OH YEAH IT WAS .
BUT THE OTHER TWO WERE JUST LOVELY .
YES I ENJOYED KAUAI BETTER TOO .
UHHUH IT WAS QUIET AND RESTFUL AND AND SO BEAUTIFUL IT WAS NT COMMERCIALIZED .
OH IT WAS RAINY .
YEAH WAS IT .
RAINY BUT YOU KNOW WE DO NT LIKE TO SPEND THE MONEY TO GO OVER THERE AND SIT ON THE BEACH ANYWAY SO .
THAT S RIGHT .
WELL IT WAS NT REAL RAINY WE HAD S A FEW SHOWERS BUT UH NOTHING THAT REALLY GOT IN THE WAY WITH ANYTHING AND JUST VERY BRIEF ONES AND AND WHEN UH NOW WE WENT TO NASSAU AND MY HUSBAND LIKED IT BETTER THAN HE DID HAWAII .
OH REALLY .
UHHUH .
OH .
YEAH HE REALLY DID I DO NT KNOW WHY YOU KNOW HE DID NT LIKE OAHU AT ALL HE THOUGHT .
UHHUH .
HE THOUGHT HONOLULU WAS JUST HORRIBLE YOU KNOW .

UNIVERSAL HEALTH INSURANCE RIGHT .
THAT S RIGHT .
UH .
WHAT WOULD WE LIKE TO SAY .
I THINK .
WELL I THINK UNIVERSAL HEALTH INSURANCE LIKE NATIONAL HEALTH LIKE WHAT .
CANADA HAS .
UHHUH .
IS THAT WHAT .
YOU RE YOU RE THINKING THE SUBJECT IS ABOUT .
I THINK THAT S WHAT .
THE SUBJECT IS ABOUT .
DID YOU READ UH THE ARTICLE IN THE PAPER TODAY ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR SUBJECT .
IN THE DALLAS THE MORNING TIMES .
YEAH .
I GUESS I DID NOT .
UH THE STATE OF WASHINGTON AND THE STATE OF MINNESOTA IS UH GOING TO BEGIN TESTING A PROGRAM A STATE FUNDED PROGRAM FOR CITIZENS OF THOSE TWO STATES AND THERE .
S FOURTEEN OTHER UH STATES .
THAT ARE CONSIDERING IT .
LEAST ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLE IN THE PAPER .
THIS MORNING .
I THINK IT S A TREND .
THAT S THAT S THAT S UH PROBABLY MAY GO NATIONWIDE EVENTUALLY BECAUSE I THINK NATIONAL HEALTH IS SOMETHING THAT WE .
ALL NEED .
IT S GETTING TO A POINT THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME FORM OF HEALTH INSURANCE .
WELL IT S BEEN INTERESTING THAT WE .
EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE THOUGH .
YES .
SO WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY THOUGH WHERE EVERYONE IF YOU ASK THEM ON POLLS WILL UH SAY THAT THEY THINK THAT EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT TO HEALTH CARE .
UHHUH .
AND YET I DO NT THINK WE VE EVER QUITE DECIDED WHO S REALLY SUPPOSED TO PAY FOR IT .
WELL THAT S THE THING YOU KNOW UH UNFORTUNATELY THE ONES .
THAT CURRENTLY PAY AND PAY THE PREMIUMS FOR HEALTH INSURANCE ARE ARE PAYING FOR THE PEOPLE .
THAT DO NT HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE .
WHICH IS WHY PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT WE OUGHT TO JUST ADMIT IT PERHAPS .
YEAH .
AND THEN TRY AND SOMEHOW SUBSIDIZE IT IN A WAY .
THAT S MORE FAIR .
I DO NT THINK YOU UH .
YOU HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE .
YES I DO .
THROUGH YOUR COMPANY .
UH THROUGH MY COMPANY YES .
BUT I HAVE BEEN IN A SITUATION UH RECENTLY WHERE I WAS LAID OFF FROM A POSITION AS A SALES MANAGER OF A COMPANY AND WAS OFF WORK FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND MY WIFE DEVELOPED CANCER .
WE DID NT HAVE ANY .
OH MY GOODNESS .
INSURANCE .
AND IT WAS A .
THAT S MUST HAVE BEEN HARD .
GO TO PARKLAND TYPE SITUATION .
HOW WAS YOUR CARE AT PARKLAND .
UH BECAUSE IT WAS A LIFE THREATENING SITUATION IT WAS VERY GOOD .
UH AS IT AS IT TURNED OUT ONE OF THE TOP UH PEOPLE OR ONE OF THE TOP DOCTORS IN THE STATE .
THAT IS INVOLVED IN CANCER TREATMENT WAS AT PARKLAND .
BUT YET PARKLAND IS NOT FREE EITHER .
NO IT S NOT FREE BUT UH .
IS IT AFFORDABLE .
IT S IT S A SITUATION THAT BECAUSE I DID NT HAVE ANY INSURANCE AND I WAS ON UNEMPLOYMENT IT WAS PAID BY THE COUNTY .
SO YOU DID HAVE A GOOD EXPERIENCE .
I HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE AS IT TURNED OUT .
UH I WAS FORTUNATE THAT THERE WAS PARKLAND .
IS YOUR WIFE BETTER I HOPE .
UH NO SHE PASSED AWAY .
I M REAL SORRY .
THAT S ALL RIGHT .
SURE .
THAT HAPPENS .
IT DOES HAPPEN BUT IT S VERY SAD .
YEAH BUT IN ANY EVENT UH I M IN FAVOR OF NATIONAL HEALTH .
WELL .
IF I HAD .
SO AM .
I .
TO VOTE FOR IT .
ACTUALLY UH I M A PEDIATRICIAN .
OH IS THAT RIGHT .
AND I FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT UH CHILDREN AND UH DEVELOPED VERY STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT THIS DURING OUR MEASLES EPIDEMIC .
UHHUH .
LAST YEAR .
UHHUH .
WHERE WE CERTAINLY PROVED THAT WE RE NOT DOING A VERY GOOD JOB WITH PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE AMONG CHILDREN AND PARTICULARLY THE CHILDREN .
WHO NEED IT MOST .
SO UH I M REALLY QUITE ACTIVE IN TRYING TO UH BE PROACTIVE AT LEAST FOR CHILDREN S ISSUES .
IT S VERY COMPLEX VERY COMPLICATED BUT UH I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT ALL CHILDREN HAVE A RIGHT TO IMMUNIZATION GLASSES HEARING AIDS BASIC HEALTH BENEFITS .
WELL I WHEN I GREW UP AND I GREW UP IN SOUTH CENTRAL KANSAS UH WE HAD AND MY MOM WORKED FOR THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT THE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND WE HAD XRAYS .
EVERY YEAR WE HAD A DENTIST COME TO OUR SCHOOL AND UH CHECK OUR TEETH ONCE A YEAR AT LEAST .
UH WE HAD ALL OUR FLU SHOTS TAKEN CARE OF OUR MEASLES MUMPS RUBELLA AND ALL THAT OTHER STUFF .
UM .
AND UH WHEN MY CHILDREN WERE GROWING UP WE DID NT HAVE THAT .
WE HAD TO PAY FOR IT WHICH .
I WAS NT OPPOSED TO PAYING FOR IT .
I HAD THE MONEY TO PAY FOR IT BUT I M SURE THAT THERE WERE PEOPLE .
THAT DO NT .
WELL AND THE COSTS HAVE SO MUCH HAS GONE UP SO MUCH .
THE COST OF IMMUNIZATIONS FOR EXAMPLE UH AND JUST THE LEGAL THE LEGAL BENEFITS UH THAT HAS REALLY FORCED PEOPLE INTO DOING A LOT OF THINGS UNNECESSARILY ET CETERA .
UHHUH .
SO WELL I DO NT KNOW IT S IT IS INTERESTING IN CASE .
YOU DID NT KNOW TEXAS LEADS THE NATION IN UNINSURED CHILDREN .
THIRTYONE PERCENT OF ALL TEXAS CHILDREN .
DID NOT KNOW THAT .
DO NOT HAVE INSURANCE AND ARE NOT ON MEDICAID .
SO UH ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE CHILDREN HAS NOTHING TO REIMBURSE THEM FOR THEIR HEALTH CARE .
AND I WORK IN THE CHILDREN S PARKLAND SYSTEM AND IT S PRETTY OVERWHELMING TO ME .
UHHUH .
BUT UH IT S PRETTY HARD TO BE INDIGENT AND TO BE DEPENDENT UPON INDIGENT HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS IN DALLAS COUNTY .
WELL NANCY WHAT DO YOU THINK UM SOME OF THE CHANGES IN ROLES OF WOMEN ARE IN AMERICAN SOCIETY IN THE PAST GENERATION OR TWO .
WELL OF COURSE WORKING .
UHHUH .
THAT S DEFINITELY GOT TO BE THE BIGGEST THING IS THAT EVERYBODY S OUT THERE WORKING .
UHHUH .
INCLUDING ME .
UHHUH .
WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS .
UM YEAH I AGREE .
YEAH .
I ALSO THINK THAT THERE ARE MORE UM THE PEOPLE ARE WOMEN STAY SINGLE LONGER IT SEEMS LIKE .
YES THEY DO .
YEAH .
YEAH THEY DO .
I KNOW MY MOTHER AND HER SISTER WERE BOTH MARRIED BY THE TIME THEY WERE TWENTY .
RIGHT .
AND I WAITED UNTIL I WAS THIRTYTWO SO .
UHHUH YEAH .
YOU KNOW UM I KNOW THAT .
YEAH THAT S TRUE IT S A BIG CHANGE I M AN O B NURSE AND SO I REALLY DO SEE WHAT YOU RE SAYING THERE .
UHHUH .
IT USED TO BE THAT OUR LIST RAN NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTYONE FOR OUR PATIENTS AGES AND NOW OUR CARE PLANS LOOK MORE LIKE THIRTYTWO THIRTYTHREE .
UHHUH .
AND IF WE GET SOMEBODY TWENTYONE WE GO OH LOOK HOW YOUNG .
YEAH .
SO YEAH YOU RE RIGHT THERE S A BIG CHANGE AND WE HAVE A LOT OF FIRST TIME MOMS IN THEIR LATE THIRTIES AND EVEN FORTIES .
UHHUH .
SO IT S TRUE .
YEAH .
BUT AGAIN I GUESS IT PROBABLY DOES GO BACK TO THE SAME THING OF WOMEN HAVING CAREERS .
UHHUH .
IF THEY DID NT HAVE IF THEY WERE NT OUT THERE WORKING AND HAVING THEIR CAREERS .
YEAH .
THEY PROBABLY WOULD BE MARRIED AND HAVING THEIR CHILDREN SO .
YEAH YEAH SEEMS LIKE THERE S .
I GUESS IT S A COMBINATION .
UHHUH GO AHEAD .
NO GO ON .
UH IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THERE ARE MORE SINGLE MOTHERS TOO I MEAN THAT S THERE RE .
YEAH .
A LOT OF EITHER DIVORCED OR UM YOU KNOW NEVER BEEN MARRIED SO .
YEAH YEAH YEAH THERE S A LOT OF MIXED UP FAMILIES THAT S FOR SURE .
YEAH I AGREE WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK HAVE BEEN THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE PAST GENERATION OR SO .
WELL JUST THAT I THINK THE FAMILIES THE THE ROLE IN THE FAMILY AND THE MOTHER DOES NT STAY HOME AND COOK THE DINNER .
UHHUH .
TAKE CARE OF THE CHILDREN UM WE DO IT ALL .
YEAH .
I REALLY THINK THAT AND I KNOW THAT THERE S A LOT MORE PARTICIPATION BY THE FATHERS BUT I STILL THINK THE MOTHERS HAVE THE MAJOR ROLE .
UHHUH .
I REALLY DO I THINK THEY RE JUST THEY RE NOT DOING VERY MUCH LESS I DO NT THINK AS FAR AS THE KIDS AND AND THE HOUSE AND EVERYTHING .
YEAH .
ARE CONCERNED NOT FROM WHAT I SEE .
YEAH .
AND AND THEY RE CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCOME BESIDES .
UHHUH .
I THINK THAT WE RE REALLY REALLY PUTTING A LOT OF STRESS ON OURSELVES .
UHHUH YEAH AND IT REALLY IT S AFFECTING THE FAMILIES .
OH IT IS .
YOU KNOW FOR MOTHERS NOT NOT TO BE HOME AND YET YOU KNOW UM I MEAN I I DO NT BLAME ANYBODY WHEN THEY HAVE TO WORK .
YEAH .
BECAUSE UM YEAH .
YEAH IT S IT S DIFFICULT AND I THINK THAT I LIVE IN PLANO ACTUALLY SO .
UHHUH .
IT S A VERY WEALTHY TOWN AND WE RE NOT PART OF THAT BUT IT IS YOU KNOW AND I THINK WHAT I SEE A LOT OF PARENTS A LOT OF MOTHERS WORKING JUST FOR BIGGER AND BETTER .
UHHUH .
AND I REALLY HATE THAT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW I HATE TO SEE THAT AND I I VE BEEN HERE FOR A VERY LONG TIME .
UHHUH .
BUT UM I DO NT KNOW NOW I M A SINGLE PARENT AND I DO NT HAVE A CHOICE ANY MORE .
UHHUH .
BUT I USED TO JUST WORK OCCASIONALLY FOR EXTRA MONEY BUT NOW I HAVE TO WORK ALL THE TIME .
UHHUH .
AND THAT S REALLY HARD .
YEAH .
AND AND I DO NT KNOW HOW A MOTHER DOES JUST CHOOSE TO GO OUT TO WORK AND AND LEAVE THE KIDS IN A WAY IT S GOOD IT S VERY GOOD TO GET OUT WITH ADULTS AND I THINK THAT S A GOOD THING IF YOU CAN DO IT .
UHHUH .
PART TIME BUT TO JUST GO OUT THERE FORTY HOURS A WEEK AT LEAST AND .
YEAH .
AND WORK AND AND LEAVE YOUR KIDS TO GET HOME FROM SCHOOL ALONE AND THAT KIND OF THING I THINK THAT S NOT VERY SMART I THINK THAT S .
UHHUH .
DIFFICULT ON THEM SO .
YEAH WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE NEXT GENERATION YOU THINK IT LL CONTINUE .
WELL IT S GOING TO BE INTERESTING .
YEAH .
YEAH I THINK IT WILL CHANGE BUT I M NOT SURE HOW IT S GOING TO BECAUSE YOU SEE YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY AND WONDER HOW IN THE WORLD THEY LL EVER AFFORD TO BUY A HOME AND .
UHHUH .
AND TO RAISE A FAMILY I DO NT KNOW HOW THEY RE GOING TO DO IT .
UHHUH .
AND SO I DO NT KNOW HOW IT CAN CHANGE TO WHERE THE MOTHER CAN GET BACK INTO THE HOME AGAIN I DO NT THAT EVER WILL GO BACKWARDS .
UHHUH .
BUT I DO NT KNOW WHAT EFFECT IT S GOING TO HAVE ON THESE KIDS NOW WHEN THEY GROW UP HOW THEY RE GOING TO FEEL ABOUT IT .
UHHUH .
IT YOU KNOW IT COULD LEAD TO ANOTHER WOODSTOCK TYPE THING YOU KNOW WHERE .
YEAH .
WHERE THERE S JUST TOO MUCH MATERIAL THINGS AND AND MAYBE THESE KIDS WILL REALLY RESENT THAT THEIR PARENTS ARE OUT THERE WORKING FOR THINGS .
UHHUH .
AND .
YEAH .
THEY MIGHT WANT TO DO WITHOUT THINGS RATHER THAN DO THAT TO THEIR FAMILIES .
UHHUH .
IT S HARD TO SAY .
YEAH IT IS I THINK SOME I DO NT KNOW HOW MANY YOU KNOW WHAT PERCENTAGE BUT SOME ARE WILL MOVE BACK TOWARD MORE TRADITIONAL LIFESTYLE OF STAYING HOME WITH THE CHILDREN I GUESS I SEE THAT HAPPENING ALREADY .
UHHUH .
SOME CHOOSING IT AND AND THEY GET YOU KNOW THERE RE PEOPLE CHIDE THEM FOR IT YOU KNOW WHY ARE NT YOU OUT .
OKAY .
OKAY I GUESS WE RE READY TO START .
WELL I GUESS WHAT PART OF T WHAT PART OF THE COUNTRY DO YOU LIVE IN .
I M IN DALLAS TEXAS .

UH .
MY PARTICULAR AREA THE HOMES RUN ANYWHERE FROM ABOUT SIXTYFIVE EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ON UP TO PROBABLY HALF A MILLION .
OH THAT S QUITE A RANGE .
YES UH THE HOMES .
THAT WERE HERE EARLIER WERE SMALLER .
NOW THEY VE GOTTEN LARGER AND LARGER AS AS THEY HAVE DEVELOPED THE LAND .

OH OH IT S JUST SUGGESTED .
SO HOW S THE BABY DO YOU THINK .
WHAT .
HOW S THE .
WE COULD TALK .
LET S TALK ABOUT THE BABY .
LET S TALK ABOUT THE BABY .
DOUG YOU WANT TO START .
SURE .
YOU DO NT USE ANY CREDIT CARDS I DO NT IMAGINE .
NO OF COURSE I USE .
CREDIT CARDS I HAVE A COUPLE OF CREDIT CARDS .
YEAH .
AND UH USE THEM .
UHHUH DO YOU USE THEM A LOT .
OH WE TRY NOT TO .
UHHUH .
WE RE ON A PRETTY STRICT AND TIGHT BUDGET .
UHHUH .
WE USE THE CREDIT CARDS HOWEVER WHEN WE RE AT A SITUATION WHERE WE DO NT HAVE EITHER THE CASH OR THE CHECKBOOK HANDY .
UHHUH .
OR WE USE CREDIT CARDS ALSO IF WE WANT TO GET AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON AN ITEM THAT WE RE PURCHASING SO .
OH WELL THAT S AN IDEA THAT S A THOUGHT UHHUH .
SO YES AND BASICALLY WE USE IT MAINLY WHEN WE RE TRAVELING .
UHHUH .
OR OUT OF STATE OR .
UHHUH .
OR SOMEWHERE WHERE YOU KNOW THEY DO NT TAKE LOCAL THEY DO NT TAKE OUT OF STATE CHECKS .
UHHUH .
AND SO WHEN WE RE TRAVELING SOME DO YOU USE CREDIT CARDS OFTEN .
MY HUSBAND LOVES THEM .
UH WE DO USE THEM UH WE TRY NOT TO BUT HE HE S ONE WHO BELIEVES IN CREDIT CARDS AND HE USES THEM QUITE A BIT .
UHHUH .
HE LIKES USING THEM AND THEN JUST PAY AT THE END OF THE MONTH .
OH YEAH WELL .
HE HE LIKES THAT .
THAT S THAT S A GOOD THING BECAUSE LOT OF PEOPLE DO NT PAY AT THE END OF THE MONTH .
UHHUH .
AND THEY JUST PAY THE MINIMUM REQUIRED BALANCE .
AND THAT S WHEN YOU GET INTO EXPENSES .
YES AND YOU GET IN OVER YOUR HEAD .
RIGHT .
IT LL UH SOME PEOPLE I KNOW ALSO TRY TO USE IT AS FLOAT .
UHHUH .
WHERE THEY BUY SOMETHING NOW AND SAY WELL I M GOING TO BUY THIS WHEN IT S GOOD AND ON SALE AND THEN I CAN .
UHHUH .
GO AHEAD AND PAY FOR IT WHEN I GET MY CHECK AT THE END OF THE MONTH WHEN I M BEING PAID .
RIGHT WELL SOMETIMES YOU DO COME ON BARGAINS AND THAT AND IT S REALLY USEFUL .
THAT S TRUE .
AND SOME PLACES WO NT TAKE YOU KNOW LIKE PERSONAL CHECKS OR CASH EVEN .
UHHUH .
BUT THEY WOULD TAKE A CREDIT CARD .
RIGHT HOW A HOW ARE THE LAWS IN PENNSYLVANIA UH AS AS REGARD WELL NOT THE LAWS BUT THE RATES CREDIT CARD RATES IN PENNSYLVANIA FOR EXAMPLE DOWN HERE WHEN YOU GO UP TO A GAS STATION .
UHHUH .
YOU GET AN EXTRA CHARGE FOR CREDIT CARDS .
RIGHT .
THAN YOU WOULD BY PAYING FOR CASH ARE THEY THE SAME THERE .
WE YEAH WE HAVE THE SAME THING UP HERE SO WE DO NT DEAL WHERE THEY DO THAT .
WE CHA YOU KNOW WE GO TO PLACES WHERE THEY DO NT CHARGE EXTRA SOME OF THEM CHARGE FIVE CENTS A GALLON EVEN LIKE THE GAS STATIONS MORE .
THAT S PRETTY STEEP .
AND UH WE JUST TRY TO AVOID YOU KNOW THE ONES THAT DO THAT WE JUST DO NT UH GO THERE .

ING SEEMS TO BE A A TOPIC .
THAT S GOING TO PROBABLY TAKE ABOUT A GENERATION TO UH CATCH ON IT SEEMS OR MAYBE A GENERATION TO TWO .
AND WE MAY HAVE TO DO IT OUT OF NECESSITY AS FAR AS MOVING THAT TIME SCHEDULE UP .
UH IT DOES SEEM TO BE A LOT OF HABITS TO BREAK .
I UH WAS NT RAISED AS A KID ON IT BUT MY KIDS ARE AND SO THEY THEY TENDED TO WANT TO GRAB THE ALUMINUM CANS WHEN THAT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS TO DO AND WE WERE DOING ALL RIGHT THERE UNTIL UH THE PRICE DROPPED OUT AND THEY WERE NT WORTH .
ANYTHING ANYMORE .
UHHUH .
AND WE IT TOOK US ALMOST A YEAR TO GET A GARBAGE SACK FULL .
WE JUST DO NT DRINK THAT MANY .
SO AS FAR AS AT HOME USE UH WE LL PICK UP A SIX PACK .
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE OR FOR WHATEVER OCCASION OF DOCTOR PEPPER OR SOMETHING AND AND BY THE TIME .
WE GATHERED UP ENOUGH CRUSHED CANS TO TAKE IT IN UH AT THE TIME .
IT WAS STILL OH ABOUT FORTY OR FIFTY CENTS .
A POUND AND WE CAME OUT WITH ABOUT A DOLLAR IT JUST REALLY WAS NT WORTH .
IT .
AND A LOT OF HASSLE .
ALL YEAR ROUND AND CANS LAYING .
YEAH .
YEAH .
SO THEY THEY REALIZED YOU KNOW WELL OF COURSE TO THEM .
A DOLLAR WAS A DOLLAR AT FOUR AND FIVE YEARS OLD .
THAT WAS NT UH THAT WAS A BIG DEAL BUT WE DECIDED IT WAS NT WORTH .
US KEEPING IT AND THEN UH T I STARTED KEEPING UP WITH UH CANS .
THERE SO OCCASIONALLY I LL BRING WHATEVER .
I VE GOT LAYING AROUND THE CAR OR THE LIKE AND THROW THEM IN THERE .
LEAST .
IT GETS BACK INTO THE SYSTEM BUT AS FAR AS A HABIT AT THE HOUSE UH I HAVE NT STARTED ON ANYTHING OTHER THAN JUST WHATEVER .
THE CITY WANTS TO PICK UP .
HAVE YOU .
ALL GOT THE INDIVIDUAL CONTAINERS YET .
NO I READ IN THE PAPER .
THIS WEEK WHERE MAYBE I DO NT KNOW IF IT .
W WAS I GUESS MAYBE THIS WEEK .
SOMEONE MAY START GETTING THEM IF THE TRUCK .
THAT PICKS THEM UP IS OUTFITTED IN TIME .
UM .
BUT IT IT SHOULD BE STARTING I WOULD STAY PROBABLY IN THE NEXT MONTH IF IF EVERYTHING GOES THAT I M NOT SURE ALL .
WHAT .
WE RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO WHETHER WE HAVE THREE SEPARATE CONTAINERS I REALLY DO NT UNDERSTAND THAT PART ON WHAT .
THEY VE TOLD YOU TO SEPARATE EVERYTHING .
RIGHT .
YEAH IT SEEMED LIKE UH IF IF I RECALL IT S BEEN A LONG TIME .
THEY RE WAY BEHIND SCHEDULE ON THAT PARTICULAR PART OF IT .
THEY WERE FINE ON THE GREEN BIG GREEN CONTAINERS .
UHHUH .
BUT UH SEEMS LIKE THEY SAID THEY WERE JUST GOING TO HAVE A BIN AND ALL DIFFERENT TYPES WOULD GO IN THERE AND THEN THAT THEY WOULD SORT IT AS .
OH .
AS NEEDED .
IT IT SEEMED THAT THERE WAS AT THE TIME ANYWAY IT THE THINKING WAS THAT THERE WAS TOO MUCH NOT GETTING SORTED PROPERLY AND THAT AT AT THE COLLECTION SITES WHERE EVERYTHING S CLEARLY LABELED AND PEOPLE .
THAT HAPPEN TO GO TO THAT KIND OF TROUBLE TO DO IT HAPPEN TO DO IT PRETTY WELL UH THOSE ARE OKAY TO HAVE THE GENERAL PUBLIC DOING THE SORTING .
BUT WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO JUST GENERAL PURPOSE TRASH THAT ALL THE HOUSES UH THE SUCCESS RATE OF GETTING IT SORTED PROPERLY SEEMED TO BE POOR SO THEY FELT THAT HAVING ONE GUY JUST SIT THERE AND RUN THROUGH IT REAL QUICK WAS BETTER THAN THAN .
UHHUH .
HAVING A HOUSEHOLD TRY IT .
BUT I I DO NT KNOW THAT SOUNDS LIKE AN AWFUL LOT OF LABOR TO SORT THE ENTIRE WEEK S WORTH OF TRASH FOR A HOUSE .
WELL IT WOULD GET MESSY TOO .
YEAH YEAH .
I I I KNOW OTHER PLACES WHEN THEY RECYCLE THEY HAVE TO LIKE WASH OUT THEIR GLASS JARS AND .
RIGHT .
WHATNOT .
AND UH WHICH .
WE RE NOT IN THE HABIT OF DOING .
THAT S TRUE .
I WAS BROUGHT UP UH YOU KNOW LONG TIME AGO THAT THEY DID NT EVEN HAVE CANS .
THEY HAD BOTTLES AND YOU D RETURN THEM TO THE .
RIGHT .
THE GROCERY STORE AND YOU D GET OUR MONEY BACK AND THAT THAT WAS ALL WELL AND GOOD .
THEY DO NT SEEM TO STILL BE DOING THAT .
IF THEY COULD JUST ELIMINATE THE CANS AND USE GLASS BUT I GUESS THIS DAY AND AGE .
YEAH .
THEY DO NT .
THEY DO NT DO THAT .
WE LIVE NEXT TO A SET OF RAILROAD TRACKS AND IT SEEMED TO BE A VERY POPULAR THING FOR PEOPLE DRIVING BY THAT HIGHWAY THERE BY OUR TRACKS TO THROW THE BOTTLES AT THE TRACKS AND TRY TO CRASH YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
BREAK THEM BUT UH THEY WERE NT THAT SUCCESSFUL SO THERE WERE A LOT OF BOTTLES TO BE RETURNED AND WE JUST WALK ABOUT A HALF .
A MILE IN EACH DIRECTION AND GATHERED UP ENOUGH TO BUY WHATEVER .
WE WANTED .
UHHUH .
FOR THE DAY AND .
YEAH AND THEY UH P I I THINK KIDS DO NT APPRECIATE MAYBE THE VALUE OF MONEY THAT IT S SO LITTLE THAT THEY DO NT CARE THEY CAN GET MORE SOMEWHERE ELSE .
YEAH JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BEGGING WILL .
UH FOR A GOOD RIGHT .
THEY RE THE NICKELS THE DIMES OR WHAT I SUPPOSE IT MIGHT BE QUARTERS FIFTY CENT PIECES IN THESE DAYS THAT THEY WOULD GET THEY THE KIDS JUST DO NT SEEM TO TO CARE THAT THAT MUCH ABOUT A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY .
RIGHT .
WELL I WONDER .
BUT WE WE DID BUY A CAN CRUSHER AND WE ARE CRUSHING CANS AND WHEN WE BUY THE SODA WHEN IT S ON SALE FOR NINETYNINE CENTS SO I WOULD SAY .
YEAH .
IN THE LAST THREE YEARS WE VE PROBABLY USED A LOT MORE CANS THAN EVER BEFORE .
UH IT WAS JUST EASIER TO DO THAT THAN TO OPEN A LARGE LITER BOTTLE AND THEN HAVE IT GO FLAT .
RIGHT YEAH .
SO THAT S THE MAIN REASON .
WE RE WE SORT OF ARE INTO CANS AT THIS POINT RATHER THAN THE LITER BOTTLES .
WHERE DO YOU TAKE YOUR CANS .
WELL AS YOU SAY IT TAKES A WHILE TO BUILD IT UP .
SINCE WE VE HAD THE CRUSHER .
ALL SUMMER WE I GUESS WE JUST NOW MAYBE HAVE A BAG FULL THAT WE HAVE NT TA OH I THINK THE KIDS WHEN WE WERE ON VACATION THEY SAID THEY DID TAKE THEM TO A A RECYCLING PLACE PROBABLY AT ONE OF THE LI .

YOU KNOW I UH UH I DID MY PARENTS LIVE IN OHIO SO I I DO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE YOU KNOW THE REALLY COLD WEATHER .
AND UH I VE ALWAYS LIVED DOWN HERE IN THE SOUTH AND OH I TOOK MY CAR UP THERE TO THEIR HOUSE AND UM I GUESS I HAD A CRACK IN THE BLOCK AND WHEN I GOT UP THERE THE CAR .
OKAY THE TOPIC OF THE CONVERSATION IS NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE AND THE PROS AND CONS AND DO I DO WE THINK THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD FINANCE IT WHAT IS YOUR OPINION .
I SAY YES .
YOU SAY YES .
YES MOTHER LIVES IN FLORIDA AND THERE ARE IN HER SUBDIVISION THERE ARE FIFTY PERCENT CANADIANS WHO WO NT GIVE UP THEIR CANADIAN CITIZENSHIP BECAUSE OF THE HEALTH INSURANCE .
I HAVE HEARD SOMEONE ELSE UH SAY THAT UH THE CANADIAN HEALTH INSURANCE IS ABSOLUTELY EXCELLENT .
IT S WONDERFUL .
AND ONE OF THE WAYS THAT THEY RE FINANCING IT IS THEY HAVE AN EXORBITANT TAX ON THEIR CIGARETTES .
OH .
THIS IS .
WELL .
EVIDENTLY THIS IS ONE OF THE WAYS THAT THEY RE PAYING FOR THE PROGRAM PLUS DISCOURAGING THE PEOPLE TO QUIT SMOKING SO THEY DO NT HAVE TO PAY OUT AS MANY UH BENEFITS ON LIKE LUNG CANCER AND THINGS LIKE THIS .
WELL EVEN IF THAT S SO YOU KNOW REALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT THEY HAVE FULL COVERAGE THEY HAVE H M O WHICH YOU KNOW AFTER YOU GET USED TO IT IT S NOT TOO BAD AND UH EVERYTHING IS COVERED .
YEAH WE .
AND WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES THAT WE SPEND WELL IN MY FAMILY ALONE WE SPENT FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS IN JULY ON MEDICAL BILLS .
OH MY WORD LYNN .
INSURANCE DID NT COVER A PENNY YEAH .
THAT S HORRIBLE .
YES IT IS HORRIBLE .
WELL WE RE FORTUNATE IN THAT WE SO FAR KNOCK ON WOOD MOST OF US HAVE BEEN RELATI REAL HEALTHY .
YEAH BUT .
SO WE DO NT HAVE A LOT OF MEDICAL BILLS .
UH IF YOU RE HEALTHY IT S FINE BUT I HAD TWO KIDS IN THE HOSPITAL IN JULY .
YEAH BUT WHAT WORRIES ME IS THE FACT THAT I DO NT LIKE THE GOVERNMENT TELLING ME WHO I CAN SEE AND WHO I CA NT SEE .
YEAH BUT YOU KNOW RICHARDSON SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS THE H M O .
UHHUH .
AND NINETY PERCENT OF THE DOCTORS YOU WOULD CHOOSE ARE ON THAT LIST .
ARE THEY .
YEAH .
WELL I KNOW THAT GRE JAMES HAD IT .
MCCULLUM IS .
I BEG YOUR PARDON .
MCCULLUM IS .
YEAH YEAH I KNOW THAT WHEN JAMES WAS WITH CONTINENTAL STEEL MCCULLUM WAS PART OF THAT AND AND THAT S GOOD BUT I ALSO HEARD FOR INSTANCE LIKE UH MY FRIEND S DAUGHTER WAS ON IT THROUGH TEXAS INSTRUMENTS AND SHE WAS ON THAT KAISER PERMANENTE .
UHHUH .
AND THEY HAD SCREWED UP HER APPOINTMENT AND WHEN SHE WENT IN SHE HAD TO TAKE WHICHEVER DOCTOR WAS AVAILABLE AND THEY SHE WOULD HAVE HAD TO WAIT LIKE TWO MONTHS TO GET THE DOCTOR SHE WANTED .
WELL BUT THAT S .
BUT THEN AGAIN I GUESS YOU CAN EVEN DO THAT IN MCCULLUM .
THAT S A SCREW UP IN AN APPOINTMENT YOU KNOW I M GOING BACK TO THE DAYS WHEN I WAS PREGNANT .
UHHUH .
AND I HAD TWO DOCTORS AND ONE WAS MY FAVORITE PERSONALITY WISE .
UHHUH .
BUT WHEN I DELIVERED RONNIE HE WAS NOT ON CALL .
UHHUH .
THE OTHER GUY DELIVERED HIM .
WELL THAT S TRUE AND THAT STILL GOES ON .
YOU KNOW AND THAT AND YOU KNOW IF UM I GO TO TOWNSEND .
UHHUH .
HE S GOT A NEW PARTNER I GO TO BOTH OF THEM NOW YOU KNOW I HAVE NO CHOICE .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE WHEN I WANT TO GO .
IF DR HOWE OR WHATEVER HIS NAME IS IS ON DUTY I GO TO HIM .
WELL YOU KNOW IT UH HOW DO YOU THINK WE RE GOING TO PAY FOR IT MORE AND MORE TAXES .
WELL NO WE NEED TO CUT SOME OF OUR SPENDINGS CUT SOME OF THE FAT OFF THE TOP AND WHITTLE IT DOWN TO THE REST OF US .
I KNOW THAT IT S GETTING TO THE POINT THAT THE INSURANCE DOES NT PAY THAT MUCH ON CATASTROPHIC ILLNESSES .
NO .
THEY DO NT PAY ANYTHING ON UH IMPLANTS .
NO .
OR TRANSPLANTS AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE NEEDING THESE AND THE AVERAGE PERSON CA NT AFFORD YOU KNOW A HEART OR A KIDNEY .
YEAH .
ON JUST THEIR OWN .
BUT YOU KNOWN RONNIE IN AUSTIN WENT TO A PROGRAM AND WENT TO A SOCIAL WORKER .
UHHUH .
AND AT THE SAME TOKEN THERE IS SOMETHING BECAUSE HE CAN GET HIS PILLS FOR TWO DOLLARS WHEN I M PAYING FIFTEEN ON MY MEDICAL INSURANCE .
GOOD GRIEF .
AND HE CAN GET FREE MEDICAL CARE BUT HE HAS TO GO TO THE CITY HOSPITAL INSTEAD OF SEEING DAVID .
UHHUH .
AND SO AGAIN YOU KNOW WE WENT THROUGH IT RONNIE S HOME TONIGHT AND WE TALKED ABOUT IT AND SAID YOU KNOW IS IT WORTH IT YEAH YOU KNOW HE PAYS FORTYFIVE DOLLARS A MONTH FOR HIS PRESCRIPTIONS WHERE HE COULD PAY SIX DOLLARS .
UHHUH UHHUH .
SO THERE .
VERY TRUE .
ARE PROGRAMS YOU KNOW IF YOU GET ON MEDICARE OR MEDICAID OR ONE OF THOSE .
WELL I KNOW THEY HAVE THE MEDICAID YOU KNOW FOR THOSE THAT HAVE TROUBLE AND I KNOW THAT LIKE WE HAVE THE UH PRESCRIPTION CARDS WHICH THAT S HELPED BUNCHES .
YEAH .
AND WONDER IF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE FIGHTING THE NATIONAL HEALTH OR WONDER IF THEY RE WANTING IT .
THAT S WHAT I READ .
THAT THEY ARE WANTING .
OKAY WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM FIRST OFF DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN THAT ARE IN IT .
I HAVE CHILDREN THAT ARE IN THE PLANO PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEMS AND I AM A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER AT THIS POINT LOOKING FOR A FULLTIME JOB IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL .
OH OKAY .
SYSTEM SO .
WELL THEN YOU SHOULD BE A GOOD ONE TO KNOW BECAUSE I MY CHILDREN ARE GROWN NOW I NOW HAVE GRANDCHILDREN .
OH .
IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM SO UH I DO NT HAVE FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE RIGHT NOW .
UHHUH UHHUH .
WITH IT SO WHAT DO YOU THINK .
WELL I THINK THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEMS ARE DOING A GOOD JOB I THINK THEY HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO YET BUT I THINK THAT UM THEY ARE STARTING TO HEAD TOWARDS MORE TECHNOLOGY AND GETTING THE KIDS COMPUTER LITERATE EARLIER YOU KNOW MY KINDERGARTNERS WERE ON THE WERE ON THE COMPUTERS AND I THINK THAT WITH THE WAY THE WORLD IS TODAY THAT S GOT TO BE DONE AND I THINK THAT UH THE SCHOOLS NOW ARE STARTING TO TEACH THINKING STRATEGIES MORE THAN JUST GIVING THEM YOU KNOW SKILLS YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
YOU DO NT JUST ADD ONE PLUS ONE YOU FIGURE OUT WHY YOU RE ADDING IT AND WHAT YOU RE GOING TO DO WITH IT ONCE YOU VE GOT IT TOGETHER AND I THINK THAT THAT S SOMETHING THAT IS DRASTICALLY NEEDED BECAUSE MOST OF THESE KIDS CAN NOT THINK THEY LITERALLY CAN NOT COME IN OUT OF THE RAIN .
THAT S RIGHT .
YOU KNOW AND THAT JUST I DO NT CARE HOW INTELLIGENT YOU ARE IF YOU BE CAN NOT MAKE IT FUNCTION FOR YOU THAT INTELLIGENCE IS BEING WASTED .
RIGHT .
AND UH THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF MY PET PEEVES AND PROBABLY WHY I WENT INTO EDUCATION SO I THINK YOU KNOW THEY RE THEY RE TRYING TO HEAD THEM INTO TEACHING THEM TO THINK AND USE THE EDUCATION THAT THEY HAVE AND I THINK THAT S VERY VERY IMPORTANT .
YES IT IS I I AGREE WITH YOU THAT THEY RE STARTING CHILDREN SO MUCH EARLIER ON THINGS BECAUSE OUR GRANDCHILDREN WE HAVE A UH FOURTH GRADER AND THEN WE HAVE ONE THAT S IN KINDERGARTEN AND AND I KNOW THE FOURTH GRADER IS DOING STUFF THAT OUR CHILDREN WAS DOING WERE DOING IN THE FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADE .
OH YEAH .
YOU KNOW IT S AMAZING .
TO ME AND STUFF THAT I DID NT DO UNTIL I WAS IN JUNIOR HIGH .
OH YEAH .
WHICH OF COURSE SHOWS MY AGE .
I TUTOR A GIRL THAT S IN EIGHTH GRADE AND HER PREALGEBRA BOOK IS HIGHER THEN SOME OF MY ALGEBRA TWO .
WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL .
IS THAT SCARY .
AND IT S LIKE OH I GOING TO TAKE THIS HOME AND STUDY IT BEFORE I CAN HELP YOU .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW SO THEY RE REALLY THEY RE REALLY MOVING THEM ALONG BUT YET AT THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW THEY ARE STOPPING AND MAKING THEM USE IT AND FUNCTION WITH IT LIKE THEY WOULD NEED TO DO IN EVERYDAY LIFE .
NOW .
AND THAT S WHA YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID IN SCHOOL I VE NEVER USED AND NEVER WILL USE .
YES .
AND UH SO I THINK THAT IT S IT S APPROPRIATE TO TEACH THEM YOU KNOW WHY THEY ARE LEARNING THIS NOT JUST BECAUSE THE TEACHER SAYS YOU HAVE TO LEARN THIS .
CORRECT ARE YOU FINDING THAT UH SINCE YOU RE DOING SUBSTITUTE THAT YOU RE WANTING TO DO FULLTIME UM I HAVE A FRIEND THAT S A TEACHER THAT ONE OF HER COMPLAINTS IS SHE CA NT TEACH BECAUSE SHE S SO BUSY FILLING OUT ALL THE FORMS .
YES THAT S A .
AND AND D ARE YOU DO YOU FIND THAT .
WELL FILLING OUT THE FORMS AND ALSO ALL OF THESE UH STATEWIDE AND NATIONAL WIDE TESTING .
UHHUH .
THINGS SO THAT THEY COMPARE AND MUMBLEX YOU KNOW YOU CAN AS FAR AS I M CONCERNED YOU CAN MAKE A SURVEY OR TEST SCORES SAY ANYTHING YOU WANT IT TO SAY .
UHHUH .
AND IT S JUST A MATTER OF HOW YOU RE GOING TO INTERPRET IT AND YOU WASTE SO MUCH TIME QUOTE UNQUOTE TEACHING TO THE TEST TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR SCORES ARE THE VERY BEST THEY RE POSSIBLY GOING TO BE .
BE UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THAT I THINK IT S UH I THINK IT S CRAZY PERSONALLY .
YOU KNOW THE FIR THE WHOLE FIRST NINE WEEKS OF SCHOOL IS IS USED AS A REVIEW BUT MORE THAN A REVIEW THEY RE GETTING THOSE KIDS PRIMED AND READY FOR THE TESTS THAT ARE COMING UP IN .
COMING UP UHHUH .
OCTOBER SO THAT YOU KNOW YOUR SCHOOL DISTRICT SHINES THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND I THINK THAT S TOTALLY USELESS I THINK YOU KNOW THERE S A PLACE AND A TIME FOR ALL OF THE TESTS AND COMPARISONS BUT I THINK THEY VE TAKEN IT TO THE EXTENT NOW THAT IT S JUST RIDICULOUS IT S LIKE BRAGGING ON YOUR GRANDCHILDREN .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW AND EVERYBODY S KIDS ARE THE BEST KIDS THAT HAVE EVER HIT THIS EARTH AND NOBODY ELSE S CHILDREN ARE GOING TO EVER LIVE UP TO THIS AND THAT S GREAT BUT THAT S WHAT THEY RE DOING WITH THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS AND THEY RE WASTING TOO MUCH TIME ON THAT I THINK .
WELL I I KNOW THAT THIS AGAIN THIS THIS FRIEND .
UH IS IN THE PLANO SCHOOL DISTRICT .
UHHUH .
AND SHE TEACHES UH UH IT MUS UH EMOTIONALLY DISTURBED CHILDREN .
UHHUH .
AND SHE SAYS SHE HAS UM SIX GRADERS IN THERE THAT ARE READING ON THE LEVEL OF THE SECOND GRADE .
YES .
AND .
SHE SAYS SHE S GETTING VERY FRUSTRATED AND VERY DEPRESSED BECAUSE THE SCHOOL IS PRESSURING HER TO PASS THEM ON EVEN THOUGH THEY RE NOT READY BUT BECAUSE EVIDENTLY YOU RECEIVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY WHEN THEY RE PASSED ON OR SOMETHING I DID NT QUITE UNDERSTAND IT .
YEAH THERE S A YEAH .
AND UH .
THE BOTTOM LINE IS ALWAYS MONEY .
OKAY YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND TELL ME YOUR FAVORITE TEAM OR WHO .
YOU THINK WILL BE DOING WELL THIS YEAR .
UH WELL WHERE I M FROM THE ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE IS A VERY BIG CONFERENCE AND COURSE WE HAVE DUKE UNIVERSITY .
THAT WAS THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONS LAST YEAR SO I M KIND OF HOPING THAT THEY LL REPEAT AGAIN THIS YEAR .

YEAH .
AND HAVE THINGS TO DO AT NIGHT I JUST I WANT FLUFF .
UHHUH UHHUH .
I DO NT WANT A LOT OF THINKING .
THAT S TRUE THAT KIND OF IS A GOOD WAY TO DO IT .
IT UH YOU KNOW IT S IT S MUCH MORE RELAXING SOMETIMES WHEN I READ TIME MAGAZINE AFTER I VE READ AN ARTICLE I M REAL DEPRESSED OVER THE SITUATION OF THE WORLD .
SO WELL IT SEEMS LIKE WE BOTH KIND OF AGREE ON THE SUBJECT OF MAGAZINES .
YEAH YEAH .
AND UH .
OKAY .
SO UH I THINK THAT PROBABLY I WILL END THE CALL I VE ENJOYED .
OKAY MIKE I GUESS WE LL BE TALKING ABOUT PAINTING RECENTLY ANY KIND OF RECENT PAINTING YOU VE DONE UH YOURSELF HAVE YOU DONE ANY RECENTLY .
WELL WE UH REMODELED A BATHROOM .
UHHUH .
AND WHICH REQUIRED UH COMPLETELY REPAINTING THE BATHROOM AND THE OTHER PROJECT WE VE DONE AROUND HERE IS UH WE VE REMODELED ALL OUR ALL OUR CLOSETS .
WOW WOW THAT S THAT S QUITE A CHORE .
WHICH REQUIRED QUITE A BIT OF PAINTING .
YES I IMAGINE IT DID DID YOU HAVE THAT DONE PROFESSIONALLY OR DID YOU DO THAT YOURSELF .
NO WE DID IT OURSELVES DID IT MYSELF .
DID YOU ENJOY THAT .
YEAH .
OH THAT S THAT S FUN WE JUST RECENTLY UH HAD OUR BOYS ROOM OUR TWO OLDEST BOYS SHARE A ROOM AND THEY RE UH THE PAINT HAS UH KIND OF FADED AND DETERIORATED AND SO WE DECIDED TO PAINT THEIR ROOM AND PUT UP WALLPAPER AND BORDER AND SO FORTH AND UH LOOKS QUITE GOOD WE WERE QUITE PLEASED WITH THE RESULT .
IS THIS A PROJECT YOU DID YOURSELF .
YES IT S A PROJECT UH THAT I DID YES AND AND UH .
WHAT WHAT BROUGHT ABOUT THE FADING OF THE PAINT .
WELL .
JUST SUN EXPOSURE .
I DO NT THINK IT S SUN EXPOSURE BUT UH BOYS WILL BE BOYS AND THERE THERE WERE CRAYON MARKS ON THERE AND .
OH OKAY YEAH .
WE HAD TO TO SCRUB THE CRAYON MARKS OFF OF COURSE TRY AND GET IT CLEAN .
LATEX PAINT .
PARDON ME .
LATEX .
YES IT WAS IT WAS LATEX PAINT AND THAT S UH WHAT WE PUT BACK ON THERE WAS A LATEX PAINT .
UHHUH .
PLUS UH THEY HAD BUNK BEDS AND THE BOY ONE OF THE YOUNGER BOYS WHEN HE WAS YOUNGER ABOUT THREE YEARS OLD GOT A UH GOT A NICE MARKER AND GOT UP ON THE CEILING AND DECIDED TO DRAW PICTURES .
ON THE CEILING .
YES ON THE CEILING .
YEAH .
AND UH YOU SCRUB AND YOU SCRUB BUT YOU CA NT IT ALL OFF .
NO THAT S TRUE .
AND SO THAT S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE PAINTED AND UH .
DID YOU GO WHAT KIND OF PAINT DID YOU USE ON THE CEILING .
WE USED A FLAT LATEX PAINT .
OKAY .
AND IN THE BEDROOM AS I UNDERSTAND THAT S UH ONE OF THE BETTER TYPE OF PAINTS TO HAVE .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE IT S NOT SO REFLECTIVE AND AND GLASSY COLORED AND IT UH TURNED OUT REAL REAL WELL .
SEEMS LIKE UH I VE WE VE DONE SOME REMODELING OF SOME UH RENTAL HOUSES THAT WE HAVE .
UHHUH .
AND IT APPEARS AS THOUGH THAT UH OH IN THE FIFTIES OR SIXTIES WHEN SOME OF THESE HOUSES WERE BUILT UH THEY USED A LOT OF UH SEMIGLOSS TYPE ENAMEL FOR CEILING PAINTS .
UHHUH .
AND THAT WAS A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO COVER WITH TODAY S PAINTS .
IT SEEMED LIKE WE HAD AN OCCASION UH WHERE WE HAD TO DO SOME SEALING .
UHHUH .
OF UH THE SE OF THE THIS TYPE OF PAINT BEFORE WE COULD PAINT IT .
OH YOU HAD TO PRIME IT AND .
YEAH .
AND SE COVER OVER IT .
RIGHT .
HUH .
YOU HAD PRETTY GOOD LUCK WITH ONE COAT TYPE PAINT YOU USE A PARTICULAR BRAND OR ANYTHING .
WELL I LIKE TO USE THIS THIS SEARS UH THE TEN YEAR GUARANTEE OR THE FIFTEEN YEAR GUARANTEE .
WEATHER BEATER TYPE STUFF .
YEAH .
YEAH .
AND THE REASON BEING IS ONCE I PAINTED I DO NT WANT TO HAVE TO GO AND DO IT ANOTHER FIVE OR SEVEN YEARS LATER .
UNDERSTAND .
BUT UH AND UH WE RE QUITE SATISFIED WITH THAT .
UHHUH .
AND AND OCCASIONALLY YOU CAN WATCH FOR IT AND GET IT ON SALE AND WE DO DO THAT IN FACT I WAS JUST READING AN ARTICLE YOU MENTIONED PAINTING YOUR BATHROOM .
UHHUH .
I READ AN ARTICLE RECENTLY THAT UH YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL ON THE KIND OF PAINT YOU PUT ON THE CEILING IN YOUR BATHROOM BECAUSE IT DOES TEND TO TO PEEL OR COME OFF BECAUSE OF THE MOISTURE HIGH MOISTURE CONTENT IN YOUR BATH BATHROOM .
YEAH IT S A LOT LIKE UH WALL PAPER THAT S TRUE .
AND UH DID YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THAT OR .
WELL THE PARTICULAR BATHROOM THAT WE DID IS A HALF BATH SO WE DID NT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT .
OH GOOD .
UH I HAVE HAD I VE UH HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED THAT TYPE OF A PROBLEM .
UHHUH .
UH WITH A LATEX PAINT .
OH GOOD NEI NEITHER HAVE I .
SO YOU SHOULD NT HAVE A YOU SHOULD NT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT .
OH GOOD .
THEY RE THEY RE PRETTY WELL REFINED TODAY .
UHHUH .
A LOT OF THE PAINTS AND SEARS IS ONE OF THE BETTER ONES .
YEAH .
I VE USED UH MANY A GALLON OF THEM MYSELF .
DO YOU UH HAVE YOU EVER USED AN OIL BASE PAINT .
UH USED OIL BASE PAINTS FOR TRIM .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW LIKE AROUND DOORS AND AND ON DOORS THINGS LIKE THAT .
WH WHY DO YOU USE THAT I M I M KIND OF LEARNING AT THIS NEW AT THIS BUT .
UH PRIMARILY BECAUSE IT IT SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE MORE UH WELL LET S SAY .
IT ADHERES BETTER OR LASTS LONGER .
WELL NOT SO MUCH THAT IT SEEMS TO HOLD UP A LITTLE BIT BETTER TOWARDS THE NICKS AND DINGS .
OH OKAY .
AS OPPOSED TO UH A LATEX TYPE PAINT .
UHHUH .
AND UH IT JUST YOU KNOW IT IT GIVES YOU A A VARIANCE EVEN THOUGH IT S THE SAME COLOR .
RIGHT WELL THAT S GOOD THAT S GOOD .
SO IT S WORKED OUT PRETTY WELL FOR US .
UH HAVE YOU EVER DONE ANY PAINTING OUTSIDE .
UH QUITE A BIT PAINTED A COUPLE OF HOUSES UH RECENTLY THIS SUMMER WE PAINTED A UH OUT BUILDING WHICH IS A SHED THAT WE HAVE ON THE .
GO AHEAD .
UM I HAVE NT GIVEN THIS A A LOT OF THOUGHT I M UH THAT THAT S A WHOLE PLEASED WITH THE PR PRACTICE THAT IS THEY I UH I DO NT YOU WOULD FAVOR INVASIONS OF PRIVACY ON THE OTHER HAND THAT S ARGUABLE BUT THAT THAT UH PEOPLE WHO S JOBS ARE CRITICAL TO PUBLIC SAFETY SHOULD HAVE TO MEET SPECIAL STANDARDS UH I HAVE NT GIVEN THIS MATTER ENOUGH THOUGHT .
DO YOU WORK FOR T I .
NO UH .
OH .
I M IN THE WASHINGTON AREA I WORK FOR N I S T .
OH OKAY OH ALL RIGHT WELL SEE WE HAVE THE TESTING ALREADY HERE WE VE HAD IT FOR OH ABOUT FIVE YEARS .
UHHUH .
IT USED TO JUST BE FOR NEW EMPLOYEES AND NOW .
AND NOW .
IT S FOR ALL EMPLOYEES THEY UH RANDOMLY SELECT EMPLOYEE NUMBERS AND UH THE DAY THAT THEY SELECT YOU IS WHEN YOU HAVE TO GO AND AND BE TESTED .
OKAY AND HOW DO PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT IT .
SO WE RE FAMILIAR WITH IT OH WE HAVE A LOT OF UM PEOPLE UPSET ABOUT IT AT THE BEGINNING SOME NOT ALL BUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING AT T I IS THAT THEY FOUND CERTAIN PARTS OF THE COMPANY THERE WAS A LOT OF DRUG ABUSE UM MAINLY THE AREAS WHE WHERE THEY WERE DOING A LOT OF UM MANUFACTURING TYPE THINGS AND WHAT THEY ENDED UP DOING IS UH KIND OF LIKE DOING A LITTLE BIT OF AN UNDERCOVER AGENT TO WATCH WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND WE HAD PEOPLE USING ON THE PREMISES AND ACTUALLY SELLING AND DEALING YOU KNOW ON THE PREMISES .
WELL OKAY THAT S THAT S A VERY DIFFERENT ISSUE .
WELL YEAH IT WAS YOU KNOW COMBINATION OF OF UH BOTH ACTIVITIES AND UH AND USING TOO SO THEY DEVELOPED THIS UH DRUG POLICY SO THAT UH TO ELIMINATE THERE S SOME PARTS OF THE COMPANY THAT WE DO UH GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND I THINK SOME OF THOSE REQUIRE THE DRUG TESTING BUT NOW T I THOUGHT WELL WE LL JUST DO IT FOR ALL EMPLOYEES THAT UM NOT JUST BECAUSE OF SAFETY ISSUES BUT BECAUSE WE WANT A TOTALLY DRUG FREE SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL PEOPLE TO WORK IN AND THAT WE SHOULD NT HAVE UM PEOPLE ON DRUGS WITHIN OUR YOU KNOW OFFICES AND SUCH .
AND .
I HAVE NT PERSONALLY EVER BEEN TESTED BUT I DO NT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT .
UM DOES THE TESTING COVER ALCOHOL AS WELL AS ILLEGAL DRUGS .
NO BUT ONE THING THAT TO TO ME WAS UM GOING ON STRETCHING IT A LITTLE TOO FAR WAS THAT THEY ALSO CHECK UM IF YOU ARE TAKING SOMEBODY ELSE S PRESCRIPTION DRUG YOU KNOW IT HAPPENS A LOT OF TIMES LIKE SOME MEMBER OF THE FAMILY GETS THE FLU OR WHATEVER AND YOU KNOW .
WELL .
THEN THEY GIVE IT TO EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE FAMILY AND DO NT ALWAYS GO BACK TO THE YOU KNOW DOCTOR AND GET ANOTHER PRESCRIPTION WELL ACCORDING TO WHAT THEY DO AT T I IF YOU TAKE A PRESCRIPTION DRUG IT HAS TO BE IN YOUR NAME IT YOU KNOW IT CA NT BE IN YOUR SPOUSE S NAME SO THEY WILL LOOK I MEAN THE TESTING WILL LOOK FOR I GUESS ANY KIND OF DRUGS AND YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM WHAT THEY ARE TAKING A PRESCRIPTION FOR .
SO THEY ASK YOU TO DECLARE BEFOREHAND WHAT PRESCRIPTION DRUGS YOU ARE TAKING .
RIGHT YES YES WHEN YOU GET TESTED YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO TELL THEM YOU KNOW EVERYTHING THAT THAT MIGHT BE THERE AND THEN IF THEY EVER UM QUESTION YOU OR SOMETHING YOU MAY HAVE TO SHOW PROOF THAT YOU DO HAVE A PRESCRIPTION IN YOUR NAME .
OKAY WELL IT I MEAN IT S I GUESS THAT IN FACT THEY DO NT TEST FOR FOR THEY DO NT ROUTINELY TEST FOR VERY MANY PRESCRIPTION DRUGS BUT THAT I BUT THEY DO NT SAY IN ADVANCE UH SO .
WELL WHAT THEY WO BE TESTING FOR ARE THE ONES THAT WOULD HAVE LIKE YOU KNOW BARBITURATES OR CODEINE THINGS LIKE THAT IN THEM .
THE ONES THAT WOULD KIND OF CONSTITUTE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES OR SOMETHING ANYWAY .
RIGHT RIGHT I GUESS THAT S WHAT I THEY WOULD NT BE LOOKING FOR PENICILLIN AND AN ANTIBIOTICS AND STUFF THEY WOULD BE LOOKING FOR THE YEAH CONTROLLED THINGS BARBITURATES AMPHETAMINES .
SO WHAT THEY ARE ASKING YOU TO TELL THEM IS ALL THE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS YOU ARE TAKING WHICH ARE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES .
RIGHT RIGHT YOU PRETTY MUCH YOU KNOW PUT DOWN WHAT YOU REMEMBER EVEN IF IT WAS JUST CONTACT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT AFTERWARDS UH MAYBE IF YOU HAD A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE .
IS CONTACT A .
WELL .
BO .
YOU YOU PROBABLY PUT DOWN YOU KNOW YOU HAD DRIXORAL OR CONTACT IF YOU WOULD REMEMBER THAT YOU DID IT .
OKAY IS CONTACT A .
NO .
MUMBLEX SUBSTANCE .
I M .
OKAY .
JUST SAYING YOU PROBABLY PRO PUT DOWN ON THE SHEET .
OKAY .
ANYTHING YOU HAVE TAKEN BUT IF THEY HAD A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE MAYBE THEY WOULD ASK YOU THEN TO SHOW THAT YOU HAD THAT PRESCRIPTION IN YOUR NAME I KNOW I HAD ONE CONTRACT EMPLOYEE THROUGH MANPOWER WAS NOT A T I PERSON .
UHHUH .
BUT WAS A CONTRACT PERSON AND THEY TEST THEM TOO EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT A REAL UH T I ER IF YOU ARE A CONTRACT EMPLOYEE HERE .
UHHUH .
THEY TEST YOU TOO AND HE HAD TAKEN SOME KIND OF UM OH YOU KNOW UH JUST HE HAD SOME KIND OF FLU OR SOMETHING HE GOT A REAL BAD MIGRAINE AND HE TOOK HIS MOTHER S .
DO YOU HAVE ANY CHILDREN .
YEAH I HAVE TWO TWO BOYS TWELVE AND SIXTEEN .

RIGHT .
WHAT UH DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE ANY TIME .
TO SPEND WITH THEM .
WELL .
THEY RE PROBABLY AT AN AGE WHERE THEY DO NT WANT TO SPEND ANY TIME WITH THEIR PARENTS .
THAT S TRUE .
YOU ACTUALLY OF COURSE SPEND LESS TIME WITH THEM WHEN THEY GET OLDER BUT IT S OF COURSE STILL REALLY IMPORTANT .
RIGHT .
I HAVE A KIND OF A FORTUNATE SITUATION I THINK RIGHT NOW WITH MY SIXTEEN YEAR OLD .

I M AWAY FROM MY OTHER SON THOSE HOURS TOO .

I THINK THAT I WOULD LIKE TO IF I YOU KNOW WE ALL SAY IF I COULD HAVE THE CAR I ALWAYS WANTED .
RIGHT .
I WOULD EITHER BUY A NISSAN MAXIMA UH I M SOLD ON NISSANS .

ITS RELIABILITY AND UH I YOU KNOW I VE READ ALL THE CONSUMER REPORTS AND THINGS AND THEY JUST RUN HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE THE AMERICAN MADE CARS IF FORD WAS A HEAD AND THE SHOULDERS ABOVE IT I D BUY A FORD .
IS NT THAT A SHAME .
BUT I HAD UH HAD A FORD ESCORT THAT ABSOLUTELY NEEDED TAPS THE DAY WE GOT IT .
MY WORD IS NT THAT SORRY THAT S SORRY .

AS FAR AS SALES .
UHHUH .
BUT IT S JUST IT JUST WAS NOT DELIV AND YOU GET STUNG A TIME OR TWO .

SO I JUST TRUSTED THE CONSUMER REPORTS AND THE AUTO .
UHHUH UHHUH .
UH REPORTS INST HAD MY SON WHO KNOWS A LOT ABOUT THAT STUDY THEM THOROUGHLY AND HE GAVE ME FOUR CHOICES OF CARS TO BUY .
UHHUH .
AN ESCORT DEFINITELY WAS NOT AMONG THEM IN FACT THERE WAS NT AN AMERICAN CAR IN THERE .
WOW .
UH THE NISSAN CAME AND AND WE BOUGHT THE NISSAN FOR FUNCTIONAL PURPOSES NOT WHAT THE CONSUMER REPORTS SAID WE SHOULD GET .
UHHUH .
BUT IT SERVED OUR NEEDS UH LATER ON HIS REPORTS THE REPORTS THAT HE STUDIED SHOWED THAT UH NISSAN WAS HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE THE REST IN THE AREA IN THE CLASS THAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR AND THAT AND I D RATHER HAVE A MAXIMA THAN A CADILLAC I REALLY WOULD IT S NOT NECESSARILY PRESTIGE .
UHHUH .
BUT IT S COMFORT UH THERE S A LOT OF FEATURES ON THERE THAT ARE DESIRABLE IF YOU RE GOING TO PAY THAT KIND OF MONEY FOR A CAR UH .
WHO MAKES THAT CAR .
NISSAN M .

THERE S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT ACTUALLY I THINK PROBABLY IF I WERE GOING TO GET A IF I WERE GOING TO BE PRACTICAL WHICH DOES NT MEAN I WOULD BE .

RIGHT AND IT S COOLER I BELIEVE .
AND .
TOO .
UHHUH .
WHEN YOU RE DRIVING IN .
UHHUH NOW THE INTERIOR OKAY I DO NT CARE ABOUT THE INTERIOR JUST AS LONG AS IT S NOT BLACK OR RED .
UHHUH UHHUH .
BUT IF I HAD THE LITTLE RED C R X .

UHHUH .
I LOVE CLASSICAL MUSIC AND YOU JUST CA NT ENJOY IT UNLESS YOU VE GOT A GOOD SOUND SYSTEM TO PRODUCE ALL THE .

THOSE ARE NICE ARE NT THEY .
SOMETHING THAT I WOULD REALLY LIKE .
YES THOSE ARE NICE .
THOSE COMPACT DISCS .
UHHUH .
REALLY ARE GOOD FOR CARS BECAUSE THEY DO NT MELT THEY DO NT WARP .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW THERE S NOTHING IN THERE THAT CAN WRAP AROUND THE THE UH ROLLERS OR ANYTHING IT SEEMS LIKE A REALLY GOOD ANSWER TO PORTABLE MUSIC .
HUH .
THAT YOU CAN CHOOSE .
OKAY .
ALL RIGHT .
WELL I AM UH THE PRODUCT OF UH I THINK AS MUCH THE CHANGING ROLES OF WOMEN AS ANYONE MY MOTHER UH WE COME FROM A MY MOTHER AND I WERE UH REALLY PRAC FIRST GENERATION DIVORCE IN OUR FAMILY .
YES .
MY UH MOTHER WAS DIVORCED IN NINETEEN UH FIFTYSEVEN .
UHHUH .
WHEN I WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD .
UHHUH .
AND WAS I WAS THE FIRST ONE OF ANYONE THAT THAT ANYONE HAD EVER KNOWN TO HAVE A DIVORCE .
UHHUH .
OF COURSE NOW FIFTY PERCENT DIVORCES IN THE UNITED STATES UH MY MOTHER UH WAS TREATED VERY BADLY UH IN A BY A LOT OF PEOPLE FAMILY MEMBERS UM ESPECIALLY FROM MY FATHER S SIDE OF THE FAMILY AND ALSO UH UH UH WE WERE UH .
UHHUH .
OSTRACIZED BY HIS FAMILY UH BASICALLY JUST YOU KNOW UH WE JUST KIND OF DROPPED OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH .
RIGHT .
AND THEY .
ALL FELT THAT TH THERE WAS NEVER AN ISSUE THAT MY FATHER WAS THE WAS THE CAUSE OF THE REASON FOR THE SPLIT UP EVEN THOUGH HE HAD IMPREGNATED ANOTHER WOMAN AND FORCED THE DIVORCE .
OH MERCY .
UH IT WAS ALWAYS MY MOTHER S FAULT SHE WAS NOT UH SUFFICIENT YOU KNOW SHE JUST WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH .
WHAT WAS WRONG WITH HER WAS SHE NOT ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH DID SHE NOT TAKE GOOD ENOUGH CARE OF HER MAN TO KEEP HIS INTEREST .
IT WAS THAT KIND OF AN ATTITUDE .
YEAH THAT THAT S TOO BAD .
SO UH YEAH IT WAS TOO BAD IT WAS REALLY ROUGH .
UM UM THAT S SAD .
IT REALLY IS .
UH SO YOU KNOW THAT S SO CHANGING SOME OF THE CHANGING ROLES OF WOMEN IN THAT RESPECT I HAVE BEEN A PRODUCT OF .
UHHUH .
UM I THINK THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE .
THAT I THINK THAT UH I WAS A I WAS FIRST GENERATION GOING TO COLLEGE IN MY FAMILY .
UHHUH .
UH FIRST MY MOTHER HAD ALWAYS HAD A QUOTE CAREER BUT ALWAYS A CAREER AS A UH UH IN A SECRETARIAL POSITION .
SHE DID RISE TO THE HIGHEST POSITION THAT A WOMAN COULD RISE TO IN A SECRETARIAL PRO PROFESSION IN DES MOINES IOWA .
THAT S THAT S WONDERFUL .
SHE WAS A SECRETARY TO UH UH THE JUD TO UH A CIRCUIT COURT JUDGE FEDERAL JUDGE .
UHHUH .
AND IT WAS A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT FOR HER AS WELL AS FOR HIM .
SO THAT WAS A REALLY HIGH HIGH STATUS POSITION .
WELL THAT S WONDERFUL .
SHE MADE OVER THIRTY THOUSAND .
THAT SPEAKS .
A YEAR .
WELL OF YOUR MOTHER .
WELL YEAH SHE .
A REAL HARD LA .
SHE HAD HIGH STANDARDS .
YEAH .
YEAH .
HARD DRIVING LADY WITH A STEEL ROD UP HER BACK YOU KNOW .
OH BLESS HER HEART .
BUT UH SO I WENT TO COLLEGE AND NOW SINCE HAVE COMPLETED TWO MASTERS DEGREES AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF MUSIC IN A CHURCH .
UM AND BUT IT S INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH I AM STILL EVERYDAY CONFRONTED WITH .
CHALLENGES .
ABSOLUTELY .
UHHUH .
CHALLENGES .
THAT HAVE TO DO WITH MY SEX .
RIGHT .
UH FOR INSTANCE UH WELL YOU KNOW I AM JUST NOT TAKEN AS SERIOUSLY YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
AT PROFESSIONS AS MANY OF THE WOM AS MANY OF THE MEN .
WHO ARE DOING THE SAME JOB .
I DO .
AND UH THE CHOIR MEMBERS TREAT ME DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE I AM A WOMAN THEY EXPECT ME TO BE MORE MOTHERLY THEY QUESTION MY AUTHORITY MORE UH THAN THEY EVER WOULD A MAN .
AND I HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH THIS BECAUSE I WORK AT BOTH BOTH AS A DIRECTOR OF MUSIC AND ALSO AS AN ASSOCIATE UNDER A MAN .
UH UHHUH .
SO I AM PRETTY I AM PRETTY OB PRETTY CONS I MEAN I AM PRETTY AWARE OF WHAT GOES ON .
SURELY .
UH IN THE CHURCH .
SO BASICALLY THAT S THAT S WELL I AM DONE TALKING .
DO YOU WANT TO TALK .
WELL I THINK THAT YOU CARRIED FORTH YOUR SUBJECT MATTER VERY WELL UH NICKIE .
AND I CAN UH RELATE TO THAT UH .
UHHUH .
UH I THINK IT S IT S THE IMAGE THAT THE WOMAN HAS AND UH IN THE WORLD .
UHHUH .
AS UH THE LESSER OF THE TWO .
OH ALWAYS .
AND UH I THINK THINGS ARE CHANGING BUT THE CHANGING IS TAKING A LONG TIME LONGER THAN WE WOULD LIKE IT TO .
UHHUH .
LIKE IT TO TAKE .
AND .
INDEED .
UH I THINK WE ARE PROGRESSING AT A SNAIL S PACE BUT WE ARE PROGRESSING .
UHHUH .
SO THAT S THE MAIN POINT IS THAT WE ARE GOING AHEAD .
UHHUH .
AND UH I THINK THAT UH IN THE LONG TERM THAT WOMEN ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE RECOGNITION THAT THEY DESERVE .
UHHUH .
AND UH MEN UH HAVE A LOT OF THEM HAVE UH COME AROUND AND HAVE SEEN .
UHHUH .
THE ERROR OF THEIR WAYS .
UHHUH .
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF DIEHARDS OUT THERE .
THAT WILL NEVER CHANGE .
UHHUH .
SO WE HAVE TO UH FACE THAT REALITY ALSO .
I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHY THEY CAN NOT EVER CHANGE WHY THEY CAN NOT BEND .
I MEAN WHY THEY CAN NOT JUST ACCEPT YOU KNOW COMPETENT WOMEN I I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT .
I GUESS IT .
S FEAR .
I MEAN WHAT .
IT COULD BE IF THEY ARE AF THEY ARE NOT SURE OF THEMSELVES .
SURE .
THE ONE S THAT UH GO ALONG WITH THAT THEY ARE SURE OF THEMSELVES .
UHHUH .
AND THEY KNOW THAT THEY CAN UH YOU KNOW UH BE ON THE SAME LEVEL .
UHHUH .
AND THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY UH EGO UH PROBLEMS THAT THEY ARE FIGHTING .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND UH I THINK THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE UH ON PAR WITH THEM .
UHHUH .
IN SALARY AND IN RECOGNITION .
UHHUH .
IN THE LONG TERM .
UHHUH .
UH AND I WHAT .
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN FUTURISTICALLY .
UHHUH .
IS WHAT .
WE ARE DISCUSSING .
UHHUH .
IS THAT YES UH WE .
EACH HAVE OUR UH JOBS IN LIFE .
UHHUH .
AND THAT WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT .
AND THAT WE SHOULD SUPPORT EACH OTHER .
UHHUH .
AND UH I THINK OUR PROBLEMS WOULD BE FEWER .
UHHUH .
IF WE SUPPORTED EACH OTHER .
UHHUH .
AND JUST LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AS EQUALS AND NONE LESSER BECAUSE WE ARE EQUAL .
MEN HAVE A LOT OF TROUBLE WITH THAT THOUGH .
UHHUH .
THEY IN THEIR IN THEIR OWN PEER RELATIONSHIPS THEY DO NOT TREAT THEMSELVES .
EQUAL AND SO IT S REALLY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO TREAT WOMEN AS EQUALS .
THEY ARE THEY ARE REALLY MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE WITH SOMEBODY BEING THE BOSS AND SOMEBODY BEING THE FOLLOWER .
UH IT JUST SEEMS THAT IT SEEMS IT SEEMS THAT THEY ARE MORE COMFORTABLE THAT WAY .
AND I DO NOT KNOW IF THAT S I MEAN THAT S IT S A MILITARISTIC POINT OF VIEW .
I GUESS YOU KNOW SOMEBODY CAN NOT BE COLONEL AND EVERYBODY ELSE IS INFANTRY BUT IT S JUST REALLY INTERESTING TO ME .
I AM MARRIED TO A WONDERFUL MAN .
UH .
YOU KNOW WHO TREATS ME VERY YOU KNOW WITH A WITH AS I THINK PROBABLY IS AS ENLIGHTENED AS ANYONE CAN BE AT THIS PARTICULAR STAGE IN THEIR LIFE TIME .
BUT WHEN HE GETS ANGRY IT S ALWAYS OVER CONTROL ISSUES IT S ALWAYS OVER POWER ISSUES IT S NEVER OVER YOU KNOW IT S ALWAYS YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO DO SOMETHING AND YOU DID NOT DO IT .
AS IF HE IS THE BOSS AND I AM THE YOU KNOW AND I AM THE SLAVE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND IT THOSE ARE THE ONLY ONLY ISSUES WE EVER FIGHT ABOUT .
I THINK IT S JUST I THINK IT S JUST DIFFICULT FOR MEN TO UH TO ACCEPT WOMEN EQUALLY EVEN IF THEY WANT TO THEY ARE MORE COMFORTABLE WHEN SOMEBODY IS THE BOSS .
UH DICTATOR DICTATORSHIPS ARE REAL EFFICIENT .
WELL I GUESS WE WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE WAY THAT THE LORD MADE US .
UM .
AND UH THE WOMEN WHEN THEY ARE MARRIED THEY ARE TO BE SUBJECTIVE TO THEIR HUSBANDS .
UM .
AND I BELIEVE THAT STRONGLY .
UM .
AND UH BUT I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE IN HARMONY WITH WHAT .
THEY ARE WITH WHAT .
THE SUBJECT MATTER IS .
UM .
AND I THINK THE ISSUE SHOULD BE SETTLED BEFORE THERE S A CONFLICT .
HUH .
UH AND I THINK THAT CAN HAPPEN IN A VERY WON WONDERFUL WAY .
HUH .
AND IF WE MEN AND WOMEN WOULD DO AS THE BIBLE SAID THAT WE WOULD ESTEEM EACH OTHER HIGHER THAN OURSELVES .
UHHUH .
CAN YOU PICTURE THAT .
UHHUH .
I MEAN IF YOUR HUSBAND DID THAT TO YOU .
UHHUH .
AND YOU DID THAT TO YOUR HUSBAND .
UHHUH .
YOU WOULD ALWAYS BE TRYING TO PLEASE EACH OTHER AND NOT YOURSELF .
YEAH IT S TRUE .
AND UH THAT S REALLY THE THE DIVINE ANSWER .
UHHUH .
AND AND THE RIGHT ANSWER .
UHHUH .
SO UH UH THAT WOULD BE A BEAUTIFUL RELATIONSHIP .
UHHUH IT WOULD BE .
AND I THINK THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE .
THAT HAVE DONE THAT .
UHHUH .
AND I HAVE SEEN IT .
UHHUH .
AND IT S IT S JUST MARVELOUS AND I AM JUST IN AWE TO SEE THIS .
OKAY NOW THEN YOU HEARD THE QUESTION WHAT .
UHHUH .
WHAT DO YOU LIKE TO DO FOR YOURSELF IN CAR AUTOMOBILE REPAIRS .
WELL I LL TELL YOU I USED TO DO A LOT MORE REPAIRS WHEN CARS WERE EASY TO WORK ON THAN I DO NOW .
OKAY .
I DO UH I DO THE EASY STUFF NOW .
I CHANGE OIL UH AND THEN WHAT SOME PEOPLE WOULD CONSIDER A LITTLE .
MORE DIFFICULT I I LL CHANGE SPARK PLUGS AND .
UM .
I LL CHANGE YOU KNOW POINTS AND YOU YOU KNOW DO AIR FILTERS THAT KIND OF STUFF .
WELL .
BUT UH I CA NT DO AS MUCH AS I USED TO UM I USED TO DO A WHOLE LOT MORE BUT NOT ANY MORE THEY RE JUST TOO WEIRD TO WORK ON NOW .
IS THAT THE REASON .
YOU RE NOT DOING IT OR ARE YOU SO BUSY YOU DO NT HAVE TIME TO DO IT .
WELL THAT S PART OF IT .
UH .
YEAH PART OF IT IS LIKE YOU SAID I DO NT HAVE TIME .
OKAY .
WELL BEING A FEMALE AND BEING ALONE YOU I DO NT DO ANYTHING BUT PUT GASOLINE .
IN MY CAR AND LET SOMEONE ELSE CHECK THE OIL EVEN .
UHHUH .
BUT UH HAVE YOU HAD ANY MAJOR REPAIRS RECENTLY .
WELL UM ON THIS CAR .

YEAH SOMETIMES IT MAKES YOU WONDER .
OH IT JUST WELL I HAVE A VERY COMFORTABLE CAR .
UHHUH .
AND I HAVE A HEALTH PROBLEM THAT I NEED A LARGE COMFORTABLE CAR .
UHHUH .

THIS FOR TWENTY AND PRETTY SOON YOU OWE A HUNDRED DOLLARS AND YOU DO NT STOP TO THINK ABOUT IT .
YEAH .
I GOT IN TROUBLE WHEN I WAS IN THE SERVICE QUITE A FEW YEARS AGO LIKE TEN TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TROUBLE .
OH MY GOODNESS .
AND THEN YOU KNOW SO I EVENTUALLY GOT IT .
ALL PAID .
NOW I CARRY ONE .
I HAVE A GAS CARD AND A VISA CARD .

BUT THEY .
D YEAH I I MADE A RULE WITH MYSELF WHEN I GOT ONE THAT IF I COULD NT PAY IT IN FULL EVERY MONTH THAT I D HAVE TO RIP IT UP SO .

SHE HAS HERS IS UP TO NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND SHE DO SHE ONLY EARNS LIKE TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS .
A MONTH BECAUSE SHE S GOING TO SCHOOL .
GEE .
AND AND SO I MEAN THAT S JUST ENOUGH TO PAY RENT AND BUY LIKE THIRTYFIVE DOLLARS WORTH OF FOOD .
A MONTH .
SO AND AND PAY FOR HER LIKE LIKE MONTHLY FEE LIKE TWEN YO I GUESS YOU HAVE TO PAY LIKE TWENTY DOLLARS .
EACH MONTH IS THE .

IT JUST SEEMS CRAZY TO TO ME BUT .
WELL MY WIFE GOT IN TROUBLE ONE TIME WITH HERS .
SHE WAS MAKING LIKE I DO NT KNOW WHAT .
SHE WAS MAKING FORTYFIVE DOLLARS .
A MONTH .
I THINK .

I MEAN YOU CAN ALWAYS FILE BANKRUPTCY TO GET OUT OF IT BUT THAT S A LOT OF PAIN AND HASSLE .
WHEN YOU KNOW IN THE OLDEN DAYS WHEN MY PARENTS WERE GROWING UP AND WE COULD NT AFFORD EVERYTHING WE DID NT HAVE SUCH THINGS AS CREDIT CARDS .
WE JUST WAITED UNTIL TIME COME AROUND THAT WE COULD AFFORD IT .
RIGHT .
AND YOU KNOW WE HAD ALL THE NECESSITIES SO .
AND I VERY SELDOM USE A CREDIT CARD ON NECESSITIES .
I ALWAYS USE IT FOR SOMETHING .
I WANT NOT SOMETHING .
I NEED .
EXACTLY .
SO .
YEAH MY PARENTS ARE REALLY GOOD ABOUT NOT USING CREDIT CARDS .
THEY ARE AGAINST IT .
YEAH .
I DO NT THINK THEY LIKE THE FACT THAT I HAVE ONE EITHER .
I THINK IF CARD CARDS WERE AS AS STRINGENT AS SAY A A HOME MORTGAGE LOAN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHERE YOU HAVE TO YOU KNOW BE ABLE TO PROVE THAT YOU CAN AFFORD THIS AND THE REST OF YOUR BILLS WE PROBABLY WOULD NT HAVE THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE .
UHHUH .

WHA .
THERE WE GO UH SO UH WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER THE MOST IMPORTANT BENEFIT BESIDES SALARY .
BOY I I DO NT KNOW THAT S A THAT S A A TOUGH ONE UH UH AND IT S UH I SUPPOSE IT S IT S CHANGES AS UH AS PERCEP MY PERCEPTION CHANGES OF OF WHAT UH I M GETTING GYPPED ON AND .
THAT WEEK RIGHT .
THIS WEEK OR THIS MONTH UH UH UH WE RE JUST UH GOING THROUGH UH UH WELL THERE S A COUPLE OF CHANGES TO THE TO THE UH OUR HEALTH PLAN AND UH AND I GUESS RIGHT NOW THE ONE IN MY MIND IS HEALTH INSURANCE BUT UH .
UM .
IF I STEP BACK I M NOT SURE I D I D UH SAY THAT WHAT WHAT ABOUT YOU .
WELL UH I RIGHT NOW I M IN SORT OF A WEIRD SITUATION I M A GRADUATE STUDENT THAT UH .
OH OKAY .
I DO NT HAVE THAT MANY BENEFITS PER SE .
YES OKAY .
UH SORT OF GET .
BUT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND ONE OF THESE DAYS YOU LL BE OUT LOOKING FOR A .
YEAH YEAH MY WIFE HAS A REAL JOB AND I CAN SEE FROM HER ANGLE UH UH I THINK HEALTH INSURANCE IS REAL REAL IMPORTANT .
YEAH .
I VE I VE I VE I VE DISCOVERED I MEAN EVEN IN MY CASE IT S SORT OF THEY RE REALLY UH A PAIN IN THE NECK ABOUT IT UP HERE BECAUSE THE UNIVERSITY MAKES ME BUY A SMALL THEY THEY HAVE A MANDATORY THEY HAVE WHAT THEY CALL THE MANDATORY PORTION OF THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE .
YEAH .
THEY OFFER INSURANCE TO EVERYONE BUT THEN THE BASICS THAT ARE MAJOR MEDICAL THEY THEY FORCE YOU TO BUY HERE NOW I M COVERED BY MY WIFE S ANYWAY BUT I STILL PAY THEM A HUNDRED DOLLARS A SEMESTER .
RIGHT OKAY .
FOR UH MANDATORY SO THAT S SORT OF ANNOYING THAT I M PAYING FOR SOMETHING I M NOT GETTING IN THAT CASE I D RATHER THAT THAT WENT TO SOMETHING ELSE .
AND AND YEAH AND THE BENEFITS YOU RE GETTING FOR THAT HUNDRED DOLLARS A SEMESTER UH YOU YOU NEVER USE BECAUSE YOU JUST USE YOUR WIFE S .
RIGHT I MEAN UH AND AND AND IT TURNS OUT THAT ACTUALLY UH THE BENEFITS THEY YOU KNOW THAT THAT HUNDRED DOLLARS SORT OF WOULD WOULD ENTITLE ME TO GO TO THE UNIVERSITY HEALTH SERVICES HERE YOU KNOW AND AND USE THEM AND IT TURNS OUT THAT I DO THINK THEY RE V THEY RE EXCELLENT PHYSICIANS THERE SO THROUGH MY WIFE S H M O WE VE REGISTERED FOR THEM AS OUR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS SO WE GO THERE ANYWAY SO THEY RE THEY RE SO IF THEY WERE TO BILL WHICH WHICH I BELIEVE THEY DO NT BUT IF THEY WERE TO BILL THE H M O FOR MY BUSINESS THEY COULD IN IN THEORY BE GETTING PAID TWICE FOR THE SAME THING BUT THEY RE NOT THANK GOD UH BUT ANYWAY UH OTHERWISE I WOULD IMAGINE UH GOOD VACATION IS IS IMPORTANT ALTHOUGH I DO NT KNOW IF THAT S REALLY A DECIDING FACTOR FOR MANY PEOPLE ON A JOB I DO NT YOU KNOW .
UH YEAH I IT UH THE THE THAT THAT S A A NEGATIVE ABOUT UH WHERE WHERE I AM IN THAT UH WELL I CAME OUT OF UH I WORKED FIVE YEARS CIVIL SERVICE AND THERE IT S UH IF I REMEMBER RIGHT YOU WELL THEY THEY ACCUMULATE IT AS HOURS PER WEEK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND OR HOURS PER PAY PERIOD OR SOMETHING BUT ANYWAY IT WORKS OUT AS I REMEMBER BASICALLY TO UH YOU START AT AT UH TWO AND A HALF WEEKS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND IT AT THREE YEARS UH IT GOES TO FOUR WEEKS I BELIEVE AND I I M COMING UP ON I VE BEEN AT T I NOW UH UH COMING UP ON FIFTEEN YEARS AND IT AND IT JUST UH THIS YEAR IS GOING TO GO TO FOUR WEEKS HERE SO .
OH WOW .
UH UH .
SO THAT S REALLY .
YEAH THAT S A THAT THAT IS A A A NEGATIVE BUT UH BUT NOT PROBABLY NOT AT PROBABLY NOT A DECIDING FACTOR BUT UH .
YEAH I MEAN I DO NT YOU KNOW I DO NT I KNOW MY WIFE UH I THINK SHE GETS YOU KNOW ABOUT TWO WEEKS A YEAR I GUESS .
YEAH .
BUT THEY RE PRETTY GOOD ABOUT IT IF SHE WANTS OTHER TIME OFF THEY YOU KNOW USUALLY LET HER .
WELL THAT THAT YEAH THAT S THAT S THE THING IS HOW HOW FLEXIBLE THEY ARE FOR COMP TIME KINDS OF .
YEAH .
KINDS OF THINGS AND UH UH THAT S THE THE THE UH YEAH THAT S A WHY IT HAS NT MADE ALL THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE IS BECAUSE THE WITH THE CIVIL SERVICE THAT YOU COULD TAKE YOU COULD TAKE YOUR VACATION IN INCREMENTS OF ONE HOUR .
OH REALLY .
AND UH AND BUT UH THERE WAS NT UH ANYTHING AS FAR AS COMP TIME SO YOU TEND TO DRIBBLE AWAY A WEEK OF IT A YEAR UH YOU KNOW AN HOUR HERE .
JUST YEAH .
A COUPLE HOURS THERE KIND OF A THING .
YEAH .
UH WHEREAS UH HERE I UH THINGS ARE FREE ENOUGH TO THAT UH THE THE ACTUAL VACATION TIME PER YEAR PROBABLY IS NT THAT IS NT THAT MUCH DIFFERENT BUT UH .
THAT S WELL THAT S A .
BUT UH .
THAT S REASONABLE I THINK .
YEAH I THINK THE I THINK THE HEALTH INSURANCE I THINK THAT S THAT S GOING THROUGH CHANGES EVERYWHERE TO UH THE THEY VE UH UH GONE THROUGH A COUPLE YEARS AGO HERE WHERE THEY UH WILL COVER YOU MUCH BETTER IF YOU GO TO THEIR DESIGNATED HOSPITALS AND NOW THEY RE IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A LIST OF OF UH DESIGNATED DOCTORS UH SO THAT JUST ROUTINE VISITS UH THEY WILL COMPENSATE MUCH BETTER FOR IF YOU GO TO THEIR DESIGNATED DOCTORS .
YEAH .
WHICH WHICH UH MY ASSUMPTION IS THAT THAT WILL NOT INCLUDE MY DOCTOR SINCE UH HE KEEPS REAL BUSY WITHOUT HAVING TO TO UH .
WEIGH ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS .
YEAH .
YEAH I THINK I WAS WATCHING SOMETHING THE OTHER DAY ABOUT THAT ACTUALLY ON UH A NEWS SPECIAL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND THEY WERE SAYING HOW IN SOME SENSE THAT THAT S GOOD BECAUSE THAT MAKES HEALTH CARE AFFORDABLE FOR EVERYONE AND MAKES YOU KNOW LOWERS THE COST OF EVERYTHING AND ALL INSURANCE AND IN OTHER CASES IT S ACTUALLY BAD BECAUSE IT WINDS UP PEOPLE YOU KNOW DO NT GET TO THEY HAVE MUCH LESS OF A CHOICE IN WHO THEY CAN USE AND STUFF LIKE THAT SO .
WELL AND AND I THINK IN THE IN THE IN THE MUCH BIGGER PICTURE THAN UH TO SOME EXTENT HOSPITALS AND DOCTORS HAVE SOME UH FIXED AMOUNT AND IF IF YOU DO NT WORK FOR SOMEBODY THAT S GOT ENOUGH CLOUT TO TO UH UH GIVE YOU YOU KNOW GIVE YOU THESE RATES AND MAKE THIS AGREEMENT .
UHHUH .
THEN UH YOU RE NOT COVERED BY THAT AND AND THE ADDED COSTS GET PASSED ON TO YOU SO .
RIGHT .
UH I M NOT I M NOT SURE IT MY UH ONE OF THE PHRASES I USE IS THAT THAT IT S MOVING TOWARDS UH PRIVATE SOCIALIZED MEDICINE THAT UH IN TERMS OF THE NEGATIVES OF OF ALWAYS HEARD IN TERMS OF SOCIALIZED MEDICINE YOU HAVE NO CHOICE ON WHO YOU WHO YOU GO TO FOR A DOCTOR AND THINGS LIKE THAT UH WHERE IT S THE GOVERNMENT THAT DECIDES HERE IT S IT S UH .
LEAST OFF WHO DECIDES .
YEAH UH AND BUT IT BUT IT S THE THE SAME THE EFFECT IS THE SAME AS THE YOU YOU UH GET LEFT OUT OF THE LOOP MORE I I I KNOW THAT THEIR UH IDEA IS THAT UH IF IF YOU HAVE TO PAY A BIGGER SHARE YOU LL YOU LL BE MORE CAREFUL ABOUT SPENDING THE SPENDING THE MONEY AND AND HELPING HOLD DOWN THE COSTS .
RIGHT .
BUT UH I I I DO NT KNOW IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF UH THE HEALTH CARE I UH FIND THAT THAT UH ALTHOUGH I VE I VE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO NEVER HAVE ANY BIG PROBLEMS BUT THAT THAT UH THE COST IS NOT A A BIG FACTOR I WANT TO I WANT TO KNOW IF THE DOCTOR S DOING THE RIGHT THING TO MAKE ME .
RIGHT .
GET BETTER .
YOU WANT TO KNOW THAT THAT THAT WHEN YOU PICK A DOCTOR YOU KNOW YOU YOU .
YEAH .
COULD PICK ONE WHO YOU COULD HAVE SOME SORT OF A .
YEAH AND .
FEELING ABOUT YEAH THAT THAT S THE .
WELL YOU KEEP UP WITH CURRENT EVENTS .
UM SOMEWHAT .
YEAH SOMEWHAT .

OH YEAH .
YEAH HE WAS PRETTY PRETTY MUCH A HE DID NT MIND HAVING PEOPLE BUMPED OFF FOR CERTAIN THINGS YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
BUT UH .
I SEE .
IT S ONE OF THE REASONS .
THE U S WAS NT SO YOU KNOW DID NT DO MORE THAN THEY DID AT THE TIME .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE THEY WERE NT ALL THAT EXCITED ABOUT HIM ALTHOUGH HE S PROBABLY BETTER THAN A LOT OF THEM BUT UH BUT THEN AGAIN WHO YOU KNOW THOSE PEOPLE ARE SO USED TO IT .
I GUESS IT S THE ONLY THING THAT WORKS .
YEAH SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE QUALITY OF NEWS COVERAGE IN AMERICA .
I THINK IT S PRETTY DARNED GOOD I THINK WE RE LUCKY TO HAVE AS GOOD A COVERAGE AS WE HAVE .
UHHUH .
I REALLY DO .
NOW I THEY SOMETIMES THEY JUMP ON IT AND AND AND GO A LITTLE TO THE EXTREME THE MEDIA DOES BUT UH BUT THAT S KIND OF UNDERSTANDABLE BECAUSE YOU KNOW OF COURSE IF YOU WATCH IT MORE MORE THAN ONCE A DAY I MEAN IT S THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND I LISTEN TO THE RADIO .
RIGHT RIGHT .
SO I YOU HEAR SO MUCH YOU GET A LITTLE TIRED OF IT BUT THEN AGAIN SO MANY PEOPLE YOU GOT TO UNDERSTAND ONLY CATCH IT ONCE A DAY MAYBE .
YEP .
BUT I THINK THE QUALITY OF OUR UH OUR NEWS IS JUST UH I DO NT BELIEVE IT COULD BE BETTER .
UHHUH .
I REALLY DO NT .
YEAH WELL YOU KNOW I THINK IT PROBABLY COULD BE IT ALWAYS COULD BE BETTER BUT I .
I DO NT THINK SO .
WOULD AGREE THAT IT S PRETTY GOOD .
I DO NT THINK OUR NEWS COULD BE BETTER .

I I MEAN I MEAN WHAT ELSE COULD THEY DO TO MAKE IT BETTER .
UM .
I DO NT SEE ANYTHING THAT THEY COULD DO .
YEAH WELL I THINK THAT UM I DO NT KNOW .
WELL YOU ALWAYS .
THE UM .
WANT TO THINK EVERYTHING CAN BE IMPROVED UPON .
RIGHT .
I UNDERSTAND WHAT .
YOU RE SAYING .
RIGHT I THINK THAT .
BUT BY TRIAL AND ERROR OVER THE YEARS I THINK THEY GOT IT ABOUT AS GOOD AS THEY RE GOING TO GET IT .
WELL THAT MAY BE SO YEAH .
UH .
I THINK THAT .
NOTHING IS PERFECT .
I M NOT ALWAYS SATISFIED WITH HOW DIG THEY DEEP INTO THE .
UHHUH .
HOW DEEP THEY DIG INTO THINGS AND SUCH .
WELL THAT S TRUE I UNDERSTAND WHAT .
YOU RE SAYING AND THEN AGAIN I UNDERSTAND WHY THEY CA NT DIG TOO MUCH DEEPER THAT S WHY WE HAVE C N N .
RIGHT .
C N N HAS THE TIME SINCE THAT S ALL .
THEY DO IS NEWS .
UHHUH .
TO DIG DEEPER .
RIGHT .
WELL I DID HEAR THE END OF THE PROMPT .
THIS TIME .
WAS THAT YOU THAT WE DID NT HEAR THE WHOLE PROMPT .
YES YES .
AND IT SAID THAT WHAT WHAT DO WE DO WE THINK THAT CRI CERTAIN CRIMES SHOULD FIT CERTAIN PUNISHMENTS AND UH I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT AFTER I GOT OFF THE PHONE THAT THAT I REALLY YOU KNOW WISH THAT THERE WAS SOME WAY TO UH SEND A MESSAGE TO PEOPLE YOU KNOW ABOUT UM CHILD ABUSE AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
THAT UH THOSE KIND OF CRIMES DESERVE SOME KIND OF SEVERE PUNISHMENT .
TOO OFTEN I FEEL THAT PEOPLE GET OFF UH .
WITHOUT .
YEAH I I AGREE WITH YOU ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY I M NOT SURE YOU KNOW I SOMETIMES HAVE A PROBLEM WITH SOME OF THE ESPECIALLY MORE FAMOUS PEOPLE .
WHO .
ALL OF A SUDDEN ARE CRAWLING OUT OF THE WOODWORK TO SAY THAT WHATEVER PROBLEMS THEY HAVE YOU KNOW WAS WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE ABUSED A ABUSED AS CHILDREN .
AND THE PARENTS ARE SAYING HEY WAIT A MINUTE WE DID NT DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND AND AND I GUESS BEFORE I D LIKE TO SEE THAT SEVERE OF A PUNISHMENT FOR IT .
IT HAS TO BE A AN ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW LIKE UH CAUGHT AT IT OR SOMETHING .
RIGHT RIGHT .
YOU KNOW OR IF THEY THEY UH YOU KNOW SEVERELY BEAT UP ON A CHILD OR YOU KNOW I WOULD HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM AT ALL .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW WITH WITH I DO NT BUY THE ROUTINE OH THEY RE JUST SICK OR THEY WERE ABUSED WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE .
UHHUH .
WELL YOU KNOW FORGET THAT .
YEAH WELL SOMETIMES THEY EVEN WONDER WHEN WHEN UH CRIMINALS PLEAD TEMPORARY INSANITY FOR FOR PUNISH FOR CRIMES .
THAT ARE SO SEVERE .
UHHUH .
AND THEN YOU KNOW THEY GET SENT TO A MENTAL INSTITUTION AND THEY PLAY LOONY FOR A WHILE AND THEN THEY RE BACK OUT IN PUBLIC .
WELL BUT I CA NT SEE THAT EITHER .
I DO NT FEEL THAT THAT SHOULD BE ANY EXCUSE AT ALL OR ANY DETERRENT AG UH YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
REASON TO NOT USE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT .
YEAH OH I AGREE I AGREE BECAUSE WE .
I THINK UH I THINK IF I WANTED TO BADLY ENOUGH I COULD CONVINCE SOMEBODY UH I WAS CRAZY .
SO MY FAMILY MAY SAY THAT ON OCCASION WHO KNOWS .
YOU KNOW UH I I DO NT THINK IT S THAT HARD TO DO .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW TO TO CONVINCE SOMEBODY THAT UH GEE YOU JUST HAD NO CONTROL OVER WHAT .
YOU WERE DOING .
YEAH YEAH WELL AND TOO YOU KNOW THEY CAN ALWAYS BE BLAMING THE OTHER PERSON WELL SHE LOOKED LIKE MY MOTHER .
WHO ABUSED ME WHEN I WAS A CHILD OR .
UHHUH .
SOMETHING WHICH .
I THINK IS UNFORTUNATE FOR THAT PERSON .
UHHUH .
AND YET SHOULD NT BE AN EXCUSE .
I GUESS YOU KNOW A LOT OF AND I WAS JUST SEEING IN THE NEWSPAPER OR THE GROCERY STORE THAT SOME MISS AMERICA WAS ABUSED BY THE MAN .
SHE LOVED AND .
THAT S THE NEW ONE .
IS THAT THE NEW I JUST HAPPENED TO SEE THE HEADLINE ON IT AND I DID NT COULD NT REALIZE IF IT WAS THE HUSBAND OR THE FATHER OR WHAT BUT I THOUGHT UH YOU KNOW IF THESE THINGS IF CHILDREN ARE BEING ABUSED I I M WONDERING HOW OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM IS FAILING THAT THEY RE NOT EVEN SEEING THIS YOU KNOW IF IT WAS THAT SEVERE THAT WHEN THEY RE LATER IN LIFE ADULTS THAT IT S ALL OF A SUDDEN AFFECTING THEM IN THIS WAY THAT IT .
WAS NT SHOWN UP AT ALL WHEN THEY WERE YOUNGER AND THAT KIND OF THAT KIND OF WORRIES ME WITH MY KIDS ONLY BEING UNDER TWO AND NOT HAVING YOU KNOW TO TO DEAL WITH THAT YET BUT STILL .
WELL YOU YOU RE RIGHT UH AND YET I MEAN DID YOU EVER IN YOUR LIFE WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE KNOW ANYBODY OR HEAR ANYTHING OF ANYTHING LIKE THIS .
NEVER .
NO .

CLAIM .
YEAH .
IT UH IT IT IT S YOU JUST DO NT KNOW AND IT .
ALL UNLESS THEY RE CAUGHT IN THE ACT OR THE THE THE CHILD IS VERY BADLY YOU KNOW BEATEN UP IT COMES DOWN TO A ONE WORD AGAINST THE OTHER .
UHHUH UHHUH .
THAT TYPE THING .
NOW TEXAS IS CAPITAL PUNISHMENT FOR IT USED TO BE JUST CAPITAL MURDER AND NOW THE THEY ADDED MASS MURDER .
ARE THOSE .
THE ONLY TWO THINGS THAT WE UH .
I REALLY WOULD HAVE NO IDEA .

UH YOU KNOW BECAUSE I HAVE A FEELING .
IT IS AND I I THINK THERE OUGHT TO BE MORE THINGS ADDED TO IT .
UHHUH .

THAT WOULD BE PRETTY LENIENT IN MY OPINION .
YEAH I I THINK THAT S I YOU KNOW UH KILLING A CHILD OR KIDNAPPING UH AND POSSIBLY NOT WELL I GUESS KIDNAPPING MAYBE IF THE PERSON GETS VERY BADLY HURT YOU KNOW IF THEY RELEASE THEM .
TWO HOURS LATER HE PROBABLY DOES NT DESERVE THE DEATH PENALTY .

I ALWAYS HAVE OR LETTER WRITING OR I MAY BE WORKING AROUND IN THE ROOM SOMEHOW BUT I DO NT I DO NT EVER JUST SIT AND I THAT S SOMETHING .
THAT COMES FROM YOUR OLD AGE YOU KNOW .
NO I DO NT SIT .
IDLE HANDS ARE THE DEVIL S WORKSHOP .
I KNOW .
WHO HAS TIME .
I DO NT HAVE TIME TO SIT I KNOW .

THAT S WHY I DO NT GET TO WATCH THAT MUCH .

RIGHT .
OR LIKE AT SIX THIRTY .
I LL WATCH WHEEL OF FORTUNE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
RIGHT WELL OUR YEAH IF OUR GRA IF OUR GRANDCHILDREN ARE WITH US THAT S THEY HAVE TO WATCH THAT .
WE DO NT WATCH IT UNLESS THEY RE HERE .
UHHUH .
NO I LIKE THAT .

BUT THEY UH .
GAME SHOW KIND OF STUFF BUT .
IT S IT S UM OH AND YOU KNOW THE THE KIDS WILL GET YOU STARTED ON STUFF LIKE AMERICA S FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS .
YEAH .
WE VE WOUND UP SENDING IN ONE .
THAT S SOMETHING .
I DID NT THINK THAT WE D EVER DO .
DID YOU SEND ONE .
YEAH .
MY OLDEST GRANDSON PULLING HIS TOOTH .
HE S HE S .
HOW FUNNY .
HE WOULD NT LET US PULL IT AND I MEAN IT IT GOT TO THE POINT .
HE WAS EATING A PEAR HERE AND HE BIT INTO IT AND IT WAS JUST HANGING BY A THREAD .
AND I AND I D TELL HIM YOU KNOW IT S GETTING READY TO FALL OUT AND HE WALKED AROUND THE HOUSE WITH HIS FA FACE DOWN TOWARD THE FLOOR AND HIS MOUTH OPEN HOPING IT WOULD FALL OUT BECAUSE HE WOULD NT LET ANYBODY PULL IT .
AND HE .
WOU HE WOUND UP PULL .
OKAY WOULD YOU UH LIKE TO BEGIN OR WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO START .
UH OH I CAN START .
OKAY .
I I THINK ONE OF THE THE BIGGEST UH IMPROVEMENTS IN WOMEN IS THAT FINALLY YOU RE STARTING TO SEE THEM GET INTO UH MANAGEMENT .
YES .
AND YOU RE SEEING THEM UH GET UH ELECTED TO UH POLITICAL OFFICES .
UHHUH .
UH NOT NEAR ENOUGH I KNOW THERE S STILL A LONG WAY TO GO ESPECIALLY IN TOP MANAGEMENT .
YES I AGREE .
YOU RE NOT SEEING YOU KNOW LOOKING AT T I YOU SEE THEM IN MANAGEMENT BUT YOU RE NOT SEEING THEM UP THERE AS V P S .
RIGHT .
AND I HAVE A SISTER THAT S AN ATTORNEY IN OKLAHOMA CITY AND I KNOW THE COMPANY THAT SHE WAS WITH UH THE WOMEN DID NT H HAVE NEAR THE POSITIONS THE LEVELS THAT THE MEN ATTORNEYS HAD .
RIGHT .
AND WERE NOT UH GIVEN THE SAME RESPECT .
I AGREE WITH THAT I I THINK YOU DO SEE MORE AND MORE WOMEN OUT THERE IN POLITICS TOO AS MAYORS .
YES .
OR UH YOU KNOW IN IN HELPING TO MAYBE UH GET SOME LEGISLATION PASSED TO TO HAVE WOMEN HAVE MORE RIGHTS I THINK STILL EVEN WITH THAT WHOLE UM THING WITH JUDGE THOMAS AND AND UH YOU YOU STILL FELT LIKE THE WOMAN WAS THE ONE THAT YOU WOULD MAYBE DISCREDIT FIRST BEFORE THE MAN OR SOMETHING THE WAY THEY HAD THE TRIAL AND .
UHHUH UHHUH .
UH I JUST THINK THAT IT S IT S STILL GOING TO TAKE ANOTHER GENERATION OR SO BEFORE BEFORE THE WOMEN REALLY COULD REALLY FEEL THAT THEY RE REALLY EQUAL IN THE BUSINESS WORLD AND THAT THEY WORK JUST AS HARD OR HARDER .
RIGHT RIGHT .
UH BUT IT S STILL UH GOING FROM FROM HOMEMAKERS INTO UH CORPORATE LEADERS IS STILL A BIG STEP .
RIGHT I ALSO THINK THAT UH UH WOMEN AS HOMEMAKERS ARE BEGINNING TO GET MORE RESPECT THAN THEY USED TO BE USED TO BE PEOPLE WOULD SAY DO YOU WORK AND YOU D SAY NO I WORK IN THE HOME AND .
RIGHT .
IT WAS IT WAS THEN IT WAS ALMOST LIKE A PUT DOWN PARTICULARLY PARTICULARLY EVEN BY WOMEN IN THE WORK FORCE BUT I THINK NOW I THINK PEOPLE ARE REALIZING THAT THE ROLES WOMEN PLAY IN THE HOME ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT .
YES .
AND IT S GETTING THE RESPECT AND WHICH IS ABOUT TIME .
I THINK IT S TRUE I THINK ALSO PEOPLE ARE HAVING CHILDREN AT A OLDER AGE .
YES VERY DEFINITELY .
SO IT S MAYBE LIKE UH YOU KNOW YOU GO THROUGH COLLEGE AND THEN YOU MAYBE WORK FOR A FEW YEARS AND THEN YOU HAVE YOUR FIRST CHILD AND UH YOU KNOW YOU YOU KNOW BOTH SIDES OF THE COIN .
THAT S RIGHT .
YOU KNOW WHAT IT S LIKE AND HOW MUCH WORK IT TAKES TO KEEP THE HOUSE RUNNING SMOOTHLY AND TO TAKE CARE OF THE KIDS AND AND THEN UH MAYBE PEOPLE THAT ARE JUST WORKING AND THINK OH YOU JUST STAY AT HOME BUT THEN WHEN THEY RE IN THEIR THIRTIES AND HAVE THEIR FIRST AND SECOND KID IT S LIKE THEY LOSE IT .
RIGHT .
THEY SAY WOW THIS IS HARDER THAN I THOUGHT .
YES .
WELL YOU KNOW .
AND AND TO THOSE THAT HAVE NEVER WORKED AND HAD YOU KNOW AND HAVE STAYED HOME WITH THE KIDS KIND OF DOES YOUR HEART GOOD .
I KNOW IT I KNOW .
BECAUSE I KNOW I STAYED HOME WITH MINE AND DID NT START WORKING UNTIL MINE WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
AND UH SO YOU KNOW IT IT KIND OF DOES ME GOOD I THINK ALSO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT S REALLY TREMENDOUS AND IT DOES NT NECESSARILY HAVE TO DO WITH WOMEN BUT THE FACT THAT THE FATHERS ARE .
ARE SO INVOLVED .
SO INVOLVED WITH FAMILIES .
YES .
WHICH AGAIN I THINK IT HELPS A WOMAN S ROLE .
RIGHT RIGHT .
YOU KNOW .
THEIR ROLE HAS TO CHANGE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
TO KIND OF ACCOMMODATE US TOO I KNOW I HAVE THREE CHILDREN AND MY OLDEST IS ELEVEN AND I VE PRETTY MUCH BEEN HOME UH SINCE BRIAN WAS BORN AND UH JUST RECENTLY I WENT BACK TO WORK UH LAST SCHOOL SEMESTER TO TUTOR UH HIGH SCHOOL AGE STUDENTS WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES AND I WAS JUST OUT OF THE HOUSE TWO DAYS A WEEK .
UHHUH .
BUT I THOUGHT WOW THIS IS REALLY HARD ONLY AND IT WAS ONLY TWO DAYS AND I WAS HOME BEFORE THREE .
BUT GETTING THE BABY TO DAY CARE GETTING THE KIDS OFF TO SCHOOL I STILL DID EVERYTHING I ALWAYS DO YOU KNOW MY HUSBAND STILL GOT UP AND WENT TO WORK .
UHHUH .
BUT UH IT IT ONLY THOSE TWO IT MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE I THOUGHT WOW FULL TIME I DO NT THINK I COULD SWING THAT PERSONALLY .
WELL I HAD TO COURSE I WORK FULL TIME BUT MY DAUGHTER AND HER HUSBAND WERE OUT OF TOWN SO I HAD MY GRANDCHILDREN FOR .
OH .
FOUR DAYS DURING UH FOOTBALL SOCCER SEASON .
OH BOY .
AND SO I WOULD WORK AND HER SOME FRIENDS WOULD TAKE CARE OF THE KIDS BUT I WOULD HAVE TO GET THEM PICKED UP FROM THERE .
PICK UP .
GET THEM FED GET THEM TO PRACTICES .
DINNER .
GET HOMEWORK DONE GET BATHS .
RIGHT .
I WAS ABSOLUTELY EXHAUSTED .
I BET I BET .
AND AND THESE WOMEN THAT ARE WAITING UNTIL THEY RE IN THEIR LATE THIRTIES OR EARLY FORTIES TO HAVE THEIR FIRST CHILDREN I THINK ARE ABSOLUTELY CRAZY .
WELL I I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE I KNOW I HAD MY FIRST CHILD WHEN I WAS TWENTYFIVE AND THAT S NOT CONSIDERED REALLY YOUNG THESE DAYS THAT S ALMOST YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
BUT UH I HAVE FRIENDS THAT THAT HAVE KIDS JUST STARTING KINDERGARTEN AND THEY RE THEY RE FORTY YEARS OLD AND AND THEN LIKE MAYBE A TWO YEAR OLD AT HOME AND I THINK BOY I I M I M IN MY THIRT .
OKAY .
YES .
WELL THIS IS A VERY TIMELY TOPIC INASMUCH AS WE RE GOING TO A FAMILY REUNION .

FIRST TIME I I MARRIED INTO THE FAMILY AND THE FIRST TIME .
I WENT WAS ABOUT FIFTYSEVEN I THINK .
UHHUH .
BUT UH THIS .
ONE HAS BEEN WELL ORGANIZED AND IN FACT .
IT USED TO BE AT LAKE BROWNWOOD AND NOW IT .
S LAKE TEXOMA BECAUSE THAT S MORE CENTRAL LOCATION .
UHHUH .
FOR PEOPLE FROM OKLAHOMA AND TEXAS TO COME TO .
I M SURE LOCATION S REALLY IMPORTANT AS FAR AS FIGURING OUT WHERE ONE OUGHT TO BE .
VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE UH YOU LL START LOSING PEOPLE IF IT S TOO FAR TO GO .
UHHUH .
WE HAVE FACTIONS WHEN IT .
S ONE PART WE I HAVE ONE REUNION ON MY MOTHER S SIDE AND WE FOUND THAT IF IT S IN A CERTAIN PART OF TEXAS SOME PEOPLE COME AND IF IT S ELSEWHERE OTHER PEOPLE COME .

RIGHT .
WELL LISTEN THEY VE UH THEY VE HAD THIS ONE WELL IT JUST OF COURSE OVER THE YEARS .
IT HAS UH BUILT UP AS FAR AS THE ORGANIZATION IS CONCERNED .
UHHUH .
BUT NOW THEY UH HAVE A GOLF TOURNAMENT ON THE SATURDAY .

THEY BRING IN LIKE KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN FROM DURANT AND UH .
UHHUH .

OUR FAMILY IS DWINDLING FOR ONE THING .
OH .

I THINK THINK THEY RE REALLY FUN .
WE GO TO MINE REGULARLY AND THEN WE GO TO MY HUSBAND S OCCASIONALLY DOWN IN TEMPLE AND HE HAS A LARGE FAMILY SO IT S IT S FUN WHEN WE GO TO THAT ONE .
YEAH MY SIDE OF THE FAMILY IS FROM BACK IN OHIO AND WEST VIRGINIA AND I THINK WE VE BEEN TO ONE IN THIRTYFIVE YEARS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO .

IT IN AS A VACATION TIME .
YEAH .
AS WELL AS REUNION .
YEAH WE HAVE EACH YEAR OF COURSE THEY ELECT OFFICERS OF THE FAMILY REUNION .
UHHUH .
AND A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO BACK IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES MY WIFE WAS PRESIDENT .
WE DISCOVERED HOW MUCH WORK .
IT IS JUST TO ORGANIZE AND GET IT TOGETHER .
UHHUH .
AND IT TAKES A LOT OF PLANNING .
AND CHOOSE .
AND ASSEMBLING OF STUFF .
SOME PLACE THAT EVERYBODY S GOING TO LIKE .
RIGHT .
AS FAR AS FOOD AND ALL THAT .
THAT S CORRECT .
THAT S A HEAVY BURDEN .
YES IT IS I TELL YOU .

THANK YOU FOR CALLING .
YES THANK YOU FOR PARTICIPATING .
ALL RIGHT .
THANK YOU .
BYE .
BYEBYE .
UH DO YOU WANT TO GIVE A START ON IT .
WELL I THINK FOR ME I I M FROM ALABAMA .
UHHUH .
SOUTH ALABAMA AND SO I GREW UP IN THE MIDST OF CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT .
UHHUH .
UH IN A PRETTY LIBERAL FAMILY FOR FOR THAT AREA AT THE TIME .
UHHUH .
AND SO I WAS VERY MUCH A PART OF ALL THE UH YOU KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON THERE .
UHUH .
UH MY PARENTS ARE PRETTY ACTIVE AND UH IT WAS VERY SCARY AND BUT NOW WE VE SEEN YOU KNOW UH BLACK PEOPLE HAVE A LOT MORE CIVIL RIGHTS IN THAT AREA AND I GUESS ALL OVER THAN THEY DID YOU KNOW TWENTY YEARS AGO .
OH DEFINITELY .
THERE S STILL A LOT TO BE YOU KNOW TO BE ACCOMPLISHED BUT .
UHHUH .
FOR ME WHEN I THINK ABOUT SOCIAL CHANGE THAT S WHAT I FIRST THINK OF BECAUSE I CAN REMEMBER YOU KNOW SEPARATE PUBLIC RESTROOMS AND SEPARATE WATER FOUNTAINS AND .
UHHUH .
SITTING IN THE BACK OF THE BUS AND EVERYTHING .
YOU CAN RELATE TO THAT NOW SEE WE DID NT WE DO NT HAVE ANY OF THAT BECAUSE WELL LIKE WE LIVE IN THE COUNTRY .
UHHUH .
IN CLARION COUNTY AND UH WE REALLY DID NT HAVE THINGS LIKE THAT GOING ON .
UHHUH .
THAT WE YOU KNOW UH RAN INTO SO WE KIND OF UH I GUESS WHEN I THINK OF SOCIAL CHANGES I THINK THINK MORE OF UH UH VISITING HABITS OF FAMILIES .
YEAH .
AND SUCH .
WELL THAT S TRUE .
UH .
THAT S A GOOD ONE RIGHT THERE .
YEAH THAT THERE S LESS VISITING DONE I THINK ON A WHOLE THAN THERE USED TO BE USED TO BE THAT YOU TOOK THE FAMILY WHETHER THE KIDS WANTED TO GO OR NOT YOU WENT VISITING AND UH TODAY YOU KNOW PEOPLE THEY DO VISIT BUT IT S NOT QUITE THE SAME AS UH WHAT IT WAS SAY TWENTY YEARS AGO THIRTY YEARS AGO .
RIGHT AND I GREW UP IN OUT IN THE COUNTRY TOO BASICALLY IN A RURAL AREA .
UHHUH .
AND WITH LOTS OF FAMILY .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND SO WE WERE ALWAYS AT FAMILY IN DIFFERENT P .
RIGHT .
FAMILY MEMBERS HOMES .
UHHUH .
BUT EVEN NOW YOU KNOW THEY DO NT EVEN DO THAT .
WELL THEY RE SO SPREAD OUT I THINK HAS A LOT TO DO WITH IT .
WELL AND THEY RE SO BUSY .
UHHUH UHHUH .
PEOPLE PEOPLE S PERSONAL SCHEDULES ARE SO BUSY .
UHHUH UHHUH .
MAINLY BECAUSE I A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO I THINK WITH MORE WOMEN WORKING .
RIGHT RIGHT .
IN OUR FAMILY YOU KNOW TWENTY YEARS AGO NOT THAT MANY OF THE WOMEN WORKED .
THAT S RIGHT YEAH .
AND NOW UH ALMOST ALL THE WOMEN WORK .
THE MAJORITY YEAH .
AND SO THAT MEANS YOU KNOW A LOT OF A LOT OF THE SOCIAL VISITING AND ALL WAS I THINK PROBABLY INSTIGATED BY WOMEN .
PROBABLY BECAUSE WHEN YOU WORK .
AT THAT TIME .
YOU .
RIGHT AND NOW .
DO NT REALLY CARE TO GO OUT AND VISIT AS MUCH .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND UH .
AND NOW UH I MEAN MY MOTHER DOES NOT WORK AND AND SHE YOU KNOW SHE S F FINDS HERSELF PRETTY ALONE A LOT .
UHHUH UHHUH .
BECAUSE MOST OF HER FRIENDS ARE WORKING WOMEN .
UHHUH .
BUT EVEN JUST SOCIAL VISITS PEOPLE DO NT DO THAT ANYMORE YOU RE RIGHT .
NO HUHUH THEY DO NT DO AS MUCH .
AND PEOPLE DO NT FEEL COMFORTABLE JUST TO DROP IN ON PEOPLE .
UHHUH .
ANYMORE THERE S A REAL .
YOU HAVE TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS OR HAVE .
RIGHT YOU KNOW YOU DO NT WANT TO .
AN INVITATION OR .
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE IT S OKAY OR .
YEAH YEAH .
I GUESS WE DO NT NOT TO MAKE INVADE PEOPLE S PRIVACY OR WHATEVER .
WELL THAT COULD BE PART OF IT I DO NT KNOW FOR SURE WHAT IT IS I KNOW OUR CHILDREN MOSTLY ARE SCATTERED OUT AT A DISTANCE SO WE REALLY DO NT HAVE THAT EVEN WE DO NT .
WELL OUT OF OUT OF FIFTEEN GRANDCHILDREN IN MY FAMILY ONLY TWO OF US DO NT LIVE WITHIN FIFTY MILES .
OH REALLY .
AND TH AND MOST LIVE WITHIN TEN .
OH THAT S PRETTY GOOD .
OR OR TWENTY SO BUT THAT S YOU KNOW THAT IS RURAL IT S A RURAL FAMILY AND .
UHHUH UHHUH .
MOST PEOPLE DID NT GO AWAY I M JUST ONE OF THE TWO .
UHHUH .
OUT OF FIFTEEN .
UHHUH .
THAT DO NT LIVE IN THE YOU KNOW EVEN IN THE SAME STATE .
WELL APPARENTLY THERE MUST BE WORK AVAILABLE FOR THOSE .
YEAH .
THAT ARE .
THERE IS IN THAT AREA .
UHHUH BECAUSE AROUND HERE THERE S REALLY NOTHING FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE NO GOOD I MEAN THERE S JOBS THERE S MINIMUM WAGE JOBS BUT UH TO MAKE A GOOD LIVING THERE REALLY AROUND HERE THERE JUST IS NT TOO MUCH .
UHHUH AND I GUESS YOU KNOW THAT WOULD GREATLY AFFECT SOCIAL CH I E SOCIAL CHANGE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
PROBABLY THE JOB MARKET HAS ALWA AND THE THE ECONOMY .
UHHUH .
HAS ALWAYS AFFECTED UH SOCIAL CHANGE .
UHHUH .
PROBABLY .
SO WELL THERE S THE MAIN THINGS I CAN THINK OF I REALLY TRIED TO THINK OF SOME OTHER THINGS AND I COULD NT REALLY .
WELL I THINK JUST ALSO YOU KNOW THE WOMEN S MOVEMENT TOO HAS AFFECTED A LOT OF SOCIAL CHANGE .
YEAH DEFINITELY .
UH PEOPLE .
SOME GOOD .
MARRY .
AND SOME BAD .
YEAH PEOPLE MARRY LATER .
UHHUH .
I MEAN BASICALLY I THINK NOW AGAIN WHERE I M FROM IN IN ALABAMA THAT S NOT NECESSARILY TRUE .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE PEOPLE DO STILL GET MARRIED RIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL .
UHHUH UHHUH .
BUT NOW OUT HERE IN TEXAS WHERE I AM NOW THAT S VERY UNUSUAL .
THEY D RATHER GET THEIR LIFE STARTED FIRST BEFORE .
MOST PEOPLE GET MARRIE I MEAN GET GO TO COLLEGE OR AT LEAST GET A JOB AND EVEN YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE SEEM TO A LOT OF PEOPLE SEEM TO BE ENGAGED FOR A LONG TIME BEFORE THEY GET MARRIED .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE THEY DO WANT TO BE FINANCIALLY SET UP .
YEAH WELL EVEN TO GET SCHOOL FINISHED I THINK A LOT OF TIMES IT S BETTER IF THEY DO FINISH THEIR SCHOOLING BEFORE THEY SETTLE IN BECAUSE A MARRIAGE TAKES A LOT OF EFFORT AND CONCENTRATION AND IF YOU RE BUSY WITH SCHOOL IT S I THINK IT S REALLY DIFFICULT FOR A FAMILY .
RIGHT BUT PROBABLY UH YOU KNOW MORE WOMEN BEING IN IN THE WORK FORCE ALSO GREATLY GREATLY AFFECTS SOCIAL CHANGE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
BECAUSE IT AFFECTS CHILD CARE AND .
RIGHT RIGHT .
UH .
YEAH I KNOW MY MY DAUGHTER THAT LIVES IN PITTSBURGH SHE HAS TWO LITTLE BOYS AND THEY THEY VE BEEN IN DAY CARE SINCE YOU KNOW ONE S FOUR AND ONE S ONE .
RIGHT .
AND THEY VE DONE WELL NOW I WOULD NT WANT TO DO IT THAT WAY BUT UH SHE S QUITE HAPPY AND THE CHILDREN SEEM QUITE ADJUSTED .
WELL AND THEY RE YOU KNOW THEY RE THEY RE SAYING RIGHT NOW WE DO NT KNOW WHAT WE JUST NOW ARE SEEING THE EFFECTS OF DAY CARE ON .
UHHUH .
THE GENERATION THAT S JUST NOW COMING INTO .
THAT S RIGHT YEAH .
THE WORK FORCE AND IN THEIR TWENTIES .
YES UHHUH .
THEY ARE THE FIRST GENERATION THAT BASICALLY GREW UP WITH DAY CARE .
THAT S RIGHT YEAH .
AND SO YOU KNOW IT REMAINED TO BE SEEN EXACTLY WHAT THAT WHAT THAT DOES .
UHHUH NOW I M GOING TO BABYSIT MY GRANDDAUGHTER SHE S JUST EIGHT WEEKS OLD SO THIS WILL BE NEW FOR ME .
UHHUH .

UHHUH .
PART OF THE HIRING PROCEDURE IS A A BLOOD TEST .

MUMBLEX I THINK THE BIG PROBLEM THOUGH IS IS THEY SEND THESE OFF TO LARGE LABS .
UHHUH RIGHT .
AND THEN THEY HAVE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF SAMPLES .
THAT UH GOING THROUGH IT IN A DAY AND BOTTLES GET MIXED UP THINGS LIKE THAT .
SO YOUR BIG BEEF WITH IT IS THE UH .
IT .
S MUMBLEX .
IS IS IT S A GOOD IDEA BUT LIKE YOU SAID THE DRUG TESTING PROCEDURES NEED TO BE DEFINED A LITTLE BETTER .
YEAH .
MAKE SURE .
IT S A LOT SAFER BECAUSE A COUPLE OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST UNFAIRLY OR WHATEVER .
YEAH I .
YEAH .
I I TEND TO AGREE WITH YOU .
DAVID .

EACH EACH PAYDAY TO .
UHHUH .

UHHUH .
UH NOT PORTFOLIO JUST YOU KNOW AGAINST WALMART STOCK .
BUT UH YOU CAN BUILD A PRETTY FAIR AMOUNT OF STOCK AFTER A WHILE .
YEAH THAT S WHAT .
MY BROTHER WAS TELLING ME .

WELL UH HOW LONG WERE WE S I HAVE NT DONE THIS IN A COUPLE MONTHS .
HOW LONG WERE WE SUPPOSED TO DISCUSS FOR .
UH YOU RE SUPPOSED TO GET FIVE MINUTES .
OKAY WE GOT A COUPLE MORE MINUTES THEN I GUESS .
UH THINK WHAT ELSE I CAN SAY ABOUT THAT .
UH .
UH DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA UH LET S SEE YOU WERE YOU WERE TESTED FOR DRUGS AS YOU GOT INTO T AS AS YOU GOT INTO T I .
RIGHT UH EVERYONE COMING IN GETS GOES THROUGH THE DRUG TEST .
YEAH .
UH NOW UH WERE YOU ASKED TO WAIT BEFORE STARTING TO WORK UNTIL THE DRUG TEST CAME THROUGH OR .
UH NO WELL LET ME THINK ABOUT THAT .
YEAH IT WAS AFTER I W I HAD ALREADY BEEN HIRED .
UH .
OKAY .
YEAH YOU GET HIRED THEN YOU COME IN THE FIRST I SEEMS TO ME .
I REMEMBER THAT UH I WAS HIRED CAME IN AND WENT THROUGH SOME ORIENTATION AND I THOUGHT I BOY I CA NT REMEMBER .
THAT WOULD SEEM STRANGE TO ALREADY BE WORKING HERE IN THE FIRST WEEK OF THE DRUG TEST .
MAYBE IT WAS DURING THE INTERVIEW .
I CAME UP A COUPLE TIMES FOR AN INTERVIEW SO IT S HARD FOR ME TO REMEMBER WHERE I WAS WHEN ALL THAT HAPPENED .
BUT UH I GUESS JUST LIKE OTHER COMPANIES OTHER FRIENDS I VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT THAT HAVE BEEN MOVING AROUND IT S IT S BEFORE .
THEY HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE DRUG TEST TO COME IN BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY GET EMPLOYMENT SO I M .
YEAH .
SURE THAT HAPPENED TO ME TOO .
YEAH .
WHAT WHAT ABOUT OH THEY JUST INSTITUTED IT THERE AT WALMART .
YEAH .
SO .
THEY THEY IT WAS AFTER I WAS ALREADY WORKING THERE AND THEY WERE NT TESTING ANY OF THOSE .
WHO WERE ALREADY WORKING .
RIGHT .
SO .
DO YOU UH HAVE A FAMILY BUDGET OR HOW DO YOU WORK YOUR BUDGETING .
WELL FOR MANY MANY YEARS UH MY WIFE AND I DID HAVE A BUDGET UH WE WERE BOTH WORKING AT THE TIME AND SO FORTH AND UH THAT WE HAD TO DO THAT UNTIL WE FINALLY GOT THE HOUSE PAID FOR AND AND OTHER BIG BILLS TAKEN CARE OF .
UHHUH .
UH WE HAVE A A BUDGET BUT NOT AS STRICT NOW AS WE USED TO BECAUSE WE DO NT HAVE QUITE SUCH A TIGHT FINANCIAL SITUATION .
YEAH .
SO IT IT S UH IT S HELPFUL I MEAN YES HAVING A BUDGET IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND THAT DID GET US SO THAT YOU KNOW THE HOUSE IS PAID FOR AND UH OTHER MAJOR THINGS ARE TAKEN CARE OF AND NOW WE CAN RELAX A LITTLE BIT MORE BECAUSE BASICALLY WE DO NT REALLY REQUIRE AS MUCH ON A DAILY OR A MONTHLY BASIS AS WE DID BEFORE SO WE DO NT HAVE TO HAVE QUITE AS STRICT UH A BUDGET AS WE DID .
OH WELL WE DO NT HAVE A REAL STRICT BUDGET UH WE HAVE A A LOW BUDGET TO WORK ON BUT WE UH YOU KNOW FOR LIKE GROCERIES WE SAY ABOUT THIS MUCH PER WEEK AND THEN .
SURE UHHUH .
WE JUST SPEND ABOUT SO MUCH WE DO NT I I DO NT KNOW OF A WRITTEN FIGURE OF EXPENSES THAT WE YOU KNOW KEEP TO OR ANYTHING BUT I KNOW THAT I GO TO THE GROCERY STORE THAT WE ALWAYS STICK WITHIN YOU KNOW FIVE DOLLARS BETWEEN HERE AND THERE .
UHHUH .
A CERTAIN AMOUNT .
I THINK I VE I DO THAT AUTOMATICALLY MYSELF .
YEAH .
I MEAN I UNCONSCIOUSLY UH YOU KNOW STAY IN A WITHIN A WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT BECAUSE I I HAVE ENOUGH FOOD ALREADY STORED HERE .
OH .
THAT I DO NT HAVE TO MAKE ANY LARGE PURCHASE AT ANY ONE TIME ALL I NORMALLY DO NOW IS PICK UP LITTLE THINGS HERE AND THERE IF THE SALT GOES OUT OR WE NEED SUGAR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
WOW THAT S GREAT .
YEAH WE HAVE TWO FREEZERS AND COURSE WE HAVE A LARGE GARDEN HERE THAT WE GROW A LOT OF OUR OWN STUFF AND WE FREEZE A LOT OF THAT SO A LOT OF THE VEGETABLES ARE TAKEN CARE OF IN OUR OWN .
OH .
P PERSONAL STORAGE .
OH YOU GUYS SOUND PRETTY SELF SUFFICIENT .
WELL WE WE KEEP A LITTLE NOTE PAD ON A ON A WALL W IF ANYTHING IS ABSOLUTELY OUT MAKE A NOTE OF IT AND THEN UH THE NEXT TIME I GO TO THE STORE WHY I PICK IT UP AND FILL IT UP .
HUH .
SO IT S IT S WORKED VERY WELL THAT WAY THAT WAY WE YOU KNOW IF EACH OF US FINDS SOMETHING IS MISSING UH WE PUT IT UP UH THE OTHER PERSON MIGHT NOT KNOW ABOUT IT .
YEAH .
THAT WAY WE .
WELL THAT S A GOOD IDEA .
KEEP UP TO DATE .
LET S SEE THE OTHER THING THERE THE TOPIC WAS TALKING ABOUT WAS IF IF UH ALL I CAN THINK OF IS IF YOU DO NT KEEP A REAL A REAL TIGHT BUDGET HOW DO YOU CONTROL EXPENSES BUT UH ONE ANOTHER THING THAT WE DO IS WE ALWAYS FLY BACK TO CALIFORNIA AND WASHINGTON EACH CHRISTMAS WELL NOT FLY BACK BUT SOMEHOW WE GET BACK THERE .
UHHUH .
AND UH THIS YEAR WE DID IT BY TRAIN BECAUSE IT WAS THE LEAST EXPENSIVE AND .
WELL ACTUALLY IT S MORE INTERESTING TOO IF YOU VE .
HUH .
GOT THE TIME .
OH YEAH .
AND UH YOU KNOW WE COULD GO TO BOTH PLACES WITHOUT HAVING TO SPEND SO MUCH FOR .
YEAH .
PLANE FARE AND SO UH WE FIND THAT IF WE RE CAREFUL WITH OUR YOU KNOW JUST EVERYDAY THINGS LIKE GROCERY SHOPPING AND AND GAS AND ENTERTAINMENT THINGS LIKE THAT THEN UH SOMEWHERE IN OUT IN THE WASH IT WILL COME OUT THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH TO GET BACK THERE .
SURE .
YOU KNOW .
WELL I THINK WE UNCONSCIOUSLY DO THE SAME THING EXCUSE ME MY THROAT S NOT AS CLEAR TODAY AS IT SHOULD BE .
UHHUH THAT S ALL RIGHT .
UH WE ARE UH GOING TO BE TRAVELING TO EUROPE WITH A CHORAL WE SING WITH A SO CALLED PENNSYLVANIA CHORAL .
UHHUH .
AND WE MAKE A TWO WEEKS TOUR OF OF UH FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND OF COURSE THAT COSTS MONEY SO WE UH EACH OF US WATCHES THE FUNDS THAT WE SPEND AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE GATHER TOGETHER OVER A PERIOD A TIME ENOUGH MONEY TO TO MAKE THIS TRIP SO TH THAT IS ANOTHER WAY OF UH BUDGETING .
UHHUH THAT S RIGHT .
AND I THINK WE JUST SORT OF UNCONSCIOUSLY DO IT WE UH JUST LIVE A NORMAL LIFE BUT WE DO NT THROW ANY MONEY AWAY PARTICULARLY WE SAVE IT FOR THIS TRIP WHICH IS UH ALWAYS VERY VERY NICE .
YEAH WELL WHENEVER I DO NT KNOW IF THIS IS PART OF THE TOPIC BUT WHENEVER I FIND YOU KNOW A DIME OR SOMETHING ON THE GROUND I I LL PROBABLY PICK IT UP .
I DO THE SAME THING I HAVE A WHOLE PILE OF THEM SAVED THAT I HAVE FOUND BY PARKING METERS .
UHHUH YEAH I HAVE A SPECIAL LITTLE JAR THAT I KEEP ALL THE MONEY I FOUND IN YOU KNOW JUST .
YEAH .
COUNT IT UP AT THE END OF THE YEAR SOMETHING .
YEAH .
BUT YEAH .
WELL LET S FACE IT THE WHEN WE RE TALKING BUDGET IT IS IMPORTANT TO TO HAVE A BUDGET AND UH I I KEEP TRACK OF MINE ON A MORE ROUGH BASIS NOW BY JUST WATCHING THE LEVEL OF MY CHECKING ACCOUNT AND I HAVE A MONEY MARKET ACCOUNT ALSO .
UHHUH .
AND UH I KEEP THOSE LEVELS UP ABOVE A CERTAIN MINIMUM AND I M ALWAYS TRYING TO .
OKAY .
I LL LET YOU START .
DO YOU .
ALL KEEP A BUDGET AND HOW DO YOU HOLD TO YOURS .
NO I I NEVER KEEP A BUDGET .
MY BUDGET OR PHILOSOPHY I GUESS IS SPEND AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE .
WELL THAT S THAT S GOOD .
AND UH .
ESPECIALLY FOR THESE TIMES .
AND IT S IT S SOR SORT OF ALWAYS WORKED .
UHHUH .
UH BUT THAT DEPENDS YOU KNOW ON THE INDIVIDUAL IF THEY CAN I GUESS HAVE SELFCONTROL .
WELL THAT S A LOT OF IT .
UH I KNOW WE TRIED SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS .
ONE TIME .
WE TRIED SOMETHING .
THAT REALLY WORKED BUT WE DID NT KEEP IT UP .
I PASSED IT ON TO A FRIEND AND SHE WO NT QUIT DOING IT .
SHE LOVES IT AND THAT WAS THE ENVELOPE SYSTEM .
UHHUH .
WHERE YOU GO AHEAD AND DECIDE ABOUT HOW MUCH BASED ON WHAT .
YOU DID LAST MONTH THAT YOU ARE GOING TO SPEND AND YOU PUT THE CASH IN ENVELOPES MARKED FOR THAT .
SO YOU HAVE ONE FOR ENTERTAINMENT AND ONE FOR GROCERIES ET CETERA .
AND THEN FOR SOME REASON TAKING IT OUT OF THAT ENVELOPE AND SEEING IT IN CASH INSTEAD OF IN CHECK FORM UH CAUSES YOU TO REALIZE HOW MUCH IS LEFT .
AND SHE EVEN WRITES DOWN ON THE ENVELOPE AS SHE SUBTRACTS AND KIND OF DEBITS ON EACH ENVELOPE .
UHHUH .
WHAT .
SHE S BUYING .
AND THEN AT THE END OF THE OF THE PERIOD PAY PERIOD IF SHE HAS ANY LEFT THAT MUCH IS FOR FUN OR ENTERTAINMENT .
UHHUH .
AND THEY .
KIND OF WORK .
IT .
THAT WAY .
WE TRIED FOR A WHILE AND A SEEMS LIKE THE PROBLEM THAT THEY WERE HAVING OF ALL THE OF ALL THE THINGS .
THAT WORKED WAS NOT PLANNING ENOUGH FOR THE INCIDENTALS THAT WE COULD NT THINK ABOUT .
YES .
AND THOSE ARE THE ONES .
THAT WILL KILL YOU .
YOU KNOW THE ACCID THE ACCIDENTAL FEE OR THE CAR REPAIR OR THE THINGS .
THAT WERE NT SUPPOSED TO BE EVERY MONTH .
WELL YEAH I I COULD NT PROBABLY BE BOTHERED DOING THAT .
UHHUH .
EVERY MONTH AND .
THAT S WHAT .
I MEAN .
IT WAS A HASSLE .
AND EVER SINCE UH WELL WE VE BEEN MARRIED ALMOST THIRTY YEARS NOW BUT UH .
UHHUH .
MY HUSBAND GOT PAID ONCE A MONTH .
UHHUH .
SO YOU LEARN TO GET .
THAT S THAT S KIND OF HARD .
RIGHT .
YOU LEARN TO GET THROUGH YOU KNOW TO THE END OF THE MONTH AND UH .
BUT DO YOU SORT OF SELF BUDGET EVEN I MEAN YOU WOULD NT LIKE ON PAYDAY THINK BOY I CAN GO DO THIS AND THAT AND THIS AND THAT .
YOU .
KIND OF THINK THIS IS GOT TO STR .
NO .
YOU .
KIND OF DIVIDE IT IN FOURTHS IN A WAY DO NT YOU .
NO .
BECAUSE IF YOU CHARGE THINGS UH YOU PAY ALL YOUR BILLS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MONTH .
RIGHT .
WHEN YOU GET PAID OR YOU GET PAID THE LAST DAY OR NEXT TO THE LAST DAY .
RIGHT .
YOU PAY ALL YOUR BILLS AND THERE IS NT ANYTHING LEFT TO SPEND ANYWAY .
WELL THAT S TRUE .
WHAT .
WE RE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING RIGHT NOW IS PAYING OFF OUR CREDIT CARDS ENTIRELY .
UHHUH .
AND WE RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND TRY TO JUST LIVE ON WHAT .
WE EARN INSTEAD OF GUESSING AHEAD OF WHAT .
WE PROBABLY WILL HAVE NEXT MONTH .
WELL YEAH WE .
OH .
WE TRIED TO TO TO OR WE ARE PAYING THEM OFF NOW .
YEAH WE RE NOT THERE YET .
UH THERE WAS A TIME WHEN MAYBE WE DID NT TAKE ALL OF THEM OFF .
UHHUH .
BUT YOU JUST SORT OF HAD TO WATCH WHAT .
YOU PUT IN .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE YOU HATE TO PAY THOSE FINANCE CHARGES .
THAT S RIGHT .
WHEN YOU SEE HOW MUCH .
IT IS .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND FOR MOST OF UH I MEAN I M A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER AND I VE ONLY SUBSTITUTED I GUESS FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS .
HUH .
SO THERE S ONLY BEEN REALLY ONE WORKING .
UHHUH SAME HERE .
UHHUH .
AND UH IT IT WORKS FOR ME BUT I CA NT SEE THAT IT WOULD WORK FOR PROBABLY THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE .
WELL I COULD SAY IT .
S KIND OF YOU KNOW THAT S THAT S GOOD .
YOU .
MA YOU PROBABLY HAVE A LITTLE EXTRA THAN YOU HAVE TO HAVE TO YOU KNOW WHAT .
I M SAYING .
YEAH .
AND SO THAT THAT S THE DIFFERENCE THERE WHERE SOMETIMES LIKE I KNOW IF WE VE HAD AN ESPECIALLY BAD MONTH AND WE RE JUST ALMOST GETTING DOWN TO PAYDAY THEN I THINK IF WE COULD REALLY BUDGET WE TRIED ONE TIM I KNOW WHEN WE WERE PLANNING TO BUY THE NEW CAR AND WE HAD NT HAD A CAR PAYMENT IN FIVE YEARS WE HAD TO GO AHEAD AND WRITE DOWN EACH MONTH .
WHAT .
IT WAS THAT EVERY PENNY WENT FOR .
UHHUH .
TO SEE HOW MUCH WAS GOING TO BE LEFT .
YEAH .
AND THAT WAS A REAL EYE OPENER .
UHHUH .
IT .
IT IS WHEN YOU DO IT .
THAT WAY .
UHHUH .
BUT TO TO HAVE LIVED BY THAT EVERY WEEK WOULD HAVE BEEN TOUGH FOR ME BECAUSE SOMETIMES I LL SPEND LESS ON GROCERIES BUT WE LL GO OUT .
SO IT S KIND OF HARD TO SAY THIS IS HOW MUCH YOU RE GOING TO SPEND GOING OUT FOR FUN .
THIS IS HOW MUCH YOU RE GOING TO SPEND .
IT .
S KIND OF HARD .
WELL WE WE EAT OUT A GOOD DEAL AT THIS POINT .
DO YOU .
I I STARTED SUBBING JUST TO GO ON A VACATION AND SAVED .
YEAH YEAH .
ALL THAT MONEY SO BECAUSE I KNEW THAT YOU COULD NT YOU KNOW SPENDING .
RIGHT .
FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ON A VACATION .
RIGHT .
OR WHATEVER .
WE WERE GOING TO GO FOR TEN WEEKS UH .
OH .
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SO I STARTED .
HOW NICE .
WORKING IN NINETEEN EIGHTYSEVEN AND JUST SAVED .
UHHUH .
FOR THREE YEARS .
BUT THE WHAT .
MINUSCULE AMOUNT .
I MADE BUT .
W .
THAT WAY .
YOU JUST DID NT PUT IT ON YOUR CREDIT CARD .
WELL THAT S .
AND AND IT WAS PAID FOR .
AND IT MADE A BIG AND YOU ENJOYED IT BETTER PROBABLY .
YES .
YEAH MUMBLEX .
AND SO I THINK THAT THAT S DIFFICULT FOR MOST PEOPLE BUT THEN MY FATHER WAS .
I THINK SO TOO .
VERY SCOTCH AND YOU KNOW YOU NEVER COULD AFFORD ANYTHING ALTHOUGH WE COULD AFFORD EVERYTHING IF HE WANTED TO .
UM .
SO IF YOU RE OUT LIKE IN A DEPARTMENT STORE AND THERE S A SALE YOU RE JUST REAL CAREFUL NOT TO LET YOUR URGES GET HOLD OF YOU .
YES .
THAT S THAT S EXCELLENT .
THAT S WHAT .
I M WORKING TOWARD .
I THINK YOU RE PROBABLY MUCH AHEAD OF ME THERE AND I M WORKING ON IT .
AND I NEVER WORRIED ABOUT SAVING MONEY BECAUSE WE JUST WE RE IN THE SAVINGS PLAN AT WORK AND THEY TOOK IT OUT SO .
SAME HERE SAME HERE .
I UH .
AND I THINK THOUGH THAT WE NEED TO HAVE SOME LIQUID AROUND THAT YOU DO NT HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE COMPANY TO GET .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW .
WELL WE NEVER HAD TOO MUCH OF THAT .
YEAH .
BUT THEN WE NEVER HAD ANY REALLY EMERGENCIES .
THAT UH .
THAT CAME UP .
YEAH .
AND WE DID NT BUY REALLY NEW OR EXPENSIVE CARS .
I THINK THE MOST MY WE RE LOOKING AT CARS NOW UH WE EVER SPENT FOR A NEW CAR WAS LIKE SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS .
UHHUH .
AND THEY WERE MAINLY USED CARS .
WELL THAT S THE BEST THING TO DO .
MY HUSBAND SAID THE OTHER DAY .
IT WAS THE WORST MISTAKE .
WE EVER DID TO BUY A NEW CAR BECAUSE IT WAS NT WORTH .
IT FROM THE DAY AFTER .
YEAH SO .
SO .
YOU KNOW WE VE BEEN RATHER RATHER FRUGAL IN THAT .
RATHER FRUGAL .
WELL THAT S THAT S GOING TO PAYOFF ON RETIREMENT .
IN THAT RESPECT .
YEAH .
SO .
WELL IT UH I GUESS WE VE COMPLETED DO YOU THINK WE VE BEEN HERE TO IN .
WELL EACH TIME .
THEY USED TO CALL IN AND TELL ME THEIR SPACE IS LIMITED AND TO PLEASE UH .
OKAY SO .
FIRST HOW MUCH TELEVISION WATCHING DO YOU DO .
I DO A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN I THINK USUAL PEOPLE DO BECAUSE I AM HERE ALONE DURING THE DAY .
UHHUH .
AND I LIKE IT JUST FOR THE NOISE .
THAT S RIGHT BUT DO YOU ACTUALLY WATCH IT .
UM .
PAY ATTENTION TO IT OR IS IT MORE OF A COMPANY .
UM IT JUST DEPENDS ON WHAT IT IS .
UHHUH .
I MEAN I HAVE MY FAVORITE THINGS THAT I DO .
UHHUH OKAY .
AND THEN SOME FUN THING TO DO SOMETIME .
RIGHT .
UM WHAT ABOUT YOU .
WELL ACTUALLY I WORK FULL TIME AND WHEN I AM NOT WORKING I AM RUNNING AND I DO NOT WATCH A LOT OF TELEVISION AND I AM VERY SELECTIVE IN WHAT I WATCH .
RIGHT .
IF THERE S SOMETHING THAT I ABSOLUTELY WANT TO WATCH I WILL TURN IT ON AND WATCH IT AND THEN TURN IT OFF I PROBABLY WATCH TELEVISION FOUR HOURS A WEEK MAX .
WELL SEE THAT S GREAT YEAH .
AND AND UH .
WELL .
IF IF I DO NOT FIND SOMETHING THAT I REALLY WANT OR REALLY WANT TO WATCH WELL THEN I JUST DO NOT TURN IT ON I WOULD RATHER LISTEN TO MUSIC .
RIGHT .
PART OF IT IS THAT UH I THINK WE NEED TO BE VERY SELECTIVE ABOUT THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT COME TO US ON A SUBLIMINAL BASIS AND I THINK THAT IF WE ARE DOING OTHER THINGS AND THESE PROGRAMS COME IN SOMETIMES THEY INFLUENCE US AND WE DO NOT KNOW WHERE THAT INFLUENCE CAME FROM .
WELL I THINK THAT WELL PART I THINK THAT S PARTIALLY TRUE TOO .
YEAH .
I THINK YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE WILL AND THE AND UH ANYWAY I THINK IT .
UH RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT .
YOU ARE YOU WOULD BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO STUFF .
OF COURSE I UH .
AND IT HAS TO BE REINFORCED AT ANOTHER LEVEL TOO BUT .
THAT S RIGHT .
ANYWAY WHAT WOULD YOU WATCH IF YOU HAD YOU KNOW THIS WEEK TO WATCH .
I UH .
DO YOU LIKE SPECIALS .
WELL LAST NIGHT FOR EXAMPLE I REALLY WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE WATCHED UNSOLVED MYSTERIES THOSE ARE FASCINATING TO ME .
OH .
IF I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY I WATCH IT UNFORTUNATELY I WAS WITH SOMEONE ELSE WHO WAS FLIPPING CHANNELS .
OH .
I HATE THAT I DO NOT CARE A WHOLE LOT FOR SOME OF THE CONTEMPORARY HUMOR .
OH RIGHT YEAH .
IN OUR COMEDY PROGRAMS ALTHOUGH NOBODY CAN APPRECIATE COMEDY ANY MORE THAN I CAN BUT I WOULD PREFER TO FIND A GOOD COMEDIAN ON ONE OF THE EDUCATIONAL CHANNELS OR ONE OF THE OLDER COMEDIANS .
WELL WE HAVE CABLE ALSO .
UHHUH .
AND SOMETIMES YOU CAN UM GET THE H B O SPECIALS .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND SOMETIMES THOSE ARE REALLY .

THINGS LIKE THAT YOU GET .
OH YEAH I TOOK A LOT OF MY .
A WHOLE LOT OF EXPOSURE .
COLLEGE COURSES I TOOK SOME OF MY .
MUMBLEX .
COLLEGE COURSES ON TELEVISION .
YEAH .
SO THAT IT S VERY SUCCESSFUL FOR SOME OF .
OH .
THOSE THINGS BUT I THINK I REALLY GOT STUNG VERY BADLY ABOUT HAVING INFLUENCE IN YOUR LIFE OR AT LEAST I SAW A VERY BAD EXAMPLE OF HAVING TELEVISION INFLUENCE YOUR LIFE UH MY HUSBAND HAD AN AUNT WHO WAS ADDICTED TO SOAPS .
UHHUH .
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT BECAME THE MOST SUSPICIOUS CANTANKEROUS CONTRARY OLD WOMAN EVER WALKED .
SHE GOT YOU A MUMBLEX .
ABSOLUTELY .
I DO NOT KNOW WHO SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS BUT SHE JUST GOT TO THE POINT WHERE YOU COULD MIGHT NEAR YOU COULD ALMOST HEAR THOSE SOAPS BEING ECHOED IN HER VOICE .
YEAH .
AND THAT ATTITUDE BEING DEMONSTRATED AND FOR HER TO MISS A SOAP IT WAS A BIG WITHDRAWAL .
OH WELL SEE THAT S .
AND .
BUT SHE WAS PROBABLY DEPRESSED TO BEGIN WITH .
WELL I DO NOT KNOW .
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN .
WELL SHE WAS GRUMPY TO BEGIN WITH .
YEAH GRUMPY TO BEGIN WITH YEAH .
THERE S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT BUT UH BUT YOU COULD CLEARLY SEE THOSE INFLUENCES .
UHHUH .
AND IN MY YOUNGSTERS I KNOW THAT ONE DAY UH MY YOUNGSTERS WERE WATCHING THE THREE STOOGES AND I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT WAS JUST CASUAL SLAP STICK .
I HATE THAT SHOW .
COMEDY BUT WHEN ONE TRIES TO LIFT THE OTHER ONE UP WITH A PIPE WRENCH I DECIDED THAT WAS NOT FUNNY .
YEAH .
ANY MORE .
I I .
AND I REALLY .
GOOD .
I REALLY FEEL VERY STRONG ABOUT THE BART SIMPSON SHOW I THINK THAT IS THE KIDS WATCH THAT AND THAT S ABSOLUTELY THE MOUTHIEST KID I EVER SAW .
AND I JUST I DO NOT LIKE IT .
IS NOT THAT AMAZING HOW OLD ARE YOUR KIDS .
MINE ARE GROWN BUT I HAVE GRANDCHILDREN .
OH OKAY SO THAT S .
AND YOUNG CHILDREN AROUND .
YEAH .
AND UH FOR A FOUR YEAR OLD TO THINK BART SIMPSON IS A HERO IS TRAGIC .
I HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT SEE IT S JUST MY HUSBAND AND I AND .
UHHUH .
SO I DO NOT HAVE THAT YOU KNOW I THAT CONSTANT INFLUENCE .
UHHUH UHHUH .
OF THE KIDS SHOWS AND ALL THAT .
YEAH YEAH .
BUT UH UM I DO NT KNOW .
WELL I WAS VERY CAREFUL EVEN WHEN MY KIDS WERE .
YEAH .
KIDS WERE AT HOME AND WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG I WAS REALLY DID UH WATCH WHAT THEY WATCHED I WAS CAU I SAT DOWN WITH THEM AND I WATCHED IT AND IF I DID NOT LIKE IT I CHANGED THE CHANNEL FOR THEM YOU KNOW .
RIGHT .
I YOU KNOW I DISTRACTED THEM CHANGED THEIR INTEREST .
RIGHT .
BECAUSE I JUST COULD NOT TOLERATE THAT KIND OF INFLUENCE ON THE KIDDOS I JUST WOU .
AND AND YOU KNOW WE GET IT AT SCHOOL TOO ANYWAY SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL NOT .
SURE .
REINFORCE IT .
THAT S RIGHT THAT S RIGHT .
YOU KNOW .
GOSH THEY GOT THEY ARE MOUTHY ENOUGH ANYWAY .
I KNOW I REMEMBER GOING TO SCH MY PARENTS WERE A LOT LIKE TOO AND OF COURSE .
UHHUH .
WE DID NOT HAVE ANY OF THE VARIETY YOU KNOW KIDS HAVE .
UHHUH .
BUT ALL THE WATCH RAWHIDE AND ALL THOSE SHOWS .
UHHUH .
AND MY PARENTS NEVER LET ME WATCH ANYTHING LIKE THAT I COULD WATCH YOGI BEAR YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
WHAT KIND OF CULTURE WAS THAT .
YEAH WELL .
AND I REMEMBER GOING TO SCHOOL THE NEXT DAY AND EVERYBODY WOULD BE ASKING OH DID YOU SEE THAT .
UHHUH .
DID YOU SEE HOW HE DID THAT AND DID YOU SEE AND I COULD NEVER PARTICIPATE .
UHHUH .
AND IT ALWAYS MADE ME FEEL A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW A LONER LIKE I YOU KNOW .
SURE I CAN .
BUT UH .
UNDERSTAND HOW THAT WOULD HAPPEN .
BUT SEE THEN MY PARENTS I THINK THEN YOU HAVE TO REPLACE IT WITH OTHER THINGS .
ABSOLUTELY WELL I DID .
YOU KNOW TO UH .
I RAN MY KIDS TO DEATH .

THE STORE AND COME HOME AND SIT DOWN AND WATCH IT .
BUT WE WENT ON FIELD TRIPS AND WE DID OTHER THINGS AND I THINK THAT WAS .
WELL THAT S YOU KNOW THAT S SOMETHING PEOPLE DO NOT DO WELL HERE WE ARE TALKING ON THAT SUBJECT BUT THAT S THAT S AN INTERESTING CONCEPT I HAVE GOT TO STICK IN MY MUMBLEX UH .

WHAT I USUALLY DO IS I LL TRY IT OUT IN THE MAGAZINE FIRST AND WITHOUT TEARING IT OUT AND THEN GIVE IT A .

WELL LARRY MY LAST ONE UNFORTUNATELY WAS A AN EXPENSIVE ONE BECAUSE I HAD A BRAND NEW LINCOLN TOWN CAR AND .
UM .
AND A COUPLE OF LADIES RAN A STOP LIGHT THE LIGHTS WERE NT WORKING PROPERLY IT WAS NT THEIR FAULT BUT WE THEY DID NT RUN IT WE BOTH HAD GREEN AND SHE HIT ME AND DID ABOUT ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF DAMAGE TO MY CAR SO .
MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS THAT S .
THAT WAS A HUGE REPAIR BILL .
WELL THAT S STILL NOT ENOUGH FOR A TOTAL IS IT .
I KNOW I HATED THAT .
IT S A VERY EXPENSIVE AUTOMOBILE .
SO IT WAS NT ENOUGH TO TOTAL IT BUT THAT S MY THAT S BEEN MY MOST UH EXPENSIVE REPAIR PROBABLY IN THE LAST YEAR WITH THE EXCEPT OF JUST SERVICE WORK BECAUSE I BUY A NEW CAR EVERY TWO YEARS AND .
OH AND DO YOU BUY ONE EVERY TWO YEARS .
WELL I TRAVEL A LOT SO .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW UH THIS LAST ONE I LEASED SO I DO NT KNOW AND I LEASED IT ON A TWENTYFOUR MONTH PROGRAM FIRST TIME I VE EVER DONE THAT BUT I LL PROBABLY GO BACK TO BUYING THEM BECAUSE I DO NT CARE TO LEASE THEM .
DID THIS CAR HAVE ONE OF THESE EXPANDING BALLOONS OR JUST ARE THERE NORMAL SAFETY BELTS IN IT THAT YOU HAD .
NO IT HAS THE EXPANDING BALLOONS .
DID THAT HELP YOU .
UH IT THEY DID NT GO OFF .
THEY DID NT GO OFF .
NO I GUESS WE WERE NT GOING THAT SORT OF UPSET ME WE WERE NT GOING FAST ENOUGH ACCO WHEN I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP ABOUT IT AND CALLED FORD MOTOR ABOUT IT BUT NO SIR DID NT GO OFF UH WE WERE .

MY GOODNESS .
SO I M GOING TO GET WHEN MY TWENTYFOUR MONTHS IS UP ON THIS CAR I M GETTING RID OF THIS CAR .
I WOULD THINK SO .
THIS DOES NT SOUND LIKE YOU VE GOT VERY GOOD LUCK WITH THAT ONE .
MY GOLLY HOW ABOUT YOU LARRY .
WELL I M RELATIVELY FORTUNATE ABOUT THAT UH HERE WE SOMEHOW DO NT HAVE MANY PEOPLE RUN INTO US ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH SCHOOL SEASON UH STUDENTS MOVE INTO TOWN WHO ARE FROM BIG CITIES AND THEY SORT OF DRIVE KIND OF WILD FOR ABOUT TWO THREE WEEKS THEN THEY FINALLY SETTLE DOWN AND .
REALIZE THAT THEY DO NT HAVE TO DRIVE THAT WAY HERE .
I UNDERSTAND .
AND NOW THAT TAKES THE STRAIN OUT OFF OF EVERYONE THAT UH IS DRIVING A VEHICLE AND I FIND THAT THE MOST OF THE REPAIRS I HAVE TO DO HERE IS BODY DAMAGE DUE TO THE SALT THAT WE HAVE TO PUT ON THE ROAD TO UH TAKE CARE OF US IN THE WINTER TIME .
I UNDERSTAND .
UH I HAVE A SIXTYNINE COUGAR AND A SEVENTYSEVEN PONTIAC SO FORTH AND I HAVE TO AND I DRIVE A HONDA MOST OF THE TIME AND I HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT UH SALT AND SO FORTH ARE KEPT OFF OF IT AND ONCE IN A WHILE WE HAVE TO REPLACE SOME OF THE PLATES IN THE BOTTOM OF IT .
SURE .
BECAUSE IT S RUSTED AWAY .
I UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE I M FROM WEST VIRGINIA AND WE HAD THE SAME THING UP THERE CONTINUOUSLY SALTING THE ROADS FOR SNOW .
UHHUH WELL I JUST I DI I HAD THIS COUGAR TOTALLY UH THE BODY OF IT TOTALLY REBUILT UH TO GET SOME OF THE RUSTS THAT WERE IN THE FENDERS .
SURE .
UH DONE AND THEN IT ALL REPAINTED AND THEN WINTER GOT HERE AND SO I PUT THE COVER OVER IT THEN TO KEEP THE ICE AND SNOW OFF .
SO I HAVE NT HAD A CHANCE TO DRIVE IT VERY MUCH BUT ANYHOW UH NOW ARE YOU GOING TO BUY THIS NEXT CAR OR YOU GOING RENT IT LEASE IT AGAIN .
NO I M GOING TO I M GOING TO BUY IT LARRY I DO NT LIKE THE RENTAL I THINK I M GETTING READY TO RETIRE MYSELF AND .
ARE YOU .
I M GOING TO I M GOING TO BE YOU KNOW DRIVING A CAR FOR LONGER SO I USUALLY DRIVE A CAR FOR THREE YEARS AND .
UHHUH .
AND ANYWAY AND SO BUT LAST COUPLE OF CARS I VE ONLY DRIVEN FOR TWO YEARS AND SO I D LEASED THIS ONE FOR TWO YEARS SO I LL PROBABLY GO BACK AND BUY ONE AND UH THIS NEXT CAR WILL PROBABLY BE MY RETIREMENT CAR .
WELL THAT S AN AWFULLY BIG ONE THAT UH THAT ONE THAT YOU HAD THAT LINCOLN UH IS NT IT TOO LARGE FOR NORMAL TOWN DRIVING FINDING PARKING PLACES .
WELL NO SIR .

I M I M VERY MUCH AWARE OF THAT .
AND I TRAVEL I M LIKE A TRAVELING SALESMAN DO NT TRAVEL A LOT ANY MORE BUT UH WHEN I DO TAKE IT IT IS VERY COMFORTABLE TO DRIVE .

SO AM .
I .
ARE YOU .
YOU KNOW I THINK IT S KIND OF COMING BACK AROUND TO THAT DO NT YOU I MEAN THAT THERE S A LOT MORE PEOPLE .
THAT STAY HOME NOW THAN BEFORE BUT I GUESS MORE THAN ANYTHING .
I THINK MAYBE PEOPLE WERE JUST KIND OF WANTING TO HAVE THE CHOICE OF WHAT .
THEY COULD DO YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
I DO NT KNOW I MEAN I THINK SOMETIMES SOME OF THE THE WOMEN S LIB THOUGH IS KIND OF LIKE THEY WANTED IT .
ALL YOU KNOW AND YOU CA NT HAVE EVERYTHING .
UHHUH .
I DO NT I DO NT THINK THAT YOU CAN HAVE I MEAN THERE S NO WAY .
I COULD HAVE A CAREER AND THEN BE THE KIND OF MOM THAT I WANT TO BE .
YEAH .
AND TO ME .
THAT S MORE IMPORTANT .
HO HOW MANY KIDS DO YOU HAVE .
TWO .
TWO .
UHHUH .
ARE THEY .
YOUNG OR .
FIVE AND TWO .
FIVE AND TWO .
I HAVE TWO AND MINE ARE TWO AND NINE MONTHS SO UM BEING BEING HOME IS REAL I I JUST AM FORTUNATE BECAUSE I DO NT KNOW A REAL LOT OF MOMS .
THAT GET TO STAY HOME AND UH I JUST IT S JUST WEIRD THAT I WAS JUST TALKING TO SOMEBODY THIS MORNING .
WHO S WHO S A WORKING UH LADY A WORKING MOM AND YOU KNOW THESE PEOPLE HAVE SECRETARIES AND THESE HIGH POWER JOBS AND IT JUST SEEMS LIKE UM SHE SHE TOLD ME NOW HER DAUGHTER TOOK HER .
FIRST STEPS AT THE DAY CARE AND UH I JUST THINK I I I JUST DO NT AGREE WITH THAT .
I THINK IT SHOULD BE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD GET BACK TO STAYING HOME AND AND BEING FAMILY MORE FAMILY ORIENTED THAN THAN NOT .
YOU KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY S ALWAYS SO BUSY WITH EVERYTHING THAT THEY RE DOING THAT THERE S NO TIME FOR THIS AND THAT AND THE OTHER AND I HOPE IT JUST DOES NT GET TO WHERE YOU KNOW THERE .
S MORE WOMEN MORE AND MORE WOMEN GOING INTO THE WORK FORCE .
WELL I AGREE I MEAN BUT I I HATE FOR THEM TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL BAD THAT HAVE TO WORK TOO SAYING YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD STAY HOME YOU KNOW OTHERWISE YOUR CHILDREN ARE NT GOING TO YOU KNOW TURN OUT OR WHATEVER .
YEAH .
BECAUSE THAT S NOT FAIR TO YOU KNOW LIKE THE SINGLE MOMS .
THAT HAVE TO WORK OR IF THEY WOULD NT BE ABLE TO MAKE ENDS MEET .
UHHUH .
NOT WORKING OR WHATEVER I MEAN I THINK IT S GOT TO BE A PERSONAL CHOICE AND IT S NICE THAT THAT WE COULD HAVE THE CHOICE TO STAY HOME .
YEAH WELL I FIND THAT I WHENEVER I HAVE TO WHENEVER I M IN A GROUP OF PEOPLE AND WE RE DISCUSSING THINGS LIKE JUST OVER THE WEEKEND .
I VISITED MY FAMILY AND SOME COUSINS I HAD NT SEEN IN A LONG TIME AND EVERYONE S ALL INTERESTED IN WHAT .
EVERYBODY S DOING AND UH YOU KNOW WELL I HAD MY BABY WITH ME AND I FOUND THAT ALL .
I TALKED ABOUT WAS MY BABY .
WHICH WAS FINE WITH ME BUT IT S LIKE YOU KNOW HERE THESE PEOPLE ARE THEY RE GOING TO SCHOOL GETTING DEGREES MAKING ALL THIS MONEY AND YOU KNOW THEY .
KIND OF LOOKED AT ME LIKE I WAS FROM THE DARK AGES YOU KNOW LIKE I BECAUSE I DID NT HAVE REALLY ALL THAT MUCH TO TALK ABOUT UH WHERE CAREER AND THINGS LIKE THAT WERE CONCERNED AND YOU .
KIND OF FEEL LITTLE BIT LIKE AN OUTCAST FOR A WHILE .
YEAH .
IN SOCIAL SITUATIONS SOMETIMES WHICH IS TOO BAD BECAUSE YOU KNOW I I FEEL LIKE I DO NT OBVIOUSLY I DO NT GET PAID FOR MY JOB BUT I SHOULD GET PAID AT LEAST DOUBLE .
WHAT .
MY HUSBAND MAKES WORKING IN AN OFFICE FOR STAYING HOME .
YEAH .
THAT S WHAT .
I FIGURE I M WORTH A LOT JUST FOR WHAT .
I DO EVERY DAY BUT YOU KNOW I DO NT KNOW THIS IS KIND OF A UM AT AT LEAST HERE I VE NOTICED I M NOT FROM HERE I M FROM COLORADO BUT I VE REALLY NOTICED THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF UH A LOT MORE PEOPLE .
THAT ARE MORE COMFORTABLE AT LEAST WITH SOME WOMEN BEING HOME AND AT LEAST IN THE CIRCLES I VE TRAVELLED AND IN THE CHURCH THAT I GO TO YOU KNOW THAT MEN DO NT TREAT YOU LIKE YOU DO NT KNOW ANYTHING GENERALLY .
YEAH .
SPEAKING .
WELL AND I THINK A LOT OF COMPANIES ARE REALIZING THIS AND OFFERING MORE OPPORTUNITIES AS FAR AS LIKE JOB SHARING OR YOU KNOW EVEN HAVING A DAY CARE ON SITE AND THAT KIND OF STUFF AND I THINK THAT S REALLY IMPORTANT .
YEAH .
THAT THAT THEY DO THAT AND THEY REALIZE THERE S A NEED FOR THAT AND UM I DO NT KNOW I FOUND WHEN I DID DO SOME WORK WHEN MY SON WAS YOUNG IT WAS LIKE CONTRACT WORK AND IT .
WAS NT WHERE I HAD TO BE THERE EVERY DAY BUT I MEAN WE WERE GOING TO THE DOCTOR ONCE A WEEK SO I DO NT KNOW HOW YOU COULD HAVE A FULL TIME JOB AND EVER HAVE ANY VACATION TIME TO DO ANYTHING BESIDES GO TO THE DOCTOR .
YEAH YEAH I CAN SEE WHERE THAT WOULD DEFINITELY HINDER THE PROBLEM DEFINITELY .
WELL .
MUMBLEX HOW BIG IS PROVO .
UM .
THAT A LITTLE TOWN OR OR A BIGGER CITY .
UM IT S NOT ONE OF THE BIGGER ONES .
IT S PROBABLY UM I COMPARE IT TO THE SIZE OF PLANO MAYBE A LITTLE SMALLER .
PLANO TEXAS .
OH .
I TALKED TO SOMEONE .
THAT WAS ONLY A COUPLE OF THOUSAND IN HER TOWN I THINK .
OH REALLY .
YEAH I FORGOT THE NAME OF THE TOWN .
I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS YOU .
NO .
OH WELL ANYWAY WE RE SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT EDUCATION .
I CERTAINLY HAVE SOME IDEAS SINCE I M STUDYING IT NOW IN COLLEGE .
I D SAY FIRST OF ALL THEY NEED TO GO BACK TO SPENDING MORE TIME ON THE BASIC READING WRITING ARITHMETIC .
UHHUH .
IN GRADE SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY REALLY TEACH YOU ABOUT FORTY PERCENT LESS THAN THEY USED TO AND IT SHOWS UP .
THAT S ONE IDEA .
DO YOU HAVE ANY .
UM I DO NT KNOW I M PRETTY I THINK I M PRETTY SATISFIED WITH UM I GRE I GREW UP IN PLANO .
UHHUH .
AND AND MY DAD IS ACTUALLY ON THE SCHOOL BOARD THERE SO I .
KIND OF KEPT UP WITH A LOT OF THINGS .
THAT WENT ON .
YEAH IT S PLANO UH IMPROVED GREATLY IN THE LAST TWENTY TWENTYFIVE YEARS .
YEAH .
THAT S FOR SURE .
IT USED TO BE THE PITS .
AND ARLINGTON IS EXCELLENT NOW BUT I M JUST SPEAKING OVERALL .
OH .
ACROSS THE COUNTRY .
YEAH .
SOMETHING IS DEFINITELY WRONG .
UHHUH .
AND UH ONE THING THEY DO NT SPEND AS MUCH TIME JUST TEACHING READING AND WRITING SO A LOT OF KIDS ARE JUST BEING PROMOTED FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND THEY TRULY CA NT READ .
RIGHT .
SO I DO NT KNOW HOW THEY EXPECT THEM TO UH PASS HISTORY WHEN THEY CA NT READ ANYTHING YOU KNOW EVEN READ A WORD PROBLEM IN MATH .
SO UM THAT S DEFINITELY A PROBLEM .
ANOTHER PROBLEM IS YOU RE GOING TO KEEP THE SMARTER PEOPLE IN THE SYSTEM TOO LONG PAYING THE WAGES THEY DO .
RIGHT .
BUT UM .
SO DO YOU WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOOD ABOUT THE SCHOOLS .
THAT IS GOOD ABOUT WELL IT DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU ARE .
THEY RE ALL SO DIFFERENT .
THAT S ANOTHER THING .
YEAH .
ABOUT THE UNITED STATES .
THERE S NO NATIONAL CURRICULUM YOU KNOW I MEAN WHAT .
THEY D BE TEACHING IN AN ARLINGTON SCHOOL .
THEY MAY NOT BE TEACHING IN A PLANO SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
AND IN THE SAME SCHOOL DISTRICT YOU MAY EVEN IN AN ARLINGTON SEVENTH GRADE FOR INSTANCE YOU MAY HAVE AN ENGLISH CLASS .
YOU MAY HAVE HALF LITERATURE FOR THE WHOLE YEAR WHEREAS IN ANOTHER .
ONE .
THEY RE GOING TO CONCENTRATE ON GRAMMAR .
GRAMMAR .
AND GIVE YOU .
A LITTLE LITERATURE IT S UP TO THE TEACHER IN OTHER WORDS .
SO THAT S KIND OF O YOU KNOW THAT S KIND OF ODD TO ME .
YEAH .
IT DEPENDS ON UH WHAT SCHOOL .
YOU RE IN AND WHO .
YOUR TEACHER IS ACTUALLY .
UHHUH .
OR IS HOW YOU END UP .
OVERALL ARLINGTON IS GOOD ONE OF THE BETTER ONES IN THE STATE SO I GUESS WE LUCKED OUT WHEN WE MOVED HERE .
UHHUH .
SO YEAH THAT S THE THING IS JUST TO LOOK AT THE SCHOOL SYSTEM IN THE AREA THAT YOU MOVE INTO BEFORE YOU .
UHHUH .
OF COURSE .
WE HAVE A SLIGHT PROBLEM IN THAT UH THE NUMBER OF THE ILLITERATE IN AMERICA IS MUSHROOMING AT THIS POINT AND UH YOU KNOW WHERE OUR KIDS MIGHT BE IN A GREAT SCHOOL WE RE STILL PAYING AN AWFUL LOT OF TAXES FOR PEOPLE .
WHO ARE ON WELFARE AND UNEMPLOYMENT BECAUSE THEY CA NT READ YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
SO .
BUT DO YOU THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE UM NATIONWIDE UM CURRICULUM .
I DO NT KNOW .
I JUST READ ABOUT THAT THE OTHER DAY AND I HAD NEVER EVEN THOUGHT OF IT .
ACTUALLY IT MAKES SENSE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT BECAUSE SOMETIMES LIKE A THIRD GRADE TEACHER WILL GET KIDS FROM SECOND GRADE .
THAT DID NT EVEN LEARN WHAT UH THEY SHOULD TO DO THE WORK THAT SHE IS SUPPOSED TO TEACH YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
MUMBLEX AND ACCORDING TO HER PLAN SO I GUESS IF THERE WAS A NATIONAL CURRICULUM .
WE D AT LEAST HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT THAT ALL KIDS WOULD LEARN .
RIGHT .
BUT UH .
WE ACTUALLY RANK FORTYNINTH IN THE WORLD AS FAR AS JUST PLAIN LITERACY GOES YOU KNOW .
UM .
THAT S THAT S PRETTY LOW THAT THERE S .
YEAH .
FORTYEIGHT COUNTRIES AHEAD OF US .
THAT HAVE MORE PEOP MORE CITIZENS PERCENTAGE WISE .
THAT CAN READ AND WRITE SO UM UNLESS WE WANT TO KEEP PAYING PAYING FOR THESE PEOPLE .
THAT CA NT MAKE IT IN SOCIETY WE RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING .
WHO DO YOU THINK IT SHOULD BE DONE THROUGH .
I DO NT KNOW .
OBVIOUSLY NOBODY S SMART ENOUGH TO HAVE FIGURED IT OUT YET SO I PROBABLY CA NT .
BUT I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE TO CUT OUT SOME OF THIS FOLDEROL STUFF AND GO BACK IN THE FIRST FIVE SIX GRADES AND JUST KEEP GOING OVER AND OVER AND OVER UNTIL MOST OF THOSE .
THAT ARE CAPABLE CAN AT LEAST LEARN TO READ AND WRITE .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE THEY CA NT EVEN GET THE MENIAL JOB WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO READ SOMETHING NOWADAYS .
RIGHT .
YOU KNOW .
UH YOU CA NT YOU CA NT EVEN WORK AN ANSWERING MACHINE IF YOU RE AT WORK AND HAD TO GET A MESSAGE OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW OR FILL OUT AN APPLICATION TO WORK AT MCDONALDS IF YOU CA NT READ .
UHHUH .
SO UH I THINK THAT S THAT S A START AT LEAST GOING BACK TO THE BASICS IN THE EARLY GRADES .
YES .
AND UM THEY SAY THAT THE AVERAGE ENGLISH STUDENT NOWADAYS DOES AT LEAST FIFTY PERCENT LESS READING AND WRITING THAN THEY DID TWENTY YEARS AGO AND THAT S A BIG JUMP .
YEAH I BELIEVE THAT .
DID YOU GO TO SCHOOL IN PLANO .
I DID .
THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL .
UHHUH UH KINDER .
WELL THE WEATHER HAS BEEN CERTAINLY HAS BEEN HOT AND IT S BEEN HUMID .
I DO NT REMEMBER A YEAR IN A LONG TIME THAT THE HUMIDITY HAS STAYED UP THIS HIGH FOR UH THIS LATE INTO UH WELL IT S NOT REALLY LATE INTO THE SUMMER BUT THE THE HUMIDITY HAS HUNG AROUND ALL OF JUNE .
YEAH .
ARE YOU NATIVE TO THIS AREA .
NO I GREW UP IN MICHIGAN SO UH .
OH OKAY .
BUT I VE BEEN I VE BEEN IN TEXAS FOR FIFTEEN YEARS .
UHHUH .
SO UH BUT YOU KNOW I KNOW THE SUMMERS GET HOT BUT .
UHHUH .
IT CERTAINLY UH THIS HUMIDITY HAS JUST REALLY HUNG ON THERE .
YEAH .
YEAH IT SEEMED LIKE WELL YOU KNOW LAST YEAR WAS SO STRANGE HAVING ALL THOSE HEAVY HEAVY RAINS IN APRIL AND THIS YEAR .
WE REALLY DID NT HAVE HEAVY RAINS UNTIL MAY .
KIND OF LIKE PUSHED THE SEASON BACK A LITTLE FARTHER AND NOW IT S KIND OF LINGERING WITH KIND OF STILL A BIT OF HUMIDITY AND IT JUST TRIED TO RAIN I MEAN I WAS COMING IN FROM MY CAR JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO AND IT WAS TRYING TO RAIN WHICH .
YES .
SEEMS STRANGE TO HAVE IT RAINING IN JULY .
NORMALLY WE DO NT HAVE TOO MUCH UH HUMIDITY OR OR UH RAINY TIME WHEN IT S PAST JUNE .
OH THAT S RIGHT THAT S RIGHT .
I CAN REMEMBER IT NOT IT S REALLY AUGUST THAT IT HAPPENS .
YOU GET THOSE GREAT BIG CRACKS IN THE GROUND WHERE IT S BEEN SO DRY .
RIGHT .
AND IT JUST GETS SO DRY AND THE EARTH OPENS UP .
I CAN REMEMBER THE FIRST YEAR .
I MOVED HERE .
UHHUH .
AND IT DID NT RAIN I MOVED HERE LIKE IN LATE AUGUST AND IT DID NT RAIN FROM AUGUST UNTIL DECEMBER AND .
I WENT HOME AND TOLD IT JUST DOES NT RAIN IN TEXAS .
I MEAN IT WAS GREAT AFTER GROWING UP IN MICHIGAN AND NOT AND AL YOU KNOW EVERY DAY WAS CLOUDY ALMOST EVERY DAY WAS CLOUDY AND I YOU SORT OF FORGET HOW MUCH .

OH YEAH .
DOWN HERE AND YOU KNOW SO MANY TIMES WHEN YOU WERE TRYING TO SCHEDULE OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES YOU JUST NEVER KNEW IF IT WAS GOING TO BE A GO OR NOT BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER .

YOU KNOW AND HERE IT WAS LIKE PRETTY MUCH YOU COULD SCHEDULE SOME ACTIVITY OUTSIDE ANYTIME AND YOU REALLY DID NT HAVE TOO MUCH OF A CHANCE OF IT GETTING RAINED OUT .
YEAH .
YOU COULD PRETTY MUCH DO WHATEVER .
YOU WANTED TO DO .
THAT S RIGHT .
WHAT PART OF MICHIGAN WERE YOU LIVING IN .
OH I GREW UP IN DEARBORN .

OH YEAH .
YOU KNOW THE THE LITTLE JOKE ABOUT WILL THE LAST PERSON LEAVING MICHIGAN JUST TURN OUT THE LIGHT .
OH WELL IT S A NICE PLACE YOU KNOW I MEAN IT S IT S A NICE THAT S A NICE PLACE THOUGH .

I DID NT LIVE IN THE CITY OF PONTIAC I LIVED TO THE WEST OF IT .
UH I FORGET THE THE COUNTY BUT YOU KNOW WHERE ALL THE LAKES ARE AROUND THERE .
OKAY SORT OF .
I LIVED IN AN APARTMENT COMPLEX ON ONE OF THE LAKES .
IT WAS REAL CLOSE TO WHERE I WORKED .
IT WAS ONLY LIKE FOUR MILES TO WORK AND IT WAS WONDERFUL BEING ON THE LAKE LIKE THAT .
YOU KNOW IN THE SUMMER YOU FEEL LIKE YOU RE YOU KNOW ON A VACATION .
ALL THE TIME BECAUSE YOU RE RIGHT ON A LAKE AND EVERYBODY S YOU KNOW OUT ENJOYING THE WATER AND SUCH AND UH IN THE WINTER TIME .
THE LAKES FROZE OVER YOU COULD STILL KIND OF GO SLEDDING AND SUCH OUT THERE BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST REALLY NEAT TO BE OUT THERE ON ALL THOSE LAKES .
THERE .
S LOTS OF REALLY SMALL ONES OUT THERE .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW LIKE MAYBE A MILE TWO LONG .

THAT S ENOUGH TO UH DO SOME BOATING .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND IT WAS LOTS OF FUN .
THAT S RIGHT .
LAKE I THINK LAKE WHITMORE IS THE ONLY ONE .

I PROBABLY COULD NAME .
UHHUH .
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS SO .
YEAH YEAH .
BUT UH .
BUT IT WAS YEAH JUST LOTS OF LITTLE LAKES AND OF COURSE IT WAS YOU KNOW A LITTLE MORE EXPENSIVE TO LIVE ON THE LAKE BUT I JUST THOUGHT THAT WAS GRAND .
AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE DID NT REALLY KNOW THAT THERE WERE ALL THOSE LAKES OUT THERE UNLESS YOU WERE FROM THAT AREA AND KIND OF SPOTTED THEM BUT THERE WAS QUITE A FEW LAKES ALL AROUND THERE .
IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS ALMOST LIKE YOU WERE LIVING ON AN ISLAND .
THERE WAS SO MUCH WATER AROUND WHERE I WAS .
I SAID I WAS NT CLOSE TO DOWNTOWN PONTIAC I WAS WAY OUT TO THE WEST MAYBE FOUR OR FIVE MILES FROM FROM THE CITY LIMITS AND IT WAS REALLY NICE OUT THERE .

YEAH .
YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY WERE FROM ALABAMA WHERE IT NEVER SNOWED .
OH .
AND THEY JUST HAD A GRAND TIME WATCHING THE SNOW AND GETTING OUT THERE AND PLAYING IN IT YOU KNOW ETERNALLY .

UM AND SO YOU JUST HAVE TO TRY AND BE PATIENT AND ANSWER THEM AGAIN OR JUST ANSWER ANOTHER QUESTION .
YEAH .
UH I UH SOME NIGHTS HIS MOTHER CALLS ME AND SAYS CAN YOUR FAMILY AND JUST BRING THE KIDS IN THE FAMILY AND JUST COME OVER AND AND VISIT GRANDMA BECAUSE SHE GETS VERY DISORIENTED .
YEAH HOW OLD IS SHE .
SHE S NINETYTWO .
UH MY SEE MY FATHER IS NINETYTWO AND STILL UH HE AND MOTHER STILL LIVE AT THE HOUSE AND DRIVE AND .
OH I THINK THAT S WONDERFUL .
AND DO THE WHOLE THING BUT YOU KNOW IF SOMETHING WOULD UH WHENEVER SOMETHING HAPPENS TO ONE OF THEM THEN .
WELL .
I DO NT KNOW WHAT I LL DO UP THERE .
UHHUH .
I I JUST KNOW THAT TOO MANY HORROR STORIES ABOUT NURSING HOMES AND SO .
YEAH I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY .
THEY RE IN MISSOURI AND I COULD I I KNOW I KNOW STORIES FOR SURE THAT THEY JUST THEY THEY JUST WELL THEY CA NT TAKE THE PROPER CARE OF THEM .
YEAH .
MOST OF THEM .
UM .
AND UH IT S IT S TRAGIC THAT YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE LIVE SO LONG THAT THEY UH DO NT HAVE A PLA REALLY DO NT HAVE A PLACE TO GO .
YES .
SO .
UH I THINK IT S WONDERFUL THESE THESE PLACES THAT ARE NT NURSING HOMES NECESSARILY BUT THEY CAN GO AND RESIDE THERE LIKE LITTLE APARTMENTS .
RIGHT .
PLACES IN BETWEEN PLACES AND I LIKE THAT IDEA IF THEY CAN HANDLE IT THEMSELVES UM .
YEAH THERE S ONE VERY CLOSE TO WHERE MY PARENTS ARE BUT UH I THINK IT WOULD BE NICE BUT MY DAD S THE TYPE HE WOULD NT WANT TO SPEND THE MONEY ON ANYTHING .
YEAH YEAH .
SO UH I MEAN HE S FROM THAT OLD DEPRESSION ERA AND UH YOU KNOW IT S OH IT S JUST BLISSFULL THAT THEY RE BOTH .
YEAH .
ABLE TO DO EVERYTHING FOR THEMSELVES I WOULD IMAGINE THAT I LL UH IF SOMETHING HAPPENS I LL MOVE ONE OF THEM OR BOT YOU KNOW IN IN WITH ME .
UHHUH .
SO UH .
YEAH .
BUT I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SAID THAT AND THEN FIND OUT HOW TOUGH IT IS AND BUT I THINK YOU D HAVE TO REALLY THEY ALSO WANTED US TO TALK ABOUT YOU D HAVE TO REALLY CHECK ON THE UH .
NURSING HOMES .
ON THIS HOMES BUT I JUST DO NT KNOW HOW MUCH YOU CAN SEE WHEN YOU GO FOR A .
VISIT .
I THINK YOU JUST HAVE TO DROP IN ALL UNEXPECTEDLY A LOT .
UHHUH .
AND SO MANY PEOPLE WHEN THEY PUT PEOPLE IN THE NURSES HOME THEY NEVER SEE THEM .
THEY DO NT GO AND SEE THEM THAT S RIGHT .
THEY NEVER GO TO SEE THEM .
THAT S RIGHT .
I VE TALKED TO MANY UH OWNERS OF PLACES AND SAY THAT NOBODY EVEN MAYBE MAYBE CHRISTMAS .
YOU KNOW UM I I THINK NURSING HOMES ARE ARE UM SOME ARE GOOD .
UHHUH .
I HAVE TO SAY THAT .
RIGHT .
BUT FOR THE MOST PART I TRULY BELIEVE THAT THE PARENTS WOULD BE BETTER IF THEY WERE WITH THE CHILDREN .
OH I DO TOO .
UM .
OR IF I IF THEY COULD BE REAL REAL NEARBY WHERE THEY COULD SEE THEM EVERYDAY OR SO .
RIGHT RIGHT .
UH BECAUSE I KNOW GOVERNOR RICHARDS IS REALLY UPSET ABOUT WHAT SHE S FINDING IN THE NURSING HO HOMES UH REGULATION IN TEXAS SO MAYBE WE LL GET IT IMPROVED .
UHHUH .
SO .
I HOPE SO .
ANYWAY .
YOU KNOW IT S I THINK IT S VERY DIFFICULT IN THE FIRST PLACE TO MAKE THAT CHOICE .
RIGHT .
TO HAVE THEM GO THERE .
OH IT S TOUGH I M SURE .
AND THEN IF YOU FIND OUT THAT THEY ARE NOT HAVING GOOD CARE YOU KNOW I M SURE THAT IT IS JUST .
OH .
YOU KNOW YOU D PULL THEM OUT OF THERE SO FAST .
RIGHT THAT WOULD BE DEVASTATING I M SURE SO .
AND UH AND YET IF YOU DID NT FEEL LIKE YOU COULD BE A GOOD CARETAKER I DO NT UH IT S A VERY VERY HARD DECISION I THINK .
IT IS A TOUGH DECISION AND IT S ONE THAT NEEDS A GREAT DEAL OF THOUGHT .
UHHUH .
AND PRIOR PROBABLY .
I THINK THAT S RIGHT .
YEAH .
AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU RE NOT A PERSON THAT IS LIKE A MEDICAL PERSON MAYBE OR SOMETHING THAT THE PERSON NEEDS MEDICAL TREATMENT .
RIGHT .
NOW I KNOW A FRIEND OF MINE WHO HAD A FATHER UH SHE BROUGHT TO HER HOME UH TO LIVE THERE BUT HE NEEDED THE MEDICAL TREATMENT AND SHE HAD A NURSING PERSON COME IN LIKE THREE TIMES A WEEK TO TO HELP HIM OUT .
UHHUH .
AND THAT MIGHT BE A PARTIAL SOLUTION .
RIGHT .
OR SOMETHING BUT UM I PERSONALLY AM FOR THE TRYING IT AT HOME CARETAKER PART BEFORE I THINK I D EVER .
I WOULD HOPE WE COULD DO THAT .
YEAH .

SO .
DO YOU WORK FOR TEXAS INSTRUMENTS .

KIND OF MAKES IT EASY YOU KNOW TO DO A LITTLE .
SOMETHING FOR IT .
SURE BECAUSE WE UH WE VE TALKED TO A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM TEXAS IT SEEMS AND WE THOUGHT WELL MAYBE THEY WORK FROM FOR DALLAS .
UH ADVICE ON SON OR DAUGHTER GOING TO COLLEGE .
RIGHT .
UH THAT S ADVICE THAT I WILL NEED IN TIME FUTURE .
UHHUH .
FOR MY CHILDREN RATHER THAN ONE THAT I HAVE UH PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH .
UH I SUPPOSE I WOULD ASK WHAT .
THE CHILD WANTS TO DO IN LIFE AND WHAT .
THE CHILD HOPES TO TO GET OUT OF COLLEGE .
UHHUH .
AND WHAT SORT OF COLLEGE WOULD BEST MEET MEET THOSE NEEDS .
RIGHT UH LET S SEE WHEN I WHEN I WENT AWAY TO SCHOOL I M TRYING TO THINK MY CRITERIA .
I GUESS WHEN YOU RE WHEN YOU RE EIGHTEEN OR SO UH IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF IT WAS A COED COLLEGE .
THAT WAS A A STRICT REQUIREMENT FOR ME .
UH AGAIN WHAT UH HOW SERIOUS A PERSON IS ACCORDING TO UH UH YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT .
THEY WANT TO GET OUT OF SCHOOL AND UH I GUESS THEY D HAVE TO CONSIDER HOW EXPENSIVE THE COLLEGE IS AND HOW CLOSE TO HOME IF THEY COULD HANDLE BEING AWAY FOR REAL LONG PERIODS OF TIME OR IF THEY NEED TO BE SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY CAN DRIVE HOME WHEN THEY NEEDED TO GET HOME .
UH LET S SEE UH NOW WHAT WAS THE QUESTION WHAT WHAT S THE CRITERIA FOR PICKING A COLLEGE .
WHAT ADVICE .
WHAT ADVICE .
WOULD YOU GIVE .
OH OKAY UH .
I GUESS ONE .
CLEARCUT PIECE OF ADVICE IS BY ALL MEANS VISIT THE COLLEGE CAMPUS .
YES .
UH STAY IN A DORMITORY IF YOU CAN .
GO TO CLASSES TALK TO FACULTY MEMBERS AND STUDENTS .
YES AND ALSO UH DEPENDING ON HOW UH UH ADJUSTABLE YOUR CHILD WOULD BE OR OR FLEXIBLE I GUESS IT WOULD BE UH IF IF THEY CHOSE A COLLEGE IN A DIFFERENT PART OF THE COUNTRY THAT MAYBE THE THEY WERE UNUSED TO THEIR THAT THE WAY .
THEY RUN THINGS I MEAN THE THE NORTHERN COLLEGES ARE VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE SOUTHERN COLLEGES I THINK .
THE PEOPLE ARE DIFFERENT AND UH YOU HAVE TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE AND MORE WILLING TO UH UH ADJUST TO OTHER PEOPLE S MANNERISMS AND CUSTOMS OR WAYS OF DOING THINGS .
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO BE A FLEXIBLE PERSON TO BE ABLE TO GO ALL THE WAY ACROSS COUNTRY TO SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT .
YOU RE USED TO .
UH .
YES I M THINKING .
YOU THINK SO .
WHAT WHAT PROBLEMS MY CHILDREN MIGHT HAVE IN THAT UH BUT I AGREE WITH YOU .
UH LET S SEE WHAT ELSE .
UH WELL CLIMATE WOULD BE YOU KNOW YOU D HAVE TO .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW IS SOMEWHAT IF UH IF IT S SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN THE ONE .
THEY RE USED TO I GUESS UH IF THEY RE USED TO THE NORTHERN WEATHER THEN THE SOUTHERN WEATHER .
THEY MIGHT KIND OF FEEL LIKE THEY NEED TO GO OUT AND PLAY ALL THE TIME NOT BE IN STUDYING .
IF YOU RE IN FLORIDA OR CALIFORNIA .
UH .
I I D ALSO ADVISE THEM THAT UH IF MOM AND DAD PAID FOR THEIR COLLEGE THAT UH IF THEY DECIDED TO DROP A COURSE OR DECIDED THAT THEY NEED ANOTHER YEAR THEN THEY D HAVE TO GET A LOAN TO CONTINUE .
YEAH .
WELL COURSE MUMBLEX IT IT IS A BIG FACTOR IN HAVING AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW MUCH PARENTS WILL PAY AND HOW MUCH HAS TO COME FROM OTHER SOURCES AND YOU RE WILLINGNESS ONE TO TO WORK DURING THE SUMMER OR OR .
THAT S RIGHT .
PART TIME .
THERE S .
AND TWO UH TO TO TAKE OUT LOANS TO ASSUME UH DEBT AFTER COLLEGE .
THE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THAT .
AND UH UH UH THEY COULD THEY COULD WORK AND EARN MONEY TOWARDS COLLEGE .
ALSO IF THEY STAY WITHIN THEIR STATE YOU GET A LOT .
MORE FINANCIAL AID OR IT S A LOT CHEAPER IF YOU STAY WITHIN YOUR STATE .
YES .
THAN IF YOU GO OUT OF STATE TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL UH AND LIKE I SAID IF THEY WAS WILLING TO WORK UH IN THE SUMMERS AND ALSO MAYBE THEN THE PARENTS COULD PAY A THIRD AND THEN MAYBE THEY COULD TAKE OUT A LOAN FOR A THIRD DEPENDING ON HOW EXPENSIVE .
IT IS .
BY THE TIME I HAVE AN ELEVEN YEAR OLD IS MY OLDEST SO IT S NOT TOO FAR AWAY BUT IT S .
MINE IS TWELVE .
OH OKAY .
BUT IT S GETTING THERE I MEAN WE STILL HAVE DEFINITELY CAN PUT AWAY THE MONEY FOR COLLEGE NOW .
UH I WOULD ADVISE THAT THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE A CAR AT COLLEGE .
THEY WOULD .
THAT S MY GUT FEELING TOO .
I MY SON IS CERTAINLY NOT PERSUADED OF THAT .
HELLO .
YES I M HERE .
OH YEAH UH YES I DID NT HAVE A CAR IN COLLEGE .
I .
NO .
THINK IT S MORE AN IN A BURDEN TO TO PROVIDE FOR .
I THINK SO TOO .
I THINK I THINK BECAUSE MOST KIDS DO NT HAVE A CAR AT COLLEGE THE ONES .
THAT DO GET TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF AND YOU KNOW THERE IS JUST I THINK IT S JUST TROUBLE WAITING TO HAPPEN .
SO I WOULD ADVISE THEY DID NT THEY DID NT TAKE A CAR AND UH .
IS IT .
THEY DID NT TAKE A TELEVISION AND THEY DID NT TAKE A REFRIGERATOR .
MAYBE THAT .
UH I DID NT DO ANY OF THOSE THOUGH I .
NO I I .
FEEL LESS STRONGLY ABOUT THE T V S AND REFRIGERATORS .
YEAH WE DID NT HAVE .
WONDERING HOW YOU KEEP UP ON THE NEWS .
PRIMARILY WITH OUR LOCAL NEWSPAPER AND T V .
UHHUH .
I LISTEN TO THE RADIO BUT NOT UM NOT LIKE I DID WHEN I WAS WORKING I AM RECENTLY RETIRED TO THAT MEANS I HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO WATCH THE NEWS ON T V HOW DO YOU GAIN YOUR NEWS .
I GUESS THE I GET THE WASHINGTON POST .
OKAY .
AND THAT IS A PRETTY BIG NEWSPAPER AND I THINK THAT S ALMOST EXCLUSIVE ME LY MY FIRST OF THE NEWS THOUGH I HAVE THE RADIO ON WHEN I GO TO WORK I DO NT THINK THE NEWS USUALLY HITS BECAUSE I M NOT GOING RIGHT ON THE HOUR .
OH I SEE .
YOU KNOW .
WELL THAT S THAT IS ONE OF THE HANDICAPS WITH BOTH T V AND AND RADIO IF YOU RE NOT AVAILABLE ON THE HOUR OR HALF HOUR THEN YOU LOSE OUT ON AN AWFUL LOT WELL WHAT IS YOUR NEWSPAPER THAT IS THE WASHINGTON POST .
RIGHT .
IS THAT CORRECT I HAVE READ THAT WHEN WE WERE IN THAT AREA AND IT IS A SPLENDID NEWSPAPER .
UHHUH .
SO WHAT MORE DO WE NEED TO DISCUSS .
TONIGHT THAT SEEMS LIKE A VERY SHORT ONE .
RIGHT I THINK THAT YOU KNOW WE WE VE RESOLVED THE ISSUE AND THAT S WHAT WE WERE ASKED TO DO .
WELL I CAN DISCUSS A LOT OF THE NEWS THAT WE HAVE BUT UH I FEEL THAT THAT S NOT PART OF OUR .
RIGHT .
RESPONSIBILITY .
RIGHT .
SO THANK YOU FOR CALLING .
OH OKAY WELL THANKS FOR DISCUSSING IT .
ALL RIGHT .
BYEBYE .
GOODBYE .
OKAY SO NOW WHAT ARE YOUR OPINIONS ON RECYCLING .
WELL I DEFINITELY THINK THAT WE NEED TO START RECYCLING .
I THINK IT HAS GOT TO BE AN INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY UNTIL I THINK IF WE WAIT UH WHICH IS HAPPENING UNTIL SOMEBODY SAYS WE HAVE TO DO IT .
YEAH .
IT IS GOING TO BE TO LATE .
I HAVE HEARD REPORTS AROUND HERE THAT THE LANDFILLS WILL BE FULL BY THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND .
YEAH I HAVE HEARD THAT TOO .
AND THAT IS NOT TOO FAR AWAY BUT I DO NT KNOW HOW IT IS THERE .
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT HERE EVEN IF YOU CARE LIKE I DO TO DO MUCH .
I TAKE MY PAPER I CAN TAKE PLASTIC AND PAPER BAGS BACK TO THE GROCERY STORE .
UHHUH .
AND I CAN TAKE PLASTIC LIKE MILK CARTONS OR IF THEY HAVE WATER IN THEM AND THERE ARE SOME FIRE STATIONS I CAN TAKE NEWSPAPERS TO AND THAT IS VERY INCONVENIENT CAUSE .
I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL I HAVE ENOUGH OF THEM TO MAKE THE TRIP WORTHWHILE .
WELL SEE I STARTED SAVING NEWSPAPERS AND I WOULD TAKE A TON OF THEM .
UHHUH .
AND UH THAT S I CA NT REMEMBER WHERE I WENT TO TAKE THEM BUT THEY WOULD NT TAKE THEM .
YEAH .
IT IS REAL HARD TO FIND A SPOT AND THEN I DO NT KNOW IF YOU NOTE EVEN DOING THAT THE AMOUNT OF TRASH .
WE THROW AWAY IS INCREDIBLE BOTTLES .
OH I KNOW .
GLASS .
THAT CAN NOT BE IT COULD BE RECYCLED BUT THERE IS NO PLACE TO .
THERE IS NO REALLY RECYCLING FACILITIES .
NO .
WE HAVE A PILOT PROGRAM IN ARLINGTON GOING ON I THINK IN THE NORTH PART OF THE CITY WHERE THEY ARE HAVE PEOPLE PEOPLE SEPARATE THE GARBAGE AS THE TRASH AS THEY PUT IT OUT .
I THINK THAT IS A GOOD IDEA .
AND I THINK THAT IS WHAT .
IT IS GOING TO HAVE TO COME TO .
WHERE WE ARE JUST FORCED TO .
BESIDES WELL LIKE A LAW OR WHATEVER .
AN THAT S HOW IT IS .
YEAH .
IN NEW YORK IS NT IT .
I THINK SO JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW .
AND YOU GET TICKETED IF YOU DO NT DO IT RIGHT .
RIGHT UHHUH .
AND I THINK IT IS GOING TO COME TO THAT BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE WILL JUST NOT GO TO THE IT S IT .
S TROUBLE FOR ME TO DO WHAT .
I DO .
YEAH .
I MEAN I AM WILLING TO DO IT BUT .
PLUS YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PLACE TO STORE ALL OF IT .
YEAH .
AND SEE I LIVE IN AN APARTMENT .
YEAH .
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT .
LIKE OUR GARAGE IS ALWAYS FULL OF SACKS OF NEWSPAPERS AND SO I DO NT KNOW .
I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE PLACES AND ALSO I HAVE A REAL STRONG OPINION .
IN IOWA THE STATE .
I AM FROM .
UHHUH .
UH I BELIEVE IT HAS GONE UP TO A DOLLAR NOW .
EVERY TIME .
YOU BUY A CONTAINER NO MATTER .
WHAT .
IT IS WHETHER IT IS GLASS WHETHER IT S A BEER CAN OR A FIFTH OF WHISKEY OR A POP OR WHATEVER YOU PAY TEN CENTS FOR IT .
YEAH .
AND THEN YOU TAKE IT BACK TO THE STORE AND YOU GET IT BACK .
UH SO THAT WAY .
IT .
KIND OF FORCES .
YOU TO RECYCLE .
YOU ARE FORCED TO .
AND UH YOU ALSO DO NT SEE THE LITTER THERE .
PEOPLE JUST .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
IT MAKES IT WORTHWHILE TO TAKE IT BACK AND I VE JUST STARTED DRINKING A NEW WATER CALLED CLEARLY CANADIAN I DO NT KNOW IF YOU VE TRIED IT .
YEAH I HAVE SEEN THEM .
AND THEY HAVE ON THE BA IT S FIVE CENTS THAT THEY PAY FIVE CENTS .
UHHUH .
AND IT EVEN SHOWS THE STATES .
THAT .
THAT TAKE THEM BACK .
YEAH .
WELL ON SOME OF THEM ARE FIVE SOME ARE TEN CENTS .
I AM LOOKING AT IT RIGHT NOW .
IS TEXAS ONE OF THEM .
TEXAS IS NOT ONE OF THEM SEE .
SO I HAVE TO THROW THEM AWAY CAUSE THERE IS NO PLACE TO TAKE GLASS .
YEAH .
NO I DO NT THINK THAT THERE IS ENOUGH BEING DONE .
NOW I WORK AT J C PENNY AT THEIR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS .
UHHUH .
AND WE HAVE A PAPER RECYCLING PROGRAM THAT UH IS COMPANY WIDE AND I DO THE RECYCLING FOR THAT .
DO THEY SAVE LIKE THE PAPER .
THEY .
THEY USE AT THE OFFICE PAPER .
YEAH .
GOOD .
BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF WASTE .
THERE IS NT THERE .
YEAH .
AND I KNOW THERE IS A LOT OF COMPUTER PAPER .
RIGHT .
THAT YOU CA NT USE .
RIGHT .
BUT UH WE USE TO HAVE UH I MEAN I DO NT EVEN REMEMBER HOW MUCH MONEY THAT THEY VE UH I MEAN THE MONEY THAT THEY VE MADE FROM THE RECYCLING PROGRAM .
THEY HAVE DONATED IT TO CHARITIES .
RIGHT .
I MEAN .
YEAH .
THEY HAVE MADE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF MONEY FROM IT .
SOMETHING ELSE I THINK WE DO CAN DO IS SUPPORT COMPANIES .
THAT ENCOURAGE LIKE I HAVE DECIDED DOWNY FABRIC SOFTENER NOW HAS WHERE YOU CAN BUY A LITTLE CARTON .
YEAH .
YOU ADD WA WELL I IMAGE EVERYBODY ELSE WILL START DOING THAT SOONER OR LATER BUT I AM GOING TO STICK WITH DOWNEY BECAUSE THEY WERE FIRST .
YEAH .
AND I WANT THEM TO HAVE MY BUSINESS .
AND I THINK PACKAGING COULD BE DONE MUCH BETTER .
THERE IS SO MUCH PLASTIC .
BUT .
WELL I KNOW YOU SEE SOME OF THE STUFF AND THEN WHEN THEY COME OUT WITH THE NEW THINGS YOU ARE LIKE WELL WHY DID NT YOU THINK OF THAT BEFORE .
YEAH .
YEAH .
AND I THINK THAT IT S JUST PEOPLE HAVE GOT TO BE AWARE .
UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE .
THAT JUST DO NT CARE AND THEY DO NT WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
AND UH I JUST LOOK AT IT I DO NT WANT MY GRANDCHILDREN LOOKING AT ME AND SAYING WHY DID NT YOU DO SOMETHING .
YOU KNOW I WANT TO FEEL LIKE I AT LEAST TRIED .
YEAH .
AND I DO NT KNOW .
IT JUST MAY OVERWHELM US HERE WHEN WE RUN OUT OF PLACES TO PUT IT .
THEN WE WILL BE FORCED TO .
IT MAY BE TOO LATE .
DO THEY NOT EVER I MEAN I DO NT KNOW THAT MUCH .
DO THEY NOT EVER BURN TRASH OR ANYTHING LIKE .
VERY LITTLE .
THAT S ANOTHER THING THAT SEE THERE WERE NO .
THEN THAT S POLLUTION .
I KNOW AMWAY .
I USE A COUPLE OF THINGS FROM AMWAY THAT IT SAYS THIS IS BURNABLE MATERIAL .
WELL THAT DOES NT DO ME ANY GOOD BECAUSE I DO NT HAVE ANY PLACE TO BURN IT .
YEAH I KNOW .
I GUESS YOU RUN INTO THE POLLUTION FACTOR .
YEAH .
AND THEN JUST LIKE THE GLASS BOTTLES THAT IT SAYS ON THE BOTTLE .
I CAN GET TEN CENTS BUT NOT IN TEXAS .
YEAH .
AND THERE IS NO PLACE .
I CAN TAKE GLASS TO .
UH .
SO I STILL THROW AWAY A LOT OF GLASS .
IT IS REALLY SAD .
YEAH .
AND THEN THE PACKAGING THING REALLY GRIPS ME .

I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE .
OH UHHUH .

I GET UH THE HOME JOURNAL AND THE UH COMPUTER BOOK IS BECAUSE MOTHER GOT A SUBSCRIPTION FOR IT AND SENT IT TO ME .

RIGHT .
THEY ALL TAKE THE EXACT SAME STARTER THEY LL INTERCHANGE COMPLETELY I MEAN COMPLETELY ONE STARTER WILL FIT ALL OF THEM SO THEY VE GOT A WHOLE LOT OF TORQUE BUT TO DO THAT THEY DID IT USE AN UNDERDRIVE SYSTEM BUT THEY GEARED IT DOWN SO THE MOTOR SPINS REALLY FAST .

USUALLY WHAT GOES IS THE BUSHINGS .
RIGHT .
YOU TAKE A LITTLE TIME REPLACE THE BUSHINGS YOU STILL GOT A PERFECTLY GOOD STARTER BUT UH MOST PLACES DO NT PUT DO NT REBUILD THEM WITH WITH G WITH GOOD ENOUGH BUSHINGS .

YEAH THERE S THERE S A LOT OF A LOT OF LITTLE THINGS .
THAT HAVE COME UP .
I KNOW MAYBE SOME OF THE BIG THINGS .
THAT UH UH CONCENTRATED FOODS FOR ONE MAYBE I DON .
THAT S RIGHT .
THAT S RIGHT .
UH I DO NT KNOW IT S ALSO JUST I VE I VE OFTEN PICTURED UH IN MY MIND YOU KNOW WHAT .
IT WOULD BE LIKE TO JUST WHAT WOULD YOU FIND IF YOU JUST KEPT ON GOING KEPT ON GOING .
UHHUH .
THAT S TRUE .
UH I GUESS OUR MINDS ARE SO UH UH WHAT IS IT .
UH FINITE .
UHHUH .
WHEN WE TRY AND PICTURE THE UNIVERSE AS AN INFINITE OBJECT .
UHHUH .
AND IT S HARD TO TO SEE YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
I ALWAYS THOUGHT WELL WHAT DO YOU DO HIT A BRICK WALL EVENTUALLY .
IT S HARD TO CONSIDER THAT SOMETHING COULD GO ON INDEFINITELY .
YEAH THAT THAT IS UH THAT IS SOMETHING .
THAT WOULD BE HARD TO THINK ABOUT .
I AGREE .
YOU KNOW LIKE YOU SAY WE RE USED TO FINITE THINGS AND SOMETHING .
THAT IS INFINITE AND JUST INCOMPREHENSIBLE .
YEAH .
BUT .
BUT UH YEAH I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM UH DO MORE IN THAT AREA TO MAKE SPACE TRAVEL MORE UH SOMETHING THAT THE ORDINARY PERSON CAN UH EN ENJOY .
YEAH .
I KNOW IT S I THINK IT S IN PEOPLE S NATURE TO BE THE FIRST TO DO SOMETHING .
UHHUH .
AND I I D LOVE TO BE THE FIRST ONE TO STEP ON A PLANET OR SOME LIKE YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
YEAH ME TOO .
I WOULD NT EVEN MIND BEING NOT SO MUCH BEING FIRST BUT JUST UH GET OUT THERE AND AND JUST EXPLORE .
YEAH .
I THINK UH IT S IN EVERYONE .
S NATURE TO SOME DEGREE TO WANT TO GET OUT AND EXPLORE SOMETHING .
THEY HAVE NT .
HUH .
OR EXPERIENCE SOMETHING YOU KNOW INDIFFERENT .
I THINK THAT S .
WHAT MADE US UH PROGRESS TO THE STATE .
WE ARE IS OUR CURIOSITY .
OH SURE .
SURE .
OF COURSE .
THAT S TRUE .
THERE MUST BE SOME BETTER SO BETTER WAY OF DOING THIS .
A BETTER PLACE TO BE OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW IT S .
UHHUH .
SO YOU YOU ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING BETTER .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
I KNOW AT WORK UH PEOPLE ALWAYS COMPLAIN TO ME .
I WELL YOU ARE ALWAYS WHINING AND .
IT S I M ALWAYS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING BETTER .
UH .
YEAH .
THERE S A BETTER WAY OF DOING IT THAN WHAT .
WE ARE DOING IT .
THAT S RIGHT .
THAT S RIGHT .
AND IF YOU ARE JUST CONTENT WITH BEING YOU KNOW WITH THE WAY THINGS ARE THEN YOU KNOW THEN YOU MUST LEAD LEAD A PRETTY DULL LIFE .
YEAH .
BECAUSE IF YO .
WELL THEY ARE ALWAYS FINDING EASIER WAYS AND YOU KNOW JUST BECAUSE THEY DO NT TALK ABOUT IT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
UHHUH .
AND THEY ARE DOING IT UN YOU KNOW UNCONSCIOUSLY .
YEAH I GUESS UH YOU DO NT REALLY THINK ABOUT IT TOO MUCH .
I GUESS YOU ARE ALWAYS FINDING NEWER WAYS AND BETTER WAYS OF DOING STUFF BUT YO IT IT S IN A SUBCONSCIOUS YOU KNOW THING .
YOU KNOW SOMEWHERE THEY CAN SIT DOWN AND WRITE DOWN WHAT YOU KNOW THINGS THAT YOU VE IMPROVED UPON YOU PROBABLY WOULD NT HAVE A PRETTY GOOD LIST .
UHHUH .
BUT YOU JUST DO NT THINK ABOUT THEM .
RIGHT .
AND THAT S TRUE .
I THINK UH YOU KNOW WE VE GOTTEN DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AT WORK YOU KNOW TO TO UH MAKE IT VISIBLE TO MANAGEMENT THAT WE ARE DOING THINGS BETTER .
OKAY THE QUESTION WAS UM WHAT WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF YOUTH UH SPENDING A YEAR OR TWO IN IN PUBLIC SERVICE .
I THINK IT WOULD BE A GREAT IDEA I M NOT SURE ABOUT REQUIRING IT YOU KNOW OF PEOPLE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE GOING YOU KNOW FEELING RESENTFUL I DO NT KNOW BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE A GREAT IDEA .
YEAH .
SEEMS LIKE THERE S SO MANY KIDS THAT DO NT HAVE ANY SINCE OF YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WANT TO BE OR DO OR YOU KNOW THEY COULD LEARN SOMETHING AND MAYBE HELP OTHER PEOPLE AT THE SAME TIME AND WE SURE OUR COUNTRY ALL COUNTRIES SURE NEED HELP SO .
HUHUH WOULD UH WOULD YOU BE MORE IN FAVOR OF UH YOU KNOW LIKE A LOCAL UH MY ONLY EXPERIENCE WITH IT I WAS IN CENTRAL AMERICA FOR A WHILE .
HUHUH .
AND UH IN SAN SALVADOR IN EL SALVADOR .
HUHUH .
FOR INSTANCE EVERYBODY HAD WHAT THEY CALLED THERE SOCIAL YEAR .
OH REALLY .
THAT THEY HAD TO PUT IN AND BASICALLY IT WAS A UH REPAYMENT FOR FOR UH HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION .
HUHUH .
AND MOST OF THEM JOINED THE RED CROSS AND IT WAS DONE INTERNALLY I JUST THERE WAS VERY LITTLE EXTERNAL I THINK POSSIBLY WHAT UH THEY RE THINKING ABOUT HERE MORE EXTERNAL PEACE CORPS .
YEAH .
TYPE THINGS WHERE WE RE SENDING PEOPLE OFF SHORE .
WELL I THINK THAT WOULD BE REAL INTERESTING FOR PEOPLE TO DO BUT I GUESS MY CONCERN ABOUT THAT WOULD BE THE COST INVOLVED TRYING TO TRAIN PEOPLE IN A NEW LANGUAGE AND SHIP THEM YOU KNOW TO OTHER COUNTRIES .
HUHUH .
AND BUT I DO NT KNOW IF YOU DID IT INTERNALLY AND IT WAS JUST PEOPLE IN YOUR OWN COUNTRY THEN MAYBE COUNTRIES THAT ARE SO POOR THAT THEY WOULD NT BE ABLE TO REALLY YOU KNOW SEND CHILDREN TO DO THAT .
YEAH .
I DID NT KNOW .
I DO NT I DO NT KNOW HOW THE PEACE CORPS WORKS I GUESS I WAS OF AGE WHEN THE PEACE CORPS CAME IN .
YEAH I WAS TOO .
AND ALL THAT .
I THOUGHT SERIOUSLY ABOUT JOINING AT THAT TIME I THOUGHT IT WAS A FANTASTIC IDEA .
DID YOU EVER GET ANY INFORMATION ON IT LIKE .
I SENT OFF FOR STUFF ON IT BUT I DO NT REMEMBER THAT MUCH ABOUT IT I KNOW THAT THEY TRAINED YOU IN THE LANGUAGE AND UM .
THAT S WHAT I WAS WONDERING ABOUT WAS WHETHER THEY ACTUALLY .
YOU ACTUALLY GOT PAID TOO WHILE IN THE PEACE CORPS IT WAS NT MUCH .
YEAH .
BUT I GUESS THEY YOU COULD PUT SOME MONEY ASIDE WHILE YOU WERE THERE YOUR EXPENSES AND .
WAS NT JIMMY CARTER S MAMA THAT WAS IN THE PEACE CORPS .
YEAH I THINK SO YEAH YEAH .
BUT IT MIGHT BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU TOOK KIDS AT A AND THEN TOOK THEN TO ANOTHER COUNTRY INSTEAD OF HAVING BEING EXPOSED TO ALL THE DRUGS AND VIOLENCE AND SEX AND EVERYTHING HERE AND TAKE THEM TO SOME OTHER COUNTRY THAT HAD DIFFERENT MORAL VALUES LIKE SAUDI ARABIA WHERE THEY COULD NT DRINK .
WHERE THEY COULD NT DO THAT YEAH YOU MIGHT END UP WITH A REVOLUTION I DO NT KNOW WHICH END THOUGH .
REALLY .
YEAH YEAH THAT S THAT S BEEN INTERESTING THOUGH THE KIDS THAT HAVE BEEN OVER YOU KNOW COMING BACK RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
YOU WONDER IF BEING EXPOSED TO THAT FOR A WHILE WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THEM WOULD ACTUALLY SAY HEY THAT S NOT A BAD WAY TO DO IT BECAUSE FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND FROM SOME OF THE GUYS I KNOW YOU KNOW CRIME UH IS PUNISHABLE JUST ALMOST UH INSTANTLY AND .
PUBLIC HANGING .
PUBLIC YEAH PUBLIC HANGING AND THIS SORT OF THING YOU KNOW SO YOU DO NT HAVE JUST A WHOLE LOT OF .
YEAH .
WHAT WE CONSIDER STREET CRIMES .
YEAH I VE HEARD THAT LIKE IN CHINA AND STUFF THERE IS VIRTUALLY NO SUCH THING AS RAPE BECAUSE IF YOU RAPE SOMEBODY YOU D BE MURDERED YOU KNOW ON THE YOU KNOW STREET SO .
YEAH WELL I GUESS THAT S UH THE PRICE OF FREEDOM I GUESS IS A LITTLE ANYWAY THE UH UH THE THE PUBLIC SERVICE THING AGAIN I I I GUESS IN MY OWN HAVING HAD THE WHOLE THREE OR FOUR MINUTES TO YOU KNOW GIVE IT A GREAT DEAL OF THOUGHT YOU KNOW .
UM I I THINK I AGREE WITH YOU ONE HUNDRED PERCENT ABOUT IT BEING SOME SORT OF VOLUNTARY BUT WHEN YOU DO THAT THEN IT BECOMES ALMOST UH A MUMBLEX OR IT CAN BE .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW THERE HAVE PEOPLE WILL KIND OF SET UP THEIR OWN LITTLE CLUB .
YEAH THAT S TRUE .
AND UH BUT IF YOU KNOW .
PEOPLE THAT MIGHT BENEFIT MOST FROM IT MIGHT NOT GO IN THAT SITUATION YOU KNOW LIKE PEOPLE THAT REALLY ARE TRAPPED IN A GHETTO OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
YEAH .
MIGHT NOT GO IF IT WAS VOLUNTARY BUT I DO NT KNOW HOW THEY D ENFORCE IT IF IT WAS .
YEAH WELL IF THEY WENT AWOL WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO .
YEAH .
SHOOT THEM .
PUT THEM IN JAIL .
I DO NT KNOW SEND THEM OVER TO IRAQ .
YEAH RIGHT .
HAVE A VACATION IN IRAQ FOR A YEAR .
I KNOW MY DAD ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT UH HE WAS IN C C C DURING UH .
YEAH .
AND HE WAS UH A ROCK RIB IOWA TYPE REPUBLICAN AND THE ONLY GOOD THING HE COULD EVER SAY ABOUT UH THE WHOLE ROOSEVELT ADMINISTRATION WAS UH CIVILIAN CONSERVATION CORPS .
HUHUH .
BECAUSE HE WAS IN IT HE THOUGHT THAT WAS GREAT .
YEAH .
THE REST OF IT WAS ALL HOG WASH BUT THAT WAS GREAT .
WELL IT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD DEVELOP PRIDE YOU KNOW IN PEOPLE IF IF IT S IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY IT WOULD CERTAINLY HELP THEM TO APPRECIATE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE HERE AND DEVELOP SOME PRIDE IN THEM IF IT WAS HANDLED THAT WAY I I IT WOULD TAKE QUITE A FEW PEOPLE I THINK IT MIGHT BUILD JOBS FOR PEOPLE YOU KNOW THAT WERE ADMINISTRATING AND RUNNING AND TRAINING AND COORDINATING AND ALL THAT SO MAYBE THAT PART OF IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TOO .
YEAH .
I DO NT KNOW .
YEAH THE ONLY .
LIKE TO HAVE A VOLUNTEER COME HERE AND RAKE LEAVES AND MOW THE GRASS AND .
WELL YOU KNOW THAT BRINGS UP THE INTERESTING SUBJECT TOO YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE WHO WHO WHO WOULD DETERMINE WHAT THESE PEOPLE DO .
YEAH YEAH .
YOU KNOW IF UH YOU KNOW IF IT S RUN BY THE INDIVIDUAL STATE YOU KNOW LIKE C C C WAS RUN BY THE ARMY AND IN EFFECT .
HUHUH .
AND THE ONLY OPPOSITION TO IT REALLY WAS THAT IT WAS YOU KNOW STARTING SOME SORT OF A MILITARY ELITIST TYPE YOU KNOW SPECIAL CORPS OF CADRE OF PEOPLE AND THAT SORT OF THING .
HUHUH .
AND UH WHEN THE POLITICS GET REAL CONFUSING .
YEAH REALLY THERE COULD BE UM SOME SCANDALS INVOLVED IF YOU KNOW IT WAS NT PEOPLE THAT WERE REALLY FAIR AND LE .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW IN A LEGAL WAY OR SOMETHING THEY COULD SEND ALL THE PEOPLE OVER TO UH YOU KNOW ONE PARTICULAR PART OF TOWN OR ONE PARTICULAR PROJECT THAT SOMEBODY HAD PAID SOMEBODY TO YOU KNOW GET SUPPORTED OR .
YEAH WELL .
MUMBLEX .
WE VE GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE YOU KNOW IF IF WELL IF THE RACIAL MAKE UP OF THE GROUP WAS SUCH AND SUCH YOU KNOW THEY D HAVE TO DO THAT PERCENTAGE OF WORK AND WHAT IS PERCEIVED TO BE THAT PART OF TOWN AND YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
THAT KIND OF THING .
THAT COULD BE A COMPLICATED TOO COULD NT IT .
OH YEAH .
YEAH .
SUPPOSE UH WELL YOU KNOW THEY HAD A GROUP WHO WERE CONSTRUCTION ORIENTED AND THEY WENT AND THEY THEY BUILT UH CA NT THINK OF A GOOD EXAMPLE A SWIMMING POOL OR ANYTHING YOU KNOW AND ONE YOU CAN YOU CAN ONLY BUILD IT IN ONE PLACE YOU KNOW AND KNOW MATTER WHERE YOU BUILD IT SOMEBODY ELSE IS GOING TO SCREAM WELL YOU DID NT BUILD ONE OVER HERE .
YEAH THAT S TRUE UNFAIR OR SOMETHING YEAH .
YEAH I THINK UH OH BOY .
IT S ONE OF THOSE THINGS ON THE SURFACE YOU KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE A GREAT IDEA IT S LIKE A JOKE I HEARD ONCE ABOUT UH ELEPHANT FOOT SOUP YOU KNOW IT S EASY TO DO ONCE YOU FIND A ELEPHANT FOOT .
IT S UH THE LOGISTICS OF THE THING THAT UH .
YEAH REALLY .
GETS YOU GOING .
YEAH WELL IT SEEMS LIKE THERE S THERE S A LOT YOU DO NT HEAR MUCH ON THE NEWS ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE REALLY YOU KNOW WANTING TO DO ANYTHING GOOD OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT YOU KNOW I M SURE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT REALLY DO HAVE GOOD HEARTS AND ARE WILLING TO HELP AND SERVE AND THAT KIND OF THING I JUST I SAW ON THE NEWS THE OTHER NIGHT THAT THE UH THE LITTLE GIRL THAT USED TO BE THE LITTLEST GIRL ON THE COSBY SHOW KISHA KNIGHT PULLMAN WAS STARTING A I GUESS NOW SHE S PRACTICALLY A TEENAGER .

YEAH IT S IT S IT S JUST THE YOU KNOW HERE YOU ARE TO THE LOGISTICS OF THE THING AGAIN YOU KNOW .

YEAH .
YEAH .
YOU HAVE TO WHAT I FOUND FROM MY EXPERIENCE IS YOU HAVE TO BUDGET TIME FOR YOURSELF .
HUHUH .
AND YOU CAN USE WHAT EVER RATIONALE YOU WANT BUT BASICALLY THE HEALTHIER YOU STAY THE LONGER YOU LL LIVE .

YEAH .
IT S KIND OF A TIP .
OH I VE DONE A LOT OF STUDY OVER THE YEARS AND I FOUND THAT PROBABLY ONE OF THE WORST THINGS THAT ANYBODY CAN INGEST IS CHLORINATED WATER .

MUMBLEX .
WE STARTED HAVING THE HEARTS ATTACKS AND UH DR PRICE WROTE A BOOK CORONARY CHOLESTEROL AND CHLORINE YOU CAN USUALLY FIND IT IN A HEALTH FOOD STORE .

HUHUH .
AND THEY WERE NT DROPPING DEAD OF HEART ATTACKS .
THAT S REALLY INTERESTING .
YEAH HE DID SOME EXPERIMENTS ON CHICKENS WHOSE ARTERIES ARE VERY SIMILAR TO OURS .
HUHUH .
AND UH PROVED THAT INGESTION OF CHLORINE CAUSES ARTERIOSCLEROSIS WHICH IS THE .
YEAH .
CLOGGING OF THE ARTERIES AND UH YOU KNOW HE S THERE S BEEN A LOT OF REPORTS SINCE THEN THIS WHOLE THING ABOUT FIRST IT WAS STRESS THEN IT WENT TO CHOLESTEROL AND NOW THEY RE SAYING WHAT S CHOLESTEROL WELL THERE S GOOD CHOLESTEROL AND THERE S BAD CHOLESTEROL .
HUHUH .
YOU KNOW IT S AMAZING WHAT HE POINTS OUT IN THAT BOOK AND IN FACT HE EVERYONE THERE WAS A TOXICOLOGIST FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY WHO DID WORK BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTYSIX WHO WROTE A LETTER TO DR PRICE IN NINETEEN EIGHTYSEVEN AND IN THIS LETTER HE PRAISED DR PRICE FOR THE WORK HE DID BACK IN THE SIXTIES ON THIS AND SAID THAT E P A HAD BEEN DOING EXPERIMENTS ON NONHUMAN PRIMATES AND PROVING THAT INGESTION OF CHLORINE CAUSES ARTERIOSCLEROSIS AND E P A NEVER PUBLISHED THAT REPORT .
AND WHAT S THE NAME OF THIS BOOK AGAIN .
CORONARY CHOLESTEROL AND CHLORINE .
I LL HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT .
YEAH .
THAT WILL BE VERY INTERESTING MY HUSBAND WANTS TO GO INTO MEDICAL SCHOOL AND BE A NEUROSURGEON SO HE S REALLY INTERESTED IN THE HEART .
YEAH .
AND HE S IN FACT HE S A WELL HEART TOO HE S UH HE S DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH ON LIKE HOW YOUR HEART REACTS TO EXERCISE SORRY HE MADE ME LAUGH UM SO ANYWAY .
YEAH THERE IS THERE IS A LOT OF GOOD INFORMATION OUT THERE UH ABOUT HEALTH AND A LOT OF THE A LOT OF THE MYTHS THEY VE BEEN PASSING AROUND PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO REALIZE ARE NT TRUE .
YEAH .
I MEAN I M ALL FOR HAVING A DIET HIGH IN FIBER AND ALL THAT BECAUSE THAT S THAT S GOOD FOR YOU .
HUHUH .
UH BUT TO BELIEVE SOME OF THE THINGS YOU KNOW AND I DO NT THINK ANYBODY SHOULD BE GOING OUT THERE AND EATING A HIGH FAT DIET BUT TO THINK THAT SOLELY ALONE IS GOING TO CAUSE SOMETHING LIKE ARTERIOSCLEROSIS IS IS JUST HARD TO BELIEVE .
IF YOU GET A CHANCE READ DR COOPER S BOOK ON CONTROLLING CHOLESTEROL .
HUHUH .
THAT S A REAL GOOD UM HE TALKS ABOUT THAT TALKS ABOUT HIGH RISK FACTORS AND HEART DISEASE AND ALL THAT .
YEAH I ACTUALLY EAT PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING THAT I WANT .
HUHUH .
AND I VE HAD MY CHOLESTEROL CHECKED AND UH A FEW TIMES AND I VE NEVER BEEN ABOVE LIKE YOU KNOW ONEHUNDRED AND FIFTY .
HUHUH .
NEVER AND UH UH I MEAN I .
YOU HAVE A GOOD RATIO OF GOOD TO BAD .
UM .
CHOLESTEROL .
WELL WHAT THEY TELL ME BUT I MEAN YOU KNOW EVERYTHING IS LIKE WITHIN FIVE TO TEN PERCENT AND ALL THAT KIND OF THING YOU KNOW THEY LEAVE THEMSELVES WIDE OPEN SO THEY CA NT BE SUED .
YEAH .
BUT UH WE VE I WORK AT THE T I SITE IN HUNT VALLEY MARYLAND .
OH REALLY .
YEAH AND WE VE HAD A FEW OF THE HEALTH FAIRS UP HERE AND UM YOU KNOW I VE ALWAYS COME OUT ACES .
THAT S GOOD .
YOU KNOW I M NOT REALLY THAT BIG ON WATCHING WHAT I EAT BUT I DO EAT YOU KNOW SOME HEALTH COOKIES THAT ARE HIGH IN FIBER .
YEAH .
LOW IN FAT AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF BUT I MEAN AS FAR AS REALLY BEING CONCERNED ABOUT INGESTING TOO MUCH CHLORINE I M NOT CHOLESTEROL I M NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT .
UH ROBERT .
WHAT DO YOU UH THINK WHAT SUBSTANCES DO YOU THINK ARE THE MOST UH LIKELY CAUSES OF AIR POLLUTION .
UM GEE I DO NT I MEAN I I GUESS IT S THE STUFF .
THAT COMES OUT OF AUTOMOBILE EXHAUST YOU KNOW THEY SAY IN THE PAPER NITROUS OXIDES AND OZONE AND ALL THAT .
RIGHT .
SO I BELIEVE THEM BUT I M NOT A CHEMIST .
DO YOU UH DO YOU THINK THAT THOSE ARE BIGGER CONTRIBUTORS THAN THINGS LIKE AI ACID RAIN AND SOME OF THE POLLUTANTS .
THAT COME FROM UH INDUSTRIAL AREAS FACTORIES AND SO ON .
I DO NT REALLY KNOW UM I GREW UP IN LOS ANGELES AND HAVE FELT LIKE I WAS VICTIMIZED BY AIR POLLUTION .
I WAS GOING TO SAY AND AND YOU SO YOU UNDERSTAND SMOG .
I UNDERSTAND IT VERY WELL AND IN FACT .
I WAS A PRIVATE PILOT THERE .
UHHUH .
AND I CAN REMEMBER VERY ETCHED ETCHED CLEARLY IN MY MIND UH FLYING AND COMING UP ABOVE THE SMOG LAYER AT ABOUT THREE THOUSAND FEET AND LOOKING BACK DOWN AND AND REALLY BEING UNBELIEVING AT .
WOW .
WHAT LOOKED LIKE A UH IT JUST LOOKED LIKED PEANUT BUTTER .
MY WORD .
THICK AND BROWN AND SO ON .
AND THAT WAS A FEW YEARS AGO .
THIS WAS QUITE A FEW YEARS AGO .
THIS WAS IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES .
I I WONDER IF IT S ANY BETTER NOW .
PEOPLE SAY THAT IT IS SOMEWHAT BETTER .
BECAUSE THEY UH CALIFORNIA HAS SUCH STRICT RULES .
RIGHT .
UM ABOUT EMISSIONS AND SO ON .
UM I I DO NT KNOW IF YOU HE RE HEARD ABOUT THE UH RECENT LEGISLATION IN UH COLORADO UH AGAINST A POWER COMPANY UH THAT S ACTUALLY ON INDIAN LAND I BELIEVE BUT UH IT HAS BEEN RULED AGAINST UH REGARDING AIR POLLUTION BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT IT S CAUSING TERRIBLE SMOG OVER THE GRAND CANYON .
UM .
AND UM PARTICULARLY IN THE WINTER MONTHS .
SO THEY IT WAS UH A LANDMARK CASE BECAUSE IT S UNUSUAL TO UM I CAN THEY THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SHUTTING IT DOWN OR IF IT DID NT COMPLY AND SO ON .
SO DID IT BURN COAL .
I DO NT KNOW THAT THE INFORMATION IS ONE OF THOSE WIRE SERVICES KIND OF NEWS PIECES OF NEWS YOU KNOW SO IT S HARD I NEVER DID SEE THE FULL STORY SO I DO NT KNOW .
YEAH .
BUT THEY SAID THAT THAT IT REALLY CAUSED SO MUCH SMOG OVER UH THE GRAND CANYON IN THE WINTER MONTHS THAT THEY COULD NT DO THE UH PILOTING UH YOU KNOW THE HELICOPTER TRIPS AND THAT SORT OF THING .
UM .
WHICH WOULD BE HORRIBLE .
YEAH .
BECAUSE THE THERE S NOTHING I MEAN THAT S SUCH A SPECTACLE .
IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO RUIN IT .
YEAH .
UH WHAT DO YOU THINK INDIVIDUALS COULD DO OR SOCIETY COULD DO TO ALLEVIATE THIS PROBLEM .
UH I DO NT UH I DO NT KNOW WHETHER WE COULD DO A WHOLE LOT AS INDIVIDUALS .
UH MAYBE JUST TAKE GOOD CARE OF OUR CARS .
RIGHT .
AND MAKE SURE WE KEEP OUR POLLUTION DEVICES CLEAN AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING .
UM APART FROM THAT I I DO NT KNOW WHAT .
WE CAN DO AS INDIVIDUALS .
WHAT DO YOU THINK WE CAN DO .
UHHUH YOU THINK IT S MORE MORE TO SOCIETY .
WELL I GUESS I .
KIND OF AGREE THERE .
I UH ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS .
THERE IS NT A LOT .
WE CAN DO ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS BUT IF WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IT THEN WE CERTAINLY CAN UH FORCE UH GOVERNMENT UH THAT WE ELECT TO DEAL MORE SERIOUSLY WITH IT .
YEAH .
AND I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY THERE .
I MUST ADMIT I M NOT ALWAYS REAL POLITICALLY ACTIVE BUT I DO THINK THAT UM CONGRESS HAS BACKED DOWN MUCH TOO MUCH ON SOME OF THE AIR POLLUTION STANDARDS .
YEAH .
AND IT S BROUGHT THE THEY UH REALLY LISTEN TO THE THE UH LOBBYIST AND UH THE CAR MANUFACTURING COMPANIES HAVE UH YOU KNOW HAVE REALLY PUSHED THEY ALL THOSE RE RESTRICTIONS ARE REALLY TOO HARD WE CA NT WE CA NT QUITE MAKE THAT GO AND THEY DO NT AND THEN WE STILL LIVE WITH AIR POLLUTION .
YEAH .
UM SO I SUSPECT THAT THAT S ONE THING THAT THAT AS INDIVIDUALS WE CAN DO MAKE OUR VOICES KNOWN PERHAPS TO OUR LEGISLATORS .
BUT UM AS A SOCIETY I THINK WE CAN DO MORE AND THAT S PROBABLY HOW WE OUGHT TO DO IT .
UH INDIVID BEING INDIVIDUALLY RESPONSIBLE AS UH GRO IN ORDER TO BE GROUP RESPONSIBLE .
YEAH I GUESS I M I M TO THE POINT WHERE I M CYNICAL ENOUGH THAT I REALLY DO NT BELIEVE ANYTHING WILL HAPPEN UNLESS UNLESS THERE S SOMETHING ECONOMICALLY JUSTIFIABLE ABOUT IT .
RIGHT .
AND IN THE CASE OF AIR POLLUTION IT SIMPLY MIGHT TURN OUT AT SOME POINT DOWN THE ROAD TO BE SO COSTLY TO HAVE TO LIVE WITH AIR POLLUTION IN TERMS OF HEALTH PROBLEMS .
UHHUH .
AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WE LL SPEND THE MONEY .
THAT S NECESSARY TO UH TO GET RID OF THE SOURCE OF IT .
I SUSPECT THAT THE PUB THAT THERE S GOING TO HAVE TO BE A LOT OF PRESSURE UH COME TO BEAR ON THE COMPANIES .
THAT DEAL WITH IT AND PROBABLY THE ONLY WAY .
THAT CAN HAPPEN IS FOR UM GOVERNMENTS TO REALIZE THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY IF COMPANIES DO NT .
YEAH .
AND UH I DO NT KNOW HOW LONG THAT THAT WILL TAKE .
PEOPLE ALSO HAVE TO REALIZE THEY CA NT HAVE THEIR CAKE AND EAT IT .
SO IF YOU DO NT WANT TO BURN COAL FOR POWER .
SURE .
HOW ABOUT NUCLE NUCLEAR ENERGY .
WELL WE DO NT WANT THAT EITHER .
EXACTLY YEAH RIGHT .
HOW ABOUT INVESTING IN THE SUN .
WELL NOBODY WANTS TO PAY TWENTYFIVE CENTS .
A KILOWATT HOUR I DO NT THINK .
RIGHT .
UH I PROBABLY WOULD NT MIND IF IT REALLY CAME DOWN TO IT .
WELL IT S JUST THE SAME THING WITH THE CAR UH UH THE GASOLINE NOW IS A WONDERFUL TIME TO SMACK A FIFTY CENT .
A GALLON TAX ON GASOLINE .
OH YES YES YES .
SO THAT WE DO NT UH RUN INTO THE KIND OF PROBLEMS WE RECENTLY HAD AND YET THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT GOING TO DO THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TOO DEPENDENT AND THEY DO NT WANT THEY DO NT WANT TO PAY FOR IT .
SO INSTEAD WE SPEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS GOING TO WAR .
YES .
UH YOU KNOW WHA HOWEVER IT MIGHT HAVE HAD OTHER CAUSES .
CERTAINLY OIL WAS A BIG FACTOR .
OH CERTAINLY YES .
UM AND I THINK THAT S PROBABLY GOING TO HAPPEN WITH WITH SUCH THINGS AS AIR POLLUTION .
YEAH .
WHEN WE WHEN WE SE GET SERIOUS ABOUT CLEANING ABOUT OUR MOTORS IN OUR AUTOMOBILES THEN UH THEN MAYBE YOU KNOW WE LL HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF HELP .
UM UH DO YOU HAVE ANY AIR POLLUTION IN YOUR AREA .
THERE S NOT REALLY A LOT HERE IN RALEIGH .
UH ONCE IN A WHILE .
WE LL GET SOME UH I THINK IT .
KIND OF WASHES DOWN FROM UH FROM YOUR AREA LINDA .
OH NO .
THAT S WHAT .
THEY THAT S WHAT .
THEY .
YOUR TALKING ABOUT FROM FROM THE UH THE MIDDLE MIDDLE STATES .
YEAH .
THAT THAT HAVE MORE FACTORIES AND SO ON .
YEAH YEAH THAT S WHAT .
THEY SAY BUT IT S IT S NOT IT S NOT VERY USUAL AND CERTAINLY WE DO NT HAVE THE EYE STINGING VARIETY THAT YOU GET IN THE BIG CITIES .
YEAH WE REALLY DO NT HAVE THAT EITHER .
ALTHOUGH I THINK I CAN TELL A DIFFERENCE IN I LIVED IN THIS AREA FOR ABOUT TWENTYFIVE YEARS AND I THINK I CAN TELL A DIFFERENCE IN THE COMFORT LEVEL UH PARTICULARLY IN THE SUMMER .
UH YOU KNOW WHEN IT GETS HOT .
UHHUH UHHUH .
AND YOU HAVE THE THAT KIND OF A PRESSURE FROM THE POCKETS OF AIR UH USUALLY THEY SAY CAUSED BY EXHAUST .
YEAH .
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I M MORE UNCOMFORTABLE AND YOU KNOW MY EYES STING MORE AND SO ON AND SO ON .
SO I SUSPECT THAT IT S IT S AN EVER GROWING PROBLEM .
YEAH .
WELL I SUSPECT THAT WE VE PROBABLY COVERED EVERYTHING THAT WE NEED TO HERE .
RIGHT I THINK .
IT WAS NICE TALKING TO YOU .
WE VE GIVEN THEM ABOUT SEVEN MINUTES ACCORDING TO MY WATCH AND I ENJOYED THE CONVERSATION .
SO DID I .
BYE BYE .
BYE .
OKAY .
OKAY .
I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THAT THAT IT HAD TO BE PRESSED .
UM BUT ANYWAY SO SO AS FAR AS W WE REALLY WE DO NT WANT TO GET IN THE HABIT OF WATCHING A LOT OF T V .
UHHUH .
BECAUSE WE BOTH WERE RAISED YOU KNOW THAT WAY YOU KNOW WHERE OUR PARENTS SORT OF STUCK US IN FRONT OF A T V TO BE THE BABYSITTER .
UHHUH .
AND WE JUST DO NT WANT THAT WE WANT MORE COMMUNICATION AND INTERACTION YOU KNOW AMONGST US AS A FAMILY AND WE BOTH LIKE SPORTS SO WE FIGURED WELL WHAT WHAT BETTER WAY TO GET OUT AND YOU KNOW BE TOGETHER AS A FAMILY .
UHHUH .
AND ALSO YOU KNOW HAVE IT BE GOOD FOR YOU AND PLUS WE LIKE WE BOTH LIKE TO COOK SO YOU KNOW THAT S SOMETHING WE SPEND TIME TOGETHER TOO IS YOU KNOW COOKING AND UH PREPARING MEALS AND STUFF SO UH BUT AS FAR AS THAT THAT S ABOUT ALL WE VE DISCUSSED AS FAR AS FOR FAMILY .
REALLY OKAY WELL SEE I M THE THIRD OLDEST OF TWELVE CHILDREN MUMBLEX .
OH MY GOSH .

OH YEAH .
AND LIKE I SA I DO NT HAVE ANY CHILDREN I M JUST ENGAGED AND I M GETTING MARRIED IN OCTOBER AND WE HAVE NT DISCUSSED THIS AT ALL UM .
YEAH LONG WAY DOWN THE ROAD RIGHT .
YEAH EXACTLY BUT UM NOW I VE NOTICED THAT LIKE WHILE I M AT COLLEGE AND WHEN I GO HOME MY BRO YOU KNOW MY I M REALLY CLOSE TO THE YOUNGER ONES AND UM LIKE WHEN WHEN LIKE WHEN I DO GO HOME THEY ENJOY JUST LAYING AROUND ME YOU KNOW LIKE IF WE DO WATCH T V AT NIGHT THEY JUST LIKE ENJOY JUST LIKE LAYING ON TOP OF ME OR SOMETHING .
YEAH .
THEY LIKE THAT .
BUT UM AS FAR AS THAT GOES LIKE WE PLAY GAMES I PLAY LIKE OLD MAID AND FISH WITH THEM AND W WE PLAY BOARD GAMES AND WHEN IT S NI LIKE I M FROM PENNSYLVANIA SO WHEN IT S NICE OUT WE GO OUTSIDE AND WE LIKE TO PLAY LIKE KICK BALL AND SOFTBALL AND STUFF SO .
UHHUH .
WE DO A LOT OF THAT AND IN THE SUMMER EVERYONE IS LIKE I THINK THERE S LIKE SEVEN OF US STILL AT HOME AND ALL SEVEN ARE IN A SPORT LIKE ALSO MUMBLEX THE GIRLS ARE IN SOFTBALL AND THE BOYS ARE IN BASEBALL SO ALL SUMMER WE LIVE ON HAMBURGERS AND HOT DOGS AND SPORTS THAT S IT YOU KNOW .
WELL DO YOU DO YOU SO YOU GO IF YOU RE IF YOU RE NOT DOING ANY KIND OF SPORT THING YOU GO TO ONE OF YOUR SISTERS OR BROTHERS .

UHHUH .
WELL THAT S THAT S GOOD TOO I MEAN AS FAR AS ENTERING I MEAN YOU RE YOU RE PARTICIPATING BUT YOU RE NOT YOU KNOW .
UHHUH .
I MEAN AT LEAST YOU RE ENCOURAGING THEM ON AND STUFF AND THAT S .
YEAH .
BECAUSE UM EVEN IF OUR KIDS YOU KNOW GET INTO SPORTS THAT WE RE REALLY NOT INTERESTED IN I DO NT I WANT THEM YOU KNOW TO KNOW THAT WE RE STILL THERE .
UHHUH .
SO TO SPEAK AS A FAMILY .
WELL IT S FUNNY BECAUSE UM WELL MY MOM AND DAD BOTH WERE KIND OF ATHLETIC THEY BOTH GREW UP ON A FARM BUT ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW IT WAS NT THEM PLAYING I NOTICE LIKE WHENEVER I WAS PLAYING SOFTBALL AND SUCH MY MOM AND DAD GOT INTO IT MORE THAN I DID I MEAN THEY D BE IN THE AUDIENCE SCREAMING AND YELLING YOU KNOW SO .
YEAH CHEERING YOU ON AND STUFF .
A LOT OF TIMES THE PARENTS GET INTO IT JUST AS MUCH AS AS THE KIDS AND I FOUND LIKE A LOT OF TIMES LIKE WHEN WE WENT ON TO TOURNAMENTS AND STUFF IT WAS REALLY FUNNY BECAUSE THE CROWDS WOULD LIKE GET INTO ARGU YOU KNOW GET INTO FIGHTS WHO CAN SCREAM LOUDER AND YOU KNOW EVERYTHING SO IT S REALLY PRETTY FUNNY TO SEE MY PARENTS GET INTO IT AND THEY RE NOT REALLY EVEN PARTICIPATING .
YEAH WELL THAT THAT WOULD BE FUN BOY SO YOU YOU HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE AS FAR AS YOU KNOW DIFFERENT WAYS A FAMILY CAN INTERACT AND AND DO THINGS TOGETHER .
YEAH .
AS FAR AS GO TWELVE .
UHHUH .
BUT IT S SO IF YOU RE NOT I WHAT IF DO PEOPLE GO OFF IN THEIR OWN LITTLE GROUPS WITH THAT MANY I MEAN DID LIKE SOME PEOPLE GO TO THEIR ROOMS AND MUMBLEX .
YEAH IT S UM THE THE ONE DOWN THING ABOUT HAVING THAT MANY PEOPLE IN OUR FAMILY IS YOU REAL WE REALLY DO NT HAVE ANY PRIVACY WHEN WE RE AT HOME BECAUSE YOU COULD NT POSSIBLY HAVE A HOUSE WITH TWELVE BEDROOMS .
YEAH .
BUT UM LIKE I SAY YOU KNOW I M TWENTY I LL BE TWENTYTWO NEXT MONTH AND I M CLOSER TO THE YOUNGER KIDS THAN I AM THE ONES MY OWN AGE AND THAT S I THINK .
HUH .
THAT S BECAUSE WE THE ONES THAT ARE OLDER ALL HAVE THEIR OWN LITTLE THING TO DO AND THE YOUNGER KIDS ARE AT HOME AND I LIKE TO SPEND TIME WITH THEM SO .
YEAH .
I DO NT I DO NT YOU KNOW .
BUT WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP AND THEY WERE NT AND THE YOUNGER ONES WERE NT AROUND WHAT DID YOU DO .
WE WERE ALL PRETTY CLOSE WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER .
OH I SEE BUT NOW THAT THEY VE ALL SORT OF MOVED OFF .
YEAH NOW THAT WE RE GETTING OLDER PEOPLE ARE GET YOU KNOW EACH ONE OF US ARE GOING OUR OWN DIRECTION .
YEAH .
UHHUH .
SO DO YOU THINK EVEN I MEAN WHAT DID YOU DO WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER DID YOU GO DO THE BOARD GAMES AND STUFF YOU STILL DID WHAT YOU DO NOW .
OH YEAH AND UM WE YOU KNOW WE HAD BLOCKS AND STUFF AND WE JUST DID WE WOULD MAKE LIKE IN THE WINTER WHEN IT WA WE COULD NT GO OUTSIDE BECAUSE OF THE SNOW AND STUFF .
UHHUH .

HURLING .

OH HURTLE OH OKAY .
YEAH TO SEE WHO COULD JUMP OVER YOU KNOW WE JUST MADE UP OUR OWN STUPID LITTLE GAMES AND LIKE HIDE AND SEEK WELL WE HAVE A A BIGGER HOUSE THAN A LOT YOU KNOW OUR HOUSE IS NT THE AVERAGE SMALL ONE SO WE COULD LIKE PLAY HIDE AND GO SEEK IN OUR HOUSE AND EVEN STUFF LIKE THAT .
SO YOU YOU HAD A LOT OF GAMES AND THINGS YOU PLAYED .
YEAH .
EVEN WHEN YOU WERE KIDS WITH THE ONES THAT YOU .
WELL SEE THEY RE UM WE RE ALL LIKE WE RE ALL PRETTY CLOSE TOGETHER LIKE M MY SISTER THAT S CLOSEST TO ME WE RE ONLY FOURTEEN MONTHS APART .
YEAH .
SO THERE WAS ALWAYS THERE WAS NEVER JUST ONE ALONE YOU KNOW .
YEAH NO NOT REAL SPREAD IN AGE .
RIGHT SO WE WERE ALL PRETTY CLOSE WHERE WE WE ALWAYS HAD A BUDDY TO PLAY WITH .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
GOSH TWELVE IS THAT IS THAT PRETTY COMMON UP THERE UH IN .
NO NO NOT AT ALL .
OH OKAY .
NOT AT ALL .
I DO NT MEET I MEAN I DO NT SPEAK WITH MANY PEOPLE THAT COME FROM FAMILIES THAT LARGE ANY MORE I MEAN .
UHHUH .
MY MY HUSBAND S MOTHER CAME FROM A FAMILY OF THIRTEEN BUT I MEAN THAT S HIS MOTHER .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW AND AND THEIR CATHOLIC AND I MEAN THAT S .
WELL YEAH I M CATHOLIC .
WELL THAT S IT THEN I THINK PROBABLY MAYBE THAT THAT .
UHHUH .
BUT I MEAN DO YOU SEE YOURSELF HAVING THIRTEEN KIDS .
NO NOT AT ALL .
OR TWELVE KIDS .
NOT AT ALL .
YEAH .
BUT SEE UM WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I USED TO SAY THAT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE FIVE WELL I VE EVEN CUT THAT DOWN NOW AND UM BUT TO ME FIVE WAS NT EVEN A LOT BECAUSE I WAS JUST SO USED TO TWELVE .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW .
BUT IT S SO EXPENSIVE MAN .
BUT YEAH IT S SO IT WOULD BE REALLY HARD NOW TO HAVE TWELVE CHILDREN .
I WOULD THINK FOR YOUR PARENTS IT WOULD BE IT WOULD STILL BE HARD EVEN NOWADAYS I MEAN JUST TO RAISE TWELVE KIDS .
WELL .
WOULD BE SHOOSH .
WELL OKAY WELL LIKE MY OLDEST BROTHER HE S HE S TWENTYFOUR AND HE PUT HIMSELF THROUGH COLLEGE AND UM THERE S A SISTER OLDER THAN ME SHE S STILL LIVING AT HOME BUT SHE WORKS .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW AND I THINK SHE EVEN GIVES MOM AND DAD A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW OF RENT MONEY .
YEAH .
AND I M PUTTING MYSELF THROUGH COLLEGE AND LIKE I M GETTING MARRIED IN OCTOBER AND MY FIANC3E AND I ARE PAYING FOR MOST OF THE WEDDING AND THEN THEN MY BROTHER RIGHT BEHIND ME HE MOVED OUT AND HE HAS AN APARTMENT AND HE WORKS AND THEN THE NEXT ONE DOWN IS IN THE MARINES AND HE S OUT OF THE HOUSE SO IT S KIND OF LIKE THEY DO NT YOU KNOW .
WELL SOMETIMES I THINK MAYBE THE LARGER FAMILIES CREATE MORE INDEPENDENCE IN THE CHILDREN THOUGH YOU KNOW I MEAN .
I I THINK THEY DO .
YOU DO NT EXPECT ANYTHING BECAUSE THERE IS NOT ENOUGH TO GO AROUND FOR EVERYBODY .
UHHUH .
SO YOU YOU KIND OF HAVE YOUR OWN INDEPENDENCE ON GOING OUT AND GETTING IT YOURSELF .
EXACTLY .
IF YOU REALLY WANT IT .
LIKE UH WELL I FIND IT A LOT WHEN I M UP HERE AT COLLEGE BECAUSE I VE ALWAYS HAD A BANK ACCOUNT I VE ALWAYS HAD MY OWN CHECKING ACCOUNT SINCE I WAS IN LIKE TENTH GRADE .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW I WOULD WORK IN THE SUMMER AND THERE S A LOT OF KIDS UP HERE THAT WOULD HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO EVEN DO A CHECKBOOK OR YOU KNOW .
YEAH .
TO TO MANAGE MONEY LIKE MY ROOMMATE S LAUGHING AT YOU KNOW AT ME YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEIR SCHOOLING S PAID FOR .
OR MANAGE MONEY OR KNOW YEAH KNOW YOU KNOW HOW TO GET HOW TO EVEN GO ABOUT GETTING MONEY .
YEAH UHHUH .
YOU KNOW HOW TO GET A JOB OR YOU KNOW JUST WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT WHEN YOU GET A JOB WHAT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY IS .
YEAH .
ARE YOU GOING TO BLOW ALL THAT MONEY HOW EASY IT IS TO BLOW MONEY YOU EARN .
YEAH AND SEE AND THEN MY MOM AND DAD LIKE WHENEVER LIKE WE WOULD GO OUT AND WE WOULD GET A SUMMER JOB AND THEN WE WOULD START BLOWING MONEY AND MY MOM SAID WELL THAT S STUPID FOR YOU TO BE BLOWING MONEY SHE GOES OKAY IF YOUR GOING TO BLOW YOUR MONEY ON OTHER THINGS SHE GOES YOU CAN JUST PAY FOR YOUR LIFE INSURANCE SO THEN WE WHEN WE ALL GRADUATED FROM HI COLLEGE FROM HIGH SCHOOL .
UHHUH .
WE ALL GOT WE RE STILL LIKE I M STILL COVERED UNDER MY MOM AND DAD S LIFE INSURANCE BECAUSE I M STILL IN SCHOOL BUT I HAVE MY OWN POLICY TOO SO I HAD A POLI YOU KNOW MY MOM AND DAD GOT IT SET UP YOU KNOW YOU KNOW HELPED ME TO GET IT AND EVERYTHING AND I HAVE MY OWN POLICY AND THEN I PAY FOR MY OWN LIFE INSURANCE TOO .
WOW .
AND THEN .
YOU VE REALLY GOT RESPONSIBILITIES .
AND THEN LIKE MY MOM AND DAD BECAUSE THERE S SO MANY OF US AND BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE LAWS ARE YOU KNOW NOW IF WE WANT TO DRIVE WE HAVE TO PAY FOR OUR OWN INSURANCE ON OUR CARS .
YEAH .
BECAUSE MY MOM SAID THAT S SILLY TO LET ONE OF THE OLDER ONE S DRIVE IT IF WE WERE IN A WRECK YOU KNOW YOU CAN BE SUED FOR ANYTHING NOW AND SHE SAID THAT S REALLY NOT FAIR TO THE YOUNGER KIDS IF WE WERE CARELESS AND WAS IN A WRECK AND THEY GOT SUED AND THEN THEY CAN TAKE EVERYTHING AWAY FROM MY MOM AND DAD AND THE LITTLE KIDS WOULD HAVE NOTHING AND I I AGREE WITH HER YOU KNOW I JUST I DO NT KNOW .
YEAH WH .
SO IF YOU KNOW IF WE WANT TO DRIVE WE PAY OUR OWN INSURANCE AND .
SO REALLY I THINK SOMETIMES THERE S AN ADVANTAGE I MEAN SOMETIMES IT S GOOD TO HAVE A BIGGER FAMILY BECAUSE IT DOES MAKE YOU MORE INDEPENDENT .
UHHUH .
IT MAKES YOU KNOW THAT YOU CA NT TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED .
YEAH .
THAT WHEN YOU GET SOMETHING YOU RE LUCKY TO GET IT SO TO SPEAK .
UHHUH .
YOU KNOW SO UM I DO NT KNOW SOMETIMES BUT NOW IT IT IS HARD I CAN IMAGINE ON YOUR PARENTS YOU KNOW .
ALL RIGHT .
WELL UM WE LIVED I GREW UP IN SAN ANTONIO AND I WAS USED TO THE HEAT AND I WAS USED TO WHAT COULD NT GROW DOWN THERE AND WE HAD A SMALL UM FARM HOUSE OUT IN CASTROVILLE WHICH IS JUST UH TO THE WEST OF SAN ANTONIO .
UHHUH .
AND WE DID A LOT OF GARDENING OUT THERE AND UH MOSTLY IN RAISED BEDS SO WE COULD KEEP THE UH SOIL NICE BECAUSE BASICALLY OUT THERE IT WAS MOSTLY A CLAY SOIL VERY HARD TO TO GROW VERY HARD TO CULTIVATE AND WHEN WE CAME UP HERE UH TO CALIFORNIA UH WE RE IN THE MONTERREY AREA AND IT S VERY UH NICE SANDY SOIL RICH SOIL AND THE WEATHER IS PERFECT FOR GROWING JUST ABOUT ANYTHING YOU WANT TO GROW .
HOW FINE .
SO WE VE BEEN OUT HERE WELL REALLY IN THE HOUSE SINCE DECEMBER AND WE VE BEEN UH PLANTING FLOWERS THAT WE COULD NEVER PLANT .
IN SAN ANTONIO BECAUSE THE HEAT WOULD JUST DRY THEM UP AFTER YOU KNOW ABOUT THREE GOOD WEEKS OF NICE WEATHER BEFORE THE HEAT STARTED .
UM .
AND HERE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO LAST YEAR AROUND .
OH BOY .
SO WE HAVE SOME REALLY PRETTY FLOWERS GROWING AND UH WE RE AT THE EDGE OF A FOREST AREA SO THERE S A LOT OF PINE MULCH .
UHHUH .
JUST ABOUT ANYTHING YOU WOULD WANT IN TEXAS AS A GARDENER IS HERE JUST AROUND US .
WE GOT HERE AT THE END OF ABOUT A FOUR YEAR DROUGHT WE VE HAD A WHOLE LOT OF RAIN UH IT S BEEN RAINING PRETTY MUCH CONTINUALLY NOW UH OFF AND ON MAYBE ONE DAY OF BREAK FOR ABOUT A MONTH SO .
OH REALLY .
YEAH WE RE GETTING REPLENISHED AND SO THERE IS WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE EVERYTHING WAS YELLOW THE GRASS WAS DEAD EVERYWHERE AND NOW WITH ALL THE RAIN EVERYTHING IS JUST GORGEOUS LUSH AND GREEN AND BEAUTIFUL AND I HOPE THAT IT HOLDS OUT HERE AFTER THE SUMMER .
WOW .
BUT UH THAT HAS BEEN THE MAJOR CHANGE THAT WE HAVE NOTICED IN GARDENING AND THAT S ABOUT THE EXTENT OF WHAT WE VE DONE JUST A LITTLE BIT ON THE PATIO AND WAITING FOR THE RAIN TO SUBSIDE SO WE CAN MOW WE AFTER ABOUT A MONTH WE FINALLY GOT TO MOW THIS WEEKEND .
BUT UM WE RE JUST SO HAPPY TO SEE GREEN IT S JUST SO NICE WE HAVE NT REALLY DONE TOO MUCH ELSE OTHER THAN THAT .
UM WELL WE JUST MOVED TO OUR FIRST HOME AND WE HAD LIVED IN A CONDOMINIUM BEFORE SO WE DID NT HAVE ANY LAWN AND GARDEN TYPE DUTIES SO WE RE JUST LEARNING THE ROPES HERE AND .
UHHUH .
BUT WHEN WE MOVED IN UM OUR BACKYARD HAS SO MANY BI TALL TREES IN IT THAT THERE JUS THERE WAS NT EVEN A BLADE OF GRASS IN THE BACKYARD .
UHHUH .
SO WE RE YOU KNOW GOING TALKING TO SOME OF OUR FRIENDS THAT ARE LANDSCAPERS AND THINGS AND LEARNING ABOUT DIFFERENT KINDS OF GRASS WE TRYING TO GO GROW GRASS AND IT JUST SEEMS SO FUNNY TO ME THAT WHEN I GREW UP IN MISSOURI AND YOU DID NT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT GROWING GRASS THERE IT JUST HAPPENED AUTOMATICALLY .
SO DO YOU HAVE TO GET A SHADE TOLERANT GRASS IS THAT WHAT YOU RE .
YES WE ARE WE TRIED WE PLANTED SOME FESCUE LAST UM FALL .
UHHUH .
AND IT S REALLY REALLY PRETTY AND UM GREEN IT STAYED PRETTY PRETTY GREEN THROUGHOUT THE WINTER AND IT S PRETTY GOO IT S NOT AS THICK AND AS NICE IT DOES NT LOOK LIKE IT CAN WITHSTAND TOO MUCH YOU KNOW .
OH DOES THAT LAST THROUGH THE SUMMER TOO .
IT S SUPPOSED TO DIE OFF LIKE IN AUGUST AND THEN YOU REPLANT IT IN SEPTEMBER AND .
OH .
SO BUT WE DO NT THE SAINT AUGUSTINE AND ALL THAT SUPPOSEDLY WAS BACK THERE JUST WAS NT LIKE I SAY THERE REALLY WAS NT EVEN ONE BLADE OF GRASS IN THE BACKYARD .
UHHUH .
AND UM SO MOSTLY YOU KNOW WE RE NOT EVEN TO THE POINT WHERE WE RE GETTING INTO FLOWERS .
AND FLOWER BEDS OR EVEN GARDENS THAT WE RE JUST SAYING LET S GET SOME GRASS .
JUST GET GRASS TO GROW .
LET S GET GRASS SO THAT THE KIDS CAN PLAY IN THE YARD AND NOT HAVE TO BE WORRIED ABOUT THE DIRT SO MUCH YOU KNOW .
WELL WHEN WE HAD OUR HOUSE UM OUT IN CASTROVILLE THE PROBLEM WITH OURS IS THAT THE UH PLOTS THERE ARE A THIRD OF AN ACRE .
UHHUH .
AND TRYING TO KEEP GRASS ALIVE DURING A SUMMER ON A PIECE OF GROUND THAT BIG WAS EXPENSIVE .
OH YEAH .
TO WATER IT AND UH AND EVENTUALLY WELL ESPECIALLY WHEN IT WAS SO BAD LAST YEAR WELL I GUESS IT WAS THE YEAR BEFORE NOW UH IT WAS SO HOT THAT YEAR THAT WAS THE YEAR THAT I THINK IT STARTED OUT A HUNDRED IN FEBRUARY .
OH NO .
UM WE WERE JUST WATERING ALL THE TIME FINALLY WHAT WE DID WAS WE SAID WE RE GOING TO HAVE TO LET THE BACK YARD DIE .
IT S GOING TO HAVE TO DO WHATEVER IT S GOING TO DO BECAUSE .
ON ITS OWN .
WE CA NT REALLY AFFORD THE FRONT YARD .
UHHUH .
AND SO WHEN WE LEFT YOU KNOW THE BACK YARD HAD SOME UM I THINK IT WAS SAINT AUGUSTINE THAT WE HAD IT HAD HELD ONTO A SMALL PORTION BUT PRIMARILY ONCE THE WEEDS START IN THE BACK WE WERE JUST YOU KNOW RESIGNED TO WELL THE ONLY WAY WE WERE GOING TO FIX THIS ONE IS THAT IF YOU PLOW IT ALL UNDER .
UHHUH .
AND PUT EVERYTHING BACK ON TOP OF IT AGAIN BUT I DO NT KNOW THAT S THE BAD THING THERE IS THAT WE SPENT SO MUCH MONEY OR YOU WOULD SPEND SO MUCH MONEY TRYING TO KEEP A LARGE LAWN ALIVE THAT WAS THE ONLY THING I DID NT LIKE ABOUT LAWNS AND WE WERE SITTING THERE WONDERING THERE MUST BE A BETTER WAY TO LANDSCAPE SO THAT YOU DO NT HAVE TO SPEND SO MUCH MONEY TRYING TO KEEP THE LAWN ALIVE AND GREEN AND THE WEEDS OUT .
YES .
SO .
IT S PRETTY REMARKABLE BECAUSE GROWING UP WE VE ALWAYS HAD A BEAUTIFUL LUSH GREEN LAWN AND WE NEVER THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS WATERING YOUR LAWNS .
UHHUH .
IN MISSOURI IT JUST HAPPENED .
UHHUH .
AND UM SO IT S BEEN REAL FUN HERE TO SEE THERE S A BIG MARKET FOR THE NURSERIES AND FOR THE LANDSCAPING COMPANIES AND A LOT OF PEOPLE UM WE LIVE IN NORTH OF DALLAS .
UHHUH .
AND UM .
ARLINGTON AREA .
PLANO .
OKAY PLANO UHHUH .
UHHUH UP NORTH AND SO THERE S A LOT OF MARKET UP HERE SINCE IT S KIND OF THE AREA THAT PEOPLE ARE MOVING INTO IN THE DALLAS AREA .
UHHUH .
AND BIG MARKET FOR FOR YARDS YARD WORK .
YEAH I IMAGINE SO WELL EVERYBODY IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE IS SO PARTICULAR ESPECIALLY IN THE DALLAS AREA .
UHHUH .
THERE THERE S SO MUCH MONEY AND EVERYONE CAN AFFORD THEY HAVE ENOUGH LEISURE TIME TO AFFORD A NICE LAWN AND ANOTHER THING I VE NOTICED IS THAT THE LAWNS IN SOME OF THE HOMES THE AREA IS SO SMALL .
UHHUH .
THAT THEY TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN BEING ABLE TO USE WHATEVER LAWN THEY DO HAVE TO LOOK REALLY NICE .
YES THEY DO I NOTICED THAT THEY RE REALLY PUTTING IN SMALL BACK YARDS BECAUSE THEY HAVE THESE MOST OF THE HOUSES HAVE THE ALLEYS .
UHHUH .
THAT RUN BEHIND AND SO THAT REALLY CUTS INTO YOUR BACKYARD SPACE AND BUT WE DO NT DO OUR WORK HERE OUT OF ENJOYMENT SO MUCH AS RIGHT NOW WE RE JUST THIS IS WE JUST MOVED IN IN SEPTEMBER SO WE RE JUST STILL AT THE POINT WHERE WE RE TALKING ABOUT THE NECESSITY .
RIGHT I KNOW OH IT S AWFUL THE FIRST HOUSE OUR HOUSE IN CASTROVILLE WAS THE FIRST ONE TOO AND WE HAD NO IDEA THE EXPENSE THAT LAWNS AND GARDENING WOULD RUN INTO .
UHHUH .
AND THE TIME THAT IT TOOK ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU START MOWING AND THEN WHEN IT COMES TO FERTILIZE THEN IT WOULD COME TO RAKING AND THEN WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING SURE THAT SOMEBODY HAD PUT THE TIMER ON THE WATER AND THE ONE THING THAT I DID NOTICE IS THAT PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE UNDERGROUND IRRIGATION SYSTEMS THE SPRINKLER SYSTEMS JUST THAT WAS THE WAY TO GO .
YEAH .
IF YOU COULD DO IT PEOPLE THAT WERE BUILDING THE NEW HOMES THAT PUT THOSE IN THAT WAS THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO GO BECAUSE IT WAS JUST SO CONVENIENT THEY WOULD JUST TURN IT ON AND THE TIMER WOULD RUN AND IT WOULD WATER THEIR LAWN AND THEY DID NT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT AT ALL .
UM .
AND THAT WAS SO NICE BUT WE DID NT HAVE THAT LUXURY SO WE WERE DRAGGING TH THE SPRINKLER AROUND EVERYWHERE .
AND SO I HOPE YOU CAN FIND UH I DO NT KNOW WHAT TYPE OF GRASS GROWS IN THE REAL SHADY AREAS I REMEMBER THE GUY THAT WAS ON THE RADIO UM THEY HAD A GARDENER AND HE I DO NT KNOW I HAD THIS ONE WELL I VE STILL GOT THE BOOK IT S UM I THINK IT S JUST CALLED TEXAS GARDENING AND IT TALKS ABOUT THE DIFFERENT GRASSES TO USE FOR THE SHADY AREAS VERSUS THE REALLY SUNNY AREAS .
HM WE .
BUT THERE IS A GRASS THAT YOU CAN USE THAT IS SHADE TOLERANT BUT I DO NT REMEMBER WHAT IT IS BUT IT S GOT LIKE A BOOT ON THE FRONT OF THE BOOK .
UHHUH .
IT S JUST A REAL FANCY DECORATED BOOT IT S LIKE TEXAS GARDENING AND IT TALKS ABOUT YOU KNOW DIFFERENT PROBLEMS THAT YOUR LAWN CAN HAVE AND HOW TO RECOGNIZE IT AND IT GOES INTO THE FULL GAMUT OF GARDENING YOU KNOW EVERYTHING FROM FLOWERS TO BULBS TO PERENNIALS TO GRASS TO WEEDS TO TREES AND TO UH HOW TO PRUNE BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I DO REMEMBER WAS WHEN IT TALKED ABOUT THE GRASS .
GRASS .
AND THERE BEING THE SHADE TOLERANT TYPES OF GRASS AND I THINK ONE OF THEM WAS A BLEND OF TWO TYPES OF GRASS THAT THEY HAD USED .
UM .
BUT I DO NT REMEM I DO NT REMEMBER IF IT WAS RALEIGH AND SAINT AUGUSTINE OR OR WHAT .
